 the interview here in voice link 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000

 link of the voice of the powerful people 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:43.570
 today we find a great idol 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.570
 to leave it more 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.809
 where are you from the wind 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.809
 technical director 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.000
 7 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.000
 of the first 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.350
 what are your expectations for 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 but not continue learning 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.920
 experiences already at the training level and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.630
 it's the worst 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.350
 now soccer grows no longer being in the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 head has time was 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.369
 how do you feel like those of 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.380
 mention for example when you see a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.229
 match in between when you are playing 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.030
 in these current times you see that 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.030
 you are also in such a good position 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.010
 and to that possibility what 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.360
 I can not be on the court announces that 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.330
 and the shots of 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.550
 what can you learn as the positives 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.120
 because you feel an exterior 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.130
 when I want to direct 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.270
 all those things accumulated rest of 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.000
 put them to the players that I have and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.680
 at this time in the tournament how is 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.130
 the team is believed to be able to become 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.050
 champion this year 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.650
 to see that of saying champions where 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.650
 complicated 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.209
 Sun 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.500
 in all 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.740
 a 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 the value line 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.780
 taking advantage but in the painting 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.349
 to win 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:54.730
 in the interview we're still going to talk 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.730
 a little topas 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.690
 if the demon catches a February 14 and 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.460
 have 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.890
 it was contraindicated 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.270
 the party way party in my life 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.270
 also the most exciting 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.450
 because we have a mouth network 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.960
 to see him remember that moment in the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.960
 history 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.920
 the desire to beat the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.920
 the team of the world 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.240
 when we said that was passed me by 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.460
 street I talked with a moment 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.740
 but it's not very spontaneous 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.500
 I stay I had no other recourse and I 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.150
 a nice move came out but there was already 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.280
 I got fogged up everything I wanted 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.260
 finish the game because not only 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.810
 we are first of group but have him 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.670
 won a tremendous team in those 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.680
 moments that was worldwide 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.719
 at the time that marked his career 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.010
 today that we are champions in the 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:07.269
 2002 but there was also a moment where 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.359
 I felt that the swollen the Medellin 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.650
 me for my tests the best and because 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.969
 medellin 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.789
 having said how the team 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:23.819
 because everyone wanted to play because he gave me 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:26.479
 a very strange story was 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:30.379
 ending an Argentine selection 15 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.379
 where it turned out that 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:40.300
 and there were several 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.300
 for the moment national is in my mind 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.680
 I had to go to introduce myself 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.930
 envied because first 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.190
 as the opportunity at the amateur level 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.400
 of 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.850
 of being in their ranks and already 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.580
 there at 16 they called the one who had 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.700
 to present myself well 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.480
 but it was totally different malone 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.249
 put to envigado and put to Medellin 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.569
 it's a big team mts 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.569
 the people of the most loved 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.640
 to finish here 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.270
 well I have run into the selection by 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.710
 leg of the knockout match tomorrow 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.680
 Argentine part 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.169
 in the angel tie to remember and 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.199
 also to a nice new party the 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.199
 true 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.500
 is the opportunity I was looking for the 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.500
 I had several calls for a while 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.960
 several gold cup friendly matches 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.940
 played with the selection but the truth 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.639
 was to consolidate myself created that I wanted and 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.680
 it was against Argentina 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.430
 the parties hurt the mind the 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.280
 Durana problem did not continue in that 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.690
 selection but I already say 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.180
 I want to spend with me in the national team 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.060
 black and unsigned because a party that 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.370
 complicated to the goal of crespo has 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.310
 robert who had oscar córdoba and who 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.370
 would win this and in the goal of the draw in 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.470
 a corner shot to a nice play 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.960
 apart it's yours if it was a nice goal 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.030
 good to remember as we do not talk about 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.700
 liberators must do what the god 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.070
 for green to see with the Medellin I played 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.980

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.170
