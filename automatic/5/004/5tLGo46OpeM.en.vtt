hello<00:00:01.829> in<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.250> video<00:00:02.429> we<00:00:02.730> show<00:00:02.760> you<00:00:03.000> how<00:00:03.240> to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hello in this video we show you how to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.960 
hello in this video we show you how to
switch<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.080> network<00:00:04.529> mode<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.370> Samsung

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
switch the network mode on the Samsung

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.039 
switch the network mode on the Samsung
Galaxy<00:00:06.000> s3

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
Galaxy s3

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.580 
Galaxy s3
so<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.519> best<00:00:08.849> used<00:00:09.090> in<00:00:09.420> scenarios<00:00:10.230> where

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
so this is best used in scenarios where

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.589 
so this is best used in scenarios where
you<00:00:11.340> know<00:00:11.610> you're<00:00:11.880> not<00:00:12.000> gonna<00:00:12.150> be<00:00:12.240> able<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.450> get

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
you know you're not gonna be able to get

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.839 
you know you're not gonna be able to get
the<00:00:12.750> likes<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.530> 3G<00:00:14.070> connection<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.820> you

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
the likes of a 3G connection so you

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.460 
the likes of a 3G connection so you
don't<00:00:15.120> want<00:00:15.330> your<00:00:15.420> phone<00:00:15.660> struggling<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
don't want your phone struggling and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.320 
don't want your phone struggling and
trying<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.920> find<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.340> faster<00:00:17.609> connection

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
trying to find a faster connection

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.150 
trying to find a faster connection
you're<00:00:18.810> basically<00:00:19.199> telling<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.650> don't<00:00:19.920> try

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
you're basically telling it don't try

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.240 
you're basically telling it don't try
any<00:00:20.279> harder<00:00:20.340> stick<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.949> can

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
any harder stick with that and this can

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.009 
any harder stick with that and this can
have<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> potential<00:00:24.029> impact<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.510> your<00:00:24.630> battery

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
have a potential impact on your battery

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.890 
have a potential impact on your battery
life<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.560> save<00:00:25.859> battery<00:00:26.160> life<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> if

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
life so it can save battery life so if

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.120 
life so it can save battery life so if
you're<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> middle<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> forest<00:00:28.740> where

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you're in the middle of a forest where

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.800 
you're in the middle of a forest where
you're<00:00:29.250> unlikely<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:29.939> three<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.390> four<00:00:30.420> G

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you're unlikely to get three or four G

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.720 
you're unlikely to get three or four G
connection<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.890> tell<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> you're<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.340> 2g

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
connection just tell it you're on 2g

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.340 
connection just tell it you're on 2g
it's<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> save<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.660> battery<00:00:33.960> life<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's going to save your battery life and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.630 
it's going to save your battery life and
it's<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:34.890> struggling<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> try

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it's not going to be struggling to try

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's not going to be struggling to try
and<00:00:35.760> find<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.180> faster<00:00:36.660> connection<00:00:37.200> however

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and find that faster connection however

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430 
and find that faster connection however
when<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.910> set<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.360> mode<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.840> set<00:00:40.110> until

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
when you set this mode it is set until

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.229 
when you set this mode it is set until
you<00:00:40.559> change<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.100> until<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> next<00:00:41.670> time<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.180> if

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you change it until the next time so if

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.610 
you change it until the next time so if
you<00:00:42.329> came<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.899> forest<00:00:43.320> where<00:00:43.530> you're

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
you came out of that forest where you're

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.410 
you came out of that forest where you're
not<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.070> much<00:00:44.309> connection<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
not going to have much connection to a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.270 
not going to have much connection to a
city<00:00:45.750> center<00:00:46.289> you're<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> get

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
city center you're not going to get

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.069 
city center you're not going to get
those<00:00:47.430> faster<00:00:47.940> speeds<00:00:48.239> unless<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.719> tell<00:00:48.930> your

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
those faster speeds unless you tell your

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
those faster speeds unless you tell your
device<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.559> essentially<00:00:50.129> accept<00:00:50.550> those

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
device to essentially accept those

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
device to essentially accept those
speeds<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.860> need<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> go<00:00:53.219> into

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
speeds so to do that you need to go into

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.500 
speeds so to do that you need to go into
the<00:00:53.489> settings<00:00:53.730> via<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.449> apps<00:00:54.840> tray<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
the settings via the apps tray or the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
the settings via the apps tray or the
notification<00:00:57.510> bar<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.989> under<00:00:58.559> connections

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
notification bar and under connections

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.189 
notification bar and under connections
within<00:00:59.430> settings<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.329> need<00:01:00.449> more<00:01:00.690> networks

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
within settings you need more networks

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.740 
within settings you need more networks
and<00:01:01.620> you've<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.370> mobile<00:01:02.820> networks<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.539> tap

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and you've got mobile networks you tap

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.370 
and you've got mobile networks you tap
on<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> you've<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.489> network<00:01:05.760> mode<00:01:06.380> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
on that and you've got network mode you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.380 
on that and you've got network mode you
tap<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.280> several<00:01:08.939> options

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
tap on that and you get several options

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
tap on that and you get several options
at<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> moment<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.830> device<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> always<00:01:11.460> going

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
at the moment the device is always going

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.969 
at the moment the device is always going
to<00:01:11.640> try<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.909> connect<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> an<00:01:12.510> LTE<00:01:12.900> W<00:01:13.439> CDMA<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
to try and connect to an LTE W CDMA and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
to try and connect to an LTE W CDMA and
GSM<00:01:14.159> connection<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.180> always<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
GSM connection so it's always going to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.590 
GSM connection so it's always going to
try<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> best<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.590> could<00:01:17.189> switch<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
try and get the best I could switch to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.149 
try and get the best I could switch to
WCDMA<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.960> not<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> look<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.680> 4G

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
WCDMA so it's not going to look for a 4G

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.170 
WCDMA so it's not going to look for a 4G
connection<00:01:20.330> or<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.390> could<00:01:21.750> switch<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:23.180> WCDMA

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
connection or I could switch to WCDMA

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.450 
connection or I could switch to WCDMA
only<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:24.960> only<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> accept<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.920> 3G

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
only so it's only going to accept a 3G

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
only so it's only going to accept a 3G
connection<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.750> these<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.619> an

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
connection and these can all have an

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
connection and these can all have an
influence<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.400> battery<00:01:30.000> life<00:01:30.210> based<00:01:31.079> on

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
influence on the battery life based on

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.560 
influence on the battery life based on
your<00:01:31.380> call<00:01:31.590> time<00:01:31.860> standby<00:01:32.369> times<00:01:32.610> or<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.450> can

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
your call time standby times or you can

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.050 
your call time standby times or you can
go<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.900> down<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.530> GSM<00:01:35.100> only<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.909> this

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
go just down to just GSM only so this

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.649 
go just down to just GSM only so this
will<00:01:36.299> affect<00:01:36.689> different<00:01:37.790> things<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.119> here

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
will affect different things so here

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.359 
will affect different things so here
it's<00:01:39.810> saying<00:01:39.990> unable<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.470> change<00:01:40.770> networks

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it's saying unable to change networks

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.300 
it's saying unable to change networks
while<00:01:41.670> data<00:01:41.939> services<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.720> use<00:01:42.930> so

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
while data services in use so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.410 
while data services in use so
something's<00:01:44.310> using<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> network<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
something's using the network in the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
something's using the network in the
background<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.049> need<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> click<00:01:47.009> OK<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
background so I need to click OK and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969 
background so I need to click OK and
make<00:01:47.670> those<00:01:47.850> changes<00:01:48.890> actually<00:01:49.890> it's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
make those changes actually it's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.730 
make those changes actually it's
switched<00:01:50.250> off<00:01:50.460> data<00:01:50.759> there<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.590> see

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
switched off data there but you can see

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
switched off data there but you can see
it's<00:01:52.860> switched<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> GSM<00:01:53.640> mode<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:54.689> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
it's switched to GSM mode and then you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.389 
it's switched to GSM mode and then you
can<00:01:55.020> tap<00:01:55.229> back<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> switch<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
can tap back in and switch it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
can tap back in and switch it
appropriately<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:58.710> one

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
appropriately as you like but that's one

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.980 
appropriately as you like but that's one

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
of the ways you control the network mode

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
of the ways you control the network mode
