00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
three and a quarter inches and I'll
explain<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.150> top<00:01:09.360> mount<00:01:09.570> depth<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> just

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
explain what top mount depth is in just

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
explain what top mount depth is in just
one<00:01:10.500> second<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:12.650> you'll<00:01:13.650> notice<00:01:13.909> this<00:01:14.909> is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
one second now you'll notice this is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.719 
one second now you'll notice this is
much<00:01:15.930> thinner<00:01:16.259> than<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:16.979> may<00:01:17.520> want

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
much thinner than this so you may want

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.090 
much thinner than this so you may want
to<00:01:17.759> consider<00:01:18.200> purchasing<00:01:19.200> our<00:01:19.350> bolt<00:01:19.619> kit<00:01:19.890> or

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
just one of our entire kits because

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
just one of our entire kits because
obviously<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.000> stock<00:01:24.240> bolts<00:01:24.689> won't<00:01:24.930> work

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
obviously the stock bolts won't work

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
obviously the stock bolts won't work
with<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> newer<00:01:25.680> thicker<00:01:26.009> adapter<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.939> let<00:01:27.270> me

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
guys whoops okay now what I meant by top

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.469 
guys whoops okay now what I meant by top
mount<00:01:45.060> depth<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:46.159> right<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
mount depth is right here this is the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.490 
mount depth is right here this is the
glass<00:01:49.310> or<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:50.549> window<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.229> window

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
glass or your window so as your window

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.440 
glass or your window so as your window
rolls<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> down<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.610> needs<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> avoid<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
rolls up and down it needs to avoid the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.219 
rolls up and down it needs to avoid the
magnet<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.950> point<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
magnet so from this point to there is a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.749 
magnet so from this point to there is a
little<00:01:58.740> over<00:01:59.009> three<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.399> quarter<00:01:59.610> inches

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
little over three and a quarter inches

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.480 
little over three and a quarter inches
so<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.299> recommend<00:02:01.079> using<00:02:01.350> speakers<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.219> are

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
so we recommend using speakers that are

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.609 
so we recommend using speakers that are
three<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> quarter<00:02:03.780> inch<00:02:03.960> top<00:02:04.290> mounting

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
three and a quarter inch top mounting

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.499 
three and a quarter inch top mounting
depth<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:04.979> less<00:02:05.159> most<00:02:05.460> speaker<00:02:05.850> manufacturers

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
depth or less most speaker manufacturers

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.969 
depth or less most speaker manufacturers
will<00:02:06.689> provide<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.110> information<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.829> their

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
will provide that information in their

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.839 
will provide that information in their
packaging<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.920> again<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> six<00:02:11.670> by

they'll vary within hundredths of an
inch<00:04:19.350> of<00:04:19.530> each<00:04:19.650> other<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:20.720> generally<00:04:21.720> what<00:04:21.840> we

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
inch of each other so generally what we

inch of each other so generally what we
do<00:04:22.140> here<00:04:23.060> we've<00:04:24.060> got<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.690> set<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.669> tweeter

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
do here we've got a set of tweeter

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.440 
do here we've got a set of tweeter
adapters<00:04:27.240> that

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
adapters that

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.050 
adapters that

dynamics<00:04:36.380> what<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.530> do<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.830> simply<00:04:37.980> slip

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
dynamics what you do is you simply slip

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.190 
dynamics what you do is you simply slip
them<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.670> there<00:04:38.850> we<00:04:39.030> reattach<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.690> bolts<00:04:40.050> and

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
them in there we reattach the bolts and

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.340 
them in there we reattach the bolts and
then<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.430> now<00:04:41.610> have<00:04:42.020> aftermarket<00:04:43.020> tweeters

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
then we now have aftermarket tweeters

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.120 
then we now have aftermarket tweeters
and<00:04:44.510> because<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.810> speaker<00:04:46.260> size<00:04:46.470> vary<00:04:46.860> so

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
and because the speaker size vary so

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.670 
and because the speaker size vary so
much<00:04:47.190> we<00:04:48.150> generally<00:04:48.690> cut<00:04:48.960> these<00:04:49.110> out<00:04:49.260> just<00:04:49.560> a

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
much we generally cut these out just a

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.370 
much we generally cut these out just a
hair<00:04:49.710> larger<00:04:50.430> than<00:04:51.150> what<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.450> specs<00:04:51.750> call<00:04:52.080> for

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
hair larger than what the specs call for

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.140 
hair larger than what the specs call for
again<00:04:52.650> they're<00:04:52.860> within<00:04:53.040> hundreds<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.820> an<00:04:53.970> inch

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
again they're within hundreds of an inch

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.040 
again they're within hundreds of an inch
so<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.230> this<00:04:55.380> case<00:04:56.270> we<00:04:57.270> took<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.540> little<00:04:57.750> bit<00:04:57.960> of

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
so in this case we took a little bit of

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.920 
so in this case we took a little bit of
tape<00:04:58.260> applied<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.520> inside<00:04:59.850> push<00:05:00.720> the

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
tape applied it to the inside push the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.750 
tape applied it to the inside push the
tweeter<00:05:01.230> in<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.740> then<00:05:01.920> now<00:05:02.100> we've<00:05:02.280> got<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.520> nice

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
tweeter in and then now we've got a nice

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.390 
tweeter in and then now we've got a nice
tight<00:05:03.660> fit<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.350> we<00:05:04.830> don't<00:05:05.010> have<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.250> worry

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
tight fit and we don't have to worry

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.610 
tight fit and we don't have to worry
about<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.700> tweeter<00:05:06.000> going<00:05:06.330> anywhere

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
about that tweeter going anywhere

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.500 
about that tweeter going anywhere
some<00:05:08.010> folks<00:05:08.280> like<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.730> take<00:05:08.910> screws<00:05:09.330> and

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
some folks like to take screws and

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.330 
some folks like to take screws and
attach<00:05:09.600> them<00:05:10.020> we<00:05:10.560> found<00:05:10.770> that<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.100> works

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
attach them we found that this works

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.320 
attach them we found that this works
really<00:05:11.670> well<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:13.080> again<00:05:13.670> just<00:05:14.670> slip<00:05:14.940> this<00:05:15.120> in

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
really well and again just slip this in
