00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
so number three is a love triangle where

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.550 
so number three is a love triangle where
the<00:02:17.580> person<00:02:18.090> didn't<00:02:18.660> end<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:19.020> with<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.350> person

you wanted them to so I think the canvas
and<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> Hunger<00:02:22.560> Games<00:02:22.590> should<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.100> have

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and the Hunger Games should not have

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.309 
and the Hunger Games should not have
ended<00:02:23.460> up<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:23.640> anybody<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.600> know<00:02:24.930> everyone

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.030 
loves Peeta and I do like him as a
character<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.810> think<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.590> Katniss

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
character I just think that with Katniss

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.610 
character I just think that with Katniss
is<00:02:29.190> character<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.420> know<00:02:30.510> all<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> PTSD

that<00:02:31.650> she<00:02:32.010> probably<00:02:32.220> has<00:02:32.459> after<00:02:32.850> all<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
that she probably has after all the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.140 
that she probably has after all the
events<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.810> happened<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:35.220> loss<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.700> you

don't think

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.730 
don't think
properly<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.420> then<00:03:06.660> number<00:03:06.900> four<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.530> a

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
properly so then number four is a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.910 
properly so then number four is a
popular<00:03:08.160> genre<00:03:08.240> that<00:03:09.240> you<00:03:09.600> hardly<00:03:10.080> reach<00:03:10.590> for

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.600 
me quite yet
but<00:03:45.870> right<00:03:46.050> now<00:03:46.230> as<00:03:46.560> it's<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.920> first<00:03:46.950> book<00:03:47.370> I'm

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
but right now as it's the first book I'm

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.540 
but right now as it's the first book I'm
not<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> fan<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.390> think<00:03:48.540> he's<00:03:49.280> trying<00:03:50.280> too<00:03:50.519> hard

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
not a fan I think he's trying too hard

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.880 
not a fan I think he's trying too hard
and<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.180> think<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.720> he<00:03:52.170> doesn't<00:03:52.319> really<00:03:52.560> have

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
and I think that he doesn't really have

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.820 
and I think that he doesn't really have
any<00:03:53.160> personality<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.300> would<00:03:54.569> like<00:03:54.810> um<00:03:55.560> I

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
any personality that I would like um I

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.500 
any personality that I would like um I
could<00:03:56.069> change<00:03:56.310> my<00:03:56.400> opinion<00:03:56.850> definitely<00:03:57.030> in

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
could change my opinion definitely in

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.420 
could change my opinion definitely in
the<00:03:57.630> later<00:03:57.810> books<00:03:58.110> era<00:03:58.500> fires<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.890> big<00:03:59.069> book<00:03:59.250> and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
the later books era fires a big book and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.580 
the later books era fires a big book and
I<00:03:59.550> hear<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.970> he's<00:04:00.150> fantastic<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.019> so<00:04:01.319> I

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.900 
don't hate me so the next one is about
the<00:06:54.800> saying<00:06:55.010> the<00:06:55.280> book<00:06:55.460> is<00:06:55.610> always<00:06:55.790> better

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
the saying the book is always better

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.450 
the saying the book is always better
than<00:06:56.420> the<00:06:56.480> movie<00:06:56.570> and<00:06:57.080> this<00:06:57.590> one<00:06:57.800> is<00:06:58.010> actually

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
than the movie and this one is actually

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.490 
than the movie and this one is actually
the<00:06:58.700> complete<00:06:59.060> opposite<00:06:59.630> and<00:06:59.990> it<00:07:00.170> is<00:07:00.260> asking

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
the complete opposite and it is asking

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.370 
the complete opposite and it is asking
which<00:07:01.280> movie<00:07:01.910> was<00:07:02.150> better<00:07:02.600> than<00:07:02.750> the<00:07:02.960> book<00:07:03.110> and

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
which movie was better than the book and

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.890 
which movie was better than the book and
for<00:07:03.710> this<00:07:03.800> one<00:07:04.070> I<00:07:04.340> think<00:07:05.300> I<00:07:05.510> could<00:07:05.690> go<00:07:05.780> with

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
for this one I think I could go with

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.390 
for this one I think I could go with
Fifty<00:07:06.170> Shades<00:07:06.200> of<00:07:06.440> Grey<00:07:06.500> but<00:07:06.860> I<00:07:06.980> think<00:07:07.250> it's

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
Fifty Shades of Grey but I think it's

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.980 
Fifty Shades of Grey but I think it's
because<00:07:07.550> I<00:07:07.880> was<00:07:07.910> just<00:07:08.180> expecting<00:07:08.480> the<00:07:08.720> movie

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
because I was just expecting the movie

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.560 
because I was just expecting the movie
to<00:07:09.080> be<00:07:09.200> so<00:07:09.380> frickin<00:07:09.920> terrible<00:07:10.400> that<00:07:10.670> it<00:07:11.240> kind

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
to be so frickin terrible that it kind

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.690 
to be so frickin terrible that it kind
of<00:07:11.660> actually<00:07:11.930> exceeded<00:07:12.560> expectations<00:07:13.310> and<00:07:13.670> I

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
of actually exceeded expectations and I

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.100 
of actually exceeded expectations and I
don't<00:07:13.910> think<00:07:14.150> anything<00:07:14.480> could<00:07:14.600> be<00:07:14.750> even<00:07:15.080> worse

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
don't think anything could be even worse

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.260 
don't think anything could be even worse
than<00:07:15.500> the<00:07:15.590> books<00:07:15.800> I'm<00:07:16.400> just<00:07:16.760> gonna<00:07:16.850> go<00:07:17.090> with

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
than the books I'm just gonna go with

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.080 
than the books I'm just gonna go with
The<00:07:17.480> Maze<00:07:17.780> Runner<00:07:17.810> by<00:07:18.320> James<00:07:18.350> Dashner<00:07:18.830> I<00:07:19.400> did

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
The Maze Runner by James Dashner I did

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.970 
The Maze Runner by James Dashner I did
like<00:07:20.300> this<00:07:20.450> book<00:07:20.720> it<00:07:20.930> wasn't<00:07:21.260> too<00:07:21.470> horrible

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
like this book it wasn't too horrible

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.970 
like this book it wasn't too horrible
and<00:07:22.250> it<00:07:22.550> was

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:22.980 
and it was

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.640

interesting<00:07:23.460> I<00:07:23.610> liked<00:07:23.850> it<00:07:24.090> but<00:07:24.990> I<00:07:25.320> think<00:07:25.380> that

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
interesting I liked it but I think that

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.040 
interesting I liked it but I think that
the<00:07:25.830> movie<00:07:26.190> was<00:07:26.340> a<00:07:26.550> lot<00:07:26.910> better<00:07:27.180> it<00:07:27.540> was<00:07:27.750> such<00:07:28.020> a

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
the movie was a lot better it was such a

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.410 
the movie was a lot better it was such a
good<00:07:28.320> movie<00:07:28.500> and<00:07:28.680> I'd<00:07:29.280> love<00:07:29.490> to<00:07:29.580> be<00:07:29.730> actors<00:07:30.150> in
