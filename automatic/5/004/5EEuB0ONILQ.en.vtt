00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.730 
um just an update I think it has been 2
hours<00:01:44.479> since<00:01:45.320> I<00:01:46.100> applied<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:47.170> roughly<00:01:48.170> 2<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.380> 3

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
hours since I applied it roughly 2 to 3

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.719 
hours since I applied it roughly 2 to 3
hours<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:50.149> looks<00:01:50.420> like<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:52.130> far<00:01:52.429> so

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
hours and it looks like this so far so

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:53.350

good

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
good

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.480 
good
and<00:01:53.450> I've<00:01:53.869> already<00:01:54.229> tried<00:01:54.679> this<00:01:54.920> foundation

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
and I've already tried this foundation

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.850 
and I've already tried this foundation
anyway<00:01:55.880> when<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.630> was<00:01:56.720> out<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.229> everything<00:01:57.679> and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
anyway when I was out and everything and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.460 
anyway when I was out and everything and
it<00:01:58.039> did<00:01:58.220> really<00:01:58.460> well<00:01:58.820> in<00:01:59.270> terms<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.990> staying

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
it did really well in terms of staying

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.870 
it did really well in terms of staying
power<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.250> keeping<00:02:01.939> my<00:02:02.090> skin<00:02:02.950> oil-free<00:02:03.950> and

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
power and keeping my skin oil-free and

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.880 
power and keeping my skin oil-free and
it<00:02:05.210> also<00:02:05.360> helps<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:05.990> use<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.470> Rimmel<00:02:06.710> stay

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
it also helps that I use the Rimmel stay

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.880 
it also helps that I use the Rimmel stay
matte<00:02:07.009> powder<00:02:07.250> over<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.060> on<00:02:08.989> its<00:02:09.170> own<00:02:09.350> there's

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
matte powder over it on its own there's

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.800

the<00:03:23.940> price<00:03:24.210> I<00:03:24.450> guess<00:03:24.720> especially<00:03:25.560> if<00:03:25.650> you're

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
the price I guess especially if you're

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.050 
the price I guess especially if you're
only<00:03:25.950> going<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> wear<00:03:26.490> it<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.670> special

only going to wear it for special

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.920 
only going to wear it for special
occasions<00:03:27.890> um<00:03:28.890> what<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.250> can't<00:03:29.670> say<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.630> it

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
occasions um what I can't say is that it

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.350 
occasions um what I can't say is that it
can<00:03:31.470> if<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.160> dry<00:03:32.430> spots<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.970> your<00:03:33.000> face

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.520 
can if you have dry spots in your face
it<00:03:33.630> will<00:03:33.870> cling<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.710> um<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.960> have<00:03:37.230> to

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
it will cling to it um so you have to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.250 
it will cling to it um so you have to
really<00:03:37.710> moisturize<00:03:38.040> your<00:03:38.640> face<00:03:38.960> if<00:03:39.960> you<00:03:40.020> have
