00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
having hair problems and I think it's a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.420 
having hair problems and I think it's a
wise<00:02:51.990> investment<00:02:52.020> versus<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.400> a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
wise investment versus going to a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:02.000 
wise investment versus going to a
dermatologist<00:02:54.920> no<00:02:55.920> question<00:03:00.830> yeah<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:01.950> we

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
dermatologist no question yeah but we

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.100 
dermatologist no question yeah but we
have<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.310> very<00:03:02.459> fairly<00:03:02.970> priced<00:03:03.150> for<00:03:03.989> an

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
have to be very fairly priced for an

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.160 
have to be very fairly priced for an
all-natural<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.330> quantities<00:03:06.870> this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
all-natural in and the quantities this

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.990 
all-natural in and the quantities this
goes<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> long<00:03:07.680> way<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> little<00:03:08.280> bit<00:03:08.459> will<00:03:08.730> do<00:03:08.880> you

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
goes a long way a little bit will do you

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.270 
goes a long way a little bit will do you
it's<00:03:09.150> highly<00:03:09.510> concentrated<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.980> for

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
it's highly concentrated and this for

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.030 
it's highly concentrated and this for
instance<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.730> six<00:03:12.030> ounces<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.959> think<00:03:13.920> that

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
instance is six ounces and I think that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.940 
instance is six ounces and I think that
they're<00:03:14.220> extremely<00:03:15.090> affordable<00:03:15.600> for<00:03:16.080> for

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
they're extremely affordable for for

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.440 
they're extremely affordable for for
what<00:03:17.100> you're<00:03:17.250> getting<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.760> for<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.000> quantity

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
what you're getting and for the quantity

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.600 
what you're getting and for the quantity
and<00:03:18.780> for<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.140> fact<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.739> little<00:03:20.220> bit<00:03:20.370> does

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
and for the fact that a little bit does

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.360 
and for the fact that a little bit does
go<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.850> long<00:03:21.120> way<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:22.260> again<00:03:22.590> we're<00:03:22.800> super

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
go a long way and again we're super

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.970 
go a long way and again we're super
concentrated<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.750> very<00:03:25.380> concentrated

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
we have our trial and travel to answer

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.400 
we have our trial and travel to answer
that's<00:03:31.830> very<00:03:32.280> handy<00:03:32.610> yeah<00:03:33.450> throwing<00:03:34.019> in<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.200> bag
