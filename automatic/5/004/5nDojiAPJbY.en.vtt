00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
next for the drains this is pretty much

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.030 
next for the drains this is pretty much
the<00:02:55.610> simplest<00:02:56.300> part<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.320> as<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.560> can<00:02:57.680> see<00:02:57.950> in

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the simplest part so as you can see in

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.400 
the simplest part so as you can see in
the<00:02:58.130> drain<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.550> right<00:02:59.440> here<00:03:01.030> okay<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:02.170> we<00:03:03.170> took

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
the drain is right here okay so we took

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.430 
the drain is right here okay so we took
a<00:03:03.800> hot<00:03:04.310> glue<00:03:04.550> Garnett's<00:03:05.030> we're<00:03:05.480> pretty<00:03:06.320> much

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
a hot glue Garnett's we're pretty much

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.070 
a hot glue Garnett's we're pretty much
parted<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.110> we<00:03:09.670> um<00:03:10.670> glued<00:03:11.660> them<00:03:11.870> together

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
parted and we um glued them together

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.870 
parted and we um glued them together
right<00:03:12.590> here<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.070> then<00:03:13.160> we<00:03:13.310> took<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.519> black

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
right here and then we took a black

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.180 
right here and then we took a black
marker<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:14.810> went<00:03:15.110> across<00:03:15.500> or<00:03:16.040> like

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190

little<00:03:16.459> dots<00:03:16.700> or<00:03:17.000> whatever<00:03:17.269> or<00:03:18.170> what<00:03:18.739> type<00:03:19.010> of

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
little dots or whatever or what type of

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.220 
little dots or whatever or what type of
design<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.150> want<00:03:20.269> on<00:03:20.450> your<00:03:20.510> showered<00:03:21.050> right

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.130 
and so that's what the shower trim looks
like<00:03:23.930> oh<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.410> what<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:28.600> shower<00:03:29.600> head

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
popsicle sticks so that they form a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.699 
popsicle sticks so that they form a
little<00:03:37.610> trifle<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.480> we<00:03:38.810> go<00:03:39.200> them<00:03:39.380> together

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
little trifle and we go them together

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.430
