00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
kelp from the base up so that the kelp

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.900 
kelp from the base up so that the kelp
becomes<00:05:32.229> a<00:05:32.560> seaweed<00:05:32.979> which<00:05:33.220> floats<00:05:33.520> off<00:05:33.729> to

its destruction they don't actually eat
the<00:05:35.890> entire<00:05:35.979> kelp<00:05:36.610> they<00:05:37.120> basically<00:05:37.419> kill<00:05:37.720> the

the entire kelp they basically kill the

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.690 
the entire kelp they basically kill the
whole<00:05:38.050> tree<00:05:38.380> just<00:05:38.680> by<00:05:38.830> killing<00:05:39.250> its

whole tree just by killing its

whole tree just by killing its

connection to the rock that anchors in

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.860 
connection to the rock that anchors in
place<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:42.580> large<00:05:42.880> number<00:05:43.240> of<00:05:43.270> sea<00:05:43.540> urchins
