jump out of the boat and hopefully

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.219

scouted<00:00:43.979> from<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> shore<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.970> know

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
scouted from the shore so you know

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.210 
scouted from the shore so you know
what's<00:00:45.449> downstream<00:00:46.049> you<00:00:46.769> should<00:00:46.979> have<00:00:47.100> an

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
what's downstream you should have an

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.710 
what's downstream you should have an
idea<00:00:47.309> which<00:00:47.729> side<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> river<00:00:48.299> you're<00:00:48.570> on

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
idea which side of the river you're on

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.810 
idea which side of the river you're on
and<00:00:48.960> where<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.199> closest<00:00:49.620> Eddie's<00:00:49.949> are<00:00:50.159> if<00:00:50.400> not

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and where the closest Eddie's are if not

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
and where the closest Eddie's are if not
you<00:00:51.420> probably<00:00:51.839> didn't<00:00:52.199> take<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> time<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
you probably didn't take the time to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
you probably didn't take the time to
look<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.159> the<00:00:53.250> rapid<00:00:53.580> in<00:00:53.670> advance<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.750> we're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
look at the rapid in advance so we're

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.299 
look at the rapid in advance so we're
going<00:00:55.049> to<00:00:55.140> assume<00:00:55.409> that<00:00:55.470> you<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.799> least<00:00:55.830> know

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
going to assume that you at least know

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.119 
going to assume that you at least know
which<00:00:56.580> side<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> river<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.949> once

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
which side of the river to go to so once

closest Eddy that they should be going
for<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:58.200> audio<00:02:58.680> gives<00:02:59.400> them<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.670> clue<00:03:00.090> of

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
for that that audio gives them a clue of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.390 
for that that audio gives them a clue of
where<00:03:00.450> they<00:03:00.690> are<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.080> they<00:03:01.140> see<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.710> and<00:03:02.040> then

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
pointing them to shore gives them an

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.810 
pointing them to shore gives them an
immediate<00:03:04.590> purpose<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.310> what<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:05.550> should<00:03:05.730> be

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
immediate purpose of what they should be

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.030 
immediate purpose of what they should be
doing<00:03:05.850> that's<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.960> fastest<00:03:07.470> way<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.680> get

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
doing that's the fastest way to get

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.160
