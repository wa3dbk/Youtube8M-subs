00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.330
 hello in this tutorial video I 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.010
 will let you see how we manufacture 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.010
 his house phosphorescent varnish 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.730
 so I took a bottle of varnish quickly 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.750
 that I filled and some top coat 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.579
 I prepared my phosphorescent powder 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.770
 I also made a small funnel 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.070
 paper that I secured with a piece of 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.070
 Scotch 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.690
 so you make the hole from below to 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.130
 the mouth of the size of the varnish you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.470
 wipe your brush well so that 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.760
 it tastes you place the funnel and you 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.390
 spill the powder you do 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 watch the powder and is really very 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.580
 very fluid so why do this big 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.949
 air flow 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.930
 pour the totality and then you 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.930
 close the bottle properly 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 you really shake very hard good I 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.250
 put in accelerated because I have 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.040
 shaken for five minutes so that the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.290
 hue really be the enemy nor form 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.100
 we must not need any more 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.210
 rest of powder in suspension must 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.190
 all this is really very very 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.409
 Fluid when you test on the paper 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.369
 like these fake packages of helped very 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.369
 clean staining teeth 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.869
 now your polish is ready there 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.869
 more than to test it 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.940
 so I put a white base in 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.560
 below at no if it's true but 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.780
 it was really necessary but I 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.960
 do it anyway so I shake very very 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.810
 well because the phosphorescent powder 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.800
 will stagnate in the bottom of the flask and if 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.420
 you are reminded that the brush 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.820
 necessarily the cd will not ask on your 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.890
 nail so the varnish will have done no 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.890
 effect so I put my first layer 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.390
 I wait for it to dry and I put my 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:30.950
 second layer second layer 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.950
 the opacity is almost perfect 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.640
 so now it's done so 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.650
 for in the dark I could only take 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.150
 photos because my camera is not enough 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.440
 powerful to capture the brightness 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.320
 so I could only take pictures so 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.160
 that's before and now we're at the 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.160
 light and that's it 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.130
 It's finish 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.439
 so if you liked this video, do not hesitate 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.799
 not to share it and click on 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.060
