00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 however now there is a problem that is me 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.910
 I have to go from here to believe it 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.230
 but I slept I did everything does not put 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.070
 I'm playing with the keyboard so I'll do it 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.379
 accidents one hundred percent safe 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.650
 among other things you can notice that there or not 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.450
 373 euros because I bought the truck 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.799
 I asked and near the bank the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.840
 problem is that I asked for the pescara 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.100
 bank but now I've done so many 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.220
 so many many many many accidents 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.900
 many have broken many rules because 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.110
 I can't drive and it happened below 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.390
 patatrac so anyway I do 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.590
 see where we are headed had stopped 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.960
 the truck so in the middle of the road 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.830
 because I stop in the middle of a road 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.990
 we are headed to Hanover then 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.119
 ask Hanover at least I think or a 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.590
 zurich I don't know we started from 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.049
 blues that I had to go by the new or 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.659
 maybe the opposite if it is the other way around me 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.690
 I shoot myself no we are not going well i 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.909

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.280
 the keyboard I do n't know how used to 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.970
 let's put it this way and not break down 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.110

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.359
 in the end he says with how you can see 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.030
 we are without fear 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:09.190
 having no trailer we have to go 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.680
 to take for his own sake carry it forward 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.800
 in the meantime I'm crazy not no 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.700
 just enough is enough 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 perfect if I ca n't drive 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.810
 anyway I said I saw that it will be fine 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.420
 our trailer 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.890
 we are now heading to 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.470
 hanover we read and then return to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.480
 zurich I believe or not I know boys and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.209
 damn with the keyboard I can't 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.079
 drive turns turns turn turns perfect 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.870
 perfect 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:41.230
 ok ok we 're here we are there we are the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.630
 nice there but or fucking raptor of nocera 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.590
 point there is it turns it turns jia jia jia jia jia 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.500
 jia perfect for firm mistakes or more 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.930
 lights turned on late morning yes 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.090
 we turn off the lights we turn off the lights at 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.349
 perfect perfect lights off in place 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.319
 we are on the right track 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.910
 we are on the right track in the meantime 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.090
 I wanted to say that with this 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.100
 with this game since the graphics 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.770
 in fact it is quite high 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.590
 huge videos something really 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.660
 really huge so to load it 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.850
 rendering and so on I take years 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.430
 however millennia anyway 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.540
 Sunday and we are in a truck lorry 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.920
 perfect truck we turn can turn me 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.390
 I don't put cold chips anywhere 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.760
 guys or better when I'm with the joystick 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.520
 with the steering wheel I put the arrows when 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.680
 I'm like that from the piano action when I know 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.540
 so refresh in a food item 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.270
 in fact now they are to tell against 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.370
 a guard rail but these are little things 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.180
 and honestly we don't care 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.790
 nothing 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.320
 however the gas is almost there 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.170
 to die to sleep 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.850
 we have less than 300 euros so what 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.620
 in the mirror all those things yes 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.930
 they see swallows at the top that piffer as one 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.230
 who knows that this is how a message came out 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.060
 I'm wrong, however, I receive this video 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.560
 he didn't owe much because the happens 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.740
 casino otherwise I can't 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.470
 load up and so on i think 18 minutes today 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.230
 I do not know maybe 8, and it is better fine 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.510
 fine fine fine stock to fine said true 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.980
 I ask wrong to a precedence there and me 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.419
 I braked by eye we had the 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.800
 previously we don't have precedence here 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.680
 I don't know 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.680
 let's brake but move a second keyboard 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.009
 because it 's killing me a finger 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.749
 perfect 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.409
 like normal people put the 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:42.960
 perfect arrow Liano stop so I can 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.759
 turn or not stop 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.219
 I don't know who the fuck I stop it I don't know 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.899

 reggio calabria nobu giro we are not 1 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.520

 we are not in Italy 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.659
 so we can go straight we try 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.129
 to stay straight we try not to do 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.589
 accidents we try not to do for years 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:13.289

 this game I can not do anything else 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.189
 however at the next parking there
