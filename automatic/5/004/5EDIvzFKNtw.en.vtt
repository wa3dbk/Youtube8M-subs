00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.150
 let's make this an iced tea and for 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.740
 We're going to use lemon tea bags 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.710
 sugar and mental 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.930
 the first step then is going to be doing 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.140
 an infusion in hot water with the 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.840
 tea rooms so let's put a 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.540
 appointment 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.630
 with approximately 250 centimeters 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.030
 cubic of water what I recommend is 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.380
 that this water is already hot from the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.300
 quill as to make it faster in 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.440
 the listening part 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.440
 so let's go to the game 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.520
 how much is here we have the 250 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.980
 cubic centimeters of water that is 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.649
 about a cup of tea that is 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.210
 before a boiling point 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.280
 minutes before it starts to boil 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.290
 we take out and we're going to add four 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.239
 tea bags that is what is going to 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.320
 give the proportional of the total jar or 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.060
 be for the tea bag is a cup 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.340
 the idea of ​​this is to make an infusion in 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.700
 hot concentrated so neither 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.840
 water from the tea bags I go to 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.700
 leave here for 3 to 4 minutes to be 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.860
 tinea well water taste and color 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.650
 on the other hand while we expect that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.380
 these infusions we are going to grab a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.310
 lemon 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.680
 let's see one end and let's cut 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.350
 some finite slices to put inside 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.790
 of the jug 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.810
 this what he is going to do is also 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.810
 add a little flavor 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.390
 lemon forgiveness with a unit 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.009
 this is fine to make the jar 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.229
 final that as I told you is for four 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.030
 people in this case I chose lemons 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.880
 but we can have the option of 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.280
 incorporate files that in this case would be 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.840
 two units because they are smaller 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.569
 we can also tell ginger that 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.009
 it is also very rich , it gives us slices 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.009
 for the jug 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.320
 and we are going to put 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.500
 around here to then pour the text 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.250
 we will also incorporate 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250
 mint 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.640
 sits on a twig afterwards with a 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.590
 spoon and when we have the tea 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.180
 incorporated we can crush it a bit 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.420
 more take it out so it takes so that 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.959
 release more the aromas the flavor 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.959
 yes 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.370
 for each tea bag 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.740
 and as we did today we did 4 we are going to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.460
 add a spoonful of sugar 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.040
 if you wish, it can also be blond sugar 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.569
 or if they want it a little more light they can 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.999
 use 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.750
 sweetener sachets here we have 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:03.780
 then the tea concentrate 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.200
 come color change is well dark 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.500
 more normal people than you consume all 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.500
 the days 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.319
 let's check them out here 2 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.319
 and we pour into the jar 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.560
 we mix for that, see a little 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.410
 sugar to also mix a little the 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.959
 mint and lemon long a bit of its flavor 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.720
 and the only thing we need is to add the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.940
 water either freezing cold water 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.750
 that you have previously in the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:47.620
 refrigerator or water and ice 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.530
 until completing the jugs as 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.750
 we mix again 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.920
 in this case the cold guard area 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.170
 so it 's direct to consume good 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.660
 here then they have ice cream summer 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.550
 finished remember and subscribe to
