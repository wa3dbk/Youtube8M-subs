00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
vamonos in I'm going to teach you how to

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.420 
vamonos in I'm going to teach you how to
snowboard<00:00:12.790> I<00:00:13.300> think<00:00:14.200> if<00:00:14.710> you<00:00:14.890> follow<00:00:15.100> the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
snowboard I think if you follow the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.800 
snowboard I think if you follow the
techniques<00:00:15.820> that<00:00:15.910> I'm<00:00:16.090> about<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.390> show<00:00:16.750> you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
techniques that I'm about to show you

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.200 
techniques that I'm about to show you
you<00:00:17.170> should<00:00:17.710> be<00:00:17.800> able<00:00:17.890> to<00:00:18.010> snowboard<00:00:18.279> in<00:00:18.820> two

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
you should be able to snowboard in two

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.990 
you should be able to snowboard in two
to<00:00:19.360> three<00:00:19.390> days<00:00:19.630> what<00:00:20.170> are<00:00:20.260> the<00:00:20.380> techniques

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
to three days what are the techniques

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.320 
to three days what are the techniques
that<00:00:22.000> you<00:00:22.119> need<00:00:22.150> to<00:00:22.390> learn<00:00:22.570> now<00:00:22.930> is<00:00:24.150> calling<00:00:25.150> me

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
that you need to learn now is calling me

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.800 
that you need to learn now is calling me
so<00:00:26.200> if<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:26.380> imagine<00:00:26.530> in<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.100> autumn<00:00:27.610> months

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so if you imagine in the autumn months

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.869 
so if you imagine in the autumn months
women<00:00:28.810> leave<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:30.250> off<00:00:30.400> of<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:30.730> Train<00:00:32.400> and<00:00:33.400> it

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
women leave was off of the Train and it

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.439 
women leave was off of the Train and it
goes<00:00:34.030> this<00:00:34.300> way<00:00:34.360> and<00:00:34.870> I<00:00:35.290> go<00:00:35.530> this<00:00:35.770> way<00:00:36.150> this<00:00:37.150> way

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
goes this way and I go this way this way

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.580 
goes this way and I go this way this way
this<00:00:37.809> way<00:00:39.810> so<00:00:40.810> we're<00:00:40.930> going<00:00:41.020> to<00:00:41.079> do<00:00:41.230> exactly

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
this way so we're going to do exactly

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.060 
this way so we're going to do exactly
that

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
that

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.750 
that
so<00:00:42.940> I'm<00:00:43.660> going<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:43.960> lead<00:00:44.260> with<00:00:44.829> my<00:00:44.860> nose<00:00:45.370> on<00:00:45.399> my

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
so I'm going to lead with my nose on my

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.120 
so I'm going to lead with my nose on my
snowboard<00:00:46.030> in<00:00:46.390> one<00:00:46.540> direction<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.980> I'm

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
snowboard in one direction then I'm

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.700 
snowboard in one direction then I'm
going<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.430> allow<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.790> tail<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.660> board<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
going to allow the tail of the board to

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.920 
going to allow the tail of the board to
start<00:00:51.370> leading<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.270> way<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:52.450> it's<00:00:52.720> going<00:00:52.840> to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
start leading the way so it's going to

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.930 
start leading the way so it's going to
turn<00:00:53.110> down<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.710> slope<00:00:53.980> then<00:00:54.579> I'm<00:00:54.700> going<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.850> be

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
turn down the slope then I'm going to be

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.150 
turn down the slope then I'm going to be
heading<00:00:55.090> in<00:00:55.300> that<00:00:55.329> direction<00:00:55.710> when<00:00:56.710> I<00:00:56.739> get<00:00:56.980> to

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
heading in that direction when I get to

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.430 
heading in that direction when I get to
that<00:00:57.399> edge<00:00:57.700> over<00:00:58.420> there<00:00:58.660> I'm<00:00:59.170> going<00:00:59.320> to<00:00:59.380> be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
that edge over there I'm going to be

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.889 
that edge over there I'm going to be
turning<00:00:59.770> my<00:01:00.040> weight<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:01.030> holding<00:01:01.420> my<00:01:01.570> tray

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
turning my weight so holding my tray

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.109 
turning my weight so holding my tray
returning<00:01:02.770> my<00:01:02.860> weight<00:01:03.100> slightly<00:01:03.820> round<00:01:04.030> to

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
returning my weight slightly round to

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.660 
returning my weight slightly round to
the<00:01:04.239> right<00:01:04.270> that<00:01:05.170> will<00:01:05.229> bring<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:06.160> tail<00:01:06.460> of

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
the right that will bring the tail of

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.540 
the right that will bring the tail of
the<00:01:06.789> board<00:01:06.820> up<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.690> slope<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.950> nose<00:01:09.220> of<00:01:09.460> the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
the board up the slope the nose of the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.460 
the board up the slope the nose of the
board<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:09.880> now<00:01:10.000> pointing<00:01:10.450> down<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.750> slope<00:01:11.229> so

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
board is now pointing down the slope so

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.770 
board is now pointing down the slope so
I<00:01:11.500> knee<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.430> then<00:01:12.640> I'm<00:01:13.119> going<00:01:13.299> to<00:01:13.330> shift<00:01:13.420> my

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
I knee and then I'm going to shift my

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.670 
I knee and then I'm going to shift my
weight<00:01:14.130> back<00:01:15.130> over<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:16.390> nose<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.720> ball<00:01:17.110> so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
weight back over to the nose the ball so

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.870 
weight back over to the nose the ball so
whatever<00:01:18.070> direction<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.650> are<00:01:20.680> going<00:01:21.220> so<00:01:21.700> with

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
whatever direction you are going so with

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.210 
whatever direction you are going so with
the<00:01:22.119> nose<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.690> board<00:01:22.840> leaning<00:01:23.500> or<00:01:23.979> the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
the nose of the board leaning or the

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.240 
the nose of the board leaning or the
tail<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.850> board<00:01:24.880> leading<00:01:26.250> obviously

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
tail of the board leading obviously

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.100 
tail of the board leading obviously
different<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.210> if<00:01:28.360> you're<00:01:28.570> riding<00:01:28.960> in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
board so tail and nose whichever is

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.410 
board so tail and nose whichever is
leading<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:35.890> way<00:01:36.040> you<00:01:36.100> want<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.700> have<00:01:36.939> your

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
leading the way you want to have your

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.080 
leading the way you want to have your
weight<00:01:37.689> over<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.350> back<00:01:39.009> foot

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:56.899 

Taylor<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:45.009> leading<00:01:45.340> with<00:01:51.360> weight<00:01:52.360> changes

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.600 

so<00:01:57.909> when<00:01:58.090> my<00:01:58.299> nose<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.350> leading<00:01:59.770> I've<00:02:00.039> got<00:02:00.490> my

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
so when my nose is leading I've got my

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.389 
so when my nose is leading I've got my
left<00:02:00.909> hand<00:02:01.240> over<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.140> nose<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.649> board<00:02:02.830> my

right hand over the tail of the board

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.860 
right hand over the tail of the board
and<00:02:12.010> my<00:02:12.220> left<00:02:12.610> hand<00:02:12.730> out<00:02:13.060> here<00:02:13.090> I'm<00:02:13.510> still

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870

holding<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.319> tray<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.850> start<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.360> make<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
holding the tray as I start to make the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.940 
holding the tray as I start to make the
turn<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.830> way<00:02:18.100> slight<00:02:19.090> turn<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.630> that

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
turn so this way slight turn to that

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.970 
turn so this way slight turn to that
when<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:20.980> make<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> turn<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.660> way<00:02:22.989> up<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.830> slope

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
when I make a turn this way up the slope

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.000 
when I make a turn this way up the slope
I'm<00:02:24.760> turning<00:02:25.269> this<00:02:25.420> way<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.470> remember<00:02:26.890> you're

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
