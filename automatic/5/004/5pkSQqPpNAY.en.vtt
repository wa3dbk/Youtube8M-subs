00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
to teach you how to make a rain storm

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.330 
to teach you how to make a rain storm
using<00:00:08.639> your<00:00:09.000> hands<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:10.650> learned<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.099> one

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
using your hands and I learned this one

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.940 
using your hands and I learned this one
when<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.610> was<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.849> kid<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.599> loved<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.769> it

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
when I was a kid and I loved to do it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.580 
when I was a kid and I loved to do it
and<00:00:14.160> just<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> note<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.350> really

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and just a note that this is really

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.290 
and just a note that this is really
something<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.100> would<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.430> with<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> big<00:00:17.970> group

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
something you would do with a big group

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.689 
something you would do with a big group
of<00:00:18.420> people<00:00:18.560> um<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> sound

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
of people um so it's not going to sound

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.420 
of people um so it's not going to sound
exactly<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.199> rainstorm<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.220> two<00:00:23.400> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
exactly like a rainstorm one just two of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.040 
exactly like a rainstorm one just two of
us<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.760> doing<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.480> wanted<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.869> show<00:00:24.990> you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
us are doing it we wanted to show you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.830 
us are doing it we wanted to show you
how<00:00:25.400> how<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> steps<00:00:26.760> go<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:27.630> how<00:00:27.750> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
how how the steps go and then how you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.390 
how how the steps go and then how you
can<00:00:27.990> actually<00:00:28.289> teach<00:00:28.619> kids<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
can actually teach kids to do it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.690 
can actually teach kids to do it
so<00:00:29.730> we're<00:00:30.300> great<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:31.109> school-aged<00:00:32.070> kids<00:00:32.099> or

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
so we're great with school-aged kids or

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.690 
so we're great with school-aged kids or
for<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> weather<00:00:33.480> story<00:00:33.989> time<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.530> even<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
for a weather story time or even in the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.010 
for a weather story time or even in the
fall<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:35.940> winter<00:00:36.090> when<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> lot<00:00:36.930> of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
fall or winter when you get a lot of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.410 
fall or winter when you get a lot of
rain<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> start<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
rain so we're going to start and the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.590 
rain so we're going to start and the
thing<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:40.620> note<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.940> first<00:00:42.180> person

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
thing to note is that the first person

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.529 
thing to note is that the first person
to<00:00:42.719> start<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:44.000> they'll<00:00:45.000> start<00:00:45.239> doing<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
to start it they'll start doing the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.880 
to start it they'll start doing the
motions<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> second<00:00:46.710> person

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
motions and then the second person

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.250 
motions and then the second person
starts<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.610> there's<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> bit<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.480> staggering

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
starts and there's a bit of a staggering

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.910 
starts and there's a bit of a staggering
effect<00:00:49.680> between<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.629> transitions<00:00:51.710> from<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
effect between the transitions from the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.959 
effect between the transitions from the
from<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> different<00:00:53.640> parts<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
from the different parts of the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
from the different parts of the
rainstorm<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.739> we'll<00:00:55.739> explain<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> more<00:00:56.219> after

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
rainstorm so we'll explain it more after

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
rainstorm so we'll explain it more after
the<00:00:56.610> video<00:00:56.850> I'm<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> try<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.289> be

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the video I'm not going to try and be

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.900 
the video I'm not going to try and be
the<00:00:58.559> delayed<00:00:58.890> step<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.430> you'll<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.730> me

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the delayed step so you'll see me

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
the delayed step so you'll see me
starting<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> little<00:01:00.629> bit<00:01:00.750> after<00:01:01.020> Lindsey<00:01:01.379> yes

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
starting a little bit after Lindsey yes

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.500 
starting a little bit after Lindsey yes
and<00:01:02.160> there's<00:01:02.550> probably<00:01:02.789> lots<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.239> different

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and there's probably lots of different

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.820 
and there's probably lots of different
ways<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> rainstorm<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.650> just

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
ways to do the rainstorm this is just

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:58.990 
ways to do the rainstorm this is just
the<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> learned<00:01:05.960> okay

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.060 

so<00:01:59.540> if<00:01:59.660> you're<00:01:59.810> doing<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.200> with<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.350> group<00:02:00.770> um

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
so if you're doing it with a group um

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.400 
so if you're doing it with a group um
it's<00:02:02.060> great<00:02:02.390> if<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:02.630> can<00:02:02.780> have<00:02:02.990> them<00:02:03.110> in<00:02:03.320> a

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
it's great if you can have them in a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.830 
it's great if you can have them in a
circle<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.190> then<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.820> can<00:02:05.330> kind<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.630> go

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
circle and then you can kind of go

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.660 
circle and then you can kind of go
around<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.530> show<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.100> kids<00:02:07.310> what<00:02:07.520> they're

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
around and show the kids what they're

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.760 
around and show the kids what they're
supposed<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:07.970> be<00:02:08.060> doing<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.810> they<00:02:09.110> don't<00:02:09.350> start

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
supposed to be doing so they don't start

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.440 
supposed to be doing so they don't start
moving<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.369> next<00:02:10.610> part<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.000> rainstorm

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
moving to the next part of the rainstorm

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.200 
moving to the next part of the rainstorm
until<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.290> get<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.890> them<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.340> show<00:02:13.790> them<00:02:13.820> the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
until you get to them and show them the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.420 
until you get to them and show them the
next<00:02:14.600> part<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.990> do<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:15.680> throughout<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
next part to do so throughout the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.360 
next part to do so throughout the
rainstorm<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.150> have<00:02:17.420> kind<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.110> mixture<00:02:19.070> of

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
rainstorm you have kind of a mixture of

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.240 
rainstorm you have kind of a mixture of
sounds<00:02:19.670> leading<00:02:20.390> up<00:02:20.540> from<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.900> drizzle<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
sounds leading up from a drizzle to the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.980 
sounds leading up from a drizzle to the
Thunder<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.060> then<00:02:23.240> back<00:02:23.450> down<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
Thunder and then back down to the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.320 
Thunder and then back down to the
drizzling<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:25.790> can<00:02:25.940> put<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.090> link<00:02:26.270> down

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
drizzling and we can put a link down

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.480 
drizzling and we can put a link down
below<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.990> choir<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.410> did<00:02:28.010> an<00:02:28.130> amazing

below to a choir that did an amazing
version<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.230> want<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.500> see<00:02:30.650> how<00:02:30.800> it
