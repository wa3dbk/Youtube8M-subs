00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone these hd machines 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.970
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.010
 new video where I'm not going 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.170
 analyze a guardian but two I 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.460
 decided to analyze two guardians why 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.559
 simply because we analyze years 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.030
 that a guard the videos were too 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.470
 short and less in sight that I'm going to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.119
 give pleasure by sharing my 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.910
 football goalkeeper knowledge 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.050
 that five minutes was not enough before 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.640
 to begin I would like to clarify that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.170
 I analyze the goalkeepers on football 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.090
 saved me more than once that they in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.560
 were pretty positive statistics 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.390
 know that the videos that I you 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 propose by testing his guardians are my 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.870
 opinion and my bread and my point of view 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.340
 do not all have the same opinions about 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.780
 gardians me I would advise you 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.280
 always the best for you 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 now what you need to know is 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 only if you take sirigu ceara 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.340
 stekelenburg or if it could 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.710
 to make you a catastrophic match 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.059
 for x reasons maybe because he did 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 not morally because he's not in 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 form 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.199
 or who does not get along with your 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.829
 defenders but know that this keeper 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.239
 cash goals 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.829
 So what I'm asking you is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.930
 give your guard several chances 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.160
 it's not you buy sirigu it makes a 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.750
 rotten match that you clear it that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.280
 you are looking for your guardian not necessary 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.210
 see the morale the form the collective 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.860
 touch to it can play 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
 I already had casillas which is one of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.650
 best goalkeepers on foot and I can 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.970
 you swear they were doing me a match 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 rotten is the following he catches me and where 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.040
 so try to discover a little bit your 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.150
 goalkeeper here today are the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 two guards we will analyze these 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.470
 salvatore sirigu and julio cesar sirigu 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 who in Italian who plays in league 1 at 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 psg and measure 1m 92 and julio cesar 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.369
 brazil a second guardian president that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.549
 I analyze who play in bpm queens park 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.780
 rangers and who measures 1m 86 we're going all 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.100
 immediately start with salvatore sirigu 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 take a look at the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.350
 statistics and the 85 in diving 79 in 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.689
 way I specify path that wants 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.610
 to say somehow ball catch 82 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.070
 7 in SLR and 84 in positioning 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.290
 had largely positive statistics 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.020
 to make him a very good guardian and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.579
 he has an art style and acrobatic so 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.110
 at the level of sirigu dive is very 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.909
 good as I said the 4th complete 25 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.860
 jean he positions himself super well against the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.990
 balloon and he's very explosive 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.460
 when I say very explosive is that they 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.560
 are moving quickly to make a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.880
 diving with a speed of execution 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.509
 impressive impressive it's 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.460
 a big quality 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.140
 more as soon as he goes out one day 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.170
 dive is that repels the ball on 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.940
 the sides he gets up 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.430
 quickly for whom these interact a 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.959
 second time so sirigu that is very 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.180
 good for diving especially on the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.360
 sides at half height and do not catch them on 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.260
 often pushes me back for that 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.480
 remake it's a war machine 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.940
 82.7 in flex he throws himself quickly to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.200
 moment the player arms his shot the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.370
 most of the time I always get out of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.480
 reflexes of fully 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.130
 it's a shame because sometimes you 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.840
 notice that on earth what about 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.269
 some matches if you take 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.680
 it will take a few blunders a little silly 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.940
 but it's just a little fake the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.980
 most of the time he will always answer 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.980
 present let's look at that gameplay 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.950
 the first dive plunger sirigu 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.239
 very well position d receives a big 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.830
 steven gerrard's strike but sirigu 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.510
 responds present pushing the ball on 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.130
 the sides on this action look 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.450
 sirigu the way they move 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.950
 goes to the ball and also the way of 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.060
 reduce sales to receive the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.890
 balloon on him and that takes us out a 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.480
 nice clapper like sirigu reduced 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.280
 well its angles quick movements and 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.660
 dipping half-height pushed back on 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.549
 sides very special accents because sirigu has 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.690
 saw the ball at the last moment but saw 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:23.480
 that he was well placed he made us a 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.190
 nice dive to the ground Sirigu comes forward 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.609
 of course the player he saw he was arming 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.230
 his shot 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.709
 he puts himself on his supports and makes a 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.709
 pretty clapper 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.260
 always by and watch sirigu he does 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.120
 lateral displacement 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.200
 the player arms his shot he gets on 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.750
 his supports and makes a stop at the center 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:48.250
 pushed back on the ribs and reflexes 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.870
 re -entrant corner big podolski head 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.280
 big reflex sirigu who gets up 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.280
 quickly to catch the ball 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.610
 sturridge facing sirigu 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.290
 that comes out quickly while reducing 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.970
 well its angles and without stopping 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.970
 reflex at the moment when sturridge shot 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.530
 aguero who was coming forward that makes in the 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.630
 loose repair area a big 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.870
 strikes but sirigu to show who it is 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.250
 a boss if the taste will happen aguero 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.900
 quickly fate big agüero shot 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.200
 but sirigu win again the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.400
 duel played well it's rigaud appreciates 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.870
 the trajectory of the balloon 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.770
 return and find himself facing ste brice 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.880
 big hit stop ground reflex at little bit 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.620
 near the same action as just now 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.850
 Sirigu advances by reducing his 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.800
 angles the ball goes automatically 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.100
 come back on it's the loose cac a 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.000
 nice reflex and pushes on the sides 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.770
 on this action it's almost 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.720
 impossible to mark because sirigu was 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.140
 well positioned well on its supports and 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.140
 this is the result 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.830
 now that we have finished I will give my 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.020
 conclusion on sirigu 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.630
 after the analysis of Julio Cesar so 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.990
 Julio Cesar and the 4th 24 years diving 80 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.820
 in June 84 reflex years and 82 years 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.460
 positioning the biggest quality 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.200
 at home for me it's the reflexes he 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.360
 is extremely powerful and super 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.300
 decisive very imposing in the outputs 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.710
 and wins the majority of face to face he 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.080
 a good lateral displacement 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.070
 are they good against the balloon 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.690
 what are the prices and in what 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.710
 team I love it we will look after the 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:27.479
 gameplay that I will offer you 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.479
 the listened it is gone the dives 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.360
 julio cesar his censorship vote in love 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.620
 who makes a back pass rolls himself 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.400
 move laterally to make a pretty 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.500
 a reflex like I say julio cesar 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.030
 moves well and well his angles he 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.100
 only has to dive is pushed back on 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.720
 the sides corner company head julio 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.430
 Cesar who was already well placed no longer 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.410
 that quietly picked up a balloon a 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.880
 center from ben arfa half volley 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.290
 two good hours julio cesar who does 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.350
 a plane plays on the ground and captures the 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.350
 ball 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.710
 same action as just now julio 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.150
 cesar or a strike on the ground but 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:11.129
 always responds repelling the 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:13.439
 ball on the ribs and reflexes 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.729
 julio cesar 500 on doctor love that makes 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.050
 a recessed pass roller moves 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.839
 laterally to make a nice stop 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.519
 reflex wagner that's close to 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:22.289
 julio julio who is advancing rapidly in 

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:24.300
 reducing his angles well tent wagner 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.059
 a lob the fonio the spell a magnificent 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.649
 reflex recovery hand missed Julio 

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:30.659
 Cesar who finds himself facing agbonlahor 

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:35.789
 Julio Cesar wins us the duel again 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:37.649
 well played same action julio cesar fate 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.659
 quickly from his cages and wins the duel 

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:41.659
 frankly it was very impressive 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:46.830
 mayuka very fast render in the 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:49.080
 repair surface he drops a 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.369
 julio reflex stop missile that gets 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.279
 picks up quickly to catch the bat 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:54.899
 and calmels danger then this action 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.099
 it's a reflex from elsewhere I 

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.099
 comments even by simply watching 

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:07.619
 his two guardians are not so 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.839
 different than that they are both 

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:12.059
 very decisive and do not do much 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:14.399
 mistakes or hand mistakes both 

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:16.860
 have an art style and acrobatic and the 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:18.509
 two are not expensive at all sirigu that 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.899
 you can find it at 1000 credits or 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:24.659
 1200 and Julio Cesar to 1400 credit or 

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:25.919
 2000 credit it will depend on you if you 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:28.499
 look good and if you have any 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.879
 chance to buy them cheaper before 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:30.419
 to finish i'm going to show you in 

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.369
 which team 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:35.039
 I put taste series so we have
