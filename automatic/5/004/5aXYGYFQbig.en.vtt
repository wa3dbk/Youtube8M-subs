00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
with a new character that is very

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.460 
with a new character that is very
similar<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.580> one<00:05:32.900> they<00:05:33.900> they<00:05:34.170> once<00:05:34.380> knew

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
similar to the one they they once knew

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.070 
similar to the one they they once knew
that<00:05:34.860> came<00:05:35.040> over<00:05:35.180> so<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:37.490> I<00:05:38.490> think<00:05:38.960> but<00:05:39.960> then

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
that came over so I I think but then

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.020 
that came over so I I think but then
again<00:05:40.200> I<00:05:40.320> don't<00:05:40.470> know<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.710> full<00:05:40.980> details<00:05:41.030> this

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
is this is just speculation this is just

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.180 
is this is just speculation this is just
going<00:05:43.650> off<00:05:43.800> of<00:05:43.830> what<00:05:43.950> everything<00:05:44.490> so<00:05:46.190> either
