00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
left a little space where I marked it to

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:21.240 
left a little space where I marked it to
help<00:01:08.369> me<00:01:08.580> guide<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.960> give<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.500> straight<00:01:14.250> line

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:30.270 

I'm<00:01:22.250> just<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.730> go<00:01:22.910> all<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.420> way<00:01:23.450> down

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.080 

like<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:33.280> now<00:01:34.280> my<00:01:34.730> excess<00:01:35.330> is<00:01:35.630> still<00:01:35.960> pinned

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
like that now my excess is still pinned

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.240 
like that now my excess is still pinned
to<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.360> actual<00:01:38.960> size<00:01:39.230> that<00:01:39.260> I<00:01:39.650> want<00:01:40.010> and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
to the actual size that I want and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.120 
to the actual size that I want and
that's<00:01:40.490> fine<00:01:42.910> now<00:01:43.910> I'm<00:01:44.240> going<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.870> cut<00:01:45.140> this

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
that's fine now I'm going to cut this

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.210 
that's fine now I'm going to cut this
the<00:01:46.760> shorter<00:01:47.330> edge<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:50.800> don't<00:01:51.800> think<00:01:52.070> I

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
the shorter edge and I don't think I

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.990 
the shorter edge and I don't think I
left<00:01:52.640> myself<00:01:52.910> enough<00:01:53.390> room<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.729> get<00:01:55.729> my

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
left myself enough room to get my

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.840 
left myself enough room to get my
scissors<00:01:56.270> in<00:01:56.750> there<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:57.710> just<00:01:58.010> to<00:01:58.310> start<00:01:58.670> a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
scissors in there but just to start a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.050 
scissors in there but just to start a
little<00:01:59.060> snippet<00:01:59.890> then<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.040> can<00:02:01.250> take<00:02:01.520> my<00:02:01.729> pin

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
little snippet then I can take my pin

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.660 
little snippet then I can take my pin
out<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:04.479> follow<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.780> guide<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.440> next<00:02:06.740> pin

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.880 

so<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:10.729> can<00:02:10.910> have<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> pretty<00:02:11.750> nice<00:02:11.990> straight

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
so I can have a pretty nice straight

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.960 
so I can have a pretty nice straight
line<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.800> if<00:02:15.950> you're<00:02:16.100> working<00:02:16.310> with<00:02:16.550> new

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
line and if you're working with new

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.620 
line and if you're working with new
fabric<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:19.430> pretty<00:02:19.850> stiff<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
fabric it's it's pretty stiff so you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:34.760 
fabric it's it's pretty stiff so you
could<00:02:20.810> probably<00:02:21.050> get<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.860> straight<00:02:22.340> cut

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.920 

I'm<00:02:35.310> down<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.940> next<00:02:36.240> pin<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.720> gonna

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
I'm down to the next pin I'm gonna

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:48.000 
I'm down to the next pin I'm gonna
remove<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.460> continue<00:02:39.030> my<00:02:39.210> cut

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:59.800 

next<00:02:49.010> pin<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.959> continue<00:02:54.590> my<00:02:54.769> cut<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.629> is

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
next pin and continue my cut and this is

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.860 
next pin and continue my cut and this is
the<00:02:59.989> final<00:03:00.260> pin<00:03:01.900> take<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.080> lose<00:03:04.870> and

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
the final pin take the lose and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.830 
the final pin take the lose and
finishing<00:03:06.410> off

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
the excess from the short end and this

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.580 
the excess from the short end and this
size<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.970> size<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.900> face<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.410> my

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590
