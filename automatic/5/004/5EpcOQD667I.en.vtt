many threats he's got aladdeus and a dog

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.039 
many threats he's got aladdeus and a dog
which<00:00:14.429> pretty<00:00:15.179> much<00:00:15.269> only<00:00:15.660> things<00:00:15.929> I'm

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
which pretty much only things I'm

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.099 
which pretty much only things I'm
worried<00:00:16.350> about<00:00:16.410> he<00:00:16.770> does<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.070> eat<00:00:17.340> ran<00:00:17.580> which

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
worried about he does have eat ran which

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.540 
worried about he does have eat ran which
does<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.320> potential<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.859> become<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.220> threat

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
does have potential to become a threat

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.730 
does have potential to become a threat
but<00:00:21.470> 5th<00:00:22.470> gen<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:23.730> not<00:00:23.910> seen<00:00:24.869> specs

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
but 5th gen this really not seen specs

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.099 
but 5th gen this really not seen specs
it's<00:00:26.160> more<00:00:26.400> commonly<00:00:26.939> especially<00:00:27.480> defensive

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
it's more commonly especially defensive

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.470 
it's more commonly especially defensive
with<00:00:28.710> stealth<00:00:29.010> rock<00:00:29.250> toxic<00:00:29.730> grower<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.330> lot

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
with stealth rock toxic grower and a lot

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
with stealth rock toxic grower and a lot
of<00:00:30.510> bloom<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.980> worried<00:00:32.219> too<00:00:32.369> much<00:00:32.399> about

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
of bloom so not worried too much about

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.170 
of bloom so not worried too much about
that<00:00:33.030> guy<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.860> I'm<00:00:34.860> pretty<00:00:35.550> much<00:00:35.640> figuring

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that guy and I'm pretty much figuring

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.670 
that guy and I'm pretty much figuring
he's<00:00:36.420> gonna<00:00:36.540> lead<00:00:36.780> off<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.170> his<00:00:37.350> head<00:00:37.380> bowed

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
he's gonna lead off with his head bowed

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.930 
he's gonna lead off with his head bowed
on<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.489> his<00:00:38.790> adios<00:00:39.270> um<00:00:40.160> he'd<00:00:41.160> Miley<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.700> HIPAA

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
on or his adios um he'd Miley with HIPAA

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.560 
on or his adios um he'd Miley with HIPAA
Don<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.300> get<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.540> his<00:00:42.690> sand<00:00:43.050> um<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:44.520> Tatar<00:00:45.270> but

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
Don to get up his sand um or Tatar but

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
Don to get up his sand um or Tatar but
probably<00:00:46.200> won't<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:46.680> Tito<00:00:47.010> since<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.430> do

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
probably won't be with Tito since I do

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.310 
probably won't be with Tito since I do
have<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> variety<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.539> things<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.140> handle

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
have a variety of things that can handle

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
have a variety of things that can handle
this<00:00:49.530> Tito<00:00:49.950> Tito<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:51.059> predictable

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
this Tito Tito is a very predictable

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.139 
this Tito Tito is a very predictable
lead<00:00:52.219> as<00:00:53.219> well<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.579> he'll<00:00:53.730> vote<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.030> but

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
lead as well as he'll vote on but

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
lead as well as he'll vote on but
whatever<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.020> I'm<00:00:55.170> figuring<00:00:55.379> he's<00:00:55.890> more<00:00:56.219> than

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
whatever so I'm figuring he's more than

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.779 
whatever so I'm figuring he's more than
likely<00:00:56.399> gonna<00:00:56.730> leave<00:00:56.969> aladdeus<00:00:57.649> which<00:00:58.789> he's

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
likely gonna leave aladdeus which he's

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.520 
likely gonna leave aladdeus which he's
probably<00:01:00.030> gonna<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.359> predicting<00:01:00.809> mari<00:01:01.050> Rotom

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
probably gonna be predicting mari Rotom

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
probably gonna be predicting mari Rotom

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
attacks right off the bat but you could

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
attacks right off the bat but you could
also<00:01:06.510> leave<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:06.900> Shaymin<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.710> even<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.130> he

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
also leave with Shaymin but even if he

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
lead against pretty much anything on his

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.469 
lead against pretty much anything on his
team<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.860> gonna<00:01:14.250> send<00:01:14.580> out<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.970> genesect

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
for an earth power and luckily i went

into land routes which is a flying-type
so<00:01:39.030> i<00:01:39.060> don't<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.509> hit<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:40.770> i'm

so i don't get hit like that so now i'm

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.289 
so i don't get hit like that so now i'm
pretty<00:01:41.100> sure<00:01:41.280> he's<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.579> switch<00:01:41.909> i'm<00:01:42.150> gonna

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
pretty sure he's gonna switch i'm gonna

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.789 
pretty sure he's gonna switch i'm gonna
go<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> substitute<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.259> he<00:01:43.380> brings<00:01:43.590> in

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
go for the substitute as he brings in

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.789 
go for the substitute as he brings in
the<00:01:43.979> hit<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.420> expecting<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.509> physical<00:01:45.990> self

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

and<00:02:36.650> predict<00:02:37.010> my<00:02:37.189> switch<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.760> goes<00:02:38.599> for<00:02:38.629> a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
and predict my switch and goes for a

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.050 
and predict my switch and goes for a
Draco<00:02:39.170> meteor<00:02:39.379> and<00:02:39.680> fuckin<00:02:40.189> destroys<00:02:40.400> my

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
I could pop it and you know I could just

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.770 
I could pop it and you know I could just
go<00:03:12.530> from<00:03:12.650> there<00:03:12.739> but<00:03:13.489> he<00:03:13.730> stays<00:03:13.970> in<00:03:14.209> kill<00:03:14.690> him

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
absolutely useless cuz it might be able

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.159 
absolutely useless cuz it might be able
to<00:03:29.000> take<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.209> hydro<00:03:29.569> pump<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.900> don't<00:03:30.049> know<00:03:30.139> I

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
to take a hydro pump I don't know I

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.899 
to take a hydro pump I don't know I
don't<00:03:30.319> really<00:03:30.500> battle<00:03:30.949> this<00:03:31.040> dog<00:03:31.310> too<00:03:31.519> often

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
don't really battle this dog too often

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.610 
don't really battle this dog too often
but<00:03:32.769> Rotom<00:03:33.769> isn't<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.190> most<00:03:34.430> um<00:03:35.620> doesn't

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
but Rotom isn't the most um doesn't

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.319 
but Rotom isn't the most um doesn't
really<00:03:36.769> have<00:03:36.889> too<00:03:37.040> much<00:03:37.190> special<00:03:37.579> tag<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.060> I

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
really have too much special tag so I

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.000 
really have too much special tag so I
figured<00:03:38.959> burning<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.409> will<00:03:39.530> probably<00:03:39.769> more

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
figured burning it will probably more

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.009 
figured burning it will probably more
bit<00:03:40.220> probably<00:03:40.879> be<00:03:41.120> more<00:03:41.299> beneficial<00:03:41.449> in<00:03:41.959> the

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
bit probably be more beneficial in the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.379 
bit probably be more beneficial in the
long<00:03:42.109> run<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.220> go<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.519> Jenn<00:03:43.819> effect<00:03:44.120> to

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
long run so I go to Jenn effect to

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.119 
long run so I go to Jenn effect to
resist<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.989> then<00:03:45.379> I'm<00:03:45.650> thinking<00:03:45.829> him

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
resist and then I'm thinking him

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.020 
resist and then I'm thinking him
probably<00:03:46.430> gonna<00:03:46.669> go<00:03:46.970> either<00:03:47.209> into<00:03:47.720> heatran<00:03:48.229> or

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
probably gonna go either into heatran or

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.860 
probably gonna go either into heatran or
something<00:03:50.030> else<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.419> don't<00:03:50.479> know<00:03:50.599> what<00:03:50.750> the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
something else I don't know what the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.830 
something else I don't know what the
fuck<00:03:51.079> but<00:03:51.829> I<00:03:52.099> go<00:03:52.579> in<00:03:52.669> a<00:03:52.760> scissor<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.329> this<00:03:53.599> dog

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
fuck but I go in a scissor and this dog

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.930 
fuck but I go in a scissor and this dog
is<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:54.139> like<00:03:54.319> minus<00:03:54.709> infinity<00:03:55.040> right<00:03:55.459> now<00:03:55.669> so

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
is that like minus infinity right now so

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.149 
is that like minus infinity right now so
this<00:03:56.180> superpower<00:03:56.989> is<00:03:57.139> gonna<00:03:57.290> do<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.709> to

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
this superpower is gonna do like to

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.490 
this superpower is gonna do like to
damage<00:03:58.579> so<00:03:59.209> I'm<00:03:59.449> just<00:03:59.599> gonna<00:03:59.720> go<00:03:59.959> for<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.260> user

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
damage so I'm just gonna go for the user

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.649 
damage so I'm just gonna go for the user
and<00:04:00.709> expecting<00:04:01.310> his<00:04:01.459> heatran<00:04:01.909> to<00:04:02.090> come<00:04:02.269> in<00:04:02.419> yet

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
and expecting his heatran to come in yet

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.960 
and expecting his heatran to come in yet
again<00:04:03.019> but<00:04:03.650> he's<00:04:04.040> not<00:04:04.220> really<00:04:04.489> bringing<00:04:04.790> in

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970

hear that his tyranitar was supposed to

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.349 
hear that his tyranitar was supposed to
be<00:04:18.139> scarfed<00:04:18.560> which<00:04:18.859> doesn't<00:04:19.820> really<00:04:19.969> matter

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
be scarfed which doesn't really matter

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:20.870 
be scarfed which doesn't really matter
that<00:04:20.510> it

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
that it

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.360 
that it
nah<00:04:21.000> scarf<00:04:21.420> because<00:04:21.660> if<00:04:22.500> he<00:04:22.740> was<00:04:22.890> scarf<00:04:23.190> you

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
nah scarf because if he was scarf you

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.790 
nah scarf because if he was scarf you
would<00:04:23.490> have<00:04:23.610> had<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.910> go<00:04:24.090> for<00:04:24.390> something<00:04:24.810> more

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
would have had to go for something more

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.670 
would have had to go for something more
than<00:04:25.980> likely<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.760> crunch<00:04:27.600> or<00:04:27.810> rock<00:04:28.110> slide<00:04:28.410> and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
than likely a crunch or rock slide and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.130 
than likely a crunch or rock slide and
if<00:04:28.950> he<00:04:29.280> did<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.490> then<00:04:29.910> I'd<00:04:30.180> probably<00:04:30.420> go<00:04:30.720> into

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
if he did that then I'd probably go into

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.250 
if he did that then I'd probably go into
my<00:04:31.520> landris<00:04:32.520> if<00:04:32.820> he<00:04:33.150> went<00:04:33.330> for<00:04:33.480> rock<00:04:33.690> slide<00:04:33.960> if

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
my landris if he went for rock slide if

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.470 
my landris if he went for rock slide if
not<00:04:34.440> go<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.280> scissor<00:04:35.640> to<00:04:35.790> resist<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.210> crunch

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
not go to scissor to resist the crunch

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.860 
not go to scissor to resist the crunch
but<00:04:36.930> yeah<00:04:37.940> after<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.030> hydro<00:04:39.300> poem<00:04:39.510> he's<00:04:39.720> gonna

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
but yeah after the hydro poem he's gonna

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.010 
but yeah after the hydro poem he's gonna
die<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.580> yeah<00:04:41.580> he's<00:04:42.060> not<00:04:42.180> gonna<00:04:42.330> die<00:04:42.570> but<00:04:42.600> I'm
