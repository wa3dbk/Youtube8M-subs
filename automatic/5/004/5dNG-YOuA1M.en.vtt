hi I'm Paul Koloff go this is how to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.339 
hi I'm Paul Koloff go this is how to
grow<00:00:07.400> grapes<00:00:07.730> outside<00:00:08.330> the<00:00:08.809> first<00:00:09.080> thing<00:00:09.259> you

grapes you want to grow in your yard and

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.939 
grapes you want to grow in your yard and
also<00:00:14.419> the<00:00:14.509> location<00:00:15.019> that<00:00:15.110> you<00:00:15.259> want<00:00:15.409> for

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
also the location that you want for

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.320 
also the location that you want for
instance<00:00:16.250> if<00:00:16.309> you<00:00:16.400> can<00:00:16.520> be<00:00:16.580> growing<00:00:16.820> table

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
instance if you can be growing table

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.970 
instance if you can be growing table
grapes<00:00:17.570> then<00:00:17.960> you<00:00:18.050> can<00:00:18.200> get<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:18.440> grape<00:00:18.650> plant

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
grapes then you can get the grape plant

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.400 
grapes then you can get the grape plant
anywhere<00:00:19.610> you<00:00:19.880> want<00:00:20.150> now<00:00:20.630> if<00:00:20.780> you're<00:00:20.900> serious

anywhere you want now if you're serious
about<00:00:21.470> growing<00:00:21.830> grapes<00:00:22.310> for<00:00:22.670> doing<00:00:23.090> wine

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
about growing grapes for doing wine

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.260 
about growing grapes for doing wine
I<00:00:23.840> suggest<00:00:24.770> then<00:00:24.980> doing<00:00:25.190> a<00:00:25.310> grafted<00:00:25.940> grape

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
I suggest then doing a grafted grape

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.150 
I suggest then doing a grafted grape
which<00:00:26.570> basically<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.350> bottom<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:27.950> top

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
which basically the bottom and the top

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.700 
which basically the bottom and the top
are<00:00:28.640> two<00:00:28.940> different<00:00:29.450> grape<00:00:29.930> plants<00:00:30.350> one<00:00:30.530> for

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
are two different grape plants one for

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.650 
are two different grape plants one for
the<00:00:30.800> soil<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:31.280> one<00:00:31.460> for<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.760> top<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:32.509> there's

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
the soil and one for the top and there's

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.270 
the soil and one for the top and there's
usually<00:00:32.780> an<00:00:32.990> Omega<00:00:33.290> graph<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:33.860> can<00:00:33.980> get<00:00:34.130> those

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
usually an Omega graph you can get those

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.030 
usually an Omega graph you can get those
anywhere<00:00:34.700> in<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:34.910> mid<00:00:35.090> coast<00:00:35.360> or<00:00:35.810> in<00:00:35.960> Napo<00:00:36.829> or

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
anywhere in the mid coast or in Napo or

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.250 
anywhere in the mid coast or in Napo or
any<00:00:37.520> other<00:00:37.700> kind<00:00:38.000> of<00:00:38.090> grape<00:00:38.510> professional

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
any other kind of grape professional

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.840 
any other kind of grape professional
grape<00:00:39.470> growing<00:00:39.739> places<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.610> next

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
grape growing places the next

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.370 
grape growing places the next
consideration<00:00:41.090> is<00:00:41.600> where<00:00:41.989> are<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:42.110> going<00:00:42.290> to

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
consideration is where are you going to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.260 
consideration is where are you going to
plant<00:00:42.560> these<00:00:42.829> grapes<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:43.670> need<00:00:43.880> to<00:00:43.970> have<00:00:44.150> the

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
plant these grapes you need to have the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.000 
plant these grapes you need to have the
maximum<00:00:44.480> Sun<00:00:44.989> on<00:00:45.110> them<00:00:45.260> especially<00:00:45.410> when

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
maximum Sun on them especially when

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.889 
maximum Sun on them especially when
they're<00:00:46.220> bearing<00:00:46.700> fruit<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:47.660> in<00:00:47.810> this

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
they're bearing fruit so in this

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.210 
they're bearing fruit so in this
particular<00:00:48.110> case<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:49.489> Sun<00:00:49.730> comes<00:00:50.360> along<00:00:51.220> this

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
particular case the Sun comes along this

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.400 
particular case the Sun comes along this
side<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:52.760> has<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.270> maximum<00:00:53.660> exposure<00:00:54.079> on<00:00:54.290> this

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
side and has a maximum exposure on this

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.680 
side and has a maximum exposure on this
side<00:00:54.649> that's<00:00:55.100> why<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:55.910> entire<00:00:56.270> side<00:00:56.540> of<00:00:56.630> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
side that's why this entire side of the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.290 
side that's why this entire side of the
house<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:57.230> full<00:00:57.590> of<00:00:57.710> grapes<00:00:57.940> here<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.149> house

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
house is full of grapes here the house

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.479 
house is full of grapes here the house
is<00:00:59.510> over<00:00:59.719> here<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.140> normally<00:01:01.010> if<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.219> grapes

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
is over here and normally if the grapes

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.490 
is over here and normally if the grapes
weren't<00:01:01.820> here<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:02.420> wall<00:01:02.870> would<00:01:03.079> be<00:01:03.170> heated

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
weren't here this wall would be heated

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.160 
weren't here this wall would be heated
up<00:01:03.649> roughly<00:01:04.309> about<00:01:04.370> 10<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:04.909> 15<00:01:05.239> degrees<00:01:05.360> higher

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
up roughly about 10 to 15 degrees higher

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.410 
up roughly about 10 to 15 degrees higher
during<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.130> summer<00:01:07.340> than<00:01:07.820> normally<00:01:08.240> without

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
during the summer than normally without

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.539 
during the summer than normally without
the<00:01:08.780> grapes<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.560> actually<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.130> grapes<00:01:10.340> are

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
the grapes so actually the grapes are

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.410 
the grapes so actually the grapes are
not<00:01:11.510> only<00:01:11.690> are<00:01:11.990> they<00:01:12.340> really<00:01:13.340> giving<00:01:13.880> us<00:01:14.150> fruit

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
not only are they really giving us fruit

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.570 
not only are they really giving us fruit
but<00:01:14.870> they're<00:01:15.020> also<00:01:15.200> shading<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.830> house<00:01:16.010> so

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
but they're also shading the house so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.490 
but they're also shading the house so
that's<00:01:16.700> another<00:01:16.880> consideration<00:01:17.350> soil<00:01:18.350> is

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
that's another consideration soil is

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.080 
that's another consideration soil is
actually<00:01:18.590> quite<00:01:19.010> important<00:01:19.580> but<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:19.940> went

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
actually quite important but you went

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.520 
actually quite important but you went
really<00:01:20.360> bad<00:01:20.540> soil<00:01:20.900> it's<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.200> Mediterranean

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
really bad soil it's a Mediterranean

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.200 
really bad soil it's a Mediterranean
plant<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.280> want<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.580> keep<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.850> really

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
plant so you want to keep it really

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.899 
plant so you want to keep it really
really<00:01:23.450> bad<00:01:23.630> soil<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.200> high<00:01:24.350> drainage<00:01:24.909> when

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
really bad soil and high drainage when

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.330 
really bad soil and high drainage when
you<00:01:26.030> have<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> bare<00:01:27.049> root<00:01:27.320> your<00:01:27.950> first<00:01:28.100> growing

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
you have a bare root your first growing

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.460 
you have a bare root your first growing
a<00:01:28.400> bare<00:01:28.640> root<00:01:28.909> grape<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.869> really<00:01:30.110> want<00:01:30.320> to

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
a bare root grape you really want to

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.050 
a bare root grape you really want to
keep<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.040> taproot<00:01:31.490> going<00:01:31.729> straight<00:01:32.030> down

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
keep the taproot going straight down

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.789 
keep the taproot going straight down
when<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:32.479> plant<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.930> when<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.290> have<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.439> potted

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
when you plant it when you have a potted

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.649 
when you plant it when you have a potted
version<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.640> make<00:01:35.240> sure<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:35.479> when<00:01:35.600> you

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
version of this make sure that when you

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.050 
version of this make sure that when you
take<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.900> pot<00:01:36.110> off<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.430> root

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
take the pot off that you the root

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.910 
take the pot off that you the root
generally<00:01:38.450> grows<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.350> circle<00:01:39.680> underneath

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
generally grows in a circle underneath

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.080 
generally grows in a circle underneath
and<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.340> want<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.580> just<00:01:40.760> pull<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.060> straight

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
and you want to just pull it straight

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.910 
and you want to just pull it straight
out<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:41.780> make<00:01:42.380> sure<00:01:42.409> it's<00:01:42.710> pointing

last thing you want to consider is the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.539 
last thing you want to consider is the
type<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:47.930> materials<00:01:48.680> for<00:01:48.920> your<00:01:49.009> trellis<00:01:49.250> or

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
type of materials for your trellis or

how you want to tie up your trellis in
this<00:01:51.770> particular<00:01:52.040> case<00:01:52.430> as<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.790> can<00:01:52.909> see<00:01:53.090> down

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
this particular case as you can see down

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.929 
this particular case as you can see down
the<00:01:53.360> side<00:01:53.659> here<00:01:53.900> this<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.070> double<00:01:55.549> curtain

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
the side here this is a double curtain

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.640 
the side here this is a double curtain
version<00:01:56.299> where<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:56.600> have<00:01:56.810> two<00:01:57.320> grapes

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
version where you have two grapes

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.910 
version where you have two grapes
growing<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.119> curtain<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.920> leaves

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
growing and then the curtain of leaves

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.490 
growing and then the curtain of leaves
fall<00:02:01.340> on<00:02:01.460> either<00:02:01.640> side<00:02:01.939> this<00:02:02.420> gives<00:02:02.659> maximum

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
fall on either side this gives maximum

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.440 
fall on either side this gives maximum
amount<00:02:03.799> of<00:02:03.890> light<00:02:03.950> exposure<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.299> gives

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
amount of light exposure and it gives

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.440 
amount of light exposure and it gives
you<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.570> very<00:02:05.780> high<00:02:05.990> yield<00:02:06.020> in<00:02:06.500> grapes<00:02:06.909> now<00:02:07.909> some

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
you a very high yield in grapes now some

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.300 
you a very high yield in grapes now some
things<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.780> consider<00:02:08.899> one<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.739> don't<00:02:10.130> use

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
things to consider one is don't use

it leeches out all
the<00:02:14.030> preserves<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.990> then<00:02:15.170> kills<00:02:15.440> your<00:02:15.620> grape
