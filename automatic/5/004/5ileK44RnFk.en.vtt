to<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.330> match<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.870> really<00:00:13.200> think<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:13.920> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
to this match I really think this is a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.160 
to this match I really think this is a
pretty<00:00:14.370> unpredictable<00:00:14.730> match<00:00:15.240> especially

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
pretty unpredictable match especially

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.660 
pretty unpredictable match especially
because<00:00:16.619> Naomi<00:00:17.460> just<00:00:18.080> turned<00:00:19.080> heel<00:00:19.380> if<00:00:19.670> this

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
because Naomi just turned heel if this

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.450 
because Naomi just turned heel if this
was<00:00:20.910> Naomi<00:00:21.150> as<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> face<00:00:21.980> like<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.310> know<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
was Naomi as a face like you know a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.859 
was Naomi as a face like you know a
couple<00:00:23.609> weeks<00:00:23.850> back<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.330> she<00:00:24.480> was<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.630> face

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
couple weeks back when she was a face

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.330 
couple weeks back when she was a face
you've<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.260> gotten<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:26.010> know<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.160> couple

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849 
you've just gotten you know a couple
wins<00:00:26.670> over<00:00:27.029> over<00:00:27.449> Nikki<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.560> know<00:00:28.590> it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
wins over over Nikki you know it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.370 
wins over over Nikki you know it
wouldn't<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.519> hard<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.970> predict<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.869> would

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
wouldn't be as hard to predict I would

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.270 
wouldn't be as hard to predict I would
have<00:00:31.470> went<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.309> Nikki<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.360> know<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.870> sure

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
have went with Nikki you know for sure

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.650 
have went with Nikki you know for sure
but<00:00:35.719> now<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.160> pretty<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.090> Naomi's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
but now that this is pretty much Naomi's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.220 
but now that this is pretty much Naomi's
first<00:00:40.079> big<00:00:40.559> match<00:00:40.829> since<00:00:41.700> turning<00:00:42.059> heel<00:00:42.390> its

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
first big match since turning heel its

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.490 
first big match since turning heel its
sides<00:00:43.860> itself<00:00:44.370> went<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> predict<00:00:44.969> because<00:00:45.510> if

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
sides itself went to predict because if

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.790 
sides itself went to predict because if
they<00:00:46.950> only<00:00:47.100> wins<00:00:47.539> then<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:49.320> its<00:00:49.530> upper

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
they only wins then that's its upper

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.520 
they only wins then that's its upper
pretty<00:00:50.010> good<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.870> storyline<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.440> a
