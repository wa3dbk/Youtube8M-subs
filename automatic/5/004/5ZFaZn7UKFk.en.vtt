I became vegan my last year of college I

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.749 
I became vegan my last year of college I
had<00:00:10.230> been<00:00:10.500> thinking<00:00:10.620> about<00:00:10.889> how<00:00:11.099> humans<00:00:11.550> treat

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
had been thinking about how humans treat

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.850 
had been thinking about how humans treat
animals<00:00:12.030> I'd<00:00:12.540> read<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> book<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.259> deliberation

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
animals I'd read the book a deliberation

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.310 
animals I'd read the book a deliberation
and<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.880> seen<00:00:15.389> some<00:00:15.420> information<00:00:16.139> from

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
and and seen some information from

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.420 
and and seen some information from
people<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> ethical<00:00:16.920> treatment<00:00:17.130> of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
people for the ethical treatment of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.429 
people for the ethical treatment of
animals<00:00:17.550> how<00:00:18.029> animals<00:00:18.420> are<00:00:18.539> treated<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.990> I

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
animals how animals are treated and I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.170 
animals how animals are treated and I
just<00:00:20.039> decided<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.460> didn't<00:00:20.730> want<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.910> support

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
just decided I didn't want to support

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.580 
just decided I didn't want to support
that<00:00:21.390> kind<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.630> Cruelty<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.020> Animals<00:00:22.140> any

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
that kind of Cruelty to Animals any

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.040 
that kind of Cruelty to Animals any
longer<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.699> slowly<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.449> surely<00:00:24.750> became

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
longer so I I slowly but surely became

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.410 
longer so I I slowly but surely became
vegan<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.789> concerned<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
vegan and I was concerned about the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.820 
vegan and I was concerned about the
health<00:00:27.539> aspects<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.439> first<00:00:28.590> because

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
health aspects of it at first because

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.700 
health aspects of it at first because
back<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> late<00:00:31.019> 80s<00:00:31.380> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
back in the this was the late 80s it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.170 
back in the this was the late 80s it
wasn't<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> lot<00:00:32.219> known<00:00:32.460> about<00:00:32.579> vegan<00:00:33.030> nutrition

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
wasn't a lot known about vegan nutrition

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729 
wasn't a lot known about vegan nutrition
at<00:00:33.540> least<00:00:33.690> most<00:00:34.050> people<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:34.469> know<00:00:34.590> much

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
at least most people they know much

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.430 
at least most people they know much
about<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.570> I<00:00:36.570> did<00:00:36.870> some<00:00:36.960> research<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
about it so I did some research and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
about it so I did some research and
found<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:39.059> know<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.540> would<00:00:39.660> be

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
found out that you know it would be

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.130 
found out that you know it would be
healthy<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.559> vegan

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
healthy to be vegan

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.130 
healthy to be vegan

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
I went vegan I lost about 10 pounds

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.110 
I went vegan I lost about 10 pounds
which<00:00:44.590> I<00:00:44.860> wasn't<00:00:45.160> heavy<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.489> begin<00:00:45.760> with<00:00:45.970> but

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
which I wasn't heavy to begin with but

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.240 
which I wasn't heavy to begin with but
it<00:00:46.300> was<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:47.140> know<00:00:47.200> my<00:00:47.379> body<00:00:47.590> fat<00:00:47.829> percentage

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
it was you know my body fat percentage

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.680 
it was you know my body fat percentage

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.479 
went down and I coalfield I was an
athlete<00:00:49.809> I<00:00:50.079> was<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.350> polymeric<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.340> pole

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
athlete I was a polymeric and pole

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.560 
athlete I was a polymeric and pole
vaulter<00:00:51.910> in<00:00:52.090> college<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.220> seemed<00:00:54.430> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
vaulter in college and so that seemed to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.729 
vaulter in college and so that seemed to
help<00:00:55.570> help<00:00:55.930> my<00:00:56.079> vaulting<00:00:56.530> actually<00:00:57.010> at

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
help help my vaulting actually at

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.959 
help help my vaulting actually at
and<00:00:58.739> then<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:01:00.530> just<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:02.489> vegan

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and then I you know I think just a vegan

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
and then I you know I think just a vegan
diet<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.570> worked<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.140> me<00:01:04.170> over

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
diet is really worked well for me over

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.249 
diet is really worked well for me over
the<00:01:04.559> years<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:06.659> gained<00:01:07.080> any

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
the years I have not gained any

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.440 
the years I have not gained any
unnecessary<00:01:07.710> weight<00:01:08.340> or<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.180> know<00:01:09.299> my

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
unnecessary weight or you know my

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.969 
unnecessary weight or you know my
cholesterol<00:01:09.689> levels<00:01:10.170> always<00:01:10.409> been<00:01:10.560> very<00:01:10.710> low

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
cholesterol levels always been very low

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.120 
cholesterol levels always been very low
and<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:13.560> done<00:01:13.770> well<00:01:13.950> for

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and and so you know it's done well for

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.749 
and and so you know it's done well for
me<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:15.210> many<00:01:15.360> years<00:01:15.899> we've<00:01:16.460> suspected<00:01:17.460> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
me for many years we've suspected that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.300 
me for many years we've suspected that
vegans<00:01:18.149> have<00:01:18.299> lower<00:01:18.539> rates<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:19.049> diabetes<00:01:19.470> or

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
vegans have lower rates of diabetes or

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
vegans have lower rates of diabetes or
that<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> vegan<00:01:20.880> diet<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.270> protective<00:01:21.780> against

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that a vegan diet is protective against

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
that a vegan diet is protective against
diabetes<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:23.310> are<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.580> exactly<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> same

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
diabetes which are not exactly the same

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.440 
diabetes which are not exactly the same
thing<00:01:24.539> to<00:01:24.659> say<00:01:25.100> but<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.880> hadn't<00:01:27.210> tracked

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
thing to say but we hadn't tracked

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
thing to say but we hadn't tracked
vegans<00:01:27.840> over<00:01:28.049> time<00:01:28.289> to<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.520> have

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
vegans over time to see if they have

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
vegans over time to see if they have
lower<00:01:29.819> rates<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.149> diabetes<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:30.899> as<00:01:31.259> a
