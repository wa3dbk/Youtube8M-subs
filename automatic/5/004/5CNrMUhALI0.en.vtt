00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.610
 hey you love me it's your conny and 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:14.089
 today is day two of his fasting course 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.580
 or is just about to end is already 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.450
 it has been dark for some time now 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.320
 just before eight o'clock and I had just left 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:29.050
 a meditation with a rage that is quasi 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.899
 the helper of hillary of us too 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.160
 Coconut has given lessons to ours 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.859
 very interesting man too with very 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.210
 a lot of experience and just like on 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.739
 together just a little bit more 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.579
 meditates and he has me a bit 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.929
 the story is told like that 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.100
 Mankind actually meditation 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:52.550
 two came very interesting 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.659
 day 2 it's still going on 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.370
 pretty good although I am here and 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:03.530
 because little fantasies have what that eat 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.619
 that's just how I sometimes feel 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.829
 Pictures in the head of eg the morning 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.360
 porridge that I miss degree was 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.899
 just things I like only the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.579
 dolls so in mind sometimes it is 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.210
 not so much as the spit in my mouth 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.890
 converges or service just like that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.240
 I know now that I as the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.549
 some things I look forward to 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.719
 I just love everything 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.159
 I think so too because I really do this 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.680
 year 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.479
 since then I am also correct to 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.640
 vegan was and not only pure 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.240
 vegetable food since the beginning of January 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.159
 I 've discovered so much what to eat 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.689
 and to taste and to new ones 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.009
 I might never do that 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.000
 and now suddenly possible 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.130
 and he was scratch that too 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.320
 last weeks and months very much for me 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:02:00.649
 exciting and therefore presumptuous but 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.659
 otherwise it was really good day 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.009
 Insight again, incredibly fast 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.140
 But it is not over 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.220
 Intoxicating it also has a bit 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:14.130
 but it was raining 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.430
 i believe 201 hours even with hilary 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.880
 at noon today on the topic 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.720
 Nutrition also very special what that 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.450
 the topic of proteins and fats and us 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.960
 longer over the stomach and how 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.030
 the things are digested and how about 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.170
 Eating the best combines that 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.590
 for example, a very bad idea 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.120
 it's meat or animal products you 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.750
 anyway will not eat but with the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.250
 for example pasta or rice or something like that 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.930
 Just combine because it's incredible 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.980
 exhausting is for the stomach too 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:58.860
 digest or for me personally 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.990
 interesting was that in the reason than 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.620
 Vegans really on the absolute 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.950
 Safe side, this is all about 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.930
 i talked a lot about sugar and it 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.200
 yes this same simic index clear 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.130
 Basically the sugar index lag is quasi 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.080
 lists how much sugar in the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.880
 different foods and 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.730
 vegetables and so on and dairy products 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.760
 and so is in and how vienna reached 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.480
 they are and it will then become yes 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.630
 from very bad to very good 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.820
 it is there and basically taken to it 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.160
 it is so that the the 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.860
 not so cool things but we all 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.560
 not good or with it 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:51.390
 have grown up just like a lot whiter 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.450
 sugar and of course bread 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.580
 pasta and especially fried things 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.080
 and things like that and of course 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.910
 also dairy products 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.310
 many of them are white so everything 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.830
 which is somehow in the white color 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.049
 is not that horny the colored that is 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.760
 the more valuable it is and the better 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.140
 It is better for the body the less 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.030
 sugar in it or 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.549
 there is still some kind of 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.140
 sugar in it good sugar quasi but just 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.370
 also a lot of nutrients and the same 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.139
 then a little bit out 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.750
 difficult to reproduce everything that way 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.750
 told me everything because it was blatant 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.650
 shelf information was and easy 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.540
 learn a lot and have afterwards 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:41.590
 she read my eyes 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.970
 this is called in English and yes there 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.350
 You can read a lot, I found 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.150
 It's quite interesting because it really is 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.870
 but especially what the diet 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.780
 or does she have a lot? 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.449
 quite a hit on the nail namely 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.410
 that I like too much sugar very much 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.500
 dark chocolate and yes that's all 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.530
 difficult for me to dismiss that though 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:10.139
 I know this is that I should do it 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.190
 and then I like to do it and easy 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.880
 believe in other things too easily 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.770
 can replace 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.570
 but i want quite a little sugar too 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.610
 take me and the other he was me 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.820
 need more green things in the 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:28.539
 mine in my diet and yes me 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.389
 Do not think so much about it 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.860
 think but it is as bad as 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.610
 So, there are just a few 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.580
 moments during the day where i just go 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.310
 only solved but felt in the basics 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.930
 I'm not really hungry then that 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.419
 drink a lot in the most diverse 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.800
 species and forms and the coconut is 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.479
 the absolute highlight or the two 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.050
 We are allowed to drink a day 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.270
 is the highlight and then we have 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:01.320
 To drink another tea this time 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:01.320
 Today it is in the team is also very clear 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.820
 also two bags of it and we have 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.980
 dinner almost take it then 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.940
 Vegetable soup we had before the 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.470
 we are also super awesome but without 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.910
 Something in it but only the brothers 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.080
 also very good and then a bit 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.220
 lime in front of delicious somehow 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.480
 the day is either fast 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.850
 I passed an hour of yoga 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.620
 made my favorite this afternoon 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.900
 I do the special varia clusters 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.550
 jivamukti because you can either 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.170
 what to watch online on youtube or 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.950
 but now I have a lot 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.810
 quite good in shot 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:43.540
 there are pictures or pdfs 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.620
 online just the the ones 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.570
 sequence of us-star steep and start 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.290
 such an hour about three quarters 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.660
 hour and it was just fine I have to 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.950
 also wants to stay alive regularly 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:03.160
 and really every day one 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:06.990
 At least I have to pack it in at least one hour 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:10.690
 still today i was a bit 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:13.450
 a little less active than yesterday 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.580
 or did not make me more active 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.020
 but maybe one more felt 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.720
 little bit of weather just really knows 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.370
 was pretty windy too and in the woods and 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:29.670
 yesterday it was just totally sonic 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:32.260
 and follow blogpost put online and 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.520
 read more below 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.410
 The sun also has a short time 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.580
 Clever as I went in 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.320
 a little bit in the sun law 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:44.290
 to recharge your batteries 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:50.980
 what it looks like from the second day I was passing 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:53.290
 I'm still curious you say yes that 

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:57.880
 already the third fourth day happened 

00:07:53.290 --> 00:08:00.300
 that's why they're the hardest 

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.300
 look 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:07.539
 otherwise I believe something of mine 

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.979
 We will meet again tomorrow 

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:11.400
 and presses my thumb for the 

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:11.400
 third day
