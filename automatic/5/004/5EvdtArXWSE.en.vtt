00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
all about getting on the same page with

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.520 
all about getting on the same page with
the<00:05:47.849> edge<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.210> feel<00:05:48.419> differently<00:05:48.870> if<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.410> have

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
the edge I feel differently if you have

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.680 
the edge I feel differently if you have
really<00:05:49.800> perfect<00:05:50.250> synergy<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.789> do<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.510> same

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
really perfect synergy and do the same

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.800 
really perfect synergy and do the same
stuff<00:05:52.020> at<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.440> exact<00:05:53.370> same<00:05:53.610> time<00:05:53.970> then<00:05:54.330> we<00:05:54.570> can

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
stuff at the exact same time then we can

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.159 
stuff at the exact same time then we can
really<00:05:55.800> eat<00:05:55.979> some<00:05:56.220> tough<00:05:56.970> things<00:05:57.240> afterwards

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
really eat some tough things afterwards

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.570 
really eat some tough things afterwards
and<00:05:59.130> well<00:06:00.020> do<00:06:01.020> you<00:06:01.139> think<00:06:01.169> that<00:06:01.740> these<00:06:02.250> free

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
and well do you think that these free

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.629 
and well do you think that these free
big<00:06:02.760> periods<00:06:03.270> would<00:06:03.539> be<00:06:03.690> enough<00:06:03.930> for<00:06:04.260> you<00:06:04.440> to

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
big periods would be enough for you to

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.589 
big periods would be enough for you to
reach<00:06:05.639> this<00:06:05.970> energy<00:06:07.430> yes<00:06:08.430> that's<00:06:08.700> indeed

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
reach this energy yes that's indeed

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.770 
reach this energy yes that's indeed
possible<00:06:09.960> I<00:06:10.620> mean<00:06:11.190> look<00:06:11.669> at<00:06:11.849> after<00:06:12.150> our<00:06:12.479> last

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
possible I mean look at after our last

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.870 
possible I mean look at after our last
five<00:06:13.110> bootcamp<00:06:13.650> April<00:06:14.070> so<00:06:14.250> much<00:06:14.490> replayed

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
five bootcamp April so much replayed

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.270 
five bootcamp April so much replayed
always<00:06:15.260> aggression<00:06:16.260> upon<00:06:16.590> time<00:06:16.800> we<00:06:16.979> invaded

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
always aggression upon time we invaded

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.270 
always aggression upon time we invaded
the<00:06:17.520> jungle<00:06:18.000> we<00:06:18.539> lived<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.380> pretty<00:06:20.190> much

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
the jungle we lived and pretty much

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.050 
the jungle we lived and pretty much
stumbled<00:06:20.789> out<00:06:20.940> from<00:06:21.150> there<00:06:22.099> well<00:06:23.099> we<00:06:23.849> know

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
stumbled out from there well we know

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.520 
stumbled out from there well we know
that's<00:06:24.330> one<00:06:24.660> of<00:06:24.780> the<00:06:24.870> reasons<00:06:25.169> you<00:06:25.380> were

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
that's one of the reasons you were

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.430 
that's one of the reasons you were
chosen<00:06:26.160> a<00:06:26.400> support<00:06:26.760> layer<00:06:26.940> is<00:06:27.210> that<00:06:27.900> you<00:06:28.169> speak

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
chosen a support layer is that you speak

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.480
