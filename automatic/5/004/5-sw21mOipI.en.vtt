 hello guys even in a recipe one 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.540
 summer recipe is very very fast but 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.210
 lemon panna cotta is really one 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.070
 it will take ten super simple cities 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.910
 minutes to do it just needs to stay in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.590
 fridge to take and want it 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.420
 really three ingredients so it's right 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 a bullshit and above all a recipe 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.670
 fresh then for the summer but more than that 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.710
 well I leave the ingredients immediately and 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.829

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.829
 a kiss to all 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.570
 the ingredients we need for 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.960
 make the panne cooked are 250 g of 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.899
 cream 40 grams of lemon juice 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.990
 filtered with lemon zest 40 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.340
 grams of sugar a sheet of glue of 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.140
 fish and raspberries to decorate the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.909
 choice is very simple we take the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.430
 cream that I already put in the saucepan e 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.159
 we join the sugar we give him one 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:26.330
 turned around so we don't have to put it 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:29.810
 bolide expect it to boil once 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.789
 who abolished shoots we will take the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.409
 lemon juice and when it will be a little 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.479
 cold we wait five minutes 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.520
 add the lemon and the sheet of 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.000
 jelly that we would have already soaked in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.000
 cold water 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.390
 now that the cream is boiling 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.300
 we turn off the cheese we apply from 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:54.380
 fire we live a jelly we add 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:57.770
 the jelly I already want too 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.880
 this one mom today 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.909
 let's turn around well now let's wait for three 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.430
 minutes five minutes water plenty of water 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.830
 hut are only 200 grams wait 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.590
 the time that cools down a little 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.900
 around 50 60 degrees and then there 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.560
 add the last lemon itself with 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.380
 profit, to which the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.650
 grated rind 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.260
 now I have taken these these are in 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.350
 plastic from a country that was yes 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.540
 see he put them on a step said e 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.540
 we think our panna cotta inside 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.590
 and then we'll put it in the fridge 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.170
 it will take at least a couple of hours before 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.170
 to solidify 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.939
 the outside are too many all these 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.330
 so it will be 10 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.160
 until now we put it in the fridge and 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.410
 let's wait for that to solidify 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.190
 Spanish and the recipe is already over but 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.440
 After we left the shops is a 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.350
 couple of hours in the fridge are now 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.700
 solidify as you can see 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.380
 we decorate I chose them for raspberries that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.060
 you can put me I also wanted a themes 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.280
 lemon slice to pick up the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.650
 lemon of the rivers what you want 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.570
 a strawberry so its a thing 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.820
 very simple and since the recipe is 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.770
 really fast no one years ago a hit 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.770
 we put ourselves in the field or in the center 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.020
 maybe with the little ones 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.930
 and here here is the recipe that is 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.720

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.640
