00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
 yes 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.600
 in oscilloscope the menu is selected 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.600
 secondary ignition oscilloscope 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.190
 the adaptation of the secondary circuit is 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.410
 effect through the kv terminals 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.420
 for engines that do not have a 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.610
 ignition cable can be made the 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.750
 registration through a measurement probe 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.320
 universal the kv terminals are divided into 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.579
 two groups a group with black kv terminals 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.519
 - and a group with red kv edges plus 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.409
 when connecting the kv terminals it is necessary 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.839
 take into account the potential for 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.000
 positive ignition voltages and 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.449
 negative ones are not invested in the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.219
 efe monitor s / a for this reason it 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.909
 recommends coming from the following 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.829
 How to start the vehicle kv terminals 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.689
 they connect starting with the first 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.689
 cable in the ignition sequence 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.970
 At the same time it is checked whether in the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.570
 fs monitor the signals are not 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.570
 inverted 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.890
 if after registration there is a signal 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.180
 inverted the terminal kv must be changed 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.120
 by the other color 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.860
 the kv terminals must always be connected 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.360
 so that the signals of the secondary 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.360
 swing up 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.980
 for the assignment of cylinders must 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.840
 put the shooting clip around 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.740
 of the secondary cable of the first 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.140
 center 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.860
 Now you can evaluate the signals 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.860
 of secondary 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.780
 with efe 7 you can adjust the sweep 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.430
 of the horizontal x axis in degrees the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.430
 percentage in milliseconds 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.950
 with efe 8 the adjustment of the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.299
 scale to the voltage curve of 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.299
 lit on the vertical axis 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.970
 with efe 4 you can see different 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.800
 representations of the curves of 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.800
 turned on to analyze the signals 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.850
 or else each of the cylinders in the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.740
 firing order in curves 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.740
 superimposed on the vertical axis 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.580
 or consecutive on the horizontal axis 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.370
 if the signal stops there is 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.130
 possibility of analyzing in detail the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.970
 measured values ​​with efe 7 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.920
 these functions are visualization of the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.790
 secondary voltage curve of the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.790
 saved signal 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.019
 display of the voltage curve of 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.450
 combustion of the secondary signal 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.860
 saved 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.930
 display of the duration curve of 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.470
 combustion of the secondary signal 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.470
 saved 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.700
 There is also the possibility of 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.560
 save a record that can be printed 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.970
 as a test report 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.970
 no no no 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.450
 other analysis options for 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.310
 check the secondary circuit it 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.260
 offer in the test steps of the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.030
 efe software s / a 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.670
 in the secondary on menu 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.340
 full adaptation here are used 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.900
 bar charts the graph of the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.870
 left shows the tension of 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.879
 turning on each cylinder the graph 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.190
 Central shows voltage values 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.650
 of combustion for each cylinder 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.810
 the graph on the right shows the 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.150
 combustion duration in each cylinder 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.950
 to make a comparison you can 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.420
 make measurements with different 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.420
 speeds of revolutions
