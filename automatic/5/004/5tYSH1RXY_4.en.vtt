rhythm<00:00:36.330> basically<00:00:37.330> you<00:00:37.660> guys<00:00:37.810> have<00:00:37.990> noticed

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
rhythm basically you guys have noticed

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.530 
rhythm basically you guys have noticed
probably<00:00:38.680> that<00:00:39.130> I'll<00:00:39.490> mess<00:00:39.850> up<00:00:39.880> on<00:00:40.210> occasion

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
probably that I'll mess up on occasion

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.070 
probably that I'll mess up on occasion
and<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.560> beats<00:00:41.770> don't<00:00:42.040> sound<00:00:42.280> right<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.660> well

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
and the beats don't sound right and well

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.540 
and the beats don't sound right and well
I<00:00:44.230> can<00:00:44.470> give<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.680> three<00:00:44.950> reasons<00:00:44.980> for<00:00:45.430> that

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
I can give you three reasons for that

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.990 
I can give you three reasons for that
one<00:00:46.860> rhythm<00:00:47.860> is<00:00:48.100> not<00:00:48.250> really<00:00:48.490> my<00:00:48.670> strong<00:00:48.910> suit

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
one rhythm is not really my strong suit

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.130 
one rhythm is not really my strong suit
to<00:00:49.330> begin<00:00:49.540> with<00:00:51.000> second<00:00:52.000> reason<00:00:52.120> is<00:00:52.360> well<00:00:52.750> I'm

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
to begin with second reason is well I'm

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.230 
to begin with second reason is well I'm
using<00:00:53.590> an<00:00:53.800> emulator<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.490> for<00:00:54.730> some<00:00:54.910> reason

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
using an emulator and for some reason

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.720 
using an emulator and for some reason
the<00:00:55.360> input<00:00:55.780> between<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:57.310> pressures<00:00:57.640> of

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
the input between the the pressures of

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.060 
the input between the the pressures of
the<00:00:57.820> keys<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.960> actual<00:00:59.230> emulator<00:00:59.680> like

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
the keys and the actual emulator like

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.730 
the keys and the actual emulator like
showing<00:01:00.310> up<00:01:00.460> it's<00:01:01.240> uh<00:01:01.390> it's<00:01:02.170> kind<00:01:02.380> of<00:01:02.440> delayed

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
showing up it's uh it's kind of delayed

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.960 
showing up it's uh it's kind of delayed
it's<00:01:02.950> weird<00:01:03.130> like<00:01:03.280> I'll<00:01:03.400> press<00:01:03.610> it<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.880> then

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
it's weird like I'll press it and then

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.800 
it's weird like I'll press it and then
like<00:01:04.180> half<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.509> second<00:01:04.780> later<00:01:04.930> then<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.670> actual

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
like half a second later then the actual

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.260 
like half a second later then the actual
command<00:01:07.810> will<00:01:08.140> execute<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.219> yeah<00:01:09.759> it's<00:01:10.060> kind

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
command will execute and yeah it's kind

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.330 
command will execute and yeah it's kind
of<00:01:10.329> weird<00:01:10.390> I've<00:01:10.749> looked<00:01:10.990> for<00:01:11.229> ways<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.409> try<00:01:12.249> to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
of weird I've looked for ways to try to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.029 
of weird I've looked for ways to try to
reduce<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.909> but<00:01:13.149> I<00:01:13.179> haven't<00:01:13.450> found<00:01:13.719> anything

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
reduce that but I haven't found anything

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.800 
reduce that but I haven't found anything
third<00:01:15.039> reason<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.670> because<00:01:15.880> I'm<00:01:16.210> playing<00:01:16.659> on

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
third reason is because I'm playing on

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.929 
third reason is because I'm playing on
an<00:01:16.929> emulator<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.619> playing<00:01:18.549> on<00:01:18.640> an<00:01:18.759> emulator

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
an emulator and playing on an emulator

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.749 
an emulator and playing on an emulator
means<00:01:19.479> I'm<00:01:19.630> not<00:01:19.749> playing<00:01:19.929> on<00:01:20.049> a<00:01:20.109> PSP<00:01:20.409> PSP<00:01:21.310> I'd

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
means I'm not playing on a PSP PSP I'd

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.840 
means I'm not playing on a PSP PSP I'd
used<00:01:22.030> my<00:01:22.119> thumb<00:01:22.649> my<00:01:23.649> right<00:01:23.859> thumb<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.310> I'd

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
used my thumb my right thumb and I'd

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.630 
used my thumb my right thumb and I'd
pushed<00:01:25.119> all<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.329> buttons<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.710> now<00:01:27.009> I'm<00:01:27.369> using

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
pushed all the buttons but now I'm using

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.459 
pushed all the buttons but now I'm using
the<00:01:28.030> arrow<00:01:28.270> keys<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.840> I'm<00:01:28.960> using<00:01:29.140> everything

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
the arrow keys that I'm using everything

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.469 
the arrow keys that I'm using everything
but<00:01:29.859> my<00:01:30.009> thumb<00:01:30.280> so<00:01:30.460> it's<00:01:30.609> kind<00:01:30.819> of<00:01:30.909> kind<00:01:31.359> of

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
but my thumb so it's kind of kind of

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.429 
but my thumb so it's kind of kind of
awkward<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:32.170> make<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:33.189> rhythm<00:01:33.490> sometimes<00:01:33.909> but

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
awkward to make the rhythm sometimes but

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.859 
awkward to make the rhythm sometimes but
you<00:01:35.439> got<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> deal<00:01:35.859> with<00:01:36.069> what<00:01:36.249> do<00:01:36.340> you<00:01:36.399> have

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you got a deal with what do you have

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.939 
you got a deal with what do you have
anyway<00:01:38.189> escorting<00:01:39.189> some<00:01:39.460> materials
