00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
 I first cleared of weed 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.660
 from last year's tree trunks 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.940
 Now I will need to cut to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 healthy kidney diseased broken area 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:23.660
 dry which is not visible in this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.039
 year of snow there was very little oh well 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.760
 results are many parables and yet 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.760
 froze 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.100
 delete here is all we have left 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 climbing roses are still shoulders 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.430
 literally not sheltered wintered eat 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.559
 one branch which is very low to the ground i 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.750
 last year did not clean this 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.289
 spring does not try for what order 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.199
 so that we can go now rose 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.059
 climbing 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.890
 root additionally create roots 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:06.439
 and get some seedlings by the fall we 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.439
 for this let's make the grooves 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.710
 grooves such and just do 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:21.920
 cuts ki 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:25.110
 over each kidney are small then 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.189
 laid in the groove and just as well 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.310
 almost as I do with currants 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.920
 and gooseberry 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.770
 when i need such getting lazy 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.130
 as I call seedlings can be like this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.130
 rooting and climbing roses 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.789
 here lashes 1 are laid here we will get 1 2 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 3 4 5 6 6 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:10.030
 Climbing Rose Seedlings Climbing Roses 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.470
 need at the moment in 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.360
 specific care 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.660
 clean well the ground around the bush 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.830
 from vigorous weeds to pour this plot 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:28.720
 lands here on my pieces of land 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.440
 the soil is very poor it is so clayey and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.440
 heavy 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.110
 and bref noise introduces almost like 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.110
 purr and as dressing 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.750
 two-three-tenths of roses of this rose 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.750
 two years 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.040
 the soil is of course poorly rooted neck 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.360
 climbing roses is not scary 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:08.409
 because it will give an extra rose 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:11.370
 roots that will only increase growth and give 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:14.980
 mousse your health 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.230
 what else since spring is here this year 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:24.359
 cold it would be good to feed immediately 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.359
 at the root of our climbing roses to the market 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:40.269
 in 10 days I will repeat the dressing and 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:44.209
 then we put the support to her tie 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:47.709
 whip and on last year's shoulders we 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.709
 get gorgeous flowers
