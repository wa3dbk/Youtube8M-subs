00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 hi everyone feels real if 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.560
 never are you how are you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.180
 a girl who loves jewels you 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.220
 must surely have the same problem 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.260
 that I never know 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.849
 exactly how to store our jewelry 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.500
 how to make it enough 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.269
 beautiful so we can always see them 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.039
 to think of wearing his jewelry there without 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.750
 forget them and they do not finish so 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.670
 lost in the depths of a cupboard 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.320
 So I decided to show you 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.300
 exactly how do I have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 solved this problem by reflecting I 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.970
 I thought it would be great 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.279
 able to put away but more rules liked 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.590
 collar while keeping a look 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 super aesthetic and surfing on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.329
 internet so i found an idea of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.280
 frames that we could hang so 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.000
 we bang on it I told myself that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.559
 it was superb 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 but on the other hand it's not easy to 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.399
 find that kind of thing in France in 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.230
 reality we find them everywhere here at 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.670
 united states i searched for a little more and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.350
 we find them quite often but in 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.789
 France I had never seen so I'm going 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.340
 show you exactly how is this 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.199
 that I created my framework to be able 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.699
 hang but necklace but also my 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.219
 earrings while keeping a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.660
 super and static look so if ever 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.890
 wanted to know exactly how is this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.890
 that I did continue keep watching 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.820
 need a cadre of four to eight 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.010
 small drill doorknobs 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.500
 a glue gun plus the juices of 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.150
 collars of the fabric a pair of scissors from the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.750
 golden paint is a sponge but it's 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.060
 an option 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.110
 and finally you will need some threads 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.420
 metal first step is to make 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.650
 holes through the board of 4 so 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.360
 firstly I'll show you what 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.790
 looks small door handles 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.520
 which I chose so you will need 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.440
 to change the wick of your drill 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.140
 to make sure it's at the right diameter 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.830
 to make holes big enough for 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.770
 you can do it so this is the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.970
 wick of the handle but also not too much 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.200
 small 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.450
 so I'm changing 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.060
 now the wick I removed so the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.310
 wick and I just unscrewed I 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.320
 take a wick of higher caliber and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.440
 I will instead and these three 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.090
 little bit that you see here do not know 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.120
 not how is this called and then 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.670
 I'll just need 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.870
 screw on my drill so I'll hold 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.850
 the black piece and the gray part and I 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.380
 go life is the wick for 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.030
 that she will not move when I 'm in 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.550
 train to drill the hole through the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.230
 board once it's tight I 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.820
 so I can take my drill 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.239
 to be able to make the hole through the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.310
 board 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.670
 so I have more than to press the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.860
 trigger in France and the drill and the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.989
 hole is over I like to check and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.760
 see if ever the hole is big enough 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.520
 that he is not yet big enough 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080
 for handling the grip and I change 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.390
 again the wick to a caliber 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.220
 superior and I continue I redo 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.510
 exactly the same thing I 'm making a hole 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.040
 bigger instead and then I try 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.489
 my wrists to see if ever that 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.489
 works well 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.190
 the step of turning off the 4 and that's 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.690
 something that is optional but 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.030
 I thought it would be great to do 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.750
 that's so I added gilding using 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.880
 of my little sponge and a paint 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.650
 golden so I'm going to apply a little bit of 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.200
 golden paint here on my little sheet 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.660
 of aluminum and using my bridges 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.549
 I will have it stamped by everyone on the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.590
 frame to add some kind of gilding 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.140
 which will give a very special style 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.690
 manca 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.670
 super unique so I continue to 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.750
 apply my gilding and if you ever 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.620
 make them his life any 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.580
 paint color 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.990
 you can also me I chose golden 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.920
 And here's the result 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.360
 Step 3 is cut and glue the fabric 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.050
 here is the fabric that I selected 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.730
 you want so dp so that it 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.590
 do not block these small parts for 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.480
 to be able to close our frame well so 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.540
 I measured up I'm now 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.830
 cutting it and once it 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.180
 will be cut I will be able to take 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.220
 my glue gun and yes 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.610
 actually it's pink and I'm going 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.730
 take my school down the mystical 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.280
 sticks inside the how of the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.400
 gun put some glue on the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.080
 table the board so our frame 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.600
 apply it of course the fabric for 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.340
 easter his mouth when I do the 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.320
 rest of the glue so simply 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.570
 I put some glue on the edge of the 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.450
 cloth as I am trying to get you 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.390
 show now and then I'll have 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.370
 more than to fold to do well but 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.720
 all this and so that the fabric does not move 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.270
 not that they are and well stick to the 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.590
 frame board the small finish 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.240
 finishes by adding a little bit 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.560
 more passes be careful not 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.229
 make packages so that you can 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.940
 put back the 4th step frame classified them 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.100
 wrists so it's very simple it goes 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.600
 have to make holes through the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.310
 tissue where is what has been done 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.740
 the three the drill have here I did 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.570
 a hole with a little needle or 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.580
 this little thing there is something 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.060
 that we use to remove the wires in 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.190
 sewing 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.820
 so it does not matter then I break a 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.650
 bigger hole with so my clip and I 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.900
 simply screw my wrists to 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.380
 through the fabric and through the holes 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.010
 that I did to the drill I saw my 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.120
 four handles and I finished this 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.460
 part of it simple steps it's the door- 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.590
 earrings I decided to name it 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.240
 iron imports earrings on this 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.460
 framework to be able to add more 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.800
 jewels so down the board of my 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.539
 4 I will measure which 4 inches and 5 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.530
 inches ie 8 cm and 10 cm so 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.370
 that's what I'm doing 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.070
 now 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.700
 and then I'll take have all of them 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.780
 yellow metal wires take two 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.250
 and I have the actual measurements that's long 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.110
 so that I can fold them on 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.100
 both sides using forceps Marty 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.590
 so I'm going to close the bar of 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.030
 metal so she does not move she does not 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.670
 not going to be right but it does not matter 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.890
 it adds a style to the frames I like 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.410
 particularly 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:53.150
 I finish with my second so with my 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.660
 second son I'm doing exactly the same 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.750
 thing and we go to step 6 which and the 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.100
 finishes the finishes in fact so I 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.650
 will show you exactly how 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.540
 hang your frame I cut son 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.760
 exactly the same metal though you 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.920
 said just now and I'm going from one 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.860
 rolled at the beginning on both sides 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.690
 outside and then on both 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.610
 inside sides of a door handle 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.290
 games have door handles 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.270
 stay then I put glue dots 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.760
 to secure everything and that it does not 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.720
 not move and here it is the place is this 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.330
 we put the cloud could hang 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.330
 then I take the framework and 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.410
 the frame board I hand the frame to 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.510
 inside so the board to 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.100
 inside the frame and I'm going to finish 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.440
 for easter it moves as we go 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.170
 so apply weight on the frame 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.840
 with glue or I thought the 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.960
 frame and the board of the four sets 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.370
 for that does not move anymore and that's what 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.600
 looks like our frame that is over and 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.910
 look at how much is it 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.320
 super adorable and super aesthetic with 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.320
 our coastal and we claud ears 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.490
 I hope this video has been 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.900
 useful if you ever decided to 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.550
 make your frame do not forget to 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.200
 take a picture and post it on my 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.600
 facebook page so I can see 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.250
 exactly what your map looks like 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.560
 I am curious like that and I want 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.780
 to see your ideas too and turn 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.310
 that your frame took so here I am 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.870
 would like to say my next video up 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.960
 the time for the nancéens do not even have 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.960
 there
