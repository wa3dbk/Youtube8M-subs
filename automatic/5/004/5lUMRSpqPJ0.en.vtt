00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to it's funny out but it says it fans

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209

out<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.050> lashes<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.500> don't<00:00:58.800> think<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
out your lashes I don't think that it

does at all it just clamps them all
together<00:01:02.870> especially<00:01:03.870> because<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> nine

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
together especially because it's a nine

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.340 
together especially because it's a nine
because<00:01:05.010> there's<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.060> Lud's<00:01:06.420> build<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:07.049> in

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
because there's like Lud's build up in

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
because there's like Lud's build up in
this<00:01:07.530> area<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.570> if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.689> touch<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:11.330> slightly<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this area and if you touch it slightly I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.810 
this area and if you touch it slightly I
get<00:01:13.290> clumps<00:01:13.860> everything<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.710> it's<00:01:16.820> really

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
get clumps everything so it's really

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.770 
get clumps everything so it's really
don't<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:19.259> takes<00:01:19.500> air<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> dry

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
don't like it it takes air just to dry

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.800 
don't like it it takes air just to dry
and<00:01:22.909> you<00:01:23.909> can't<00:01:24.119> even<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> bottom

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and you can't even do the bottom

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.660 
and you can't even do the bottom
lashline<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.490> close

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
lashline with it because you just close

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.810 
lashline with it because you just close
your<00:01:26.700> eyes<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.820> imprints

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
your eyes and it like just all imprints

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.420 
your eyes and it like just all imprints
of<00:01:29.939> your<00:01:30.119> lashes<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.840> left<00:01:31.430> underneath

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
of your lashes are just left underneath

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.110 
of your lashes are just left underneath
your<00:01:32.729> eyelid

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:51.090 

I<00:01:37.210> like<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.320> idea<00:01:38.470> of<00:01:38.800> it<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.590> really<00:01:50.620> good

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
I like the idea of it it's a really good

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.200 
I like the idea of it it's a really good
idea<00:01:51.430> but<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:54.180> don't<00:01:55.180> think<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.810> works

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.540 

as<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.080> can<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.470> clumping<00:02:01.830> up<00:02:01.950> even<00:02:02.460> on

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
as you can see it's clumping up even on

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.630 
as you can see it's clumping up even on
there<00:02:02.790> look<00:02:03.890> just<00:02:04.890> clumping<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.400> in<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:07.640> so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
there look just clumping up in that so

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:21.020 
there look just clumping up in that so
you<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.330> imagine<00:02:09.720> putting<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:20.730> when<00:02:20.940> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
you you imagine putting that in when you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.590 
you you imagine putting that in when you
wipe<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.420> down<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:23.090> close<00:02:26.450> did<00:02:27.450> some
