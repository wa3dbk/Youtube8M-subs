00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 it is 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.880
 Wow 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.369
 now we of the mec and lack of leadership and 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.590
 here is another video the video a little 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.330
 fast and first of all for those who are already 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.540
 in our dna a river again no no 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.640
 I died again, taking a week and more. 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.380
 The video I mentioned to you knows 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.690
 past that will be a series with the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.820
 My friend that she started playing 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.890
 You can also and I 'm coming back to play. 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.330
 Then I'll do a series with 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.160
 she does not know how many times a week she goes 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.890
 be the next to leave playing with her 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.390
 basically going to be scolding for help 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.940
 code in my case her case is 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.980
 learning to play then I can 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.540
 talking some things to her like 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.760
 of these things you can use as 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.050
 tip also type of fame movement 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.149
 here comes me here for that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.230
 kill them kill the enemy but do not see that 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.820
 kill the enemies 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.550
 so I'll work more or less like this 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.770
 You can watch the video with another 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.390
 I hope not to have fun if 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.789
 can try to watch the video for the purpose 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.740
 to learn then who is a beginner 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:13.539
 no code this series of relearn to play 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.270
 My god is going to be very useful and can 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.350
 end up getting better with these mini tips 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.990
 that I will give during the video but the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.720
 main intention and if it is delivered 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.550
 playing with her gives a laugh her has to 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.229
 relearn how to play code 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.780
 See the name of the series, but that's it. 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.490
 video here is to ask a favor to 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.530
 You to everyone who saw 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.190
 this video as you know I already 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.899
 i mentioned 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.940
 I'm tired of mentioning that you're in 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.679
 third year and my third year is 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.170
 different from the third year of 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.729
 because you generally have the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.179
 matter of the first sec- 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.880
 third is my college is the system of 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.950
 angle and I do not know if it is observed by all 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.899
 the years at least in that college he 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.530
 divided the matter of the three years into two 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.239
 years 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.800
 so in the first year I had the subject of a 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:02.289
 year and a half and in the second year of 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.119
 a year and a half and in the third I have 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.450
 kind of a coursework then a 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.209
 reviewed in all material evidence 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.790
 proof to make the photo review 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.860
 review review says a summary summarized 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.300
 that's how the third works, so it's 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.730
 very pulled 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.180
 but it's 100% to get you through 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.980
 Vestibular and everything and my college and 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.709
 adopted one thing that colleges 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.370
 generally assume that the work of 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.349
 conclusion 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.510
 course for those who do not know a job 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.650
 that you usually do in the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.260
 last year of any course is the semester 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.480
 in case I do not know but in my case one year 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.269
 that you choose at least in college 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.239
 you choose a theme is a free theme 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.860
 but it has to be well directed. 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.409
 so I'll give some examples of people 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.680
 who are in my college, one of them is 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.030
 a psc will be the third my friend is 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.540
 to give you an idea of how 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.209
 it works 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.049
 this is my friend and will if on the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.879
 trafficking in marijuana and tobacco 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.480
 brazil and paraguay border 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:10.420
 This is his tcc. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.519
 alternative cancer treatments 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.280
 then you will not only get treatment 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.890
 not having support then going to cover is more 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.720
 everything but this is another focus will have another 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.099
 who talk about the inclusion of children 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.079
 with Down Syndrome in Colleges 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:31.299
 theoretically both the normal word but 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:33.669
 is no hit it colleges 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.569
 without saying how it works. 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:41.669
 inclusion and my tcc verse about is the 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:45.099
 relation to literary adaptations of 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.950
 this is fantastic adaptations 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.459
 in the movies so 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.040
 do not be too controversial because I do not 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.310
 wanted to make a controversial theme go 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.870
 to cover is everywhere only when you see 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.129
 a movie said our book is very 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.310
 the better it will treat all these differences 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.900
 of movie book but not only the question of 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.209
 talk the book better than the movie because 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.530
 the tc is not about what you have a 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.599
 opinion for you to give an opinion 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.790
 for you to do in facts then 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.019
 will be facts to the time it takes to 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.150
 writing a book has to go there to 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.160
 make a movie the whole budget it takes 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.099
 to make a movie all the time that 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.150
 you have available within a movie 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.990
 so I'm working with the part 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.699
 fantastic I'm not sure but the three 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.479
 main will be harry potter 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.700
 obviously lord of the most hobbit rings 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.039
 and game of thrones that will get the part 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.630
 to show here is also good to see a 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.330
 serial because 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.520
 There are many more episodes you have a lot 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.890
 more time to cover a book then 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.130
 for example the game of thrones the first 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.780
 book game of thrones is from the chronicles of 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.660
 fire and ice first book has its side 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.460
 more than 700 pages and this 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.010
 has transformed into ten episodes and even 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.530
 so it did not have several holes in history 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.390
 so I'll get all the parts of the tc and 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.190
 because I need your help 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.880
 they must be asking themselves 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.980
 It was also qat down below that I go 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.870
 do are two polls one of movies 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.940
 What movies and serials do you already 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.380
 had voted on a multiple list 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.910
 choose then you can dial in time 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.730
 As much as you want 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.490
 and the other will be books you've already 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.020
 have also read multiple choice 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.120
 schema because I'm going to need to use this 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.420
 based on my third make a 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.800
 too graphic and everything looks cute 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.950
 I'm going to make this chart and I'm going to 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.060
 based on your response to set up and 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.470
 to talk and it's the people these days I 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.180
 imagine that you are more or less 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.560
 age a little less a little to 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.880
 more because I know there are already people 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.700
 I've already graduated, I know there are people 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.820
 still did not enter high school is not 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:55.090
 based on responses from you is to 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:58.500
 able to improve my work for 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.110
 to have more say has more facts about 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.540
 with people watching more movies or less 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.580
 we had in relation to books and then 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.170
 who knows, does other poll asks 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.540
 opinion etc 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.150
 But this time, the main card will go 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.520
 so it's in the description then it's please 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.820
 vote because I've been over 200 people 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.100
 already an immense participation of you and me 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.510
 pardon for this video has been neither 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.790
 related to the code but it's because I'm 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.490
 I want to take you on the third a 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.500
 Seriously and my tcc is serious and any 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.120
 You doubt about tc 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.100
 about how the scheme works if the 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.080
 code you have do not let us 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.770
 comments or interact with you 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.600

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.200
 they discuss reading the books that you 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.390
 do you think my job will work? 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.890
 mostly about game of thrones 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.700

 I do not know how it's going to stay, but this. 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.940

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.460
 You see, I really do not know what 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.760
 I'll leave it to the bottom so forgive me 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.290
 but that's going to have the new series tomorrow 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.720
