00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 On yesterday's news we showed you a stolen truck 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 which was found through the OnLine system. 

10:00:01.000 --> 10:00:05.000
 ONLINE CONTROL SYSTEM Our system has enabled us to find a truck in the Portuguese city of Guarda. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 The TV house SIC NEWS went to the company providing the service 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 to the end user, so they have complete information on where their vehicle is located. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Artur Falacho, the transport company owner, did not expect such a situation 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 but with the assistance of a vehicle tracking service is possible 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 to track the movement of trucks from the place of the gunfight - Guarde - 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 all the way to the city of Chaves, where he was - or his statement - the police 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 he found a truck with a still-loaded trailer inside the warehouse. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 After the truck was stolen, 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 the thief entered the A24 motorway 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 and abandoned the highway at the city of Chavez, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 as you can see the blue line, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 and now I swipe so you can see the warehouse 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 where the WebEye system showed us the vehicle 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 and the movements the vehicle did. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 As we have the ability to control the user's page, 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 in one or two minutes we can see where the vehicle is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 and assisting the client in such exceptional moments. 

10:00:50.000 --> 10:00:55.000
 ONLINE CONTROL SYSTEM The system followed a vehicle from Guard to Chavez. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 We found a vehicle almost 300 km away from his place of disappearance. 

10:01:11.000 --> 10:01:15.000
 CARLOS MENDEZ WebEye Iberica 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 The WebEye system is installed in a safe place 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 and with the help of GPS and GPRS signals it is possible 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 track all types of vehicles. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 The WebEye system costs between 199.00 and 1.500,00 EUR, 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 and the cost depends solely on the user's needs 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 while the cost of one month per vehicle is between 20,00 and 50,00 EUR. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 With the help of the map, you can see some vehicles in Europe 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 and WebEye serves over 25,000 vehicle users, 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 and even technicians can track the vehicles. 

10:01:25.000 --> 10:01:30.000
 ONLINE CONTROL SYSTEM The WebEye system costs between 199.00 and 1.500,00 EUR, 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 The system enables each user to view more information 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 about the requested vehicle or driver. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is also possible to send or receive a text message 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 using our PNA system and in this way with all these tools we help the user 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 optimize his fleet of vehicles with great savings. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 In this case, David drives to the south 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 the Tejo River and every 15 seconds the vehicle is online 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 in the WebEye Vehicle Tracking System. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Every time a user arrives, he can send a message, 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 showing that he arrived, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 not telling where but on the map 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 you can see his last position. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 The system shows exactly where it is 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 and we can find it in that way. This is a very important tool 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 which enables us 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 such situations are solved in a much easier way. In this case, the vehicle was stolen in the town of Guardi, 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 and the end price had a happy ending (but not for thieves). 

10:02:25.000 --> 10:02:30.000
