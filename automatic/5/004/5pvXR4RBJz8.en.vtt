00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.809
 I will achieve it 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.809
 and then I remember 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.189
 at the time of closing last game all 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189
 outside 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.630
 my name is breaking, I've been doing it for 30 years 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 this 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.300
 and it's hard to enjoy your work when 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.300
 nobody else likes what you do 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.949
 it must be good that to be the good 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.040
 many real thanks as bad as we are 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.170
 all that we understand is dave and I am a 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.239
 bad 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.190
 ralph you are human but that is not 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.190
 it means that you are wrong you understand 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.100
 they are justice that the labels do not give you 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.100
 the happiness 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.469
 I do not want to continue 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.469
 It is evil 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.270
 ralph has abandoned his game 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.270
 and the one that breaks everything 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:38.090
 to change where it is to be expected as 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.790
 they talk about these little birds 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.600
 and in the long run the royal colony has 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.600
 gone to subtle turn 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.340
 changing of good because a lot of people 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.340
 best 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 break 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.070
 and you because in this impertinent mega 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.200
 threats you stop playing at the houses and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.190
 we are going to give them cane since when 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.700
 video games are slow 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.040
 I try to be nice you are imitating 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.840
 imitating is a rude and this 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.840
 conversation will end every mind 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.060
 and in your civilians
