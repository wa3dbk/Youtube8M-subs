 Welcome to the Chinese View, I am Ben, I heard that last time someone challenged me to eat rotten tofu. 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 Come on, enjoying the rotten tofu is great, how can it be called a challenge? 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.070
 Anyway, because of this challenge, I also visited the Ningxia night market in Taipei to enjoy a very popular Taiwanese snack. 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.770
 Brother, can I have a rotten tofu, thank you. 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.310
 How much do you want to fry? 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.050
 8 parts frying is okay, crispy in soft, a little more vegetables, a little chili sauce 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.580
 Please wait a moment 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.150
 Thank you 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:53.330
 There is another task to challenge me is to clean up the beach in Taiwan, hoping everyone is interested in this activity. This time I went to Taiwan and didn't have a chance to go to the Y Lan area to pick up the trash, but next time I will definitely come to this place to complete the challenge. 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.640
 Oh, rotten tofu is here, thanks 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.620
 What's the best rotten tofu with the drink, I recommend that people use it with drinks made from tofu. 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.630
 Sorry, give me a cup of Vinh Hop bean milk 2014. I wait a bit. OK 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.800
 The intense flavor of soybeans, blended with a fabulous, banana flavor 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:08.140
 Okay, next I will challenge 3 people to introduce Taiwanese cuisine, two of which we interviewed last time, Mr. Quang Nguyen and Mr. Black Bear from Taiwan Tourism Department 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.380
 The third person we usually watch her show, Janet (Dza-sharp). Hope everyone accepts this challenge, to promote Taiwanese cuisine. 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:26.360
 Although the pressure is great, you only have 24 hours to complete the challenge, but we have a lifetime to enjoy Taiwanese cuisine. 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.660
 Stop here today, see you guys next time.
