00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
little plastic device that will change

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.959 
little plastic device that will change
colors<00:00:10.349> it's<00:00:10.530> kind<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.830> neat<00:00:11.040> neat<00:00:11.700> color

change<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.540> does

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
change that it does

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.930 
change that it does
and<00:00:13.139> it'll<00:00:13.530> project<00:00:14.009> these<00:00:14.130> stars<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> top

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and it'll project these stars on the top

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.840 
and it'll project these stars on the top
here<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:16.080> your<00:00:16.440> ceiling<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:17.190> your<00:00:17.310> baby<00:00:17.730> to

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
that bright and I don't know if that's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.509 
that bright and I don't know if that's
on<00:00:23.010> purpose<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.900> lack<00:00:25.170> of

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
on purpose or if it's just a lack of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.589 
on purpose or if it's just a lack of
intensity<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> bulb<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.269> does<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
intensity on the bulb it does have a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.720 
intensity on the bulb it does have a
nice<00:00:27.859> does<00:00:28.859> look<00:00:29.039> nice<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.369> you're<00:00:29.490> looking

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730

nice does look nice and you're looking
at<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> projector<00:00:30.300> itself<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.740> stars

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
at the projector itself but the stars

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
at the projector itself but the stars
really<00:00:32.279> aren't<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> pronounced<00:00:33.450> when

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
really aren't all that pronounced when

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.990 
really aren't all that pronounced when
they<00:00:33.840> project<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.410> onto<00:00:34.800> your<00:00:34.980> ceiling<00:00:35.790> but

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
they project up onto your ceiling but

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.729 
they project up onto your ceiling but
again<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> don't<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> design

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
again I don't know if that was a design

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.569 
again I don't know if that was a design
decision<00:00:37.920> or<00:00:38.250> not

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
decision or not

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
some white noise sounds as it cycles

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.819

that<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.610> doesn't<00:01:08.760> project<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.450> well<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that it doesn't project that well on the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
little stuffed animal that's velcro to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.359 
little stuffed animal that's velcro to
it<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:18.049> this<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.380> velcro<00:01:19.770> pad<00:01:20.220> on

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it so you have this little velcro pad on

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
it so you have this little velcro pad on
his<00:01:20.520> butt<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.240> attach<00:01:21.720> them<00:01:21.900> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
his butt and you just attach them to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.929 
his butt and you just attach them to
that<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.070> small<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.759> may

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that it is a little small so you may

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.390 
that it is a little small so you may
want<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.299> careful<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:25.220> little<00:01:26.220> one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
want to be careful about little one

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
want to be careful about little one
having<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.150> yeah<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
having it but yeah I think this is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.179 
having it but yeah I think this is
designed<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> sit<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
designed to kind of sit on the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.800 
designed to kind of sit on the
nightstand<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.970> looked<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.689> than
