00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.060
 connect mobile phone to computer 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.660
 because this question you ask me 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.440
 most often for this we need 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.640
 cord 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.470
 minijack with one and the other a 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.750
 also charging 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.010
 because in the process of recording the battery 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.840
 the phone sits down 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.320
 fast minijack should be stereo 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.559
 with two stripes on the very jacky mind well 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.550
 cord one strip out take we take out 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.969
 headphone 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.629
 phone and connect the line input 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:49.820
 computer we try to sound good 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:52.340
 let's take it and take its peak 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.670
 farther 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:04.379
 hi-hat okay so now the drums 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:10.429
 normal sound will suit you like this 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.429
 pager bass let's take it too 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.480
 some solo instrument to us 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.040
 need 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:30.520
 bill let's 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:34.600
 and you take the synthetic sound of it too 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.300
 so any sound effect 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.560
 for example this one 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:49.870
 so now let's try to write 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.870
 set the pace include click and go 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:55.860
 then you can try to write 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.860
 voice to improvise something like that 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.310
 he 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.690
 well that's all good luck for now
