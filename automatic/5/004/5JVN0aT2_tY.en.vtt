hi<00:00:00.900> guys<00:00:01.199> today<00:00:01.620> we're<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.460> be<00:00:02.580> making

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hi guys today we're going to be making

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.940 
hi guys today we're going to be making
some<00:00:03.270> simple<00:00:03.480> waffle<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.319> ice<00:00:04.470> cream<00:00:04.740> cone

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
some simple waffle and ice cream cone

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.020 
some simple waffle and ice cream cone
molds<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.850> hope<00:00:06.270> you'll<00:00:06.420> find<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.839> useful

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
molds so hope you'll find it useful

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.580 
molds so hope you'll find it useful
probably<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.179> easiest<00:00:09.599> way<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.809> make<00:00:10.139> an<00:00:10.290> evil

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
probably the easiest way to make an evil

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.770 
probably the easiest way to make an evil
waffle<00:00:10.980> mold<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.429> by<00:00:11.670> pressing<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.179> grid<00:00:12.420> like

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
waffle mold is by pressing a grid like

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.379 
waffle mold is by pressing a grid like
this<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:13.290> onto<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> sheet<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> clay<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
this one onto a sheet of clay the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.570 
this one onto a sheet of clay the
disadvantage<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.590> method<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.340> you

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
disadvantage of this method is that you

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.429 
disadvantage of this method is that you
can't<00:00:17.850> vary<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.330> size<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> squares<00:00:19.199> to

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
can't vary the size of the squares to

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:34.450 
can't vary the size of the squares to
adjust<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.130> different<00:00:20.279> sized<00:00:20.699> projects

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.790 

another<00:00:35.239> great<00:00:35.540> way<00:00:35.780> is<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:36.230> use<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.559> blunt

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
another great way is to use the blunt

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.490 
another great way is to use the blunt
side<00:00:37.100> of<00:00:37.309> a<00:00:37.399> blade<00:00:37.670> or<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:37.969> much<00:00:38.360> safer<00:00:38.750> plastic

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500

straight<00:00:42.170> as<00:00:42.410> possible<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:43.129> achieve<00:00:43.280> neater

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
straight as possible to achieve neater

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:54.200

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.180 

some<00:00:55.210> metal<00:00:55.629> tools<00:00:55.899> have<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.199> similar<00:00:56.649> texture

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
some metal tools have a similar texture

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.310 
some metal tools have a similar texture
that<00:00:57.339> can<00:00:57.460> also<00:00:57.670> be<00:00:57.820> useful<00:00:58.179> although<00:00:59.170> the

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
that can also be useful although the

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.319 
that can also be useful although the
size<00:00:59.589> of<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.890> pattern<00:01:00.129> may<00:01:00.519> not<00:01:00.730> be<00:01:00.879> suitable

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
size of the pattern may not be suitable

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.719 
size of the pattern may not be suitable
for<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.690> scale<00:01:02.050> you're<00:01:02.260> working<00:01:02.739> in<00:01:02.890> this

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
for the scale you're working in this

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.030 
for the scale you're working in this
method<00:01:04.059> should<00:01:04.570> be<00:01:04.629> used<00:01:04.930> directly<00:01:05.170> onto<00:01:05.770> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
method should be used directly onto the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.230 
method should be used directly onto the
clay<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.310> want<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.850> pattern<00:01:07.060> on

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.780 

the<00:01:10.990> great<00:01:11.229> advantage<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:12.070> using<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.460> car-door

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
the great advantage of using a car-door

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.420 
the great advantage of using a car-door
blade<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:14.079> you<00:01:14.140> can<00:01:14.320> control<00:01:14.740> not<00:01:14.979> only<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
blade so you can control not only the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.130 
blade so you can control not only the
size<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.970> squares<00:01:16.329> to<00:01:16.570> adjust<00:01:16.960> them<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
size of the squares to adjust them to

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.560 
size of the squares to adjust them to
your<00:01:17.290> needs<00:01:17.530> but<00:01:18.220> also<00:01:18.610> change<00:01:18.909> their<00:01:19.149> angle

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
your needs but also change their angle

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:41.940 
your needs but also change their angle
to<00:01:19.780> achieve<00:01:20.049> a<00:01:20.080> different<00:01:20.290> effect

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.320 

you<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.130> make<00:01:43.310> them<00:01:43.490> as<00:01:43.610> big<00:01:43.850> or<00:01:44.000> as<00:01:44.090> small<00:01:44.270> as

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
you can make them as big or as small as

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.210 
you can make them as big or as small as
you<00:01:44.600> want<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.110> if<00:01:45.500> you'd<00:01:45.650> like<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:46.010> create

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
more space between your squared pattern

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.260 
more space between your squared pattern
you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.770> wiggle<00:01:49.130> your<00:01:49.280> blade<00:01:49.520> or<00:01:49.730> card<00:01:50.030> in
