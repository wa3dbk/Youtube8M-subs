 as the prosecutor had indicated 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.919

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 precisely because the dogs that have 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.519

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.949
 back we're seeing staff from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.379

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.479
 they have put stairs and ropes and for 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.239
 middle of these two tools then 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.879

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.489

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.800
 look like the moles have given them this 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.110
