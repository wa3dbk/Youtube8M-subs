00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.030 

some<00:00:01.480> of<00:00:01.599> the<00:00:01.750> examples<00:00:02.290> of<00:00:02.440> sweet<00:00:02.679> picking

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.040 
some of the examples of sweet picking

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.180 
some of the examples of sweet picking
that<00:00:03.159> I<00:00:03.190> do<00:00:03.310> are<00:00:04.290> pretty<00:00:05.290> basic<00:00:05.470> actually<00:00:06.040> but

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.190 
that I do are pretty basic actually but

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.499 
that I do are pretty basic actually but
I<00:00:06.220> like<00:00:06.370> to<00:00:06.490> change<00:00:06.670> things<00:00:06.970> up<00:00:07.150> a<00:00:07.270> little<00:00:07.390> bit

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
I like to change things up a little bit

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.970 
I like to change things up a little bit
to<00:00:08.139> make<00:00:08.290> them<00:00:08.380> a<00:00:08.440> little<00:00:08.559> bit<00:00:08.830> more

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
to make them a little bit more

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.409 
to make them a little bit more
interesting<00:00:09.490> so<00:00:09.730> if<00:00:09.849> we<00:00:09.999> were<00:00:10.089> using<00:00:10.120> an

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:10.419 
interesting so if we were using an

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:20.109 
interesting so if we were using an
arpeggio<00:00:10.809> like<00:00:11.679> this

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.040 

there's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.180> lot<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.420> things<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.720> could<00:00:21.810> really

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
there's a lot of things you could really

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.170 
there's a lot of things you could really
do<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.650> um<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.849> of<00:00:23.880> those<00:00:24.029> in

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
do with that um one of those in

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.330 
do with that um one of those in
particular<00:00:24.360> would<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.900> something<00:00:25.110> like<00:00:25.230> this

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.700 

and<00:00:34.630> up<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:35.840> speed<00:00:36.079> it<00:00:36.230> would<00:00:36.260> sound<00:00:36.470> like<00:00:36.590> this

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
and up to speed it would sound like this

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.420 
and up to speed it would sound like this
and<00:00:41.470> you<00:00:42.470> can<00:00:42.620> take<00:00:42.770> that<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.129> move<00:00:43.309> that

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
and you can take that and move that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.710 
and you can take that and move that
around<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.850> neck<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.030> little<00:00:44.150> bit<00:00:44.449> to<00:00:44.570> make<00:00:44.690> it

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
around the neck a little bit to make it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.240 
around the neck a little bit to make it
even<00:00:44.989> more<00:00:45.110> interesting<00:00:45.320> or<00:00:45.739> just<00:00:45.770> use<00:00:46.040> it<00:00:46.070> as

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
even more interesting or just use it as

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.729 
even more interesting or just use it as
a<00:00:46.280> warm<00:00:46.550> up<00:00:46.699> for<00:00:46.730> your<00:00:46.940> arpeggio<00:00:47.629> use<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.230> it

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
a warm up for your arpeggio use so it

00:00:48.739 --> 00:01:25.950 
a warm up for your arpeggio use so it
would<00:00:48.860> sound<00:00:49.010> like<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:49.339> slow

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.840 

one<00:01:26.650> of<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.830> things<00:01:27.040> in<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.310> bottom<00:01:27.580> part<00:01:27.790> of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
one of the things in the bottom part of

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.130 
one of the things in the bottom part of
the<00:01:27.910> arpeggio<00:01:28.390> which<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.720> actually<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
the arpeggio which is actually the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.840 
the arpeggio which is actually the
hardest<00:01:29.440> part<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.830> playing<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.490> you're

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
hardest part of a playing it is you're

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.670 
hardest part of a playing it is you're
actually<00:01:31.180> switching<00:01:31.870> up<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.080> little<00:01:32.290> bit<00:01:32.470> so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
actually switching up a little bit so

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:41.270 
actually switching up a little bit so
when<00:01:32.800> you're<00:01:32.920> going<00:01:33.040> from

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.700 

you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.260 

it's<00:01:44.710> probably<00:01:44.950> wise<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.610> spend<00:01:45.880> some<00:01:46.030> time<00:01:46.240> on

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
it's probably wise to spend some time on

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.700 
it's probably wise to spend some time on
that<00:01:46.509> bottom<00:01:46.840> one<00:01:46.869> just<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.259> really<00:01:47.470> get<00:01:47.619> that

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
that bottom one just to really get that

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.950 
that bottom one just to really get that
smoothed<00:01:48.100> out<00:01:48.340> until<00:01:49.329> it's<00:01:49.509> comfortable<00:01:49.720> for

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
smoothed out until it's comfortable for

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.250 
smoothed out until it's comfortable for
you<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.290> play<00:01:50.500> so

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.730 

I'm<00:01:55.380> down<00:01:55.650> there

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.719 

and<00:02:02.740> once<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.009> get<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.219> down<00:02:03.310> smooth<00:02:03.609> it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
and once you get it down smooth it

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:27.990 
and once you get it down smooth it
sounds<00:02:03.939> really<00:02:04.240> really<00:02:04.420> cool

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.050 

you<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.180> also<00:02:29.330> add<00:02:30.580> tapping<00:02:31.580> stuff<00:02:31.820> if<00:02:31.940> you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
you can also add tapping stuff if you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.790 
you can also add tapping stuff if you
want<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.390> with<00:02:32.600> slides<00:02:32.960> as<00:02:33.170> well<00:02:33.320> which<00:02:33.560> makes

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
want to with slides as well which makes

00:02:33.800 --> 00:03:09.800 
want to with slides as well which makes
it<00:02:33.980> sound<00:02:34.100> really<00:02:34.460> cool<00:02:37.960> things<00:02:38.960> like<00:02:39.170> that

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.449 

so<00:03:10.810> actually<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.170> was<00:03:11.319> going<00:03:11.590> down<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
so actually I was going down to the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.420 
so actually I was going down to the
whole<00:03:12.610> whole<00:03:13.180> part<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.629> air<00:03:13.780> pedi<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
whole whole part of the air pedi on the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:47.220 
whole whole part of the air pedi on the
top

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.330 

alright<00:03:48.230> well<00:03:48.349> here's<00:03:48.590> another<00:03:48.650> really<00:03:49.159> cool

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
alright well here's another really cool

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.119 
alright well here's another really cool
riff<00:03:49.870> diminished<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:51.049> course<00:03:51.319> again<00:03:51.739> one<00:03:52.099> of

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
riff diminished of course again one of

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.809 
riff diminished of course again one of
my<00:03:52.280> favorites

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
my favorites

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.000 
my favorites
that's<00:03:53.360> got<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.569> lot<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.780> cool<00:03:54.200> try<00:03:54.440> tones<00:03:54.709> in<00:03:54.920> it

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
that's got a lot of cool try tones in it

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.220 
that's got a lot of cool try tones in it
and<00:03:55.220> it's<00:03:55.700> basically<00:03:56.030> just<00:03:56.150> going<00:03:56.360> for<00:03:56.900> three

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
and it's basically just going for three

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.289 
and it's basically just going for three
one<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:58.540> vice<00:03:59.540> versa<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:02.060> it's<00:04:02.239> like

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
one a vice versa to that so it's like

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.390 
one a vice versa to that so it's like
diminished<00:04:03.260> here<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.709> then<00:04:03.829> I<00:04:04.040> guess<00:04:04.370> that

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
diminished here and then I guess that

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.539 
diminished here and then I guess that
would<00:04:04.609> be<00:04:04.700> augmented<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:06.560> then<00:04:06.859> you're<00:04:07.280> going

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
would be augmented and then you're going

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.750 
would be augmented and then you're going
for<00:04:07.849> two<00:04:08.120> one<00:04:08.359> four<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.500> one<00:04:09.680> vice<00:04:10.340> versa<00:04:10.609> on

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
for two one four to one vice versa on

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.339 
for two one four to one vice versa on
that<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:11.359> you're<00:04:11.540> getting<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.840> sound<00:04:12.049> that's

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
that so you're getting a sound that's

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.610 
that so you're getting a sound that's
sounds<00:04:13.040> like<00:04:13.159> this<00:04:13.340> with<00:04:14.060> all<00:04:14.359> up<00:04:15.079> picks<00:04:15.349> and

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
sounds like this with all up picks and

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:27.730 
sounds like this with all up picks and
then<00:04:15.769> all<00:04:15.980> down<00:04:16.190> picks

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.490 

and<00:04:28.850> then<00:04:29.850> you<00:04:30.240> can<00:04:30.389> go<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.720> shape<00:04:30.930> here

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
and then you can go to the shape here

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:39.440 
and then you can go to the shape here
for<00:04:32.100> two<00:04:32.280> one

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.330 

and<00:04:40.080> then<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:40.350> just<00:04:40.530> take<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> whole<00:04:40.830> riff<00:04:41.130> down

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
and then I just take the whole riff down

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.870 
and then I just take the whole riff down
one<00:04:41.580> half<00:04:41.760> step<00:04:42.440> school<00:04:43.440> kind<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.710> feel<00:04:44.070> kind

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
one half step school kind of feel kind

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.530 
one half step school kind of feel kind
of<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.000> classical<00:04:45.450> violin<00:04:45.840> thing<00:04:46.080> or<00:04:46.200> something

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.090 

that<00:04:54.540> would<00:04:54.630> sound<00:04:54.870> like<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.200> up<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.440> speed

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:11.070 

Oh

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.050 

and<00:05:11.830> as<00:05:12.009> you<00:05:12.099> kind<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.340> noticed<00:05:12.639> I<00:05:12.729> kind<00:05:12.970> of

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
and as you kind of noticed I kind of

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.430 
and as you kind of noticed I kind of
sped<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.449> look<00:05:13.629> up<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:13.930> then<00:05:14.020> slowed<00:05:14.259> it<00:05:14.409> down

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
sped the look up and then slowed it down

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.659 
sped the look up and then slowed it down
that's<00:05:14.710> also<00:05:15.039> a<00:05:15.069> good<00:05:15.220> way<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.430> really

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
that's also a good way to really

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.689 
that's also a good way to really
practice<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.569> by<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.199> kind<00:05:17.590> of<00:05:17.770> slowly

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
practice it by just kind of slowly

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.640 
practice it by just kind of slowly
slowing<00:05:19.389> it<00:05:19.479> down<00:05:19.509> and<00:05:19.659> bringing<00:05:20.409> it<00:05:20.500> back<00:05:20.590> up

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
slowing it down and bringing it back up

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:39.580 
slowing it down and bringing it back up
to<00:05:20.919> speed

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.870 

then<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.680> can<00:05:40.830> take<00:05:40.950> the<00:05:41.130> diminishe<00:05:41.490> part<00:05:41.760> of

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
then you can take the diminishe part of

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.580 
then you can take the diminishe part of
it<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.210> just<00:05:42.390> really<00:05:42.780> roll<00:05:42.930> with<00:05:43.110> that<00:05:43.230> to<00:05:43.500> to

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
it and just really roll with that to to

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.770 
it and just really roll with that to to
make<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:43.830> sound<00:05:44.010> cool<00:05:44.250> I'm<00:05:44.580> still<00:05:45.480> getting<00:05:45.720> a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
make it sound cool I'm still getting a

00:05:45.780 --> 00:06:15.860 
make it sound cool I'm still getting a
sound<00:05:46.020> kind<00:05:46.260> of<00:05:46.290> like

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.450 

so<00:06:16.870> what<00:06:17.020> I'm<00:06:17.110> playing<00:06:17.290> the<00:06:17.740> diminished<00:06:18.190> rift

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
so what I'm playing the diminished rift

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.530 
so what I'm playing the diminished rift
very<00:06:18.640> very<00:06:18.880> slow

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
very very slow

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.910 
very very slow
you<00:06:19.630> can<00:06:19.780> almost<00:06:20.050> kind<00:06:20.230> of<00:06:20.260> tell<00:06:20.470> in<00:06:20.620> my<00:06:20.710> right

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
you can almost kind of tell in my right

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.280 
you can almost kind of tell in my right
hand<00:06:21.100> how<00:06:21.400> I'm<00:06:21.520> really<00:06:22.300> doing<00:06:22.930> separate

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
hand how I'm really doing separate

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.890 
hand how I'm really doing separate
picking<00:06:23.710> from<00:06:24.250> each<00:06:24.430> individual<00:06:25.300> note<00:06:25.570> some

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
picking from each individual note some

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.300 
picking from each individual note some
clothes

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.840 

this<00:06:31.880> slowly<00:06:32.180> progress<00:06:32.390> is<00:06:32.780> getting<00:06:33.170> faster

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
this slowly progress is getting faster

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.160 
this slowly progress is getting faster
kind<00:06:34.850> of<00:06:34.940> starts<00:06:35.240> turning<00:06:35.480> into<00:06:35.600> a<00:06:35.810> sweet

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
kind of starts turning into a sweet

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:43.210 
kind of starts turning into a sweet
that's<00:06:36.980> more<00:06:37.220> of<00:06:37.310> a<00:06:37.370> single<00:06:37.730> motion

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.710 

and<00:06:44.220> you<00:06:44.759> can<00:06:44.909> really<00:06:45.060> start<00:06:45.360> getting<00:06:45.419> crazy

and you can really start getting crazy

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.080 
and you can really start getting crazy
