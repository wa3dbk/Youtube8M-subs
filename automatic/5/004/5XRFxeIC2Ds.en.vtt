00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.530
Welcome to ASU libraries
hidden treasures.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.770
I'm Xaviera Flores, project
archivist for the archives and

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.870
special collections, working
with the Chicano Research

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.530
Collection.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.160
Hayden library holds the largest
Mexican- American

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.230
archival collection in
the state of Arizona.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.710
Here with me today is my
colleague, and the curator of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.150
this kind of research
collection, Nancy Godoy.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.950
Hey, Nancy.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.530
Hola.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.810
I'm working on a grant project
processing some of Nancy's

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.479
collections.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.590
One which we have here today,
which is the Alianza Hispano

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.920
Americana records collection.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.763
Do you want to tell us a little
bit more about it?

00:00:39.763 --> 00:00:40.450
Sure.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.610
Alianza Hispano Americana was
established in 1894 in Tucson.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.870
It was the first Mexican-
American fraternal mutual aid

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.620
organization.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.320
The main goal of Alianza was
to provide health and life

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.840
insurance to the community.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840
This was a time when
nobody else would.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.230
And then they not only where
in Arizona, they were in

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.950
Mexico and other
states as well.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.070
Alianza is actually one of the
first Latino organizations in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.270
the southwest.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.150
It eventually [correct],
it branched out.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.370
I think the largest part of
our collection is actually

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.390
membership files.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.470
This is a great resource
for anybody who's

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.110
doing genealogy research.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.320
One of our students found one
of his family members.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.840
And I think the great thing
about that too, is he was able

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.070
to see where is relatives went
from one place to the next.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.300
So it's also kind of cool
for studying immigration

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.540
migration, socioeconomic
statuses, and obviously

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.930
payments, which brings us to
our second item, which is

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.820
actually a ledger.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.601
The Alianza ledgers go
back all the way to

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:47.860
1894, when it started.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.930
And some of them were not
in good condition.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.090
So we took great pains
to preserve them.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.650
You can see with this
ledger right here.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.770
It has so much financial
information, as well as family

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.090
names, which is really rich
information in genealogy.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.520
It captures when the Mexican-
American community went from

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.830
lower class to, eventually,
middle class.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.100
And it documents a lot of this
information before statehood.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.800
So you really get a roundabout
idea of how the community

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.730
existed, in their financial
records, and what families

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.120
were in certain areas
before then.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.920
One of the last pieces is
actually one of my favorites.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.130
It's a photo of the founders of
Alianza Hispano Americana,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.490
and also a membership badge that
they would give out to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.640
their members.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.270
This one is from 1897.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.310
And like you mentioned, where
you can see a lot of the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.520
moving up from lower
to upper class.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.605
If you just look at the way that
they are dressed, they

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:44.670
are very well dressed,
very prominent.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.710
And by the medals that they
gave, they took a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.190
lot of honor in this.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.300
And they were a huge influence
on the community.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.480
They took pride in taking care
of their communities.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.550
Again, this is a time when there
was hostility against

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.810
Mexican- Americans.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.780
And this is just a small
part of the collection.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.780
What else do we collect?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.800
We collect a lot.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.570
And the Chicano Research
Collection, as itself, is a

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.270
hidden treasure.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.080
That's true.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.280
We've been collecting
since 1970.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.860
Doctor Christine Marin started
this collection.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.730
And since 1970, we've been
collecting pretty much

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.110
anything you could think of.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.130
And it started from a student
protests, too, which I think

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.110
is really cool.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.770
It was one of the student
demands to start a collection

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.370
that documented their history.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.270
Because it wasn't being
taught in schools.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.600
And also documented the
curriculum and what the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.630
Chicano students were
also interested in.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.880
So what's the best way for
someone to come in and do

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.280
research with the collection?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.215
You would come here to Hayden
Library Luhrs Reading Room, or

00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:42.320
make an appointment with me.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.510
You can contact me via
email or phone.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.950
The only way you can view
it is if you come here.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.600
You get to wear cool
little gloves.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.920

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.500

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.100
Well Nancy, thank you so much
for being here today, and

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.290
showing us these pieces, and
for talking more about the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.480
Chicano Research Collection.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.120
And how, in itself, it's
a hidden treasure.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.540
Thank you very much for watching
another episode of

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.330
Hidden Treasures.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.240
And hopefully we'll
see you soon.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.330
Adios

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:30.270
