00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
get a lot more into collation like the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.540 
get a lot more into collation like the
front<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.720> rear<00:02:22.930> they<00:02:23.230> kind<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.530> move<00:02:23.800> all<00:02:24.040> all

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
front the rear they kind of move all all

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.160 
front the rear they kind of move all all
together<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:26.380> not<00:02:26.620> really<00:02:27.160> good<00:02:27.670> but

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
together so it's not really good but

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.500 
together so it's not really good but
yeah<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.590> be<00:02:29.680> removed<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.550> got<00:02:30.700> top

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
yeah that can be removed it's got top

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.590 
yeah that can be removed it's got top
links<00:02:31.930> as<00:02:32.080> well<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.550> when<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.670> move<00:02:34.000> they<00:02:34.330> move

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
links as well so when you move they move

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.310 
links as well so when you move they move
to<00:02:35.700> these<00:02:36.700> ones<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.330> they<00:02:37.450> got<00:02:37.660> will<00:02:37.930> join

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
to these ones and they got will join

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.200 
to these ones and they got will join

that<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.830> ESC<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:07.750> I<00:05:07.780> really<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.680> there's

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
that is the ESC so I really and there's

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.340 
that is the ESC so I really and there's
a<00:05:09.280> little<00:05:09.490> flaw<00:05:09.790> here<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.360> see<00:05:10.720> I'm<00:05:10.870> moving

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
a little flaw here you see I'm moving

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
the server at all so there's a little

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.650 
the server at all so there's a little
problem<00:05:19.090> there<00:05:20.160> but<00:05:21.160> yeah<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:21.910> this<00:05:22.060> is<00:05:22.120> just<00:05:22.570> a

problem there but yeah so this is just a

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.230 
problem there but yeah so this is just a
little<00:05:22.960> quick<00:05:23.170> movie<00:05:23.620> review<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:25.030> there's

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
little quick movie review and there's

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.820 
little quick movie review and there's
any<00:05:25.420> switching<00:05:25.990> sack<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:29.110> transmitter
