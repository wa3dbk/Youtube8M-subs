00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Welcome to the Geneva 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.790
 car salon at honda and the hire 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.570
 very interesting car before and although the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.400
 Civic Type R is a front-wheel drive 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.040
 Power package would like to say under the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.929
 hood a two-liter turbo engine and the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.740
 has it right in this case 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.990
 The unit has 310 ps and has one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.890
 maximum torque of 400 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.130
 newton meters 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.359
 the top speed should be at exactly 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.939
 270 kilometers per hour 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.769
 the spurt on 100 is done by the japanese 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.840
 in 5 7 seconds 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.920
 The forces bundle a manual 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.140
 six speed transmission 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.450
 special attention has honda at the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.850
 development on the aerodynamics 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 so the civic type r has an almost 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 completely disguised underbody 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.230
 Rear diffuser and a tail wing should for 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 plenty of downforce worry the broad 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.010
 front splitter and the side skirts 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.989
 also serve an optimized 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.059
 Air flow of the front bumper 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.620
 was designed so that the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.020
 turbulence at the front wheels 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.390
 be minimized for better cooling 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.729
 the engine was the upper and the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.409
 lower front grille enlarges the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.840
 additional air intakes in the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.570
 front apron and air outlets in the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.220
 Wheelbases are supposed to be efficient 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.409
 ensure ventilation 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.950
 especially for the type r was also a 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.600
 new four adaptive damper system 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.820
 basic settings developed is new 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.860
 also a r mode of suspension and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.780
 Drive at the push of a button to sharpen 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.689
 slowed down the new honda civic 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.759
 type r of a brembo brake system in 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.159
 There is an alu among other things 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.650
 shift knob sports seats with extra high 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.869
 backrest good stitching and a 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.189
 black roof sky 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.860
 characteristic of the honda civic 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.370
 type r of course 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.050
 big rear spoiler i think so here 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.790
 you can not look out the back 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.110
 but you definitely do not want to 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.700
 No one wants to look in the back play 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.080
 but we look forward to the front 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.320
 synonymous times what the launch is concerned 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.820
 At the end of march 2015 it should start work 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.470
 should he be orderable 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.270
 However, there are in geneva 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.080
 to cancel yet no final prices 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.380
 but so around 35,000 euros, he will probably 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.380
 lie
