00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
start with two and a half cups of flour

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.320 
start with two and a half cups of flour
to<00:00:11.010> which<00:00:11.190> we're<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.580> add<00:00:11.730> one<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
to which we're going to add one and a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.530 
to which we're going to add one and a
half<00:00:12.360> teaspoons<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.349> salt<00:00:14.150> I'm<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.360> just

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
half teaspoons of salt I'm going to just

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.390 
half teaspoons of salt I'm going to just
give<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.320> little<00:00:16.500> bit<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.830> stir<00:00:19.400> now

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
give that a little bit of a stir now

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.580 
give that a little bit of a stir now
we're<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.590> cut<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.830> half<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.670> cup<00:00:24.180> of

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
we're going to cut a half a cup of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.060 
we're going to cut a half a cup of
butter<00:00:25.590> into<00:00:25.980> small<00:00:26.460> pieces

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.729 

just<00:00:31.670> make<00:00:31.820> it<00:00:31.970> easier<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:32.540> cut<00:00:33.230> that<00:00:33.380> in<00:00:33.560> with

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
just make it easier to cut that in with

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.190 
just make it easier to cut that in with
the<00:00:33.860> pastry<00:00:34.220> cutter<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:34.750> we're<00:00:35.750> going<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.050> add

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
the pastry cutter and we're going to add

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.360 
the pastry cutter and we're going to add
a<00:00:36.230> half<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.680> cup<00:00:36.710> of<00:00:36.890> shortening

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.010 

so<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:44.969> we're<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> take<00:00:45.390> our<00:00:45.449> pastry

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so now we're going to take our pastry

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.939 
so now we're going to take our pastry
cutter<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:47.570> cut<00:00:48.570> all<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.110> into<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
cutter and cut all of this into the

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.450 
cutter and cut all of this into the
flour<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.440> important<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> your

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
flour so it's really important that your

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.979 
flour so it's really important that your
butter<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.239> shortening<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.040> are<00:00:56.040> cold

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
butter and your shortening or are cold

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.280 
butter and your shortening or are cold
just<00:00:57.989> take<00:00:58.140> them<00:00:58.290> out<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.589> refrigerator

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
just take them out of the refrigerator

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.479 
just take them out of the refrigerator
right<00:01:01.290> before<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.769> begin<00:01:04.129> we<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> make

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
right before you begin we want to make

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
right before you begin we want to make
sure<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:06.030> overwork<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.810> but

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
sure that we don't overwork this but

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.270 
sure that we don't overwork this but
that<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.259> get<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:08.430> P<00:01:08.880> sized

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
that we get it to about these P sized

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.840 
that we get it to about these P sized
chunks

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.109 

doesn't<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.110> uniform<00:01:16.909> you<00:01:17.909> want

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
doesn't have to be very uniform you want

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.660 
doesn't have to be very uniform you want
those<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.960> bigger<00:01:19.170> pieces<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.860> butter<00:01:20.310> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
those kind of bigger pieces of butter in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
those kind of bigger pieces of butter in
there<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.270> mount<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.750> gives<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> nice

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
there to mount that gives it that nice

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.510 
there to mount that gives it that nice
flaky<00:01:23.810> texture<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.290> baked

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.060 

so<00:01:30.060> we're<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.719> close<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> having<00:01:31.500> about

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so we're pretty close to having about

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:44.320 
so we're pretty close to having about
the<00:01:32.369> right<00:01:33.229> texture<00:01:34.229> here

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.000 

so<00:01:44.870> now<00:01:45.380> we<00:01:45.440> want<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.800> add<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:47.170> half<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.350> cup<00:01:48.380> to

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
so now we want to add a half a cup to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.960 
so now we want to add a half a cup to
three-quarters<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:50.360> cup<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:51.610> ice<00:01:52.610> water

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
three-quarters of a cup of ice water

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.020 
three-quarters of a cup of ice water
just<00:01:53.900> make<00:01:54.110> sure<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.560> don't<00:01:55.030> actually

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
just make sure that you don't actually

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.870 
just make sure that you don't actually
get<00:01:56.180> any<00:01:56.420> ice<00:01:56.630> chunks<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.380> there<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:58.040> ice

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
get any ice chunks in there the ice

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.540 
get any ice chunks in there the ice
water<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.600> important<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.560> prevent<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.160> butter

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
water is important to prevent the butter

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.210 
water is important to prevent the butter
from<00:02:02.080> melting<00:02:03.080> we<00:02:03.230> wanted<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.500> melt<00:02:03.800> when<00:02:04.070> we

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
from melting we wanted to melt when we

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.950 
from melting we wanted to melt when we
actually<00:02:04.400> put<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:04.820> pie<00:02:05.000> into<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.600> oven<00:02:07.960> so

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
actually put the pie into the oven so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.900 
actually put the pie into the oven so
another<00:02:09.470> trick<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:10.040> especially<00:02:10.520> if<00:02:10.580> your<00:02:10.700> hand

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
another trick is especially if your hand

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.340 
another trick is especially if your hand
if<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.240> warm<00:02:11.450> day<00:02:11.510> or<00:02:11.840> if<00:02:11.900> your<00:02:12.020> hands<00:02:12.200> are

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
if it's a warm day or if your hands are

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.990 
if it's a warm day or if your hands are
really<00:02:12.380> warm<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:13.040> actually<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:13.760> dip

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
really warm you can actually just dip

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.660 
really warm you can actually just dip
them<00:02:14.210> into<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.720> ice<00:02:15.020> water<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:16.190> get<00:02:16.310> them<00:02:16.520> nice

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
them into the ice water to get them nice

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.960 
them into the ice water to get them nice
and<00:02:16.730> cool<00:02:17.270> before<00:02:18.200> starting<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.620> work<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
and cool before starting to work the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.600 
and cool before starting to work the
dough

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.420 

so<00:02:28.210> again<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.540> want<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.780> work<00:02:29.850> quickly<00:02:30.850> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
so again you want to work quickly and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:41.070 
so again you want to work quickly and
not<00:02:33.870> need<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.110> dough<00:02:35.410> too<00:02:35.470> much<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.540> this

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
not need this dough too much so this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.590 
not need this dough too much so this
recipe<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.040> actually<00:02:42.430> for<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> double<00:02:43.120> crust<00:02:43.390> so

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
recipe is actually for a double crust so

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.620 
recipe is actually for a double crust so
you<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.840> want<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.080> make<00:02:44.230> two<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:46.240> two<00:02:46.450> balls

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
you just want to make two and two balls

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.050 
you just want to make two and two balls
out<00:02:47.020> of<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:48.420> you're<00:02:49.420> then<00:02:49.600> going<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:51.060> roll

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
out of it that you're then going to roll

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.340 
out of it that you're then going to roll
out<00:02:53.850> okay<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.300> that's<00:02:55.480> good<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.959> can<00:02:56.080> see<00:02:56.230> how

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
out okay so that's good you can see how

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.470 
out okay so that's good you can see how
this<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.560> actually<00:02:57.010> kind<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.250> even<00:02:57.730> flaking<00:02:58.360> in

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
this is actually kind of even flaking in

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.210 
this is actually kind of even flaking in
my<00:02:58.600> hand<00:02:58.930> that's<00:02:59.260> about<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> texture<00:03:00.010> that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
my hand that's about the texture that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.960 
my hand that's about the texture that
you<00:03:00.430> want<00:03:01.360> this<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.780> be<00:03:01.930> at<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.970> before

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
you want this to be at and before

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.400 
you want this to be at and before
rolling<00:03:04.330> them<00:03:04.480> out<00:03:04.600> you're<00:03:04.990> actually<00:03:05.140> going

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
rolling them out you're actually going

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.160 
rolling them out you're actually going
to<00:03:05.620> want<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:06.390> put<00:03:07.390> them<00:03:07.540> into<00:03:07.750> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
to want to put them into the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.850 
to want to put them into the
refrigerator<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.820> short<00:03:10.180> period<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.570> time

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
refrigerator for a short period of time

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.070 
refrigerator for a short period of time
allows<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.160> gluten<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.209> sort<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.480> relax<00:03:13.810> it'll

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
allows the gluten to sort of relax it'll

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080 
allows the gluten to sort of relax it'll
make<00:03:14.230> them<00:03:14.350> easier<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.709> roll<00:03:15.040> out<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:16.000> now

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
make them easier to roll out so now

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.270 
make them easier to roll out so now
we're<00:03:16.209> going<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.390> get<00:03:16.480> some<00:03:16.750> flour<00:03:17.530> onto<00:03:18.010> our

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
we're going to get some flour onto our

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.180 
we're going to get some flour onto our
surface<00:03:18.700> before<00:03:18.850> rolling<00:03:19.480> out<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.920> dough<00:03:23.190> now

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
surface before rolling out the dough now

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.500 
surface before rolling out the dough now
we're<00:03:24.310> going<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.459> take<00:03:24.610> one<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.850> our<00:03:24.940> balls<00:03:25.180> and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
we're going to take one of our balls and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.560 
we're going to take one of our balls and
just<00:03:25.660> kind<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.900> flatten<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.470> out<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:27.330> little<00:03:28.330> bit

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
just kind of flatten it out a little bit

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.840 
just kind of flatten it out a little bit
and<00:03:29.380> actually<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:29.860> kind<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.100> flip<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.640> over

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
and actually just kind of flip it over

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.800 
and actually just kind of flip it over
to<00:03:31.180> get<00:03:31.350> flour<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.500> both<00:03:32.650> those<00:03:32.860> surfaces<00:03:33.810> and

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
to get flour on both those surfaces and

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.770 
to get flour on both those surfaces and
even<00:03:35.049> get<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> little<00:03:35.650> bit<00:03:35.769> on<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.600> rolling<00:03:37.600> pin

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
even get a little bit on the rolling pin

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.229 
even get a little bit on the rolling pin
and<00:03:38.049> then<00:03:38.830> just<00:03:39.100> start<00:03:39.340> rolling<00:03:39.730> from<00:03:40.060> the

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
and then just start rolling from the

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.240 
and then just start rolling from the
center<00:03:40.630> out

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.160 

and<00:03:46.790> if<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.000> feels<00:03:47.120> like<00:03:47.240> it's<00:03:47.450> sticking<00:03:47.750> just

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
and if it feels like it's sticking just

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.340 
and if it feels like it's sticking just
put<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.350> little<00:03:48.560> bit<00:03:48.770> more<00:03:49.930> flour<00:03:50.930> on<00:03:51.320> your

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
put a little bit more flour on your

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:05.610 
put a little bit more flour on your
rolling<00:03:51.890> pin

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.100 

I<00:04:05.709> mean<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:06.370> fold<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.390> over<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.750> couple<00:04:08.049> of

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
I mean just fold it over a couple of

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:21.560 
I mean just fold it over a couple of
times<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:14.019> fit<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.620> into<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:15.220> pie<00:04:15.700> pan

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.340 

so<00:04:22.170> it's<00:04:22.290> important<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.740> not<00:04:22.920> stretch<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:24.350> just

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
so it's important to not stretch it just

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.700 
so it's important to not stretch it just
kind<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.620> fit<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.920> in<00:04:26.010> there<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:27.350> cut<00:04:28.350> off<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
kind of fit it in there and cut off the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.470 
kind of fit it in there and cut off the
excess

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.930 

and<00:04:34.690> then<00:04:35.290> just<00:04:36.150> kind<00:04:37.150> of<00:04:37.270> fold<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.900> ends

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
and then just kind of fold the ends

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.270 
and then just kind of fold the ends
under<00:04:43.770> now<00:04:44.770> we<00:04:44.860> can<00:04:45.010> use<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.190> fork<00:04:45.610> just<00:04:45.910> to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
under now we can use a fork just to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.070 
under now we can use a fork just to
press<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.490> edges<00:04:48.610> down<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:52.330> now<00:04:52.600> your<00:04:52.810> pie<00:04:53.020> is

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
press the edges down so now your pie is

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.310 
press the edges down so now your pie is
ready<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.310> be<00:04:54.760> filled<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:57.210> once<00:04:58.210> you're<00:04:59.110> ready

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
ready to be filled and once you're ready

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.140 
ready to be filled and once you're ready
to<00:04:59.500> bake<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.980> pie<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.220> put<00:05:00.700> it<00:05:00.790> into<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.030> oven

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
to bake the pie you put it into the oven

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.070 
to bake the pie you put it into the oven
at<00:05:01.660> 425<00:05:02.410> degrees<00:05:02.740> for<00:05:03.450> about<00:05:04.450> 10<00:05:04.840> or<00:05:04.990> 15

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
at 425 degrees for about 10 or 15

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.020 
at 425 degrees for about 10 or 15
minutes<00:05:05.350> just<00:05:05.920> to<00:05:06.070> have<00:05:06.220> that<00:05:06.370> high<00:05:06.550> heat<00:05:06.850> to

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
minutes just to have that high heat to

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.640 
minutes just to have that high heat to
really<00:05:07.270> melt<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.570> butter<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:07.990> then<00:05:08.230> lower<00:05:08.560> it

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
really melt the butter and then lower it

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.090 
really melt the butter and then lower it
down<00:05:08.770> to<00:05:09.310> about<00:05:09.340> 350<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.950> continue<00:05:11.950> baking

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
down to about 350 and continue baking

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.310 
down to about 350 and continue baking
the<00:05:12.370> pie<00:05:12.520> for<00:05:12.970> maybe<00:05:13.600> around<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.990> half<00:05:14.110> hour

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320

only have the bottom layer and if you

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.760 
only have the bottom layer and if you
have<00:05:23.920> the<00:05:24.040> top<00:05:24.250> layer<00:05:24.520> also<00:05:25.530> you're<00:05:26.530> going<00:05:26.620> to

have the top layer also you're going to

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.870 
have the top layer also you're going to
want<00:05:26.830> to<00:05:27.040> definitely<00:05:27.250> keep<00:05:27.460> an<00:05:27.580> eye<00:05:27.700> on<00:05:27.730> it

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
want to definitely keep an eye on it

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.140 
make sure that you don't burn the crust
and<00:05:29.440> you<00:05:29.530> can<00:05:29.680> actually<00:05:30.250> cover<00:05:30.640> it<00:05:30.850> with<00:05:30.940> tin

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
and you can actually cover it with tin
