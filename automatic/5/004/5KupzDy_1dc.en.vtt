down one more time for low speed and one

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
down one more time for low speed and one
more<00:00:59.699> time<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.120> high<00:01:00.210> speed<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.260> back

more time for high speed and then back

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.039 
more time for high speed and then back
all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> way<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> off<00:01:02.850> position

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
all the way up to the off position

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.870 
all the way up to the off position
there's<00:01:04.049> an<00:01:04.199> additional<00:01:04.650> control<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there's an additional control on the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.960 
there's an additional control on the
very<00:01:06.090> tip<00:01:06.450> since<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> since<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> Priuses<00:01:08.820> are

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
very tip since the since the Priuses are

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.990 
very tip since the since the Priuses are
hatchbacks<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> rear<00:01:10.799> wiper<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
hatchbacks there is a rear wiper and so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460 
hatchbacks there is a rear wiper and so
you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> off<00:01:12.780> position<00:01:13.080> and

you can see the off position and

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.789 
you can see the off position and
rotating<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:14.850> tip<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.450> stock<00:01:15.990> one

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
rotating the very tip of that stock one

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.710 
rotating the very tip of that stock one
notch<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.340> would<00:01:17.850> put<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.240> intermittent

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
notch up would put you an intermittent

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
notch up would put you an intermittent
mode<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.729> more

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
mode and then on and then one more

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.520
