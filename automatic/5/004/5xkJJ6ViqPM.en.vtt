net get closer to the net there's a few
reasons<00:00:32.189> for<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.550> number<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> closer

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
reasons for this number one the closer

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.090 
reasons for this number one the closer
you<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> net<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:34.620> accurate

you are to the net the more accurate

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.590 
you are to the net the more accurate
your<00:00:35.160> shot<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.790> take<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> shot

from 50 feet away and from 5 feet away

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.650 
from 50 feet away and from 5 feet away
you're<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> hit<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> net<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> lot<00:00:39.450> more

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
you're going to hit the net a lot more

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
you're going to hit the net a lot more
when<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.320> close<00:00:40.500> number<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
when you're in close number two is the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.819 
when you're in close number two is the
goalie<00:00:42.210> has<00:00:42.420> way<00:00:42.899> less<00:00:42.930> time<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.440> react<00:00:43.649> if

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
goalie has way less time to react if

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.500 
goalie has way less time to react if
you're<00:00:43.950> 50<00:00:44.250> feet<00:00:44.399> away<00:00:44.489> lots<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.149> time<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.390> read

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you're 50 feet away lots of time to read

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.029 
you're 50 feet away lots of time to read
the<00:00:45.570> puck<00:00:45.750> make<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> save<00:00:46.350> 5<00:00:46.710> feet<00:00:46.920> away

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the puck make the save 5 feet away

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.500 
the puck make the save 5 feet away
goalie<00:00:47.610> doesn't<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> much<00:00:48.180> time<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
goalie doesn't have that much time to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
goalie doesn't have that much time to
react<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.960> shot<00:00:49.200> third<00:00:50.160> reason<00:00:50.340> is

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
react to your shot third reason is

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.889 
react to your shot third reason is
because<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.120> where<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> puck<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.840> going

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
because that's where the puck is going

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.330 
because that's where the puck is going
if<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> puck<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.739> always<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> net

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
if the puck is always going to the net

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
if the puck is always going to the net
and<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:53.610> always<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> net<00:00:54.329> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and you're always going to the net you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.600 
and you're always going to the net you
can<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.110> those<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.469> pins<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.160> tippin's<00:00:56.489> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
can get those two pins so tippin's is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.189 
can get those two pins so tippin's is
one<00:00:56.760> way<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> score<00:00:57.149> another<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.960> off<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
one way to score another one is off the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.110 
one way to score another one is off the
rebound<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.770> there's<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.309> few<00:00:59.520> reasons<00:00:59.760> why<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
rebound so there's a few reasons why you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.119 
rebound so there's a few reasons why you
want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> net<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.170> closer<00:01:01.410> but

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
want to go to the net and get closer but

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.229 
want to go to the net and get closer but
there's<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> few<00:01:02.430> more<00:01:02.489> reasons<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.149> just

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
there's a few more reasons and I'm just

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000 
there's a few more reasons and I'm just
gonna<00:01:03.390> back<00:01:03.480> us<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.930> stats<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.769> there's<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
gonna back us up with stats so there's a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.859 
gonna back us up with stats so there's a
Toronto<00:01:05.369> Star<00:01:05.610> reporter<00:01:06.119> broke<00:01:06.720> down

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
Toronto Star reporter broke down

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.380 
Toronto Star reporter broke down
anything<00:01:07.049> about<00:01:07.260> 6500<00:01:08.040> goals<00:01:08.189> an<00:01:08.369> entire<00:01:08.790> NHL

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
anything about 6500 goals an entire NHL

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.440 
anything about 6500 goals an entire NHL
season<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> showed<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:11.119> 20%<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> goals

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
season it showed that 20% of the goals

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.050 
season it showed that 20% of the goals
were<00:01:12.840> scored<00:01:12.990> from<00:01:13.409> within<00:01:13.799> 6<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.580> 10<00:01:14.760> feet<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
were scored from within 6 to 10 feet of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.600 
were scored from within 6 to 10 feet of
the<00:01:15.119> net<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.650> 22%<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> goals<00:01:16.979> were<00:01:17.460> scored

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the net and 22% of the goals were scored

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
from within 11 to 15 feet so that's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820 
from within 11 to 15 feet so that's
almost<00:01:20.939> half<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> goals<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.590> entire

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
almost half of the goals in the entire

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.679 
almost half of the goals in the entire
season<00:01:23.130> were<00:01:23.340> scored<00:01:23.640> within<00:01:23.909> 15<00:01:24.360> feet<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
season were scored within 15 feet of the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.300 
season were scored within 15 feet of the
net<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.470> radius<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> set<00:01:26.159> with

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
net this is the radius that I set with

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.789 
net this is the radius that I set with
cones<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> orange<00:01:27.570> cones<00:01:27.900> are<00:01:28.140> 15<00:01:28.560> feet

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
cones so the orange cones are 15 feet

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.440 
cones so the orange cones are 15 feet
away<00:01:28.920> from<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.220> net<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.790> neon<00:01:30.000> cones<00:01:30.329> are

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
away from the net and the neon cones are

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
away from the net and the neon cones are
10<00:01:30.600> feet<00:01:30.750> away<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> net<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> NHL

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
10 feet away from the net so in the NHL

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.569 
10 feet away from the net so in the NHL
I<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> 2012<00:01:33.390> season<00:01:34.100> 22%<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.369> goals

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
I think was a 2012 season 22% of goals

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.370 
I think was a 2012 season 22% of goals
were<00:01:35.850> scored<00:01:35.970> between<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> neon<00:01:36.780> cones<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
were scored between the neon cones and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.080 
were scored between the neon cones and
these<00:01:37.530> orange<00:01:37.890> cones<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.880> arc

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
these orange cones so this little arc

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.840 
these orange cones so this little arc
right<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.689> then<00:01:40.200> 20%<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.640> goals

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
right here and then 20% of the goals

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
right here and then 20% of the goals
were<00:01:42.119> scored<00:01:42.270> between<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> neon<00:01:43.290> cones<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.890> 5

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
were scored between the neon cones and 5

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.460 
were scored between the neon cones and 5
feet<00:01:44.759> away<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:44.970> 5<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> 10<00:01:45.810> feet<00:01:45.840> away<00:01:46.170> from<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
feet away so 5 to 10 feet away from the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
feet away so 5 to 10 feet away from the
net<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.430> getting<00:01:48.030> any<00:01:48.149> close<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
net right there and getting any close to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.429 
net right there and getting any close to
that<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> pretty<00:01:48.930> much<00:01:49.049> where<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> goal

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that is pretty much where the goal

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
that is pretty much where the goal
crease<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:50.000> ok<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.689> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
crease is ok now that you know to go to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.999 
crease is ok now that you know to go to
the<00:01:51.869> net<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.290> work<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> few<00:01:52.799> drills

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the net let's work on a few drills

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:53.960 
the net let's work on a few drills

I'm just going to talk about setup that
I'm<00:01:57.509> using<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:57.869> people<00:01:58.409> always<00:01:58.530> ask<00:01:58.860> so

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
grass so it's a little bit soft where I

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.600 
grass so it's a little bit soft where I
just<00:02:04.469> put<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> piece<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.890> plywood<00:02:05.040> underneath

you're going to do is shoot these pucks
quickly<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:21.960> when<00:02:22.110> you're<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.320> close<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
quickly because when you're in close you

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.410 
quickly because when you're in close you
want<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.250> get<00:02:23.370> quick<00:02:23.670> shots<00:02:23.910> off<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.300> don't

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
want to get quick shots off you don't

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
want to get quick shots off you don't
want<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.600> play<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.960> puck<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.350> it

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
want to play with the puck because it

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.800 
want to play with the puck because it
gives<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.710> goalie<00:02:25.890> time<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.220> set<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.120> get

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
gives the goalie time to set up so get

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.780 
gives the goalie time to set up so get
quick<00:02:28.050> snaps<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.400> work<00:02:29.520> on<00:02:29.670> your

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
quick snaps on that you can work on your

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.400 
quick snaps on that you can work on your
accuracy<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.300> I'm<00:02:30.420> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.630> go<00:02:30.690> try<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.990> shove

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
accuracy so I'm going to go try to shove

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.140 
accuracy so I'm going to go try to shove
off<00:02:31.500> these<00:02:31.709> ones<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.250> I'm<00:02:32.700> trying<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.940> go<00:02:33.060> up

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
off these ones so I'm trying to go up

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.180 
off these ones so I'm trying to go up
high<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:34.020> one<00:02:34.110> went<00:02:34.260> over<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.500> net<00:02:34.680> see

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
high that one went over the net see

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.410 
high that one went over the net see

in<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> few<00:02:46.560> different<00:02:46.650> variations<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.790> that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
in a few different variations so in that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.949 
in a few different variations so in that
one<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.330> trying<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.510> shelf<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.840> every

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
one I was just trying to shelf it every

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.270 
one I was just trying to shelf it every
time<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.530> also<00:02:49.620> work<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.010> accuracy

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
time you can also work on your accuracy

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.610 
time you can also work on your accuracy
to<00:02:50.730> try<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.910> go<00:02:51.030> top<00:02:51.540> left<00:02:51.810> every<00:02:52.020> time<00:02:52.170> top

to try to go top left every time top
right<00:02:52.830> every<00:02:52.980> time<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.310> for<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.520> bottom

right every time go for the bottom

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.850 
right every time go for the bottom
corners<00:02:54.090> or<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.660> alternate<00:02:54.959> pop<00:02:55.620> left

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
top right top left top right as you go

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.760 
top right top left top right as you go
through<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:57.959> hit<00:02:58.110> all<00:02:58.260> those<00:02:58.380> pucks

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
through and hit all those pucks

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.650 
through and hit all those pucks
you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.370> also<00:02:59.520> do<00:02:59.670> your<00:02:59.760> backhand<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.270> highly

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
you can also do your backhand I highly

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.880 
you can also do your backhand I highly
recommend<00:03:01.050> working<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.500> because<00:03:01.739> a

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
recommend working on that because a

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.470 
recommend working on that because a
backhand<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> bit<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.850> neglected<00:03:03.270> shot

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
backhand is a bit of a neglected shot

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.300 
backhand is a bit of a neglected shot
and<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> good<00:03:04.440> backhand<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:05.070> close

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
and if you have a good backhand in close

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.590 
and if you have a good backhand in close
you're<00:03:05.580> going<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.760> score<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.090> lot<00:03:06.209> more<00:03:06.390> goals

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you're going to score a lot more goals

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.660 
you're going to score a lot more goals
so<00:03:07.050> for<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:07.410> I'm<00:03:07.650> gonna<00:03:07.860> go<00:03:07.950> top<00:03:08.430> left

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
so for this one I'm gonna go top left

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.580 
so for this one I'm gonna go top left
every<00:03:09.060> single<00:03:09.300> puck<00:03:09.480> let's<00:03:10.140> see<00:03:10.230> how<00:03:10.350> many<00:03:10.410> I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
every single puck let's see how many I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.640 
every single puck let's see how many I
can<00:03:10.739> hit<00:03:12.170> remember<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.260> want<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.410> get<00:03:13.530> those

pucks off fast and you want to try to

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.789 
pucks off fast and you want to try to

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
not miss the net there we go top left

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.560 
not miss the net there we go top left
every<00:03:20.010> time<00:03:20.190> another<00:03:20.910> great<00:03:21.150> drill<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.390> work

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
going from forehand to backhand I have

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.170 
going from forehand to backhand I have
one<00:03:29.070> pile<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.430> pucks<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.760> one<00:03:29.880> side<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
one pile of pucks on one side the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.640 
one pile of pucks on one side the
shooting<00:03:30.450> pad<00:03:30.600> I'm<00:03:30.870> going<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> quickly<00:03:31.380> move

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
shooting pad I'm going to quickly move

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.289 
shooting pad I'm going to quickly move
it<00:03:31.799> across<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.160> shooting<00:03:32.430> pad<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.120> try

it across the shooting pad and then try

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.670 
it across the shooting pad and then try
to<00:03:33.360> lift<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:33.810> because<00:03:34.260> when<00:03:34.560> you're

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
to lift it up because when you're

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.440 
to lift it up because when you're
shooting<00:03:34.860> you're<00:03:35.580> not<00:03:35.880> always<00:03:36.060> going<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.330> have

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
shooting you're not always going to have

shooting you're not always going to have
a<00:03:36.480> clear<00:03:36.900> shot<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.440> net<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.890> goalie<00:03:38.130> might

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
a clear shot of the net the goalie might

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.220 
a clear shot of the net the goalie might
be<00:03:38.430> set<00:03:38.640> up<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.180> if<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.299> can<00:03:39.510> quickly<00:03:39.810> move<00:03:40.049> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
be set up so if you can quickly move the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
and then lift it up and if you can do

and then lift it up and if you can do
that<00:03:43.890> quicker<00:03:44.220> than<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.670> goalie<00:03:44.850> can<00:03:45.000> side

that quicker than the goalie can side

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.550 
that quicker than the goalie can side
across<00:03:45.420> you're<00:03:45.930> going<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.110> score<00:03:46.260> some<00:03:46.440> goals

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.370 
so that's we're going to work on here
I'm<00:03:48.239> going<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.480> forehand<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.900> back<00:03:48.989> in<00:03:49.200> and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
I'm going to forehand it back in and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.780 
I'm going to forehand it back in and
then<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.709> keep<00:03:49.860> some<00:03:50.070> variation<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.730> can

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
then to keep some variation you can

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.130 
then to keep some variation you can
start<00:03:51.060> with<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.209> puck<00:03:51.360> on<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.480> other<00:03:51.630> side<00:03:51.810> go

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
start with the puck on the other side go

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.350 
start with the puck on the other side go
backhand<00:03:52.530> forehand<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.400> recommend<00:03:53.850> they

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
backhand forehand so I recommend they

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.759 
backhand forehand so I recommend they
start<00:03:54.660> by<00:03:54.780> just<00:03:54.989> slowly<00:03:55.200> moving<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> puck

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
start by just slowly moving the puck

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.770 
start by just slowly moving the puck
over<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.640> working<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.329> technique

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
over and just working on that technique

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.160 
over and just working on that technique
so<00:03:58.200> pulling<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> puck<00:03:58.799> across<00:03:58.920> going<00:03:59.700> from

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
so pulling the puck across going from

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.050 
so pulling the puck across going from
forehand<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.680> backhand<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.370> then<00:04:02.850> getting

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
forehand to backhand and then getting

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.690 
forehand to backhand and then getting
that<00:04:03.209> puck<00:04:03.390> up<00:04:03.570> high<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.320> work<00:04:04.530> on<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:05.549> right

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
that puck up high so work on the right

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.390 
that puck up high so work on the right
technique<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.900> motion<00:04:07.350> once<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.250> get

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
technique the motion once you get

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.009 
technique the motion once you get
comfortable<00:04:08.700> shelfing<00:04:09.480> those<00:04:09.660> pucks<00:04:09.840> each

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
comfortable shelfing those pucks each

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.479 
comfortable shelfing those pucks each
time<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.470> either<00:04:10.829> your<00:04:10.980> backhand<00:04:11.130> or<00:04:11.340> forehand

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
time on either your backhand or forehand

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.610 
time on either your backhand or forehand
then<00:04:12.150> start<00:04:12.420> going<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:12.630> little<00:04:12.690> quicker<00:04:12.989> once

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
then start going a little quicker once

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.080 
then start going a little quicker once
you<00:04:13.709> start<00:04:13.920> going<00:04:14.130> faster<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:14.760> gonna<00:04:14.910> be

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
you start going faster it's gonna be

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.789 
you start going faster it's gonna be
more<00:04:15.269> difficult<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.959> I'll<00:04:16.440> start<00:04:16.650> missing

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
more difficult and I'll start missing

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.460 
more difficult and I'll start missing
the<00:04:17.010> net<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> little<00:04:17.310> bit<00:04:17.519> more<00:04:17.700> but<00:04:18.510> once<00:04:19.350> you

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
the net a little bit more but once you

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.170 
the net a little bit more but once you
get<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.680> speed<00:04:20.130> you're<00:04:20.700> gonna<00:04:20.790> get<00:04:21.000> more

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
get that speed you're gonna get more

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.330 
get that speed you're gonna get more
goals<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.660> way<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.620> there<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.220> was<00:04:23.310> a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
goals that way so there that was a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580 
goals that way so there that was a
little<00:04:23.550> bit<00:04:23.640> of<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.760> weak<00:04:23.910> one<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.300> just<00:04:25.080> work<00:04:25.410> on

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
little bit of a weak one I just work on

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.350 
little bit of a weak one I just work on
that<00:04:25.620> speed<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.370> start<00:04:26.640> slow

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
that speed so start slow

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.029 
that speed so start slow
faster<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:27.810> faster<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.229> faster<00:04:28.319> and<00:04:28.949> if

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
faster and faster and faster and if

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.050 
faster and faster and faster and if

quarter second even it's going to be
enough<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.930> buy<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.139> time<00:04:49.259> to<00:04:49.889> get<00:04:50.039> an<00:04:50.159> opening

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
enough to buy you time to get an opening

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.980 
enough to buy you time to get an opening
and<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:50.939> get<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.210> edge<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.629> score<00:04:51.840> more

and to get that edge and score more

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.629 
and to get that edge and score more
goals<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> few<00:04:52.860> things<00:04:53.069> you<00:04:53.280> can<00:04:53.340> do<00:04:53.460> and

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
goals so a few things you can do and

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.800 
goals so a few things you can do and
I'll<00:04:53.699> start<00:04:53.849> with<00:04:53.969> some<00:04:54.120> simple<00:04:54.389> ones<00:04:54.569> work

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
I'll start with some simple ones work

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.929 
I'll start with some simple ones work
more<00:04:55.020> out<00:04:55.169> so<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.889> first<00:04:56.069> one<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.460> just<00:04:56.879> to

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
more out so the first one is just to

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:58.700 
more out so the first one is just to
show<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.120> little<00:04:57.330> bit<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.509> blade<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.020> fake<00:04:58.530> like

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
show a little bit of blade and fake like

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.290 
show a little bit of blade and fake like
you're<00:04:58.830> going<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.039> shoot<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.430> one<00:04:59.580> side<00:04:59.849> so<00:05:00.090> I

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
you're going to shoot to one side so I

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.969 
you're going to shoot to one side so I
have<00:05:00.389> my<00:05:00.930> blade<00:05:01.169> I'm<00:05:01.289> just<00:05:01.469> stick<00:05:01.650> handling

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
have my blade I'm just stick handling

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.499 
have my blade I'm just stick handling
over<00:05:02.189> the<00:05:02.279> puck<00:05:02.460> here<00:05:02.759> I'm<00:05:02.969> going<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.360> do<00:05:03.419> is

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
over the puck here I'm going to do is

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.809 
over the puck here I'm going to do is
open<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.319> this<00:05:04.439> one<00:05:04.680> side<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:05.219> sometimes

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
open it to this one side and sometimes

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.369 
open it to this one side and sometimes
that's<00:05:06.090> enough<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.539> get<00:05:06.689> the<00:05:06.810> goalie<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.169> slide

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
that's enough to get the goalie to slide

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.320 
that's enough to get the goalie to slide
it<00:05:07.529> depends<00:05:07.860> how<00:05:07.979> it<00:05:08.159> 10c<00:05:08.669> is<00:05:08.789> and<00:05:09.000> how<00:05:09.060> much<00:05:09.210> he

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
it depends how it 10c is and how much he

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.850 
it depends how it 10c is and how much he
thinks<00:05:09.360> you're<00:05:09.659> actually<00:05:09.900> over<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:10.169> side<00:05:10.379> so

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
thinks you're actually over that side so

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.920 
thinks you're actually over that side so
just<00:05:10.889> by<00:05:11.159> opening<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.969> blade<00:05:12.120> like<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:12.509> you

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
just by opening the blade like that you

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.480 
just by opening the blade like that you
can<00:05:13.080> buy<00:05:13.199> yourself<00:05:13.349> a<00:05:13.710> half<00:05:13.889> second<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.279> go<00:05:14.400> to

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
can buy yourself a half second and go to

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.550 
can buy yourself a half second and go to
the<00:05:14.580> other<00:05:14.669> side<00:05:14.879> trick<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:15.539> goalie<00:05:15.750> make<00:05:16.529> a

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
the other side trick the goalie make a

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.529 
the other side trick the goalie make a
move<00:05:16.830> even<00:05:17.159> so<00:05:17.580> all<00:05:17.610> it's<00:05:17.909> going<00:05:18.029> to<00:05:18.120> look<00:05:18.180> like

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
move even so all it's going to look like

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:19.939 
move even so all it's going to look like
let's<00:05:18.750> go<00:05:18.840> like<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.080> open<00:05:19.439> the<00:05:19.500> blade<00:05:19.680> and

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
let's go like this open the blade and

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.700 
let's go like this open the blade and
you<00:05:20.189> can<00:05:20.310> go<00:05:20.430> back<00:05:20.610> in<00:05:20.879> you<00:05:21.779> can<00:05:21.900> also<00:05:22.050> just

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
you can go back in you can also just

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.499 
you can go back in you can also just
show<00:05:22.800> some<00:05:22.919> blade<00:05:23.279> for<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.550> right<00:05:23.759> side<00:05:24.000> and

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
show some blade for the right side and

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.570 
show some blade for the right side and
then<00:05:24.840> shoot<00:05:25.050> for<00:05:25.199> the<00:05:25.259> left<00:05:25.439> side<00:05:25.650> so<00:05:26.219> that<00:05:26.430> one

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
then shoot for the left side so that one

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.950 
then shoot for the left side so that one
would<00:05:26.699> look<00:05:26.789> like<00:05:26.939> this<00:05:27.180> let's<00:05:27.629> open<00:05:27.750> some

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
would look like this let's open some

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.809 
would look like this let's open some
blade<00:05:28.259> and<00:05:28.500> then<00:05:28.680> shoot<00:05:28.889> for<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:29.129> left<00:05:29.729> side

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
blade and then shoot for the left side

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.700 
blade and then shoot for the left side
so<00:05:30.150> he<00:05:30.270> thinks<00:05:30.659> you're<00:05:30.750> going<00:05:30.900> this<00:05:31.020> way<00:05:31.169> shoot

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
so he thinks you're going this way shoot

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.200 
so he thinks you're going this way shoot
the<00:05:31.830> other<00:05:31.860> way<00:05:32.129> it's<00:05:32.520> just<00:05:32.550> enough<00:05:32.849> to<00:05:32.969> freeze

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
the other way it's just enough to freeze

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.689 
the other way it's just enough to freeze
the<00:05:33.240> goalie<00:05:33.539> a<00:05:33.750> little<00:05:34.020> bit<00:05:34.430> last<00:05:35.430> thing<00:05:35.669> that

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
the goalie a little bit last thing that

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:37.909 
the goalie a little bit last thing that
you<00:05:35.819> can<00:05:35.940> do<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.659> just<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.900> simple<00:05:37.139> move<00:05:37.319> so

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
you can do is just a simple move so

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.040 
you can do is just a simple move so
instead<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.639> actually<00:05:38.969> faking<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.360> shot<00:05:39.599> you're

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
instead of actually faking a shot you're

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.230 
instead of actually faking a shot you're
just<00:05:40.229> moving<00:05:40.500> to<00:05:41.039> one<00:05:41.190> side<00:05:41.460> catching<00:05:42.120> it

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
just moving to one side catching it

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.850 
just moving to one side catching it
bring<00:05:42.779> it<00:05:42.900> back<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:43.319> other<00:05:43.379> side<00:05:43.620> and

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
bring it back to the other side and

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.619 
bring it back to the other side and
shooting<00:05:44.279> this<00:05:44.669> is<00:05:44.819> a<00:05:44.849> really<00:05:45.029> easy<00:05:45.060> one<00:05:45.389> to<00:05:45.509> do

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
shooting this is a really easy one to do

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.170 
shooting this is a really easy one to do
I<00:05:45.839> do<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.560> same<00:05:46.710> thing<00:05:46.979> if<00:05:47.190> I<00:05:47.460> want<00:05:47.969> to<00:05:48.029> shoot
