that's<00:02:22.209> okay<00:02:22.660> let's<00:02:23.230> find<00:02:23.500> what<00:02:23.739> you're<00:02:24.129> going

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
that's okay let's find what you're going

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.770 
that's okay let's find what you're going
to<00:02:24.310> lock<00:02:24.489> your<00:02:24.700> shoulder<00:02:25.030> blades<00:02:25.269> up<00:02:25.480> against

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
to lock your shoulder blades up against

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.160 
to lock your shoulder blades up against
the<00:02:25.930> pad<00:02:26.530> why<00:02:27.220> you're<00:02:27.370> pressing<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.360> one<00:02:29.080> of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
the pad why you're pressing and one of

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.020 
the pad why you're pressing and one of
the<00:02:29.230> biggest<00:02:29.560> things<00:02:29.799> that<00:02:30.099> your<00:02:30.670> shoulders

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
shouldn't play rotate as you will raise

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.920 
shouldn't play rotate as you will raise
your<00:02:35.860> arm<00:02:35.980> or<00:02:36.250> your<00:02:36.280> head<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.000> mechanics

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
your arm or your head so that mechanics

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.750 
your arm or your head so that mechanics
on<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.260> too<00:02:38.470> by<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.650> way<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.040> right<00:02:39.489> here

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
on that too by the way and right here

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.870 
on that too by the way and right here
for<00:02:40.239> our<00:02:40.500> bench<00:02:41.500> press<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.920> same<00:02:42.129> thing<00:02:42.430> you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
for our bench press the same thing you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.370 
for our bench press the same thing you
know<00:02:42.940> locking<00:02:43.360> yourself<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.840> place<00:02:44.049> is<00:02:44.230> not

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
know locking yourself in place is not

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.559 
know locking yourself in place is not
how<00:02:44.530> we're<00:02:44.680> going<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:44.860> move<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.610> that's<00:02:46.269> not

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
how we're going to move so that's not

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.479 
how we're going to move so that's not
all<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.989> space<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.440> we<00:02:47.530> have<00:02:47.739> coming<00:02:48.459> to

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
all the space that we have coming to

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.580 
all the space that we have coming to
this<00:02:48.579> side<00:02:48.849> over<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.569> we<00:02:50.140> have<00:02:50.349> some

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
this side over here and we have some

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.400 
this side over here and we have some
dumbbells<00:02:51.160> now<00:02:51.599> pick<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.720> PI<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.049> this<00:02:53.170> face

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
dumbbells now pick you PI on this face

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.569 
dumbbells now pick you PI on this face
here<00:02:53.650> just<00:02:53.860> take<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:53.980> little<00:02:54.160> quick<00:02:54.340> look<00:02:54.519> at

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
here just take a little quick look at

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.640 
here just take a little quick look at
that<00:02:54.670> amount<00:02:54.849> of<00:02:54.970> space<00:02:55.000> down<00:02:55.360> there<00:02:55.650> keep

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
that amount of space down there keep

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.750 
that amount of space down there keep
that<00:02:56.769> in<00:02:56.890> mind<00:02:56.920> I'm<00:02:57.190> going<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.430> play<00:02:57.549> some

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that in mind I'm going to play some

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.890 
that in mind I'm going to play some
things<00:02:57.910> if<00:02:58.030> you're<00:02:58.150> gonna<00:02:58.269> be<00:02:58.360> able<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.510> do<00:02:58.720> in

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
things if you're gonna be able to do in

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.800 
things if you're gonna be able to do in
that<00:02:59.019> space<00:02:59.230> as<00:02:59.980> we<00:03:00.190> move<00:03:00.340> forward<00:03:00.579> so<00:03:00.970> over

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that space as we move forward so over

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.240 
that space as we move forward so over
here<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.739> have<00:03:02.769> our<00:03:03.430> free<00:03:04.360> weight<00:03:04.540> area<00:03:04.750> and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
here we have our free weight area and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.250 
here we have our free weight area and
you<00:03:06.250> know<00:03:06.340> basically<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.150> look<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:08.200> is

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
you know basically if you look this is

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.780 
you know basically if you look this is
it<00:03:08.410> it's<00:03:08.799> not<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:08.980> lot<00:03:09.129> of<00:03:09.160> room<00:03:09.430> here

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
it it's not a lot of room here

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.400 
it it's not a lot of room here
and<00:03:09.879> one<00:03:10.629> thing<00:03:10.810> you're<00:03:10.959> probably<00:03:11.140> going<00:03:11.349> to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
and one thing you're probably going to

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.130 
and one thing you're probably going to
find<00:03:11.680> most<00:03:12.250> often<00:03:12.670> these<00:03:12.819> hotel<00:03:13.150> gyms<00:03:13.420> you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
find most often these hotel gyms you

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.110 
find most often these hotel gyms you
only<00:03:14.349> have<00:03:14.650> up<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.980> 50<00:03:15.310> pounds<00:03:15.730> if<00:03:15.880> you're

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
only have up to 50 pounds if you're

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.500 
only have up to 50 pounds if you're
lucky

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
lucky

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.629 
lucky
sometimes<00:03:16.989> with<00:03:17.170> 35<00:03:17.739> pounds<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.280> that's<00:03:18.340> it

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
sometimes with 35 pounds and that's it

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.500 
sometimes with 35 pounds and that's it
so<00:03:19.209> how<00:03:20.019> can<00:03:20.230> we<00:03:20.760> work<00:03:21.760> with<00:03:21.790> what<00:03:22.180> we've<00:03:22.329> got

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
so how can we work with what we've got

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.360 
so how can we work with what we've got
here<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.870> still<00:03:23.019> get<00:03:23.139> a<00:03:23.200> good<00:03:23.319> workout<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.680> and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
here to still get a good workout in and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.650 
here to still get a good workout in and
I<00:03:24.430> think<00:03:24.639> it's<00:03:24.730> really<00:03:24.940> easy<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.239> think<00:03:25.450> some

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
I think it's really easy I think some

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.729 
I think it's really easy I think some
people<00:03:25.900> walk<00:03:26.079> in<00:03:26.230> here<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.470> say<00:03:26.560> oh<00:03:26.590> they

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
people walk in here and say oh they

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.170 
people walk in here and say oh they
don't<00:03:26.859> have<00:03:27.040> enough<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.430> they<00:03:27.519> walk<00:03:27.730> out<00:03:27.910> and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
don't have enough and they walk out and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.360 
don't have enough and they walk out and
that's<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.480> mistake<00:03:28.810> what<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.470> say<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:30.040> let's<00:03:30.250> say

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
that's a mistake what I say is let's say

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.440 
that's a mistake what I say is let's say
we're<00:03:30.519> do<00:03:30.639> I'm<00:03:30.760> going<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:30.970> show<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.180> couple

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
we're do I'm going to show you a couple

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.050 
we're do I'm going to show you a couple
examples<00:03:31.480> let's<00:03:31.959> say<00:03:32.109> we're<00:03:32.560> doing<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:33.060> running

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
examples let's say we're doing a running

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.099 
examples let's say we're doing a running
back<00:03:34.239> okay

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
back okay

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.259 
back okay
maybe<00:03:35.590> like<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.799> version<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.370> dumbbell<00:03:36.730> row<00:03:36.970> I

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
maybe like a version of a dumbbell row I

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.539 
maybe like a version of a dumbbell row I
would<00:03:37.750> grab<00:03:37.930> one<00:03:38.470> 50<00:03:38.980> here<00:03:39.190> because<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.430> can

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
would grab one 50 here because I can

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.440 
would grab one 50 here because I can
probably<00:03:39.700> do<00:03:40.000> let's<00:03:40.180> say

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
probably do let's say

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.930 
probably do let's say
70s<00:03:40.840> or<00:03:40.930> 80s<00:03:40.959> so<00:03:41.860> how<00:03:42.010> will<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.280> make<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.610> 50

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
70s or 80s so how will you make this 50

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.059 
70s or 80s so how will you make this 50
seem<00:03:43.180> hard<00:03:43.450> well<00:03:43.930> we've<00:03:44.440> talked<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.890> all<00:03:45.010> the

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
seem hard well we've talked that all the

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.830 
seem hard well we've talked that all the
time<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.640> time<00:03:45.670> under<00:03:46.060> tension<00:03:46.120> principle

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
time the time under tension principle

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.830 
time the time under tension principle
right<00:03:47.349> going<00:03:47.739> slower<00:03:48.069> so<00:03:48.459> go<00:03:49.060> here<00:03:49.360> come

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
right going slower so go here come

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.530 
right going slower so go here come
slower<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:50.500> red<00:03:50.760> squeeze<00:03:51.760> at<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.000> top

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
slower on the red squeeze at the top

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.280 
slower on the red squeeze at the top
come<00:03:53.110> down<00:03:53.349> slow<00:03:53.760> under<00:03:54.760> control<00:03:55.180> up<00:03:55.810> all<00:03:56.110> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
come down slow under control up all the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.759 
come down slow under control up all the
way<00:03:56.440> squeeze<00:03:57.310> down<00:03:58.180> under<00:03:58.750> control<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.530> kind

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
way squeeze down under control so kind

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.550 
way squeeze down under control so kind
of<00:03:59.830> keeping<00:04:00.130> our<00:04:00.250> reps<00:04:00.519> in<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:01.630> format<00:04:02.230> is

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
of keeping our reps in that format is

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.280 
of keeping our reps in that format is
going<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.220> make<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.700> lot<00:04:04.060> more<00:04:04.239> work<00:04:04.510> being<00:04:05.170> done

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
going to make a lot more work being done

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.120 
going to make a lot more work being done
on<00:04:05.739> your<00:04:06.220> your<00:04:06.880> back<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.660> how<00:04:08.560> can<00:04:08.620> we<00:04:08.799> make<00:04:08.830> it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
on your your back but how can we make it

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.670 
on your your back but how can we make it
even<00:04:09.519> harder<00:04:09.849> short<00:04:10.510> rest<00:04:10.750> times<00:04:10.989> just<00:04:11.349> jump

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
even harder short rest times just jump

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.650 
even harder short rest times just jump
in<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.430> right<00:04:12.580> side<00:04:12.849> go<00:04:13.180> right<00:04:13.420> back<00:04:13.630> to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
in to the right side go right back to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.440 
in to the right side go right back to
the<00:04:13.870> left<00:04:14.019> side<00:04:14.290> remember<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.610> left<00:04:16.060> side<00:04:16.269> is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
the left side remember that left side is

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.000 
the left side remember that left side is
resting<00:04:16.900> when<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.109> right<00:04:17.260> side<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:17.620> working

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
resting when the right side is working

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.409 
resting when the right side is working
so<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.430> don't<00:04:18.790> need<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:18.970> rest<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.329> time

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
so you don't need the rest of the time

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.569 
so you don't need the rest of the time
minute<00:04:19.690> in<00:04:19.810> between<00:04:19.840> sets<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:21.010> go<00:04:21.190> back<00:04:21.370> and

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
minute in between sets to go back and

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.210 
minute in between sets to go back and
forth<00:04:21.790> let's<00:04:22.389> say<00:04:22.540> I'm<00:04:22.660> doing<00:04:22.840> bench<00:04:23.800> presses

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
forth let's say I'm doing bench presses

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.700 
forth let's say I'm doing bench presses
and<00:04:24.639> I'm<00:04:24.760> trying<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.060> make<00:04:25.210> these<00:04:25.450> hard<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.680> I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
and I'm trying to make these hard so I

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.110 
and I'm trying to make these hard so I
can<00:04:26.979> set<00:04:27.190> up<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:27.669> an<00:04:27.820> incline<00:04:28.180> press<00:04:29.820> in<00:04:30.820> grab

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
can set up like an incline press in grab

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.629 
can set up like an incline press in grab
these<00:04:31.620> 50s<00:04:32.620> let's<00:04:32.800> say<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:33.010> was<00:04:33.160> trying<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.460> use

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
these 50s let's say I was trying to use

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.690 
these 50s let's say I was trying to use
like<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.850> mobile<00:04:34.120> rolling<00:04:34.780> using<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.430> 84<00:04:36.430> self

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
like a mobile rolling using the 84 self

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.830 
like a mobile rolling using the 84 self
so<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.479> come<00:04:38.320> up<00:04:38.350> here<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:39.610> basically<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.330> can

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
so I come up here and basically I can

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.890 
so I come up here and basically I can
either<00:04:41.020> come<00:04:41.260> down<00:04:41.550> slow<00:04:42.550> with<00:04:42.760> one<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.810> as

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
either come down slow with one and as

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.719 
either come down slow with one and as
the<00:04:44.020> other<00:04:44.110> ones<00:04:44.350> going<00:04:44.590> up<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.950> can<00:04:45.460> bring<00:04:45.580> it

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
the other ones going up I can bring it

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.600 
the other ones going up I can bring it
on<00:04:45.910> down<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:46.900> there's<00:04:47.080> constant<00:04:47.320> movement<00:04:47.860> and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
on down so there's constant movement and

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.279 
on down so there's constant movement and
constant<00:04:49.120> tension<00:04:49.530> okay<00:04:50.530> that's<00:04:50.979> one<00:04:51.220> way<00:04:52.289> and

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
constant tension okay that's one way and

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.770 
constant tension okay that's one way and
we<00:04:53.410> get<00:04:53.560> ourselves<00:04:53.680> charm<00:04:54.250> twelve<00:04:55.210> reps<00:04:55.450> or<00:04:55.630> so

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
we get ourselves charm twelve reps or so

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.110 
we get ourselves charm twelve reps or so
under<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.080> way<00:04:56.350> but<00:04:56.710> let's<00:04:56.889> say<00:04:57.039> we<00:04:57.760> finally

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
under that way but let's say we finally

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.659 
under that way but let's say we finally
complete<00:04:58.419> our<00:04:58.450> set<00:04:58.889> come<00:04:59.889> right<00:05:00.100> down<00:05:00.310> and

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
complete our set come right down and

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.620 
complete our set come right down and
drop<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.539> right<00:05:01.630> into<00:05:01.990> a<00:05:02.639> burnout<00:05:03.639> set<00:05:04.000> of

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
drop it right into a burnout set of

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.529 
drop it right into a burnout set of
push-ups<00:05:05.190> so<00:05:06.360> compound

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
push-ups so compound

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.690
