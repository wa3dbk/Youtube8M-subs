 that it has on its instinct, ie it is not 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.950
 very useful for us at the moment 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.900
 here we have another little manual which 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.380

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.570
 proper left just get the focus here is 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.060
 how to properly maintain the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.640
 mink pocket knife case is like 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.740

 languages 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.430
 good, let's go to the good stuff 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.430
 first talking a little about 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.440
 the dimensions public victorinox camper 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.290
 he has nine centimeters 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.500
 length and two centimeters're 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.320
 thickness or thickness of the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.090
 his most interesting knife is the fact 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.430
 that he only asks 74,898 little then 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.609
 you hardly feel it by pressing 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.019
 pocket or inside any type of 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.439
 sport that you use in your day to 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.470
 day 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.260
 OK 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.170
 the tools he uses are all 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.720
 described here in this list. 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.290
 that we are part of a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.730
 the first is the very large blade 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.680
 present in several models Video 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.110
 victorinox if not all 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.520
 I must also remember that all 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.020
 victorinox equipment comes 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.120
 extremely sharp then for you 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.380
 handle them without taking care not to 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.450
 ending up doing good is this first 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.520
 blade that for the most varied ne 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.980
 very tough is her son is 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.070
 It's very good and it takes too long to lose 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:02.190
 It's also there, then we have a 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:04.470
 small blade that is initially them 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.240
 teach as an example is for example 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.040
 for you to point pencils and things 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.260
 gender but at the end of the day it has 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.030
 a job for more 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.590
 elaborated also requiring greater 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.500
 level of detail 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.240
 we also have the classic corkscrew 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.000
 unique in all models of the 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.120
 victorinox who is this one with exception 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.670
 of some special models 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.010
 good is we also have the wooden saw 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.560
 which is very effective 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.790
 I was surprised by the effectiveness of this 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.709
 product is a saw enough enough 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.250
 sharp is she works very well in 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.140
 wood 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.540
 logical that you have to respect is the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.160
 size of a steering goes 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.260
 cut a tree trunk with a scene 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.450
 more severe up to five centimeters 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.330
 the day up to 10 centimeters in diameter 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.459
 Can you do it a lot? 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.370
 very clean fast 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.190
 we also have as additional small 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.500
 here is the toothpick that stays 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.560
 stored in the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.900
 you have to withdraw, it may seem 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.610
 silly plus a toothpick is one thing 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.750
 interesting to have in a 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.750
 camping trip 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.870
 we also have the tweezers 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.870
 other side 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.449
 the tweezers I think is very useful 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.910
 mainly to take any type 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.620
 of freitas that enter your hand there 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.380
 small objects this will be 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.300
 difficult for you to take another way 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.940
 huh 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.940
 we also have the can opener 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:48.910
 It's very effective. It promises to 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.870
 simple function is great the quality is 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.389
 very large 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.040
 remembering that here on the tip he has 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.040
 A small screwdriver lets me see 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.950
 I can focus on the camera 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.690
 good little small tip here 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:12.060
 Okay, and we have the 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:15.460
 bottles being that also has a slit 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.050
 can also be very useful. 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.610
 along with the seller of bottles we 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.070
 we have here is easier a trigger 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.200
 of yarn that this little tour here 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.539
 that it has a small spinning and that 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:37.240
 it eases at the time you have a capon 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:43.080
 and we also have a function and this 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:47.470
 rock face very useful 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.210
 Good, and we have something here too. 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.130
 I forgot to put it here on the list 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.770
 the little ring here for you to hang on 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.260
 any other accessory you have 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.030
 if you want to learn to draw where 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.000
 Netão is enough and facilitates the 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.130
 transport of the penknife but in summary is 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.950
 a pretty pocketknife is not a pocketknife that 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.349
 You can walk with it in your pocket when 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.820
 you're in town is when 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.710
 going to the field is a pocketknife that he 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:16.169
 has very useful tools in both 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.979
 sceneries is it javi reviews on 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.570
 International where people say that 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.220
 he has invested more than 20 years he 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.960
 continues to operate, which is 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.599
 victorinox quality feature 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.990
 It's scans in specific 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.760
 remembering that I bought in Sao Paulo 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.800
 he paid me around 90 and his friend 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.659
 were 97 reais 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.590
 It's the time when I'm doing this. 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:37.750
 video I do not know how 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.330
 this value can switch depending on 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.980
 when you watch it was okay but 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.360
 so it's a great penknife for who is 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.730
 starting think if you are looking 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.890
 of his first brand setback and a 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.210
 Army knife that does not call attention to 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.800
 negative shape when you are 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.200
 walking down the street when you step on a 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.630
 bank and leave it there in the doorway 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.760
 to pass on the metal detector is a 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.650
 Great universe for you have good for 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.850
 to camp also the knife that will supply 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.190
 your needs 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.470
 You will not be disappointed, will you? 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.190
 with a victorinox pocketknife 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.890
 you'll probably want to finish 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.080
 buying other models also in the 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.300
 It's a great penknife trying to entrance a 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.440
 relatively low value for quality 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.930
 What are you going to achieve? 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.820
 obviously if you can buy by 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.230
 outside or directly by the states 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.970
 united for you will pay much more 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.070
 cheap but who does not have this 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.450
 possibility is victor north ends 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.770
 finding many places there 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.660
 mainly in the capitals 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.000
 there are shops in the mall that sell 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.360
 Victorinox in the then is an easy mark 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.100
 access to everyone is in comparison to 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.650
 Obviously mind head and forget 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.480
 along with there is the victorinox klimber 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.750
 which is another pocket knife also of 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.370
 well- known entry from victorinox to 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.460
 difference is that he takes the 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:51.100
 Wood places the scissors and also 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.930
 adds a hook so that're 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.640
 differentiation between these two 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.690
 models that are very similar in 

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.220
 their functions 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.540
 No, I'll stay here, I hope. 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.340
 Did you like this review? 

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.080
