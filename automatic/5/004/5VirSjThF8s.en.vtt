00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.019
 exists independent of the body 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.029
 when the body 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.299
 can not wait for a continuity 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.299
 with this result the list is the view of religions in general 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.079
 the materialism 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.209
 is that person who says that when the body dies 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.749
 the weapon disappeared 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.480
 the thesis that the soul 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.970
 there is nothing beyond that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.120
 the product of matter 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.330
 the journalists do not know how to eat lunch in the forest 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.410
 something 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.440
 something the outbreak of dengue explains 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.800
 physicist 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.690
 within that year 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.710
 even better 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.380
 if for some reason it has no logic 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.650
 able to understand 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.650
 other injured next 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.920
 through their experience 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.950
 Your team is already well. 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.950
 who was the case the case dragged 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.580
 I imagine if I deal 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.350
 with these problems told 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.230
 in a different way 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.010
 it's this show 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.080
 these were the French families 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.550
 the letter that in March this pay for it 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.660
 You'd better be the one. 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.160
 the current capacity to check in has nothing to do and to happen in 60 days 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.040
 I can not understand why 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 and you want to know 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 another document 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.470
 a heavy vehicle 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.340
 a certain end 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.830
 the municipality of sinop 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.490
 your border body 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.080
 the only way out of this 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.400
 some get rid of any sensitivity 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.080
 of any social class 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.290
 in this sense 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.310
 our perception also that a body 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.540
 that it undergoes an intentional loss of consciousness 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.249
 how do you have a body that you had done and for everything on an ongoing basis 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:16.969
 it causes you to suffer and this suffering leads to the awareness it 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.159
 gets shaken 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.329
 it is necessary that it results in the story that we know a little of ourselves 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.050
 it's no accident 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.050
 e.g. 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.069
 a portion of the capacity not to suffer in heat 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.469
 it seemed not to be the release of any feeling of any action 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.469
 of any case in question 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.529
 in item 6 3 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.529
 the financial crises he said 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.249
 this perception 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.529
 from bryan singer 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.449
 accepting 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.999
 in fact no one really knows 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.199
 if they say they know 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.199
 bussunda 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.739
 burris 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.779
 all this movement 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.779
 to argue gently 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.309
 the pregnancy 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:50.669
 if you are a point of view 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.849
 You have to watch on the TV from every part of the project. 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.049
 when asked about tevez 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.069
 What is the root of the conference? 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.470
 How do you explain her? 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.219
 the difficult moments 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.219
 the subject is the starting point I'm a coward 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.459
 there is no such thing as the fact that from this finding of consumption 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.499
 earlier this year 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:13.949
 there has to be 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.949
 after the first 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.710
 basic components such as 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.460
 one of the grandchildren of the world 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460
 what we ended 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.419
 the child 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.419
 being made by the force of our own hands 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.999
 knows her 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.860
 We even surpassed the philadelphia inquirer. 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.520
 we do not have to learn to look on the positive side of the human being 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.759
 nani and understand that this will become a constituent part of the body however 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.779
 will never arrive in the state 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.620
 of total Palestinian conflict dominance 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.979
 at this time 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.400
 that besides body and soul 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.659
 we have the basement was the chosen one 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.379
 and I wanted it to be something that you really were 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.779
 and that outside you have to clean his door continuously 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.059
 so the court opened that the zoo auditor 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:18.479
 when the zoo opens when you can weird 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.759
 that is when you lose the ability to perceive the set when you 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.419
 sleeps 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.059
 when you are 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:29.209
 has managed the content of the agreement with the type of protection and so on 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.249
 following experience 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.499
 and if I did it marin cilic that a hair 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.270
 which was decisive
