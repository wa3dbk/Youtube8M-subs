special<00:00:20.779> definitely<00:00:21.779> worth<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> 4<00:00:22.350> dollars

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680

because<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.130> applies<00:00:25.010> flying<00:00:26.010> spun<00:00:27.260> you<00:00:28.260> jump

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
because it applies flying spun you jump

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.009 
because it applies flying spun you jump
higher<00:00:28.680> too<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.300> hover<00:00:30.300> mode<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.810> I

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
higher too when you have hover mode on I

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.200 
higher too when you have hover mode on I
didn't<00:00:31.949> pick<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> quickest<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.030> to

it<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.510> really<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.680> simplest<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.469> go

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it but really the simplest and just go

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
it but really the simplest and just go
to<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.280> first<00:00:38.730> turn<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> left<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:39.809> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to the first turn on the left I think of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.069 
to the first turn on the left I think of
anything<00:00:40.140> down<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.040> road<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.809> you'll<00:00:42.809> lift
