00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
venipuncture code for lab draws so what

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.139 
venipuncture code for lab draws so what
I<00:00:43.170> did<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.559> went<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.070> supercoder<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
I did is I went out to supercoder and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.910 
I did is I went out to supercoder and
just<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.600> pulled<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> code<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.829> we

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
just kind of pulled in the code so we

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
just kind of pulled in the code so we
could<00:00:47.070> take<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> look<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
could take a look and and this one is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.290 
could take a look and and this one is
actually<00:00:49.460> three<00:00:50.460> six<00:00:50.670> four<00:00:50.940> ten<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.719> an<00:00:52.680> age

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
actually three six four ten is an age

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
actually three six four ten is an age
specific<00:00:54.300> code<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.320> age<00:00:55.530> three<00:00:56.010> or

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
specific code so it's for age three or

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.150 
specific code so it's for age three or
under<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:58.530> patient<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
under and it's for when the patient is a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.240 
under and it's for when the patient is a
hard<00:00:59.550> stick<00:01:00.030> meaning<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> physician<00:01:01.469> needs

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
hard stick meaning the physician needs

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.080 
hard stick meaning the physician needs
to<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.910> maybe<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.400> normal<00:01:05.760> person

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to do it so maybe the the normal person

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.020 
to do it so maybe the the normal person
doing<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> blood<00:01:06.570> draw<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.110> cannot<00:01:07.880> get<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
doing the blood draw just cannot get it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
doing the blood draw just cannot get it
to<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.500> work<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:10.920> call<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to you know to work so they call in the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
to you know to work so they call in the
physician<00:01:11.670> okay<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.170> why<00:01:13.320> three<00:01:13.530> six

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
physician okay so that's why three six

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.649 
physician okay so that's why three six
four<00:01:13.920> ten<00:01:14.159> venipuncture<00:01:14.760> age<00:01:15.030> three<00:01:15.330> years<00:01:15.540> or

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
four ten venipuncture age three years or

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.190 
four ten venipuncture age three years or
older<00:01:16.939> necessitating<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.180> skill<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:19.020> a

therapeutic<00:01:24.530> purposes<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.979> that's<00:01:26.220> why<00:01:26.400> it's

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
therapeutic purposes so that's why it's

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
therapeutic purposes so that's why it's
not<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> routine<00:01:27.450> venipuncture<00:01:28.020> it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
not for the routine venipuncture it's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.880 
not for the routine venipuncture it's
when<00:01:28.380> they're<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> hard<00:01:28.829> stick<00:01:29.189> okay<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> then

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
when they're a hard stick okay and then

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.720 
when they're a hard stick okay and then
and<00:01:33.310> it's<00:01:33.790> in<00:01:33.970> its<00:01:34.180> age-based<00:01:34.390> as<00:01:34.990> well<00:01:35.730> we're

by then a puncture that's your your
routine<00:01:42.130> one<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.610> then<00:01:43.180> I<00:01:43.390> found<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.930> good

younger and you needed the physician to
do<00:02:53.110> it

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
do it

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.860 
do it
okay<00:02:55.290> all<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.460> was<00:02:56.550> pointed<00:02:56.910> out<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.030> I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
okay all right it was pointed out that I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.680 
okay all right it was pointed out that I
said<00:02:58.620> age<00:02:58.950> three<00:02:59.400> years<00:02:59.640> are<00:02:59.820> younger<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.300> meant

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
said age three years are younger I meant

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
said age three years are younger I meant
older<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:02.270> read<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.390> wrong<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.020> is<00:03:04.320> an<00:03:04.470> age

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
older I read it wrong so it is an age

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.100 
older I read it wrong so it is an age
based<00:03:04.980> code<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.850> that's<00:03:06.660> one<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:06.960> the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
based code so that's one of the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.870 
based code so that's one of the
differences<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.070> had<00:03:08.280> someone<00:03:08.850> that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
differences so if you had someone that

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.400 
differences so if you had someone that
was<00:03:08.970> younger<00:03:09.360> than<00:03:09.510> three<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.810> would<00:03:09.900> not<00:03:10.140> use

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
was younger than three you would not use

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.500 
was younger than three you would not use
three<00:03:10.710> six<00:03:10.950> four<00:03:11.130> ten<00:03:11.400> you'd<00:03:12.000> use<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.360> for

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
three six four ten you'd use it for

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.750 
three six four ten you'd use it for
someone<00:03:12.720> older<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.980> key<00:03:14.280> difference<00:03:14.700> between

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
someone older the key difference between

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.060 
someone older the key difference between
410<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.750> 415<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:17.180> needing<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.560> physician<00:03:20.010> to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
410 and 415 is needing the physician to

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.410 
410 and 415 is needing the physician to
come<00:03:20.130> do<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.520> because<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.760> patient's<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.210> hard

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
come do it because the patient's a hard
