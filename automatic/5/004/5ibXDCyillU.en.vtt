we're gonna be working on a simple sweet

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.750 
we're gonna be working on a simple sweet
pattern<00:00:33.840> that's<00:00:34.620> actually<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.190> looks<00:00:35.430> quite

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
pattern that's actually that looks quite

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.460 
pattern that's actually that looks quite
complicated<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.350> all

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
complicated but it's not really at all

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.350 
complicated but it's not really at all
it's<00:00:37.620> very<00:00:37.890> simple<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.460> sweeps<00:00:39.030> are<00:00:39.180> just

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it's very simple and sweeps are just

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540 
it's very simple and sweeps are just
sweeping<00:00:39.870> one<00:00:40.170> limb<00:00:40.410> from<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.219> part<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
sweeping one limb from one part of the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.100 
sweeping one limb from one part of the
drumset<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> next<00:00:42.390> part<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> drum<00:00:42.899> set

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
drumset to the next part of the drum set

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.600 
drumset to the next part of the drum set
so<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.380> fairly<00:00:43.620> simple<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.250> sweep<00:00:44.460> from

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so it's fairly simple I can sweep from

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.639 
so it's fairly simple I can sweep from
my<00:00:44.790> floor<00:00:45.090> tom<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.540> snare<00:00:45.809> drum<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.410> rat
