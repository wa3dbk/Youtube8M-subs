00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.600 
okay now to that little that part okay
are<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.070> doing<00:02:36.280> right<00:02:36.430> here<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.880> your<00:02:37.690> gone

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
are you doing right here is your gone

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.300 
are you doing right here is your gone
mmm

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.270 

and<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:45.700> okay<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.950> can<00:02:48.099> probably

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
and then that okay so you can probably

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.400 
and then that okay so you can probably
see<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.760> right<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.930> D<00:02:50.140> chord

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
see that right there the in the D chord

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.729 
see that right there the in the D chord
you're<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:51.720> hitting<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.750> hitting<00:02:53.650> that

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
you're just hitting that hitting that

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.510 
you're just hitting that hitting that
right<00:02:53.920> there<00:02:54.099> hmm<00:02:54.819> hitting<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.480> G<00:02:55.780> string

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
right there hmm hitting this G string

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.050 
right there hmm hitting this G string
pull<00:02:57.520> off<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:02.709> got<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.980> hit<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.190> open<00:03:03.819> string

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
pull off you got to hit that open string

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.309 
pull off you got to hit that open string
right<00:03:04.300> there<00:03:04.360> because<00:03:04.660> that's<00:03:04.780> what<00:03:04.989> creates

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
right there because that's what creates

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.960 
right there because that's what creates
the<00:03:05.440> whole<00:03:05.590> effect<00:03:08.310> okay<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.459> don't<00:03:09.610> have<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.760> pic

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
the whole effect okay I don't have a pic

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.199 
the whole effect okay I don't have a pic
right<00:03:10.180> now<00:03:10.300> so<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> little<00:03:10.720> hard<00:03:12.180> some<00:03:13.180> of

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
right now so it's a little hard some of

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:22.340 
right now so it's a little hard some of
that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.140 

so<00:03:23.350> yeah<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:24.160> can<00:03:24.340> even<00:03:24.580> skip<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.090> I

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
so yeah just you can even skip that I

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:34.509 
so yeah just you can even skip that I
guess<00:03:26.610> so

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.820 

just<00:03:35.519> play<00:03:35.730> along<00:03:35.879> with<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.450> song<00:03:36.830> and

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
just play along with this song and

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.589 
just play along with this song and
you'll<00:03:38.040> figure<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.459> out<00:03:38.670> that's<00:03:39.000> what<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.299> did<00:03:39.569> I

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
you'll figure it out that's what I did I

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.930 
you'll figure it out that's what I did I
just<00:03:39.720> figured<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.799> out<00:03:40.950> because<00:03:41.340> all<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.670> tabs

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
just figured it out because all the tabs

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.430 
just figured it out because all the tabs
out<00:03:42.239> there<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.510> mean<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.810> looked<00:03:43.110> at<00:03:43.290> them

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
out there I mean I looked at them

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.250 
out there I mean I looked at them
sometimes<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.890> look<00:03:44.010> at<00:03:44.129> tabs<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.989> cheat

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
sometimes I look at tabs just to cheat

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.940 
sometimes I look at tabs just to cheat
to<00:03:46.470> make<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.709> quicker<00:03:46.950> but<00:03:48.530> none<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.680> them<00:03:49.830> are

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
to make it quicker but none of them are

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.830 
to make it quicker but none of them are
right<00:03:50.129> really<00:03:50.730> they<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:50.970> were<00:03:51.540> just

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
right really they all were just

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.289 
right really they all were just
different<00:03:52.709> all<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.489> ones<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.760> saw<00:03:53.940> anyway<00:03:54.239> so

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299
