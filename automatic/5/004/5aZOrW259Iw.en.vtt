will cut three strips based on the size

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.030 
will cut three strips based on the size
of<00:00:29.119> pattern<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.300> want<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.890> because<00:00:31.890> you

of pattern you want to do because you
can<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.820> several<00:00:33.120> sizes<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.380> in

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
can do it in several sizes and I have in

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.150 
can do it in several sizes and I have in
front<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.890> me<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.239> small<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
front of me the the small one and a

front of me the the small one and a
large<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.239> then<00:00:39.899> there<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:41.270> six<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
large one and then there are six and a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
large one and then there are six and a
half<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.989> actually<00:00:43.320> 7<00:00:43.620> 1/2<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.280> 7<00:00:44.670> 1/2

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
half this is actually 7 1/2 a 7 1/2

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.590 
half this is actually 7 1/2 a 7 1/2
belly<00:00:45.899> button<00:00:46.350> there's<00:00:46.530> 7<00:00:47.070> 1/2<00:00:47.280> minis<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.030> the

six and a half group so once you get

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.529 
six and a half group so once you get
your<00:00:51.629> pattern<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:52.739> tell<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:54.270> size

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
your pattern it will tell you what size

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.799 
your pattern it will tell you what size

of strips that you need to cut to create

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.180 
of strips that you need to cut to create
the<00:00:58.050> look<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.039> want<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> achieve<00:01:01.190> as

line up two of the solid lines on those
seam<00:03:38.730> allowances<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:40.790> then<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.970> cut<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.660> you

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
seam allowances and then you cut and you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.280 
seam allowances and then you cut and you
don't<00:03:43.650> want<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.950> cut<00:03:44.190> clear<00:03:44.670> too<00:03:45.630> far<00:03:45.959> into

don't want to cut clear too far into

don't want to cut clear too far into
this<00:03:46.650> section<00:03:46.920> because<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:47.459> want<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.790> be<00:03:47.940> able

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
this section because we want to be able

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.970 
this section because we want to be able
to<00:03:48.209> use<00:03:48.690> all<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:50.250> strip<00:03:50.730> for<00:03:51.060> our<00:03:51.330> blocks<00:03:51.980> so

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
to use all this strip for our blocks so

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:13.600 
to use all this strip for our blocks so
you<00:03:53.010> cut<00:04:01.250> as<00:04:02.250> far<00:04:02.640> as<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.239> need<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:04.080> get<00:04:04.350> your

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.000 

and<00:04:14.610> I'm<00:04:14.880> going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.060> line<00:04:15.299> it<00:04:15.330> up<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.859> lot<00:04:16.859> of

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
and I'm going to line it up a lot of

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.430 
and I'm going to line it up a lot of
times<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.489> will<00:04:17.549> also<00:04:18.030> use<00:04:18.209> my<00:04:18.419> turntable<00:04:19.290> when

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
times I will also use my turntable when

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.370 
times I will also use my turntable when
I'm<00:04:19.940> cutting<00:04:20.940> these<00:04:21.239> especially<00:04:21.780> when<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.109> use

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
I'm cutting these especially when I use

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.290 
I'm cutting these especially when I use
in<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.740> smaller<00:04:23.390> block<00:04:24.890> now<00:04:25.890> don't<00:04:26.250> throw<00:04:26.669> any

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
in the smaller block now don't throw any

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.630 
in the smaller block now don't throw any
of<00:04:27.600> your<00:04:27.780> pieces<00:04:28.050> away<00:04:28.380> because<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.070> lot<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.550> the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
of your pieces away because a lot of the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.900 
of your pieces away because a lot of the
patterns<00:04:29.940> are<00:04:30.810> designed<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:31.560> use<00:04:32.010> these

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
patterns are designed to use these

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.960 
patterns are designed to use these
pieces<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.840> we<00:04:34.050> cut<00:04:34.350> away<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.040> I'll<00:04:35.700> show

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
pieces that we cut away and I'll show

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.480 
pieces that we cut away and I'll show
you<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.210> in<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.750> couple<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:37.140> samples<00:04:37.740> but

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
you that in a couple of samples but

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.880 
you that in a couple of samples but
there's<00:04:38.729> one<00:04:39.030> block<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.750> then<00:04:40.229> you<00:04:40.260> just<00:04:40.650> come

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
there's one block and then you just come

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.330 
there's one block and then you just come
along<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:42.169> line<00:04:43.169> up<00:04:43.910> again

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
along and line up again

00:04:46.340 --> 00:05:11.880 
along and line up again
and<00:04:48.470> cut

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.640 

so<00:05:12.890> this<00:05:13.220> is<00:05:13.490> our<00:05:13.670> blog<00:05:14.000> that<00:05:14.540> we<00:05:14.900> use<00:05:15.850> in

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
so this is our blog that we use in

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.580 
so this is our blog that we use in
several<00:05:18.650> of<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.940> designs<00:05:20.420> from<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.440> Xbox<00:05:22.240> and

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
several of the designs from the Xbox and

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.560 
several of the designs from the Xbox and
then<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:25.370> pattern<00:05:25.640> will<00:05:25.910> tell<00:05:25.940> us<00:05:26.240> how<00:05:26.390> we're

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
then the pattern will tell us how we're

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.030 
then the pattern will tell us how we're
going<00:05:26.690> to<00:05:26.750> put<00:05:26.960> them<00:05:27.050> together<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:27.800> maybe

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
going to put them together and maybe

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.440 
going to put them together and maybe
we're<00:05:28.280> going<00:05:28.400> to<00:05:28.490> put<00:05:28.640> them<00:05:28.730> together<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.210> that

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
we're going to put them together so that

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.140 
we're going to put them together so that
eventually<00:05:29.870> we<00:05:30.140> create<00:05:30.560> a<00:05:30.590> star<00:05:30.950> like<00:05:31.850> I<00:05:31.970> said

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
eventually we create a star like I said

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.750 
eventually we create a star like I said
we<00:05:32.300> want<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.600> keep<00:05:32.780> these<00:05:33.050> pieces<00:05:33.760> because

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
we want to keep these pieces because

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.500 
we want to keep these pieces because
they<00:05:35.090> can<00:05:35.840> be<00:05:36.020> sewn<00:05:36.350> together<00:05:36.680> and<00:05:37.240> put<00:05:38.240> in<00:05:38.390> the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
they can be sewn together and put in the

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.320 
they can be sewn together and put in the
borders<00:05:38.930> so<00:05:39.740> some<00:05:40.040> of<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.250> other<00:05:40.400> examples<00:05:40.640> I

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
borders so some of the other examples I

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.070 
borders so some of the other examples I
have<00:05:41.710> using<00:05:42.710> this<00:05:43.010> particular<00:05:43.400> technique<00:05:44.270> are

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
have using this particular technique are

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.640 
have using this particular technique are
done<00:05:45.350> in<00:05:45.500> this<00:05:45.680> baby<00:05:46.010> blanket<00:05:47.440> here's<00:05:48.440> the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
done in this baby blanket here's the

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.090 
done in this baby blanket here's the
block<00:05:49.150> right<00:05:50.150> here<00:05:50.210> here<00:05:51.200> was<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.770> three

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
block right here here was the three

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.400 
block right here here was the three
strips<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:52.940> you'll<00:05:53.570> see<00:05:53.780> in<00:05:53.870> this<00:05:53.990> one<00:05:54.170> there

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
strips and you'll see in this one there

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.470 
strips and you'll see in this one there
strips<00:05:54.950> are<00:05:55.130> different<00:05:55.580> sizes<00:05:55.820> but<00:05:56.270> that's

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
strips are different sizes but that's

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.680 
strips are different sizes but that's
the<00:05:56.750> reads<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.710> create<00:05:58.010> a<00:05:58.040> different<00:05:58.370> look

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
the reads to create a different look

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.440 
the reads to create a different look
then<00:05:59.690> with<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.140> layout<00:06:00.700> it<00:06:01.700> actually<00:06:02.180> created

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
then with the layout it actually created

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.240 
then with the layout it actually created
this<00:06:02.690> little<00:06:02.990> star<00:06:03.290> that's<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.650> little<00:06:03.860> harder

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
this little star that's a little harder

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.820 
this little star that's a little harder
to<00:06:04.370> see<00:06:04.400> because<00:06:05.150> of<00:06:05.360> all<00:06:05.600> the<00:06:05.810> random<00:06:06.110> fabrics

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
to see because of all the random fabrics

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.660 
to see because of all the random fabrics
that<00:06:06.920> I<00:06:07.070> used<00:06:07.430> but<00:06:08.420> if<00:06:08.540> you<00:06:08.690> look<00:06:08.900> over<00:06:09.200> here

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
that I used but if you look over here

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.540 
that I used but if you look over here
the<00:06:10.670> scrap<00:06:11.000> pieces<00:06:11.360> are<00:06:11.870> right<00:06:12.740> here<00:06:13.160> in<00:06:13.340> the

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
the scrap pieces are right here in the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.320 
the scrap pieces are right here in the
border<00:06:13.910> whether<00:06:14.690> in<00:06:15.200> this<00:06:15.530> particular<00:06:15.860> case

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
border whether in this particular case

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.900 
border whether in this particular case
they<00:06:17.330> were<00:06:17.510> cut<00:06:17.720> go<00:06:17.960> in<00:06:18.140> that<00:06:18.290> direction<00:06:18.910> but

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
they were cut go in that direction but

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.660 
they were cut go in that direction but
there<00:06:20.120> they<00:06:20.300> are<00:06:20.350> all<00:06:21.350> the<00:06:21.830> way<00:06:21.950> around<00:06:22.370> the

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
there they are all the way around the

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.850 
there they are all the way around the
scrap<00:06:22.970> is<00:06:23.210> used<00:06:23.510> and<00:06:23.810> that's<00:06:24.260> one<00:06:24.650> of<00:06:24.680> the

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
scrap is used and that's one of the

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.650 
scrap is used and that's one of the
reasons<00:06:25.250> I<00:06:25.400> like<00:06:25.790> this<00:06:26.060> technique<00:06:26.390> is<00:06:27.020> because

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
reasons I like this technique is because

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.140 
reasons I like this technique is because
we<00:06:29.660> use<00:06:29.900> up<00:06:30.230> all<00:06:30.410> those<00:06:30.590> pieces<00:06:31.010> but<00:06:31.640> not<00:06:31.880> in

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
we use up all those pieces but not in

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.350 
we use up all those pieces but not in
every<00:06:32.390> one<00:06:32.570> but<00:06:33.070> it<00:06:34.070> is<00:06:34.310> good<00:06:34.580> here<00:06:34.910> is<00:06:35.030> another

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
every one but it is good here is another

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.940 
every one but it is good here is another
one<00:06:35.950> use<00:06:36.950> the<00:06:37.340> exact<00:06:37.790> same<00:06:38.270> method<00:06:38.840> here's<00:06:39.710> our

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
one use the exact same method here's our

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.720 
one use the exact same method here's our
square<00:06:40.370> is<00:06:40.640> right<00:06:41.180> in<00:06:42.110> here<00:06:42.680> we<00:06:43.250> get<00:06:43.430> it<00:06:43.520> going

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
square is right in here we get it going

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.960 
square is right in here we get it going
this<00:06:43.940> way<00:06:44.120> there<00:06:44.510> we<00:06:44.630> go<00:06:45.100> so<00:06:46.100> the<00:06:46.400> three<00:06:46.670> strips

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
this way there we go so the three strips

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.990 
this way there we go so the three strips
were<00:06:47.150> sewn<00:06:47.360> together<00:06:47.680> we<00:06:48.680> cut<00:06:48.980> when<00:06:49.640> we<00:06:49.670> sewed

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
were sewn together we cut when we sewed

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.370 
were sewn together we cut when we sewed
them<00:06:50.090> back<00:06:50.150> together<00:06:50.510> we<00:06:50.870> created<00:06:51.260> this

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
them back together we created this

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.890 
them back together we created this
wonderful<00:06:52.040> row<00:06:52.400> of<00:06:52.580> Christmas<00:06:53.150> trees<00:06:53.600> and

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
wonderful row of Christmas trees and

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.290 
wonderful row of Christmas trees and
then<00:06:54.740> follow<00:06:55.070> the<00:06:55.310> rest<00:06:55.520> of<00:06:55.670> the<00:06:55.760> pattern<00:06:56.000> to

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
then follow the rest of the pattern to

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.190 
then follow the rest of the pattern to
put<00:06:56.570> the<00:06:57.170> borders<00:06:57.560> on<00:06:58.150> here<00:06:59.150> is<00:06:59.330> an<00:06:59.480> another

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
put the borders on here is an another

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.780 
put the borders on here is an another
one<00:07:00.530> another<00:07:01.490> great<00:07:02.030> look<00:07:02.950> again<00:07:03.950> here's<00:07:04.580> our

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
one another great look again here's our

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.520 
one another great look again here's our
square<00:07:05.740> three<00:07:06.740> strips<00:07:07.280> and<00:07:07.900> then<00:07:08.900> this<00:07:09.230> one

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
square three strips and then this one

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.670 
square three strips and then this one
here<00:07:09.770> we<00:07:09.950> actually<00:07:10.640> cut<00:07:10.970> one<00:07:11.870> set<00:07:12.200> of<00:07:12.350> strips

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
here we actually cut one set of strips

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.820 
here we actually cut one set of strips
where<00:07:13.280> we<00:07:13.400> can<00:07:13.580> read<00:07:13.940> where<00:07:14.840> it<00:07:14.930> says<00:07:15.140> X<00:07:15.470> blocks

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
where we can read where it says X blocks

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.719 
where we can read where it says X blocks
in<00:07:16.190> the<00:07:16.310> mid

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
in the mid

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.390 
in the mid
and<00:07:16.819> then<00:07:17.659> the<00:07:17.780> other<00:07:17.930> set<00:07:18.259> is<00:07:18.289> flipped<00:07:19.159> over

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
and then the other set is flipped over

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.290 
and then the other set is flipped over
and<00:07:19.729> cut<00:07:20.240> from<00:07:21.159> the<00:07:22.159> other<00:07:22.189> angle<00:07:22.520> get<00:07:22.939> it<00:07:23.060> get

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300 
and cut from the other angle get it get

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.450 
and cut from the other angle get it get
the<00:07:23.449> right<00:07:23.629> side<00:07:23.900> and<00:07:24.139> that's<00:07:24.860> what<00:07:25.099> created

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
the right side and that's what created

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.589 
the right side and that's what created
that<00:07:25.580> left<00:07:26.300> and<00:07:26.629> right<00:07:27.379> look<00:07:27.889> once<00:07:28.819> again<00:07:29.030> the

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 
that left and right look once again the

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.629 
that left and right look once again the
scraps<00:07:29.960> were<00:07:30.650> used<00:07:31.009> in<00:07:31.310> the<00:07:31.789> border<00:07:33.310> the<00:07:34.310> same

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 
scraps were used in the border the same
