00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 Known and abdullah in the session and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.359
 today a really fun gameplay 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.490
 cheap single cash straight in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.719
 Germany at the moment but I know 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.150
 not that I can tell you that ye 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.820
 leave you soon my custos 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.100
 gameplay so far but that's at 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 denner and indeed it is a honor to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.210
 say it is actually a double camps 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.029
 dirt is as good as but she is so much 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 pitch had the game so I say now 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 I first had a 31 at the beginning 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 train with msps out of rock and then 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.759
 after that it was not cut but 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.530
 I've got you swift where you're safe 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.450
 go and after that I had in the Taunus has 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.210
 quite trick and one assist a 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.760
 start at and an assist now 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.100
 a button had the second fight 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.350
 what it spends was played the king 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.309
 and then find next ten seconds 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.829
 I just do not have an opponent anymore 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 we would quit the game is over 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.780
 But while that made for 15 seconds 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.100
 left and recognize rausgeholt than me 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.510
 but you do not want to have chris 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.590
 output might have now merkel 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.329
 but can get I wanted to 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.699
 number sure and so is the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.890
 But smallest claus cut without funny 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.420
 that they simply it is yes I have 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.070
 actually not quite that gambled though 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.220
 with a colleague, I also know that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.659
 clique the yoga or the tv duel everyone 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.939
 if you do not know then I really know 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.140
 not if you look on youtube but 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.640
 despite lower to quasi kitchen 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 routinely and me only 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.890
 quotes so many comics april 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.700
 do not know what but as palpable jews 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.880
 I still do not care about the two of them 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 sure and fast what is here 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.240
 urgently on the stock on it and hitler 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.290
 it is not easy then 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.670
 is a damn camps bay 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.619
 Well, I have two in total now 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 fat double artist is one and have 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.250
 alexander uploaded and already 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.979
 somehow nine or ten camps tracks 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.860
 and only paper fits in yesterday 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.090
 the way through that has sometime adapts 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770
 in a description also who weeks 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.149
 decide 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.560
 and yes the first with 15 hours 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.259
 playing time I always pass 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.409
 30 hours of playing time did not even have 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.780
 still bad result so well only 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.820
 so 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.830
 and exactly to the gameplay and how 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.190
 said with the sps played on the walk 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.940
 Domination quite normal and what do I want 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.370
 was probably red from the pen now 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.810
 the best i can i have on 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.880
 defended his time defended his time 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.500
 So three firearms only a maximum of three 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.980
 So just need a protection 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.980
 point what most of the svp 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.569
 threatened because everything is real shit and 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.920
 apparently quite normal that is synonymous 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.790
 ranger tip brand but her weeks 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.170
 just shit then played that now 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.630
 a little bit recently the pact he knew 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.100
 so many markets and policemen 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.080
 you somehow shortened 17 different 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.070
 parks are a bit hard at first 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.090
 notice 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.390
 It was in the beginning I believe it 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.660
 Yes, there would be a stalker at the beginning 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.540
 then preparation resembled and then still 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.540
 somehow that after right after 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.070
 amplifier exactly so quotes practically 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.530
 I hope that means more exactly 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.970
 and that's when I first had caspers 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.260
 later , only cats are cunning 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.510
 then caught and intensive stations the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:21.660
 hottest bonus somehow to iwata as 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.920
 as a ninth third special focus so 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.250
 12 is also really useful for max and 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.130
 raffles and for msps and as he had 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.500
 the specialist stayed in hardliner 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.049
 stations to again show our the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.280
 setup maybe wonder yes i will 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.530
 In any case soon as far as I am 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.709
 pc have class that make us like q 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.940
 Cells at best somewhere somehow good 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.519
 great dakar knowledge is enough for everyone 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.959
 case again awarded so and says on 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.850
 getting the best video clips is one 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.400
 compact four play here times 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.340
 few tips by the way and neither 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.769
 wednesday will be best for you 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.780
 not all the time studied most 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.620
 easy time 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.569
 reading is ruhr territory is only mine so 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.510
 next to the flag from the left list 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.480
 in front at such awarded chuck berry 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.430
 heard these stocks I would have it 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.620
 somehow not right in the game so 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.639
 sound like something from encrypted to 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.310
 splash game of domination or death 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.590
 match but almost only on should manager 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.630
 as I said, it's the best way 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.970
 in this way as the opponents 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.050
 intercept this has investors from these 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.060
 to a real 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.910
 so there are two outputs too 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.140
 ask another direction ours 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.150
 take another direction is the exit 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.630
 a spot by the way and away from behind 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.480
 expand abroad and lay next to the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.440
 transport 2 even so that you know yes 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.419
 just spend a great match here 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.240
 sure how chips many people will be nice 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.110
 I would not create by any means 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.390
 estimated by any race team 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.070
 but if cams tricks but as a tip 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.979
 that just such a high traffic area so 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.360
 So that means it was just too much going on 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.510
 is much against that many people want 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.270
 come a lot action swr position everything 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.220
 can do sound with her that 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.979
 such rias comes out as well 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.470
 ever and you can you so 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.490
 advantage it is my will 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.410
 I look've also a big part 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.950
 also safe in the gameplay weeks ahead 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.630
 unfortunately I play a game before that 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.680
 has passed you can do what McCanns 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.760
 really hearty yet 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.220
 can obtain it somehow 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.479
 one in ahaus would have shown 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.810
 but I thought I could 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.190
 I do not have that without viii zr anyway 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.560
 was really shared so just looks in the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.979
 cache in jura trust ev I know 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.440
 but in any case I am 60 and 70 ps 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.580
 I am quite sure and that should be possible 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.250
 kinda not a bit 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.500
 other so what I wake up comes 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.860
 janka comes this time also a car renault 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.260
 first to visit and had to enter 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.160
 little bit of life without 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.990
 In any case, it would be nice if you 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.750
 if you could let her miss easier 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.900
 as soon as you have 406 off we have it 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.400
 directly my bad fights and you 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.249
 is really fast i would 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.809
 But do not say so now 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:09.469
 the fastest does not even choose that 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:12.229
 so yes a year has gone faster 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:14.569
 in any case under two minutes 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.489
 40 I believe or and to the good 3 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.019
 I certainly stream 

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:19.459
 in third place has me it has apple 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:21.919
 like soon no longer cope the 

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:24.859
 whole class setup videos and said 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.779
 patient proficient tutorial video like 

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:27.199
 best extreme can technically 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:28.699
 heavy 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.259
 I already have many people 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.199
 getting better now from yesterday 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.819
 but drop off immediately and hope so 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.049
 I like the käppi what was there and 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.429
 I forgot to comment as I said 

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:38.989
 was already alex then comes my 

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:41.409
 fastest camps directly or download 

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:41.409
