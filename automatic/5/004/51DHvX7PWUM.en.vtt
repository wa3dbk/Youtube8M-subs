 As you can see from the market, when I pressed the search button to wipe the precious 8th road, 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.850
 Do not try to delete while some are able to know what you have retrieved a couple 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 There are those who have given up once. 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.060
 The poor merchant or love you showed me 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.890
 There are many cases where you want to delete this if there is a play . 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.430
 10 I called for you to delete your search history, because earlier in the Market 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 The history of the four records of the Ah 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.160

 Whether it's basically Market Search History or Google Maps Search History , 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.609
 There is an advantage that you can install everything 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.689
 And now youtube is inevitably the crocodile west, and you see here 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.470
 YouTube is a one-of-a-kind preference setting that lets you naturally enter 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.640
 I have. 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.320
 It's called clearing your search history . 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:21.470
 If you delete your search history, it will be deleted at once. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.820
 I once went in and searched for the contents of the funny video I have a trick 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.910
 Were there four things? 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.980
 In the state of 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:34.300
 Since the Hebrews do ray me that Lee's Figure 8a before me work when such 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.300
 Markets likewise 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:45.050
 I showed you the search history for that YouTube and I got it in the market . 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:49.130
 The situation in the Search History now To delete all this time history 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.659
 Take the laser and run the Delete selected item 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.189
 Then the record is marked 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.189
 Back into the market 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.040
 If you click on the magnifying glass, you can see the search history 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.050
 This is not brooding Off 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.230
 Now, anyway, the load evidence below does not make sense.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.720
 And once again,

 At the bottom of the YouTube preferences, click Clear to give me a nauch record. 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.910
 Go back to YouTube, enter search, then hit 40 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.440
 This does not pop up 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.460
 When you receive a beautiful place that I mentioned earlier history of the laser in this way 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.920
 I did an unnecessary search, and I can take the enemy at once.
