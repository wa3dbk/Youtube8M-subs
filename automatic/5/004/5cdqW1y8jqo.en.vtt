00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 a few days to see if to remove this youtube 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.220
 this video is being like a video 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 bomb what is the tuesday of tuesday 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.630
 that these issues that I showed now is a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.670
 specific tweet for those who have a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.650
 with 3g and 3gs and for those in 6.0 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.650
 I do not know, I do not think many people have 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.210
 taken a lot of benefit from that tweet now 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.310
 same because not many people spend 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.349
 then they have I'm going to look for a tweet 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
 here something that really are not tweets 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.880
 but it is also a good functionality 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.420
 and interesting and what it allows you to do 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.920
 is in con der on a system to put it 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.079
 in one inside a folio because as 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.300
 can you see this one is never 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.700
 I do not use it at all at once but 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.070
 here they are already telling me diversity 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.140
 no longer want to be you know that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 with people who have migrated their iphone 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.469

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.989
 saying industrial I did not use it and I 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.079
 would like to save it in a folder and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.780
 I can not as you can see 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.879
 I can not save it and it really is 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.649
 application I do not like me at all I 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.500

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:12.649
 magazines in the blur and already put 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.600

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.610
 who says this program that is for me 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.229
