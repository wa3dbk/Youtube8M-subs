00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
I that I sort of look out and I think

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.750

who<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.810> mean<00:03:59.050> there<00:03:59.380> might<00:03:59.500> be<00:03:59.610> one<00:04:00.610> or<00:04:00.730> two

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
who I mean there might be one or two

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.870 
who I mean there might be one or two
players<00:04:01.120> you've<00:04:01.450> got<00:04:01.660> three

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.770 
players you've got three
like<00:04:02.360> that<00:04:02.570> but<00:04:03.820> if<00:04:04.820> it's<00:04:05.030> on<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.270> same<00:04:05.450> thing

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
like that but if it's on the same thing
