00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
Tuesday's every tuesday i'm going to

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.080 
Tuesday's every tuesday i'm going to
talk<00:00:16.949> about<00:00:17.070> all<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> trailers<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.940> were

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
talk about all the trailers that were

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.029 
talk about all the trailers that were
released<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.660> last<00:00:18.750> week<00:00:19.230> since<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.859> last

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.370 
released in the last week since the last
episode<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.720> reason<00:00:21.869> I'm<00:00:22.050> doing<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.260> is

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
episode but the reason I'm doing this is

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
episode but the reason I'm doing this is
because<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.949> obviously<00:00:23.430> make<00:00:23.820> videos<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:24.390> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
because I obviously make videos for a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.810 
because I obviously make videos for a
specific<00:00:25.050> trailer<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:25.800> announced<00:00:26.189> but

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
specific trailer to get announced but

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.040 
specific trailer to get announced but
sometimes<00:00:27.210> there's<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> trailer<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.019> want

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
sometimes there's a trailer that I want

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.450 
sometimes there's a trailer that I want
to<00:00:28.289> talk<00:00:28.470> about<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:29.070> worth<00:00:29.189> making

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
to talk about but it's not worth making

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.640 
to talk about but it's not worth making
a<00:00:29.609> video<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:30.990> why<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
a video and so that's why I'm going to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
a video and so that's why I'm going to
start<00:00:31.830> doing<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.550> apologize<00:00:33.059> if

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210

once I love stuff like that but they

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.860 
once I love stuff like that but they
look<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.639> they<00:04:17.790> did<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:17.970> pretty<00:04:18.030> lame<00:04:18.570> job

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
with it so I'll be probably passing on

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.099 
with it so I'll be probably passing on
that<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.209> hoping<00:04:21.510> someone<00:04:21.780> else<00:04:21.900> does<00:04:22.079> a

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
that and hoping someone else does a

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.379 
that and hoping someone else does a
better<00:04:22.290> job<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.070> my<00:04:23.520> surprise<00:04:23.550> the
