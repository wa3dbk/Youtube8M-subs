00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.589
 very good to all I'm the one who believes that and 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.240
 well this time I bring you a video is going to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.339
 being pretty short is simply for 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.110
 all those who are in the custom 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:16.170
 firmware 4 54 or 55 and it is and the arrivals 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.989
 keep saying the error that you have to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.489
 update and well I know that there is to see that 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.679
 tube ready cansahcab the issste but 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.989
 well, you could not upload the video before 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.399
 simply because of the fact that 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.919
 it was costing because render what 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.929
 but, well, I'm just going to 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.900
 leave a pkg file in the description 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.060
 it's a let's say a senén speak of visible 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.550
 to install and uninstall what is 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.050
 he put them and well this is what I did 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.110
 I'm courageous angelillo is totally 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.610
 ours and nothing simply that for 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.180
 install it 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.920
 you put the pkg file in a usb what 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.770
 install jce open what is the program 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 and automatically detect if you are in 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.510
 three the pardon in four or 54.55 of hita 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.220
 once it has been detected you give it 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.590
 one click and gives you the option to activate or 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.780
 deactivate then good the good thing that 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.790
 has to the spurs that I've seen two that 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.070
 it's done manually so they do not let you 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.190
 then disable it then in case 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.330
 someone wants after a big ar or 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.729
 even when they take out a new version 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.350
 climb I always recommend where there is 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.900
 lãderes puff 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.830
 and then good connect with this case 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.960
 what have we done with this little 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.960
 application then we give you the possibility 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.970
 to activate and deactivate and nothing 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.280
 I just leave this here with the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.080
 rest of the video that 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.330
 Well I mean first of all also 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.070
 that some place takes a little bit and my 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.780
 wings is not seen because in mine in 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.570
 concrete takes a long time for that fact a 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.580
 small video cut but the normal thing is 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.530
 that you do not have to be late, well, since I 'm 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.590
 I'll explain a little bit and once 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.210
 you have opened him you say to the message 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.610
 yes and once you finish doing 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.770
 all of them will ask that if he wanted 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.409
 restart the system and it will give you the option 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.479
 to make a complete reset A semi 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.540
 restart you do the one that you 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.600
 you want, and nothing pleases 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.539
 will restart the I have tried it in several 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.959
 plays un kubrick and nothing any problem 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.239
 anyway as it is always said in 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.840
 this and good that you use it under our 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:24.250
 responsibility and nothing here you will see 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.959
 that you are already perfectly at 4.6 and nothing 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.170
 more I hope you like to comment to see 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.060
