especially the players map awareness is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
especially the players map awareness is
extremely<00:00:41.670> poor<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.450> ganking<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:42.930> teleport

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
extremely poor so ganking with teleport

extremely poor so ganking with teleport
is<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:43.829> easy<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.309> long<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> don't

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
is really easy as long as you don't

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
other things like that people simply

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.000 
other things like that people simply
just<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.930> expect<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> severity<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
just don't expect the severity of

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
just don't expect the severity of
teleport<00:00:59.550> ganks<00:00:59.879> which<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> why<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
teleport ganks which is why I like to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
teleport ganks which is why I like to
take<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.379> mid<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.770> top<00:01:01.890> laners<00:01:02.250> where<00:01:02.730> I'm

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
take it on mid and top laners where I'm

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.230 
take it on mid and top laners where I'm
not<00:01:02.969> trying<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> win<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.629> lane<00:01:03.809> 1<00:01:04.080> B<00:01:04.229> 1<00:01:04.409> directly

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
not trying to win my lane 1 B 1 directly

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.640 
not trying to win my lane 1 B 1 directly
however<00:01:06.240> there<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:07.080> besides<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
however there are two down besides to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.140 
however there are two down besides to
teleport<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.850> fairly

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
teleport but they can actually be fairly

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.450 
teleport but they can actually be fairly
easily<00:01:09.420> avoided<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> skilled<00:01:10.470> player<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
easily avoided by a skilled player the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.859 
easily avoided by a skilled player the
first<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> most<00:01:12.150> obvious<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
first is the most obvious in that

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.690 
first is the most obvious in that
teleport<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.439> pretty<00:01:13.650> much<00:01:13.770> useless<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> 1v1

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
teleport is pretty much useless in a 1v1

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060 
teleport is pretty much useless in a 1v1
situation<00:01:15.020> especially<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.530> compared<00:01:16.950> with

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
situation especially when compared with

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
situation especially when compared with
ignite<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> makes<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> fairly<00:01:18.540> difficult

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
ignite so it makes it fairly difficult

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.359 
ignite so it makes it fairly difficult
to<00:01:19.080> kill<00:01:19.229> your<00:01:19.350> lane<00:01:19.560> opponent<00:01:19.770> directly<00:01:20.070> all

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to kill your lane opponent directly all

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.859 
to kill your lane opponent directly all
by<00:01:20.460> yourself<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.390> need<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> avoid

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
by yourself so you need to avoid

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
by yourself so you need to avoid
fighting<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> play<00:01:22.590> safe<00:01:22.890> unless<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.369> have

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
fighting and play safe unless you have

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
fighting and play safe unless you have
significant<00:01:24.119> advantage<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.720> lane<00:01:24.869> now

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
significant advantage in your lane now

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.200 
significant advantage in your lane now
this<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.250> an<00:01:26.369> impact<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> game<00:01:27.000> but

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this can have an impact on the game but

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
this can have an impact on the game but
I<00:01:27.270> definitely<00:01:27.630> believe<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.259> map

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
I definitely believe that the map

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
I definitely believe that the map
pressure<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.189> create<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.640> teleport

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
pressure you can create with teleport

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.969 
pressure you can create with teleport
far<00:01:30.780> surpasses<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> pressure<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.890> can

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
far surpasses the pressure you can

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.120 
far surpasses the pressure you can
create<00:01:32.250> when<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.909> kill<00:01:33.090> your<00:01:33.210> opponent<00:01:33.299> 1v1

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
create when you kill your opponent 1v1

create when you kill your opponent 1v1
the<00:01:35.130> next<00:01:35.400> downside<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> can

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the next downside is that if you can

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.270 
the next downside is that if you can
teleport<00:01:36.840> somewhere<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.470> then<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.710> die<00:01:37.979> or

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
teleport somewhere and then you die or

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.710 
teleport somewhere and then you die or
you're<00:01:38.759> unable<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.090> make<00:01:39.240> something<00:01:39.600> happen

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you're unable to make something happen

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.149 
you're unable to make something happen
it<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.200> put<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.860> far<00:01:41.040> behind

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it can put you really far behind

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
it can put you really far behind
relative<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> your<00:01:41.970> lane<00:01:42.119> opponent<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:43.020> as

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
relative to your lane opponent but as

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.420 
relative to your lane opponent but as
long<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.470> aren't<00:01:43.619> teleporting<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.220> plain

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
long as you aren't teleporting in plain

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.010 
long as you aren't teleporting in plain
sight<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> your<00:01:44.850> opponents<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> should

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
sight of your opponents then it should

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.149 
sight of your opponents then it should
work<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.320> fine<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> should<00:01:47.070> be

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
work out just fine and you should be

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.550 
work out just fine and you should be
able<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.490> your<00:01:47.610> gank<00:01:47.790> off<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:49.110> that's<00:01:49.439> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
able to get your gank off so that's it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.020 
able to get your gank off so that's it
