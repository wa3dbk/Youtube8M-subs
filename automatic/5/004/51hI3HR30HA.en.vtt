00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
kind of hate this edge control it does

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.929 
kind of hate this edge control it does
the<00:02:03.939> job<00:02:04.210> but<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.509> lot<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.840> times<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.759> doesn't<00:02:06.759> do

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
it well and then it leaves a white

this white residue that it leaves on
your<00:02:14.799> hair<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.579> not<00:02:15.850> cute<00:02:16.120> that's

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
your hair so that is not cute that's

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.990 
your hair so that is not cute that's
actually<00:02:16.750> gross<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.160> decided<00:02:18.549> all<00:02:18.820> right

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
actually gross so I decided all right

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.229 
actually gross so I decided all right
Joe<00:02:19.239> you're<00:02:19.450> gonna<00:02:19.630> need<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.930> new<00:02:20.079> edge<00:02:20.260> control

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
Joe you're gonna need a new edge control

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.880 
Joe you're gonna need a new edge control
so<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.480> edge<00:02:22.630> control<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.230> bought<00:02:23.560> is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
so the edge control that I bought is

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.949 
so the edge control that I bought is
this<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> design<00:02:25.269> essential

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
this and this is the design essential

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.979 
this and this is the design essential
natural<00:02:26.709> honey<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.280> shade<00:02:27.610> edge<00:02:27.820> tamer<00:02:28.209> now

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
natural honey and shade edge tamer now

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.920 
natural honey and shade edge tamer now
this<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.920> about<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.190> same<00:02:30.579> size<00:02:31.000> as<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
this is just about the same size as the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.699 
this is just about the same size as the
ors<00:02:32.500> edge<00:02:32.829> control<00:02:33.220> as<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.780> guys<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.410> see<00:02:35.470> I

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
ors edge control as you guys can see I

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.410 
ors edge control as you guys can see I
guess<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.280> probably<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:36.879> little<00:02:37.209> bit

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
guess it's like probably a little bit

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.990 
guess it's like probably a little bit
wider<00:02:37.989> but<00:02:38.290> by<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:39.340> much<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
wider but by like this much it's a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.839 
wider but by like this much it's a
little<00:02:40.209> bit<00:02:40.330> wider

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
little bit wider

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.229 
little bit wider
but<00:02:41.810> yeah<00:02:42.310> that's<00:02:43.310> how<00:02:43.519> they<00:02:43.640> look<00:02:43.819> just<00:02:44.060> about

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
but yeah that's how they look just about

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.619 
but yeah that's how they look just about
the<00:02:44.420> same<00:02:44.719> in<00:02:44.959> size<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.040> about<00:02:46.400> $5.99<00:02:47.269> and

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
the same in size this is about $5.99 and

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.110 
the same in size this is about $5.99 and
this<00:02:47.900> one<00:02:48.139> was<00:02:48.349> 1199<00:02:50.499> 1305<00:02:51.499> with<00:02:51.980> tax<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.969> when

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
this one was 1199 1305 with tax so when

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.030
