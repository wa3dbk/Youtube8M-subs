 healthy nutrition that's clear 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
 we all know 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.809
 Number two is sufficient to move on 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 that 's logical, we all know that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.920
 but only three sides are the first 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.250
 strongly neglected would be that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.990
 Attitude to lose weight begins in 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.380
 head consumes the right attitude 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.979
 and today's tips for everyone 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.470
 go wrong one of his habits 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.270
 to break a certain behavior 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 let's say we 're used to that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.890
 evening always to watch TV and on the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200
 couch to sit and the problem is with 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.689
 We usually eat TV too much 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.250
 snacking sweet to be missing and then brings 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.290
 the best diet, nothing brings that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.810
 best fitness fitness program nothing 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.450
 if you then 1300 four hours before the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
 TV sits and only at night because of it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.390
 virtually everything for free 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.670
 why is it so difficult with this 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.590
 show behavior why is it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.149
 hard to say okay I'm doing something 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.890
 other view I do not sit down 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.140
 TV should not run or 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.790
 walk or read a book or 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.540
 I'll do something else why is that? 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.100
 heavy 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.070
 quite simply if it is one 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.320
 programmed going on is there and that is 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.689
 like a child when a child vom 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.360
 Kindergarten is coming to elementary school 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.850
 has to change completely 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.460
 it has to get up another time 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.800
 is another 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.660
 it has to dress faster 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.370
 Maybe it is the beginning of the child 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.400
 To earlier it is not hungry yet 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.550
 After being overwhelmed with all the things that it 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.290
 think now and the new way to school 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.120
 and who has children and children 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.000
 already observed that knows that there 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.760
 has so ca three and then broken 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.590
 this is the new everyday life for the child 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.750
 our inner is our subconscious 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.300
 like this kid if yours 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.640
 inner child it was used to now 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.560
 in the evening to watch TV and to snack 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.410
 then it will refuse one 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.570
 new routine to learn and jesus very much 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.100
 important to plan this new routine well 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.590
 even if I think if you 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.810
 children the school comes because I need 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.010
 a good plan the better I 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.500
 planned 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.450
 The better I know what happens when 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.000
 must be and the better I am 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.370
 already prepared for it in the evening 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.500
 the easier it is the easier 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.600
 it works for me and for the child 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.040
 and exactly the same with the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.840
 take off the case 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.910
 that is, if you say you want to 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.190
 breaking a specific pattern 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.079
 do you need the good plan and you 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.640
 know when this pattern occurs 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.940
 maybe you'll switch every day 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.670
 1700 TV and stays until 22.5 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.400
 TV is sitting but had to start 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.780
 Good means you start planning today 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.360
 what you do tomorrow instead what 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.120
 could you do that instead you need 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.760
 a very precise plan and watch out for it 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.480
 this plan must also bad weather and 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.930
 Include fair weather solutions and that 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.730
 run walk not go what 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.620
 go out into the city and it's on 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.840
 terrible rainy weather it is 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.420
 ice cold outside then you will be back to 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.000
 TV goes so you need three 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.820
 Good weather and three new strategies 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.370
 strategies for bad weather what can 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.340
 You instead do what you can 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.250
 there he writes it down and exactly 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.079
 plan that and then next time 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.910
 your pattern is allowed and an inner one 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.260
 child flex budget i would but now 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.940
 I'm away again and I want to go now 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.220
 again that but I want for the ass 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.190
 6 o'clock instead we have a new one now 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.709
 plan and in that you will get used to it 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.320
 and you will see it after three or four 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.940
 weeks is the new behavior thanks for 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.730
 you routine and the icon is deleted
