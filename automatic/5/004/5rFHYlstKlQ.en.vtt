00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
promised the same tree of course in this

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.490 
promised the same tree of course in this
I'm<00:02:53.100> still<00:02:53.310> I'm<00:02:53.550> still<00:02:53.820> sort<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.440> poking<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
I'm still I'm still sort of poking the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.720 
I'm still I'm still sort of poking the
finger<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:55.980> always<00:02:56.130> used<00:02:56.490> there<00:02:56.670> are

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
finger but it's always used there are

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.810 
finger but it's always used there are
expectations<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.810> audience<00:02:57.930> pretensions

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
expectations of the audience pretensions

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.060 
expectations of the audience pretensions
you<00:02:59.820> know<00:02:59.940> II<00:02:59.970> go<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.800> still

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
you know II go and and and it's still

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.320 
you know II go and and and it's still
like<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.850> think<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.180> more

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
like that but it's I think it's more

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.540 
like that but it's I think it's more
explicit<00:03:03.960> it's<00:03:04.680> more<00:03:04.920> dramatic<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.460> it's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
explicit it's more dramatic and it's

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.010 
explicit it's more dramatic and it's
more<00:03:05.700> sincere<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.390> think<00:03:06.570> that's<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> big

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
more sincere I think that's the big

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.020 
more sincere I think that's the big
difference<00:03:07.200> because<00:03:07.620> we're<00:03:08.580> with<00:03:08.820> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
difference because we're with the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.660 
difference because we're with the
characters<00:03:09.600> here<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.590> know<00:03:10.740> we're<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.460> their

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
characters here you know we're on their

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.270 
characters here you know we're on their
side<00:03:11.700> more<00:03:12.570> than<00:03:12.630> maybe<00:03:13.350> with<00:03:13.530> David<00:03:13.860> Brent<00:03:14.070> or

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
side more than maybe with David Brent or

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.580 
side more than maybe with David Brent or
Andy<00:03:14.550> Millman<00:03:14.760> or<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.690> know<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.290> Golden

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
Andy Millman or you know and the Golden

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.500 
Andy Millman or you know and the Golden
Globes<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:16.950> think<00:03:17.160> people<00:03:17.459> thought<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.700> it

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
Globes I think people thought that it

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.480 
Globes I think people thought that it
was<00:03:18.690> mean<00:03:18.990> but<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.470> was<00:03:19.500> very<00:03:19.800> considered<00:03:20.340> and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
was mean but it was very considered and

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.890 
was mean but it was very considered and
and<00:03:20.700> they<00:03:20.760> weren't<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.090> room<00:03:21.240> full<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.480> wounded

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
and they weren't a room full of wounded

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.110 
and they weren't a room full of wounded
soldiers<00:03:22.140> they<00:03:22.650> were<00:03:22.709> privileged<00:03:23.610> people<00:03:23.760> who
