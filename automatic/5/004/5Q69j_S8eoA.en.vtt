00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
got to my class which is geometry one

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.330 
got to my class which is geometry one
two<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.260> guys<00:03:06.380> probably<00:03:06.560> wondering<00:03:07.190> like

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
two and you guys probably wondering like

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.949 
two and you guys probably wondering like
I<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.730> you're<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> junior<00:03:08.150> when<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:08.750> still

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
I that you're a junior when you still

I that you're a junior when you still
have<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.079> geometry<00:03:09.350> well<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.609> get<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.239> question

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
have a geometry well I get this question

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.330 
have a geometry well I get this question
a<00:03:11.660> lot<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.709> why<00:03:12.859> I'm<00:03:13.069> going<00:03:13.310> to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
a lot and this is why I'm going to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.400 
a lot and this is why I'm going to
explain<00:03:13.639> to<00:03:13.819> us<00:03:13.940> when<00:03:14.269> eighth<00:03:14.480> grade<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.319> had

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
explain to us when eighth grade I had

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.710 
explain to us when eighth grade I had
pre-algebra<00:03:16.250> when<00:03:16.910> most<00:03:17.090> people<00:03:17.359> just<00:03:17.510> went

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
pre-algebra when most people just went

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.690 
pre-algebra when most people just went
to<00:03:17.900> straight<00:03:18.230> algebra<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.769> 8th<00:03:18.920> grade<00:03:19.160> but<00:03:19.639> I

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
to straight algebra in 8th grade but I

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.340 
to straight algebra in 8th grade but I
had<00:03:19.850> pre-algebra<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.989> then<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:21.230> means

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
had pre-algebra so then that means

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.879 
had pre-algebra so then that means
freshman<00:03:21.889> year<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.310> had<00:03:22.760> algebra<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.380> then<00:03:24.709> I

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
freshman year I had algebra and then I

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.550 
freshman year I had algebra and then I
was<00:03:25.760> not<00:03:26.030> good<00:03:26.209> at<00:03:26.299> output<00:03:26.720> uh-oh<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.049> just<00:03:27.200> did

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
was not good at output uh-oh I just did

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.460 
was not good at output uh-oh I just did
not<00:03:27.650> get<00:03:27.889> it<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.220> failed

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
not get it so I failed

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.540 
not get it so I failed
semester<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.720> had<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.410> retake<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.280> whole

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
semester and I had to retake the whole

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.290 
semester and I had to retake the whole
class

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
class

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.300 
class
sophomore<00:03:35.170> year<00:03:35.200> which<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.560> last<00:03:35.800> year<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.250> I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
sophomore year which is last year and I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.160 
sophomore year which is last year and I
almost<00:03:36.490> did<00:03:36.820> not<00:03:36.850> pass<00:03:37.180> but<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.420> passed<00:03:37.720> with

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
almost did not pass but I passed with

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.950 
almost did not pass but I passed with
barely<00:03:38.470> like<00:03:38.710> one<00:03:38.950> point<00:03:39.310> with<00:03:39.580> a<00:03:39.610> C<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.570> I<00:03:40.600> was

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
barely like one point with a C so I was

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.100 
barely like one point with a C so I was
so<00:03:41.230> happy<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.710> now<00:03:41.890> in<00:03:42.610> junior<00:03:43.000> year<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.390> have

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
so happy so now in junior year I have

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.680 
so happy so now in junior year I have
geometry<00:03:44.800> 1/2<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:46.030> now<00:03:46.210> that<00:03:46.270> that's<00:03:46.540> cleared

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
geometry 1/2 so now that that's cleared

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.200 
geometry 1/2 so now that that's cleared
up<00:03:47.050> I<00:03:47.350> go<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.680> my<00:03:47.950> scene<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.580> I<00:03:48.940> was<00:03:48.970> actually

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
up I go to my scene and I was actually

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.730 
up I go to my scene and I was actually
really<00:03:49.420> happy<00:03:49.750> because<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.080> love<00:03:50.170> my<00:03:50.500> teacher

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
really happy because I love my teacher

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.650 
really happy because I love my teacher
because<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.190> had<00:03:51.430> her<00:03:51.520> last<00:03:51.730> year<00:03:52.000> for<00:03:52.180> algebra

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
because I had her last year for algebra

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.630 
because I had her last year for algebra
for<00:03:52.900> like<00:03:53.080> maybe<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.190> quarter<00:03:54.400> or

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
for like maybe like a quarter or

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.430 
for like maybe like a quarter or
something<00:03:54.970> but<00:03:55.450> then<00:03:55.600> like<00:03:55.810> my<00:03:55.960> whole<00:03:56.230> caucus

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
something but then like my whole caucus

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.380 
something but then like my whole caucus
got<00:03:56.680> changed<00:03:57.040> around<00:03:57.130> then<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.820> got<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.120> whole

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
got changed around then I got a whole

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.150 
got changed around then I got a whole
different<00:03:58.690> other<00:03:58.780> teachers<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.650> so<00:03:59.920> now<00:04:00.130> I
