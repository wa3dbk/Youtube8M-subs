jack on the other side that's to figure

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.820

because then the whole string goes out

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.790 
because then the whole string goes out
because<00:02:41.280> they're<00:02:41.430> cheap<00:02:41.610> lights<00:02:41.850> go<00:02:42.330> up<00:02:42.360> right
