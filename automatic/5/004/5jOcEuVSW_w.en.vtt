going to do that straight look and I
know<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.170> rule<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.380> thumb<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.340> should

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
know the rule of thumb that you should

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.210 
know the rule of thumb that you should
do<00:03:59.640> is<00:03:59.880> measure<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.360> by<00:04:00.510> your<00:04:00.720> nose<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:02.190> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
do is measure it by your nose to the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.210
