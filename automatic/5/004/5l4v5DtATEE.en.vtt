 Y 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.799
 and if they want it 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.740
 an off - road vehicle in style 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.240
 classic is specifically 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 developed to circulate by 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 sand ground surfaces stones 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.900
 strong slopes and even for the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.900
 watering of rivers and water areas 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.560
 d 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.090
 These vehicles are sturdy and heavy and 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.579
 they have the technical elements 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.530
 necessary for this type of driving 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.449
 with a very high ground clearance 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.579
 higher than passenger cars drive 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.140
 the four wheels and gearbox with 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.590
 reducing gears 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.340
 fifth 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 two 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 the off - road vehicle market 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 has been evolving in recent years 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.620
 due in large part to the type of 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.980
 use that users make of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.980
 they 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.790
 the vast majority circulates almost 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.530
 exclusively by road so that 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.720
 they do not need vehicles that are very 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.850
 ready to move out of it and 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.580
 thus variants are triumphing 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.170
 lighter as the suv and above all 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 the crossover or all road 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.049
 a suv type SUV or simply 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.609
 it only has a robust image and 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.409
 muscular, reminiscent of the 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.420
 classic off-road vehicles but with a 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.159
 more careful aerodynamics maintains a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.259
 remarkable ground clearance and 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.359
 certain aptitudes to circulate outside 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.959
 of the asphalt but is not prepared to 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:44.209
 face areas of certain difficulty 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.340
 acronyms are from the term sport 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.020
 utility vehicle something like a vehicle 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.179
 for sports use in English 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.890
 they began to be used to describe 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.890
 vehicles focused on leisure 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.970
 the crossovers that many call 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.070
 also all roads are closer to 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.369
 the cars although they maintain an image 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.369
 robust 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.640
 its free distance to the ground is less than 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.920
 in the suv and they can also have 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.220
 four-wheel drive or 4x4 or 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.110
 only forward or four by two go 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.060
 better on the road that is where they perform 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.280
 almost all of kilometers and it 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.060
 they defend well on roads and tracks not 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.250
 very broken 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.349
 They are a good option for lovers of 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.060
 the hunter country hunts and 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.440
 skiers who do not want to complicate 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.440
 going through difficult areas 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.580
 in recent times the segment of 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.530
 the compact crossover is the one that is 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.360
 growing stronger are more 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.280
 affordable and they go better in city that is 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.280
 where they spend most of their time 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.300
 sales in the Spanish market of 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.040
 these compact crossovers went from 8 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:10.120
 thousand 618 units in 2010 to 14 thousand 887 in 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.990
 2012 but rose 76% in 2013 to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.860
 reach 26 thousand 213 units and a 65 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.410
 percent in 2014 reaching 43 thousand 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.170
 187 units the arrival of new 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.270
 models like the jean rené gueits 500 x or 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.190
 suzuki vitara are contributing to that 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.160
 the rise is maintained and in the past 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:35.700
 February, the increase was 119 per 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.700
 hundred with 8 thousand 387 units sold 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.920
 of the three best-selling models in this 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.620
 type of vehicles in 2014 the renault 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.900
 captur that with 11 thousand 610 units was 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.230
 the sales leader and the 2008 itself that 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.030
 was third with 8 thousand 892 units nor 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.040
 they even offer the possibility of 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.230
 4x4 or all-wheel drive 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.629
 the second best-selling that was the nissan 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.700
 juke continues to offer it even though they are sold 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.700
 much more the 4 x 2 versions 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.260
 we can differentiate the crossover 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.730
 compact depending on the brand so 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.590
 that the models of brands with more 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.269
 experience in all terrain are more 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.580
 campers and they have versions with 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.990
 real off-road possibilities and the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.419
 that come from generalist brands 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.419
 They offer a robust look and little more 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.439
 if we compare the free height to the ground 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.870
 we can see that clearly highlights the 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:40.669
 jean rené gay with 20 5 centimeters 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.310
 followed by the psuv that will prevent it from 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.830
 it stays at 18 5 centimeters and the nissan 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.620
 juke with 18 centimeters el renault 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.949
 captur is at 17 centimeters the period 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.539
 2008 in 16 5 centimeters and the opel mocha 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.539
 in 15 7 centimeters 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.520
 the greatest possibilities of vehicles 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.680
 like the renegade or invite to do that 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.050
 if in the segment more than 90 of the 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.570
 sales are of versions 4 by 2 in these 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.530
 models the forecast of 4x4 goes up to 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.530
 30% 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.540
 all right
