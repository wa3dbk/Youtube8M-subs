unfortunately it's Washington I ever so
slightly<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.759> can<00:01:31.000> get<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.570> general

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
slightly but you can get the general

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.859 
slightly but you can get the general
gist<00:01:32.259> is<00:01:33.030> they're<00:01:34.030> basically<00:01:34.299> really<00:01:34.509> really

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
gist is they're basically really really

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.399 
gist is they're basically really really
nice<00:01:35.020> together<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.850> cream<00:01:37.810> blush<00:01:38.110> and

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
nice together they cream blush and

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.249 
nice together they cream blush and
either<00:01:39.220> of<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.700> two<00:01:39.880> powder<00:01:40.720> blushes<00:01:41.020> are

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
either of the two powder blushes are

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.030 
either of the two powder blushes are
beautiful<00:01:41.860> together<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:42.880> these<00:01:43.590> blushes<00:01:44.590> tend

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
beautiful together so these blushes tend

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.550 
beautiful together so these blushes tend
to<00:01:45.159> wear<00:01:45.340> longer<00:01:45.670> on<00:01:45.939> me<00:01:46.119> when<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:46.450> wear<00:01:46.869> powder

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
to wear longer on me when I wear powder

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.340 
to wear longer on me when I wear powder
foundation<00:01:48.520> because<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.720> have<00:01:49.869> quite<00:01:50.020> orally

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
foundation because I have quite orally

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.620 
foundation because I have quite orally
skin<00:01:50.619> so<00:01:50.860> when<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.159> were<00:01:51.430> liquid<00:01:52.119> foundations

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
skin so when I were liquid foundations

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.510 
skin so when I were liquid foundations
it<00:01:52.810> seems<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.290> break<00:01:53.409> down<00:01:53.590> just<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.040> way<00:01:54.280> bit

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
it seems to break down just that way bit

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.510 
it seems to break down just that way bit
quicker<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.570> doesn't<00:01:55.869> last<00:01:56.020> as<00:01:56.320> long<00:01:56.520> with

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
quicker so it doesn't last as long with

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760 
quicker so it doesn't last as long with
the<00:01:57.729> cream<00:01:57.970> blush<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.689> beautiful<00:01:59.500> but<00:01:59.649> in
