little bit of room for wiggle and then

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.530 
little bit of room for wiggle and then
what<00:01:17.850> you're<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.450> going

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.910 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:18.630> take<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> legs<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.409> straighten<00:01:19.830> them

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
to take the legs going straighten them

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.100 
to take the legs going straighten them
out<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.159> this

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
out like this

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.190 
out like this
and<00:01:22.880> then<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> step<00:01:24.869> where<00:01:25.080> you're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and then there is a step where you're

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.640 
and then there is a step where you're
going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.560> take<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:27.080> clip<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
going to take a little clip in there and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530 
going to take a little clip in there and
hook<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.130> onto<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> tab<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:30.509> not

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
hook it onto a tab in there you're not

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.700 
hook it onto a tab in there you're not
you're<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> make<00:01:31.470> sure<00:01:31.500> they

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you're going to want to make sure they

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.710 
you're going to want to make sure they
don't<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:33.000> quite<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> bit

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
don't do that for actually quite a bit

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.330 
don't do that for actually quite a bit
of<00:01:33.750> time<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.350> reason<00:01:35.009> wise<00:01:35.220> because

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of time and reason wise because

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
of time and reason wise because
otherwise<00:01:35.610> parts<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.119> start<00:01:36.299> crashing<00:01:36.659> into

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
otherwise parts will start crashing into

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
otherwise parts will start crashing into
each<00:01:36.930> other<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> sky<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.799> next<00:01:38.340> thing

arms<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:47.729> wobbling<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.659> you'll<00:01:48.930> rotate<00:01:49.409> them

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
arms from wobbling up you'll rotate them

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.200 
arms from wobbling up you'll rotate them
up<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.009> you'll<00:01:50.159> press<00:01:50.549> them<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.060> fact

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
up and then you'll press them in in fact

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.480 
up and then you'll press them in in fact
their<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:52.020> arrows<00:01:52.560> are<00:01:52.770> molded<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.220> here

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
their little arrows are molded in here

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.920 
their little arrows are molded in here
that<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.759> tell<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> exactly<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> need

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that will tell you exactly what you need

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.289 
that will tell you exactly what you need
to<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.790> you're<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.149> do

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to do and then when you're going to do

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.270 
to do and then when you're going to do
is<00:01:57.360> you're<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> pop<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.130> little

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
is you're going to pop this up a little

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.209 
is you're going to pop this up a little
bit<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.329> comes<00:02:00.840> over<00:02:01.469> these<00:02:01.890> things

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
bit so that it comes over these things

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.310 
bit so that it comes over these things
it's<00:02:03.030> above<00:02:03.360> them<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:04.140> like

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it's above them and that will like

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.469 
it's above them and that will like
rotate<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> waist<00:02:04.950> around<00:02:05.189> very<00:02:05.850> easily<00:02:06.149> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
rotate the waist around very easily and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.089 
rotate the waist around very easily and
then<00:02:07.079> you'll<00:02:07.320> clip<00:02:07.560> these<00:02:07.680> into<00:02:07.979> place

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
then you'll clip these into place

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.490 
then you'll clip these into place
because<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.330> any<00:02:09.599> other<00:02:09.869> time<00:02:10.050> in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
because if you do it any other time in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.270 
because if you do it any other time in
these<00:02:11.099> will<00:02:11.459> come<00:02:11.730> too<00:02:12.000> close

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
these will come too close

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.220 
these will come too close
to<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.430> volume<00:02:12.700> they'll<00:02:12.819> start<00:02:13.230> clashing

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
to the volume they'll start clashing

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.080 
to the volume they'll start clashing
against<00:02:14.500> some<00:02:14.709> parts<00:02:15.069> up<00:02:15.370> there<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.790> anyway

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
against some parts up there so anyway

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.990 
against some parts up there so anyway
you'll<00:02:16.660> pop<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.290> down<00:02:17.470> like<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.100> it's<00:02:18.340> it

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
you'll pop that down like that it's it

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.510 
you'll pop that down like that it's it
doesn't<00:02:19.209> really<00:02:19.300> stay<00:02:19.720> very<00:02:20.170> well<00:02:20.470> it's<00:02:21.130> just

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
doesn't really stay very well it's just

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.160 
doesn't really stay very well it's just
it<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.880> kind<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.090> flop<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:22.569> anyway<00:02:22.840> leave

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
it just kind of flop so anyway leave

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.020 
it just kind of flop so anyway leave
that<00:02:23.319> there<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.709> then<00:02:24.459> you'll<00:02:24.580> come<00:02:24.760> up<00:02:24.819> to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that there and then you'll come up to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.030 
that there and then you'll come up to
the<00:02:25.120> chest<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.930> will<00:02:26.050> fold<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:26.500> down<00:02:26.709> like

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the chest and you will fold it down like

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.220 
the chest and you will fold it down like
this<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.550> you'll<00:02:28.240> clip<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.750> into<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.050> body

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
this and you'll clip it into the body

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.220 
this and you'll clip it into the body
and<00:02:29.530> you'll<00:02:29.709> bring<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.520> chest<00:02:30.910> closer<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:31.540> to

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
and you'll bring the chest closer in to

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.590 
and you'll bring the chest closer in to
bring<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> arms<00:02:32.830> down<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.400> you'll<00:02:34.330> pop

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
bring the arms down like this you'll pop

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.120 
bring the arms down like this you'll pop
up<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.110> shoulder<00:02:35.500> pads<00:02:36.250> here<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.819> here<00:02:37.450> and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
up the shoulder pads here and here and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.680 
up the shoulder pads here and here and
then<00:02:39.130> we<00:02:39.340> are<00:02:39.370> basically<00:02:39.970> done<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.270> only

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
then we are basically done the only

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.960 
then we are basically done the only
problem<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.680> guy<00:02:41.830> has<00:02:42.069> is<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> these<00:02:42.730> end

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
problem that this guy has is a these end

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.940 
problem that this guy has is a these end
I<00:02:43.150> actually<00:02:43.450> remember<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.140> came<00:02:44.470> up<00:02:44.620> with<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.800> way

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
I actually remember I came up with a way

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.340 
I actually remember I came up with a way
to<00:02:45.010> keep<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.090> held<00:02:46.360> out<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.750> don't<00:02:47.140> remember

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
to keep that held out I don't remember

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.009 
to keep that held out I don't remember
what<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.739> was<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.630> I've<00:02:49.630> actually<00:02:49.810> been

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
what it was and I've actually been

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.810 
what it was and I've actually been
experimenting<00:02:50.530> with<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.680> guy<00:02:50.860> for<00:02:51.100> like<00:02:51.310> 10

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
experimenting with this guy for like 10

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.060 
experimenting with this guy for like 10
minutes<00:02:52.150> trying<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.390> figure<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.690> out<00:02:52.810> um<00:02:53.080> but<00:02:53.410> I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
minutes trying to figure it out um but I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.820 
minutes trying to figure it out um but I
I<00:02:54.519> got<00:02:54.910> nothing<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.930> just<00:02:56.350> kind<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.590> flops

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
I got nothing so it just kind of flops

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.070 
I got nothing so it just kind of flops
anyway<00:02:57.790> last<00:02:58.390> thing<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:58.630> want<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.810> do<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:58.959> you

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
anyway last thing you want to do is you

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.500 
anyway last thing you want to do is you
want<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.350> bring<00:02:59.800> his<00:02:59.920> feet<00:03:00.190> up<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:00.880> so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
want to bring his feet up like this so

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.240 
want to bring his feet up like this so
spread<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.930> legs<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.970> here<00:03:03.970> we<00:03:04.060> have<00:03:04.300> toe<00:03:04.660> bot

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
spread the legs and here we have toe bot

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.620 
spread the legs and here we have toe bot
evolution<00:03:06.250> why<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:06.970> robot<00:03:07.300> mode<00:03:07.510> and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
evolution why in this robot mode and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.229 
evolution why in this robot mode and
this<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.410> really<00:03:08.830> cool<00:03:09.010> robot<00:03:09.250> mode<00:03:09.670> he<00:03:10.150> has

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
this is a really cool robot mode he has

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.870 
this is a really cool robot mode he has
a<00:03:10.300> cool<00:03:10.840> robot<00:03:11.260> mode<00:03:11.500> cool<00:03:11.920> car<00:03:12.130> mode<00:03:12.370> cool

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
a cool robot mode cool car mode cool

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.600 
a cool robot mode cool car mode cool
robot<00:03:13.209> mode<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.860> not<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:15.160> awful

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
robot mode and not in awful

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.009 
robot mode and not in awful
transformation<00:03:16.209> it's<00:03:16.329> not<00:03:16.450> my<00:03:16.630> favorite

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
transformation it's not my favorite

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.140 
transformation it's not my favorite
transformation<00:03:17.590> because<00:03:17.890> sometimes<00:03:18.820> parts

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
transformation because sometimes parts

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.390 
transformation because sometimes parts
will<00:03:19.360> smash<00:03:20.200> into<00:03:20.440> each<00:03:20.650> other<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.160> that's

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
will smash into each other and that's

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.729 
will smash into each other and that's
not<00:03:21.760> fun<00:03:22.630> whenever<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.170> happens<00:03:23.560> but

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
not fun whenever that happens but

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.680 
not fun whenever that happens but
overall<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.489> ultimately<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.120> really<00:03:25.510> cool

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
overall it is ultimately a really cool

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.530 
overall it is ultimately a really cool
figure<00:03:26.049> I<00:03:26.200> really<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.670> only<00:03:27.970> problem

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
figure I really like it the only problem

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.970 
figure I really like it the only problem
I<00:03:28.630> kind<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.019> have<00:03:29.200> with<00:03:29.350> them<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.739> doesn't

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
I kind of have with them is I doesn't

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.100 
I kind of have with them is I doesn't
have<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> best<00:03:30.579> pose<00:03:30.850> ability<00:03:31.299> now<00:03:31.900> that's

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
have the best pose ability now that's

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.110 
have the best pose ability now that's
not<00:03:32.350> actually<00:03:32.860> really<00:03:33.190> much<00:03:33.489> for<00:03:33.700> problem

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
not actually really much for problem

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.120 
not actually really much for problem
because<00:03:34.360> no<00:03:34.630> tomate<00:03:35.049> figure<00:03:35.350> really<00:03:35.739> has<00:03:35.920> much

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
because no tomate figure really has much

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
because no tomate figure really has much
pose<00:03:36.400> ability<00:03:36.880> um<00:03:38.160> but<00:03:39.160> he<00:03:39.340> really<00:03:39.940> would

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
pose ability um but he really would

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.759 
pose ability um but he really would
benefit<00:03:40.510> from<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.780> lot<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:41.019> poseability<00:03:41.410> here

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
benefit from a lot of poseability here

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.800 
benefit from a lot of poseability here
um<00:03:43.200> what<00:03:44.200> am<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.350> saying<00:03:44.560> it's<00:03:45.480> I'm<00:03:46.480> trying<00:03:46.720> to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
um what am I saying it's I'm trying to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.720 
um what am I saying it's I'm trying to
say<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.109> he's<00:03:47.890> like<00:03:48.040> most<00:03:48.250> other<00:03:48.430> toe<00:03:48.579> bot

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
say is he's like most other toe bot

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.120 
say is he's like most other toe bot
figures<00:03:49.200> he's<00:03:50.200> not<00:03:50.350> really<00:03:50.500> worth<00:03:50.709> more<00:03:50.920> than

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
figures he's not really worth more than

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.759 
figures he's not really worth more than
forty<00:03:51.609> dollars<00:03:51.970> I'm<00:03:52.180> at<00:03:52.329> most<00:03:53.140> if<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.590> have<00:03:53.709> to

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
forty dollars I'm at most if you have to

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.319 
forty dollars I'm at most if you have to
pay<00:03:53.890> more<00:03:54.040> than<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.250> don't<00:03:54.670> get<00:03:54.970> him<00:03:55.090> unless

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
pay more than that don't get him unless

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.970 
pay more than that don't get him unless
you<00:03:55.390> really<00:03:55.600> like<00:03:55.810> what<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:56.049> see<00:03:56.260> that's<00:03:56.829> what

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
you really like what you see that's what

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.170 
you really like what you see that's what
I'm<00:03:57.040> trying<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.250> say<00:03:57.370> about<00:03:57.549> his<00:03:57.670> possibility

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
I'm trying to say about his possibility

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.900 
I'm trying to say about his possibility
he's<00:03:58.870> um<00:03:59.170> he<00:04:00.010> looks<00:04:00.190> good<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.430> he<00:04:00.640> is<00:04:00.730> one<00:04:00.880> of

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
he's um he looks good and he is one of

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.490 
he's um he looks good and he is one of
the<00:04:01.030> better<00:04:01.180> figures<00:04:01.480> down<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.660> line<00:04:01.840> but

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
the better figures down the line but

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.030 
the better figures down the line but
he's<00:04:02.590> not<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.780> must-buy

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
he's not a must-buy

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.039 
he's not a must-buy
now<00:04:06.040> one<00:04:06.190> thing<00:04:06.310> about<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:06.609> guy<00:04:06.820> is<00:04:07.090> he<00:04:07.720> was

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
now one thing about this guy is he was

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.750 
now one thing about this guy is he was
the<00:04:08.140> first<00:04:08.350> time<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.620> figure<00:04:08.859> I<00:04:09.010> ever<00:04:09.190> got<00:04:09.430> and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
the first time I figure I ever got and

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.910 
the first time I figure I ever got and
so<00:04:10.450> he's<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.750> reason<00:04:10.959> why<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.170> ever<00:04:11.500> gotten<00:04:11.799> to

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
so he's the reason why I ever gotten to

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.800 
so he's the reason why I ever gotten to
tobots<00:04:12.370> much<00:04:12.609> at<00:04:12.820> all<00:04:12.910> in<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.120> first<00:04:13.269> place<00:04:13.540> so

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
tobots much at all in the first place so

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.620 
tobots much at all in the first place so
that<00:04:14.220> should<00:04:15.220> give<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.700> an<00:04:15.940> idea<00:04:16.299> of<00:04:16.329> how<00:04:16.479> much

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
that should give you an idea of how much

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.479 
that should give you an idea of how much
I<00:04:16.810> do<00:04:16.870> like<00:04:17.169> this<00:04:17.350> guy<00:04:17.590> because<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.250> really

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
I do like this guy because I really

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.830 
I do like this guy because I really
didn't<00:04:18.700> know<00:04:18.789> anything<00:04:19.120> about<00:04:19.299> tobots<00:04:19.690> what

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
didn't know anything about tobots what

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.659 
didn't know anything about tobots what
was<00:04:19.959> good<00:04:20.140> what<00:04:20.169> was<00:04:20.380> bad<00:04:20.470> about<00:04:20.650> tobots<00:04:21.190> but<00:04:21.489> I

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
was good what was bad about tobots but I

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.550 
was good what was bad about tobots but I
didn't<00:04:22.210> like<00:04:22.360> him<00:04:22.510> enough<00:04:22.720> just<00:04:22.960> on<00:04:23.169> his<00:04:23.380> own

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
didn't like him enough just on his own

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.400 
didn't like him enough just on his own
just<00:04:23.950> not<00:04:24.159> really<00:04:24.370> understanding<00:04:24.820> what<00:04:25.180> to

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
just not really understanding what to

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.740 
just not really understanding what to
so<00:04:25.560> we're<00:04:25.680> at<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.860> time<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.580> give<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.730> uh<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
so we're at the time to give it uh the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.260 
so we're at the time to give it uh the
rest<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.990> my<00:04:28.230> figures<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.500> chance<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.190> he<00:04:29.400> is

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
rest of my figures a chance so he is

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.940 
rest of my figures a chance so he is
good<00:04:30.600> enough<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.990> be<00:04:31.110> your<00:04:31.350> first<00:04:31.530> tobots

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
good enough to be your first tobots

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.310 
good enough to be your first tobots
figure<00:04:32.400> if<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:33.390> can't<00:04:33.660> find<00:04:33.930> some<00:04:34.170> of<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
figure if you can't find some of the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.600 
figure if you can't find some of the
other<00:04:34.440> figures<00:04:34.590> our<00:04:34.890> must<00:04:35.130> buys<00:04:35.310> like

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
other figures our must buys like

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.380 
other figures our must buys like
quadrant<00:04:36.120> or<00:04:36.300> ax<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.720> buy<00:04:36.810> adventure<00:04:37.290> Z<00:04:38.390> anyway

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
quadrant or ax to buy adventure Z anyway

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.710 
quadrant or ax to buy adventure Z anyway
for<00:04:39.570> possibility<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.110> do<00:04:40.260> get<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.470> one<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.720> 360

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
for possibility you do get a one a 360

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.930 
for possibility you do get a one a 360
on<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.930> arms<00:04:43.230> you<00:04:43.680> do<00:04:43.830> get<00:04:44.040> an<00:04:44.160> elbow<00:04:44.400> here

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
on the arms you do get an elbow here

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.050 
on the arms you do get an elbow here
it's<00:04:45.570> only<00:04:45.720> two<00:04:46.020> clicks<00:04:46.380> legs<00:04:47.070> go<00:04:47.280> forward<00:04:47.820> and

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
it's only two clicks legs go forward and
