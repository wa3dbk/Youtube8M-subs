we<00:02:11.090> go<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.950> setting<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.280> i<00:02:13.310> should<00:02:13.520> be<00:02:13.550> able

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
we go to setting so i should be able

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.330 
we go to setting so i should be able

to<00:02:21.330> an<00:02:21.599> option<00:02:22.019> use<00:02:22.560> side<00:02:23.220> switch<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.810> can

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
to an option use side switch you can

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.220 
to an option use side switch you can
change<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.620> way<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.980> side<00:02:26.220> switch<00:02:26.580> works<00:02:27.230> by

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
change the way the side switch works by

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.070 
change the way the side switch works by
default<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.879> have<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.299> set<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.569> mute

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
default this one I have it set to mute

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.710 
default this one I have it set to mute
so<00:02:31.319> if<00:02:31.410> i<00:02:31.500> push<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.010> side<00:02:32.250> switch<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.030> ipad

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
so if i push the side switch on the ipad

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.890 
so if i push the side switch on the ipad
the<00:02:33.930> ipad<00:02:34.260> will<00:02:34.769> mute<00:02:35.060> immediately<00:02:36.060> or<00:02:36.299> i<00:02:36.330> can

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the ipad will mute immediately or i can

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.470 
the ipad will mute immediately or i can
set<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.860> lock<00:02:38.220> rotation<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.120> when<00:02:39.450> i

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
set it in lock rotation so that when i

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.440 
set it in lock rotation so that when i
have<00:02:39.840> my<00:02:40.379> iPad<00:02:40.829> in<00:02:41.280> my<00:02:41.489> favorite<00:02:41.970> position

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
have my iPad in my favorite position

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140 
have my iPad in my favorite position
either<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.750> landscape<00:02:43.470> or<00:02:43.829> portrait<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.909> I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
either the landscape or portrait and I

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.880 
either the landscape or portrait and I
don't<00:02:45.390> want<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.659> keep<00:02:45.959> moving<00:02:46.200> around<00:02:46.500> all

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
don't want it to keep moving around all

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800 
don't want it to keep moving around all
the<00:02:47.010> time<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.489> can<00:02:47.940> lock<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.299> in<00:02:48.420> one<00:02:48.599> position

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
the time I can lock it in one position

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.940 
the time I can lock it in one position
and<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.799> is<00:02:50.760> lock<00:02:51.090> rotation<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.560> change

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
and that is lock rotation so you change

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.440 
and that is lock rotation so you change
them<00:02:53.129> that<00:02:53.310> way<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:54.030> just<00:02:54.120> a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
them that way and I think it's just a

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.110 
them that way and I think it's just a
general<00:02:55.319> preference<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:55.890> yourself<00:02:56.310> as<00:02:56.940> to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
general preference for yourself as to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.210 
general preference for yourself as to
which<00:02:57.269> way<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.540> go<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.709> moment<00:02:59.099> we'll<00:02:59.190> leave

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
which way you go the moment we'll leave

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.970 
which way you go the moment we'll leave
it<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.579> mute<00:02:59.989> double<00:03:00.989> puts<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.379> home<00:03:01.560> screen

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it to mute double puts the home screen

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.300 
it to mute double puts the home screen
let's<00:03:02.430> go<00:03:02.609> back<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.120> controls<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:05.190> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
let's go back to the controls so the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.819 
let's go back to the controls so the
first<00:03:05.489> icon<00:03:06.090> i<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.359> it's<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.290> side<00:03:07.530> switch

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829

set to mute so the first the icon down

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.910 
set to mute so the first the icon down
here<00:03:10.440> now<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.819> opposite<00:03:12.920> function

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
here now is the the opposite function

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.509 
here now is the the opposite function
this<00:03:14.099> one<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.549> i<00:03:14.670> wanted<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:15.329> lock<00:03:15.629> the
