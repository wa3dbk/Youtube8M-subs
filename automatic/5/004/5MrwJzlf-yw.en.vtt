little<00:02:50.060> drug<00:02:50.930> store<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:52.180> can't<00:02:53.180> remember

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
little drug store and I can't remember

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.260

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
a window right there so it's kind of

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.810 
a window right there so it's kind of
right<00:05:45.740> in<00:05:45.800> my<00:05:46.070> face<00:05:46.669> but<00:05:47.000> I<00:05:47.530> got<00:05:48.530> another<00:05:48.860> veto
