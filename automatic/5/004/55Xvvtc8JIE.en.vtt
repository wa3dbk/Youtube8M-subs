is actually drilling a hole and running

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
is actually drilling a hole and running
your<00:00:37.680> power<00:00:37.950> wire<00:00:38.219> actually<00:00:38.760> through<00:00:38.940> the

your power wire actually through the

your power wire actually through the

not<00:00:41.520> where<00:00:41.730> you're<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> hit<00:00:42.739> anything

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
not where you're going to hit anything

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.190

that's<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.640> hot<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.120> something<00:00:45.840> that

might cause something else to to break

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.410 
might cause something else to to break
likely<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> drill<00:00:50.969> through<00:00:51.000> into

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
likely if you drill through into

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
likely if you drill through into
something<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.680> always<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> make<00:00:53.160> sure

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
something you always want to make sure

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.189 
something you always want to make sure
you<00:00:53.430> drill<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> hole<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.840> good<00:00:54.989> location

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you drill a hole in a good location

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
you drill a hole in a good location
double<00:00:56.160> check<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.120> drill<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
double check and when you do drill a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.670 
double check and when you do drill a
hole<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.629> advised<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.320> drill<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:59.160> least<00:00:59.850> a

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
hole I advised to drill at least a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.810 
hole I advised to drill at least a
quarter<00:01:01.680> inch<00:01:01.949> probably<00:01:02.340> bigger<00:01:02.520> than<00:01:02.609> what

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
quarter inch probably bigger than what

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
quarter inch probably bigger than what
you<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.300> need<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.719> least<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.199> mean

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you really do need at least I mean

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.509 
you really do need at least I mean
somewhere<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.339> bigger

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
somewhere in there you want it bigger

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.530 
somewhere in there you want it bigger
because<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.000> way<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.240> put<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> rubber

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
because that way you can put a rubber

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.359 
because that way you can put a rubber
grommet<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.650> way<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> doesn't<00:01:08.130> cut

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
grommet on it so that way it doesn't cut

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
grommet on it so that way it doesn't cut
through<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.850> power<00:01:09.420> wire<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> short<00:01:10.170> out

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
through your power wire and short out

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.240 
through your power wire and short out
because<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.770> you're<00:01:10.860> gonna<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.040> issues

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
because then you're gonna have issues

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.380 
because then you're gonna have issues
they're<00:01:11.640> always<00:01:11.939> fuse<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.170> system<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.909> lot

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
they're always fuse your system I a lot

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
they're always fuse your system I a lot
of<00:01:15.450> people<00:01:15.659> don't<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> big<00:01:16.290> comp<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
of people don't a lot of big comp you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.580 
of people don't a lot of big comp you
know<00:01:17.130> people<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.840> for<00:01:18.840> competitions<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
know people don't for competitions and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
know people don't for competitions and
stuff<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.220> cause<00:01:20.509> resistance

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
stuff because it can cause resistance

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
stuff because it can cause resistance
well<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.229> them<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.070> just

putting the fuse at least six inches
from<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> battery<00:01:33.350> like<00:01:34.350> we've<00:01:34.530> done<00:01:34.680> right

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
from the battery like we've done right

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.289 
from the battery like we've done right

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
I got another jumper that'll go right

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.899 
I got another jumper that'll go right

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
there and then to the battery here and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
there and then to the battery here and
that's<00:01:45.119> prime<00:01:45.899> more<00:01:46.049> than<00:01:46.140> six<00:01:46.350> inches<00:01:46.560> that's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that's prime more than six inches that's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
that's prime more than six inches that's
probably<00:01:47.280> more<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.610> three<00:01:48.149> foot<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
probably more like three foot but the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.359 
probably more like three foot but the
idea<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.079> there<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.040> i<00:01:50.070> would<00:01:50.220> say

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
idea is there for about the i would say

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.950 
idea is there for about the i would say
six<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> twelve<00:01:51.000> inches<00:01:51.090> there's<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> few<00:01:51.930> other

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
six to twelve inches there's a few other

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.480 
six to twelve inches there's a few other
things<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.530> i<00:01:52.560> might<00:01:52.770> add<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.369> this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
things that i might add here on this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
things that i might add here on this

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
don't do is don't run your RCA cables

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.180 
don't do is don't run your RCA cables
with<00:02:10.679> your<00:02:10.979> power<00:02:11.160> wire

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
with your power wire

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.500 
with your power wire
a lot<00:02:12.460> of<00:02:12.490> people<00:02:12.640> do<00:02:12.850> this<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.300> then<00:02:13.360> they'll

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
a lot of people do this and then they'll

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.450 
a lot of people do this and then they'll
hear<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.840> whining<00:02:14.350> noise<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.130> engine

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
hear that whining noise of the engine

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.650 
hear that whining noise of the engine
when<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.790> cars<00:02:16.000> running<00:02:16.330> through<00:02:16.540> their

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
when the cars running through their

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.880 
when the cars running through their
stereo<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.260> reason<00:02:17.530> why<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.770> is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
stereo and the reason why that is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.190 
stereo and the reason why that is
because<00:02:18.130> your<00:02:18.370> brand<00:02:18.550> RCA<00:02:19.420> cables<00:02:19.900> with<00:02:20.080> your

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
because your brand RCA cables with your

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.890 
because your brand RCA cables with your
power<00:02:20.350> wire<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:21.400> advised<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.060> run<00:02:22.270> one<00:02:22.750> on

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
power wire it's advised to run one on

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.720 
power wire it's advised to run one on
one<00:02:23.080> side<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:24.010> other<00:02:24.040> one<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.700> other

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
one side and the other one on the other

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.220 
one side and the other one on the other
side<00:02:25.060> that's<00:02:25.480> how<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.720> really<00:02:25.870> want<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.170> get

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
side that's how you really want to get

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.510 
side that's how you really want to get
it<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.560> don't<00:02:26.770> get<00:02:26.860> any<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.160> ground

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
it so you don't get any of that ground

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.160 
it so you don't get any of that ground
loop<00:02:27.700> noise<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.480> won't<00:02:28.630> hear<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.900> engine

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
loop noise you won't hear the engine

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.050 
loop noise you won't hear the engine
feedback<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.800> your<00:02:30.100> car<00:02:30.550> stereo<00:02:30.760> when<00:02:30.970> your

feedback on your car stereo when your

feedback on your car stereo when your
car's<00:02:31.240> running<00:02:31.540> will<00:02:31.690> hear<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.960> wine<00:02:32.200> if

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
car's running will hear that wine if

car's running will hear that wine if
you're<00:02:33.220> hearing<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.580> wine<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.150> did

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
you're hearing that wine and you did

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
you're hearing that wine and you did
separate<00:02:34.750> them<00:02:34.900> there<00:02:35.050> could<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.320> chance

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
separate them there could be a chance

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.370 
separate them there could be a chance
that<00:02:35.710> maybe<00:02:35.890> even<00:02:36.790> your<00:02:37.000> stereo<00:02:37.570> has

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
that maybe even your stereo has

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.450 
that maybe even your stereo has
something<00:02:38.680> wrong<00:02:38.740> with<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.160> or<00:02:39.340> your
