 funny that comes to mind in the middle of the 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.110
 to run away at night I almost stopped 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.500
 and I dreamed that was not 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.780
 dream 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.080

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.450

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.390

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.830
 seen the eye of starface has 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.920
 lit up and looked at us 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:42.270
 No , I would not have seen it 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.270
 has lit up as if a fire 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.929
 you do not believe me or I plan that 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.640

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.369
 confused maybe something 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.509
 hallucination 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.399
 I believe such a thing is he's called 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.649
 I'm not hysterical and there was still one 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.209
 what happens and I'm behind that 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.700
 Field covered by a truck 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:06.399

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.590
 I do not mind you believe me 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.020
 what the terrain belongs to the government 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.490
 there may be a little traffic up there 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.500
 we have enough excitement for today 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.760
 I would have to say let us 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.780
 have breakfast and walk back 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.780

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.230
 escaping mules while searching in the 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.000

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.880
 at least so far 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.700
 Now take a deep breath and catch 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.440
 again from the beginning of 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.120

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.459

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.340

 Photo archive of the newspaper of my 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.440
 Grandfather I can now answer 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.740
 I also have to continue my grandmother 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.599
 said she does not need that at hd 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.599
 but does nothing to see you okay 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.650
 Charlie says that was nice 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.880
 exciting up there I was up stone face 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.210
 so sure that on the 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.160
 right track was the quad the 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.700
 talking water solved tree everything 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.320
 was there but there were already a few men 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.520
 they searched everything and not that 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.680
 least found 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.200
 yes, I could have said that to you right away 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.670
 that there is nothing to find 30 years 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.370
 I dug myself up there 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.690
 and found nothing 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.390
 That means there is no gold shining 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.220
 but there are the shops euro but 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.500
 nobody is smart enough to find him 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.450
 Old Homer was a smart fox 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.190
 but we have yet solved the riddle 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.970
 I prescribe you have the riddle 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.390
 unsolved 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:52.340
 up there, gold does not love the solution 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:54.260
 is in the fifth last verse in the box 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.050
 A distant day will be the treasure 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.580
 on the flanks carry what this axis 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.340
 means about it I think since 30 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.420
 years later and I just can not come 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.760
 it if you ever figure it out 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.270
 then I can not do that either 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.890
 I think I 'm better at that 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.620
 is a very good idea 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.350
 the fun of many sleepless 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.850
 nights 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.060
 I know what I'm talking about you can do 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.060
 trust me
