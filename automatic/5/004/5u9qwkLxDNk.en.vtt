00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.689 
twenty eighth of an inch so in in order
to<00:00:53.010> read<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.180> vernier<00:00:54.750> caliper<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:59.930> first<00:01:00.930> look

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
to read a vernier caliper you first look

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.980 
to read a vernier caliper you first look
at<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.690> zero<00:01:04.680> mark<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.670> scale<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
at the zero mark on the scale and you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.130 
at the zero mark on the scale and you
see<00:01:07.229> where<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.650> closest<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:09.140> this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
see where it's closest to on this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.090 
see where it's closest to on this
particular<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.820> larger<00:01:12.210> scale<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.100> in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
particular on the larger scale and in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.030 
particular on the larger scale and in
this<00:01:14.430> case<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.420> under<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> half<00:01:16.710> inch

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this case it's just under a half inch

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.330 
this case it's just under a half inch
and<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.650> seven<00:01:19.650> sixteenths

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and so that would be seven sixteenths

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.300 
and so that would be seven sixteenths
and<00:01:20.600> then<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.990> follow<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.650> vernier<00:01:23.009> scale

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and then you follow the vernier scale

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.090 
and then you follow the vernier scale
across<00:01:23.840> until<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.020> find<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> mark<00:01:25.860> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
across until you find the mark that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.450 
across until you find the mark that
closest<00:01:26.610> finds<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.600> another<00:01:28.020> mark<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
closest finds up to another mark and in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.920 
closest finds up to another mark and in
this<00:01:29.670> case<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.250> one<00:01:32.250> two<00:01:32.460> three

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
this case it would be the one two three

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.289 
this case it would be the one two three
the<00:01:33.930> seventh<00:01:34.470> mark<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.610> vernier<00:01:35.759> scale

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the seventh mark on the vernier scale

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.280 
the seventh mark on the vernier scale
and<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.650> 7<00:01:38.210> 128<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.049> add

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and so that would be 7 128 so if you add

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.149 
and so that would be 7 128 so if you add
7<00:01:40.799> 128<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.970> seven<00:01:42.479> sixteenths<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.950> your

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
7 128 to seven sixteenths you get your

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.179 
7 128 to seven sixteenths you get your
measurement<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.930> vernier<00:01:46.259> caliper<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.329> more

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189
