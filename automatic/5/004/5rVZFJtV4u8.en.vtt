00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
so I know specifically when women are

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.340 
so I know specifically when women are
gaining<00:00:18.480> muscle<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:18.990> when<00:00:19.080> they're<00:00:19.170> losing

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
gaining muscle and when they're losing

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.990 
gaining muscle and when they're losing
fat<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.490> really<00:00:20.699> helpful

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
fat and this is really helpful

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210 
fat and this is really helpful
especially<00:00:21.330> when<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> woman<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.680> pretty

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
especially when a woman is in pretty

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.859 
especially when a woman is in pretty
good<00:00:23.310> shape<00:00:23.430> already<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.390> start<00:00:24.750> their

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
good shape already when they start their

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.870 
good shape already when they start their
training<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:26.010> may<00:00:26.039> not<00:00:26.369> lose<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> lot<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
training they may not lose a lot of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.429 
training they may not lose a lot of
weight<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> scale<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.140> times

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
weight on the scale so a lot of times

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.710 
weight on the scale so a lot of times
what<00:00:28.710> happens<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.460> lose<00:00:29.640> body<00:00:29.910> fat<00:00:30.029> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.500 

okay<00:01:19.310> all<00:01:20.310> right<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.729> say<00:01:20.909> first<00:01:21.119> starting
