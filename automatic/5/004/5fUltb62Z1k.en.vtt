00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.060
 US producers are increasing productivity in crops 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.959
 grains through irrigated agriculture the positive results are 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.560
 result of the US government program that they have where to sit 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.330
 writing research on water saving 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.330
 the idea is to increase cvc productivity for the environment 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:22.470
 who shows us this change of concept c4 isma celular and jose

 carlos castro 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.929
 irrigated agriculture in the United States is 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.760
 in the search for sustainability in food security in the region of 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 missouri the oil producer shows the maize crop the quality of the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.770
 spikes 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
 tarso genro full grain filling the family producer 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.190
 diversifying production also invests in the streets 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.820
 but it was not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.290
 we have a good amount of water a good market for next year 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.710
 so we decided to try 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 we do not have these ten yet - hopefully by the end of this year the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.560
 production of cuxa rice similar to the production of 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.240
 corn 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.980
 only part tribune spoke joked 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.390
 patrick who felt this year heat and moisture and succeed 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.250
 and calculates a loss of 10% 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 yet the guarantee of productivity beyond pain control 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.680
 required at each stage of production 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.240
 irrigated agriculture 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.960
 guarantees to the producer a productivity of two hundred and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.320
 per hectare and 56 sacks of soybeans 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.760
 the United States delegation received greater attention from the government 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.170
 North American 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 because of the lack of water in some states like texas for example 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.790
 the region of san antonio 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.500
 remained without rain for three years from 2005 to 2008 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.250
 the rains have returned last year this opens the way for a change of 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.110
 concept 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.940
 research the foundation for the development of irrigated agriculture 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.999
 with the lowest possible water consumption 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.890
 even so 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.070
 increasing productivity there, we followed a field day in the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.639
 university of missouri 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.269
 the producers traverse the trajectory of the searches pulled by a tractor 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.980
 the field lectures reveals a change in the rice production system a 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.769
 which is intended to replace crops flooded by the link with the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.569
 pivot 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.939
 a water saving that already reaches 50% 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.609
 a package that begins with the improvement of genetics of varieties 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.719
 - only if you had crossed 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.819
 and more resistant to drought 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.249
 What is striking in the United States is the presence of representatives of the 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:48.089
 specialists accompanying research and the work of 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:53.959
 country as a worker in agronomy of the department of agriculture the authors 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.139
 the work tÃ¢nia mental in the cast 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.450
 producers have been targeting 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.550
 years, he has his own information bank that he used at the time of 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.850
 rear wing planning in addition they can use information from 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.880
 different agencies of the American government, for example if someone is 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.280
 planted for the first time, it is possible to know how much the cost of 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.140
 crops historically as the market behaves within and this is updated 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.680
 whole year is a big help for the output producers especially those 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.589
 who are new to culture 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:30.749
 that that to a point of the special fund of the use of the electronic urn
