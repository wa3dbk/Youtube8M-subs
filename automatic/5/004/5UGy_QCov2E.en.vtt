00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.440
 so welcome now always 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.380
 back to a player review on mine 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.710
 camera review on yaya touré in 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.390
 Formats 88 euro rating 78 tempo 4 after 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.930
 the treble 80 shot many 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.260
 elaborate 85 fit and 93 46 1 80 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.550
 there are 410 karin koster big in four 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 I have played 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.449
 scored nine goals and that's all 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 not earned on my account 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.619
 but all thanks to the good adam 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.240
 possible he also has in youtube channel 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.220
 link to this is in the video description 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.220
 has extended his account for me 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.070
 a couple of players houston apparently as 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.450
 I and has since, for example a jaja 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.759
 turin form actually a lot of money 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.070
 but also costs other players and thanks 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.140
 this good adam can take in now 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.729
 the next days also heaped up again 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.290
 the player too expensive players 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.580
 So come to the team 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.950
 offensive play as easy times 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.259
 maybe while watching and then 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.410
 wait, thank you, but leave something 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.619
 do not agree to yaya touré 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.360
 really much was a surprise package 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.450
 because that delivers what you get from 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.470
 as a player as he expected and 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.360
 sometimes even better 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.500
 pace 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.790
 Old school temperance is really first 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.350
 times promise true I no longer say 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.930
 one has already done again 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.729
 much faster than 78 cents I have to 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.840
 in any case say very well 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.119
 can fit you with them he is a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.380
 monster in battles not even 93 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.750
 Physics is no different too 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.920
 expect 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.430
 petra a lot off so that's obviously a lot 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.650
 hot 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.509
 you have is an extremely greenshoe 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.890
 so especially the 16 extremely strong and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.360
 Even from a distance can be without problems 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.920
 Unfortunately, one has no stock 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.170
 but many were dangerous 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.360
 and latenschüsse thereby very much 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.250
 be cool to his left foot still really 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.840
 to use because one has on site so 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.250
 at 16 o'clock especially with left whole 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.690
 you can transform many balls and you can 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.269
 on the left also really wonderful fit 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.489
 because control has great in the ingame 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.200
 somehow sets only 68 agility though 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.610
 I can do that much better 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.850
 you can take precautions with him 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.230
 He is just really when you are in 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.239
 the central midfielder plays 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.070
 an ingenious play station so one 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.990
 can always and everywhere wind in the air 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.760
 so with long 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.890
 if so in the head example he is 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.120
 really cool he is a great ball like that 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.620
 with his body body can the ball 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.910
 just wait a bit 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.960
 the situation results and then also in the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.650
 also a really cool game 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.780
 open 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.790
 and yes a few players easier 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.170
 so really awesome is thus as you 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.030
 just given by the way then he stops 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.140
 the is to a good situation for so long 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.880
 and then use it and play one 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.680
 wonderful pass then runs mostly 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.170
 even with forward and closes 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.780
 maybe even the ball from the gate and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.000
 then you feel fast without problems 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.870
 So yaya touré really a right one 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.730
 horny player 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.980
 the only negative basis is with him 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.430
 the three are always with hits like the type 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.800
 even worse but you can stop 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.040
 unfortunately not everything but everything else in 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.300
 one of the gates for 400k probably 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.330
 still a pretty good price 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.710
 constantly for a tory in the form of absolute 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.310
 buy recommendation gets right back 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.640
 I can not go to the start of the player anymore 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.660
 talk 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.520
 hinders the player series tell of 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.680
 10 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.300
 I said it is good that 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.980
 I spied more goals because of the 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.670
 Guys a little buffer around you 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.200
 to explain some things 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.880
 the next few days will not be regular 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.770
 I give my videos again too 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.960
 Two days after my cling 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.710
 announcement video until now the video 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.150

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.590

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.280
 simple theme here really because an account 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.930

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.480

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.010
 The way here purple is missing here's 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.480
 marquise team of the seas so we 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.040
 all come to link in the 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.880

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.710
 Here I am announced 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.360
 go on 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.760
 later I have a new series 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320
 this coldplay will be included 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.800

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.110

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.380
 I can not go without fucking and 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.080
 Month youtube house you already noticed in the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.270
 language use is a bit grotesque though 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.040
 well actually not care so to 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.860
 that god neither a new spot 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.840
 picture series player mode player 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.629
 So far, I really do not have any 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.659
 That's why Beijing's leader is also a leader 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.800
 difficult but maybe it's adam 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:07.129
 or another of one thing 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.240
 somehow allow the player to 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.560
 rule if you want that too 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.150
 I do not want anything from Peter right now 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.800
 just knows such a possibility 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.689
 Trouble that was it at this player review 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.789
 I hope that was not my day and 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.789
 At least then say job before start
