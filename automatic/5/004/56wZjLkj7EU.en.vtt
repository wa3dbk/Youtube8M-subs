00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.280
 maria in incoming 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:18.470
 about the wind gamers nyse lost in 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.910
 game 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.740
 I am a knaut of brown hearts of 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.990
 those new videos are here today 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.140
 classic lost the wind is for you with 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.880
 half rex this weapon we saw 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.849
 in the analysis of which I leave the link from 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.250
 bench somewhere here is a weapon that 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.469
 was really badly written by the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.660
 same fell of coast in the game as 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.160
 we have seen is a weapon that does not have 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.350
 nothing to do with assault rifles 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.809
 even if it says it's a gun 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.989
 assault a scope of machine guns 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.429
 written really badly anyway 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.530
 on strengths because it has a good 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.420
 they give a really good charger 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.069
 roomy honored with fire not bad 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.409
 as always I leave you the direct link 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:59.300
 analysis why talk about it so five 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.039
 seconds is really difficult anyway 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.749
 let us not dwell too much and talk 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.229
 immediately this is meta rics to one 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.720
 girl 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.540
 the class you see here is a class 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.130
 of assault jobs we will end up together with 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.050
 it for the various in ways in 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.390
 support and when it will be for the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.130
 specialist but still the idea is always 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.049
 the same because because the goals rext 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.299
 guys it's a machine gun is a 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.880
 so machine gun must not go to 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.170
 cover those sidereal distances of a 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.909
 rifle sniper rifle 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.610
 assault in a sniper must stand 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.710
 close if you have a target over 20 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.750
 meters means that it must not be non 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.759
 you will have to shoot you have to give you close e 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.680
 try to exploit it when you have it 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.259
 the advantage is not the opponent then 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.729
 how to get out abstain from 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.560
 those occasions when they must 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.200
 opponent in that range ie within 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.509
 25 meters with these accessories because 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.750
 telemetrics in this case set it 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.429
 for an opponent you face in 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.950
 urban combat therefore i 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.229
 walls in the case of maps that later on 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.729
 shoot them like butter and 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.890
 that's why you see the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.130
 silencer 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.900
 the silencer guys because it's not there 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.280
 lots of choice really guys for 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.990
 regarding the barrel or the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.000
 silencer not to be cremated with 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.730
 mouth train to try to add 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.230
 a bit of scope at the expense of 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.700
 be unburdened to my opponents 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.950
 I always prefer the silencer 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.620
 therefore you already know it as the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.600
 We always put it on the brake 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.340
 support houses as for the 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.500
 classic assault is better not to die 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.560
 therefore the senter always mentioned us 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.150
 wait for others there are very good for 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.770
 as for the other lots of 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.140
 tell the fruit of the jacket are 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.750
 as always football on difficulties a 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.220
 contain a few thousand recoil 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.780
 as I do not recommend them to you 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.480
 that dot can't help you sometimes 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.340
 and this guy is load the stuff 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.680
 gold and we do not need stokes and klamaths 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.390
 arix to a charger from 38 hit the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.550
 Rapid Fire doesn't think about you because one 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.470
 you don't need a nasty thing 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.330
 wasted and a charger on a 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.920
 opponent to eliminate him only one and then 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.019
 to 200 people to kill a person 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.850
 still recharge so there would be no 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.580
 absolutely nothing we talk about 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.350
 river by gene because I put every case 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.280
 intended to inform the jet why it is 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.260
 fundamental 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.019
 many strong players for the good ones 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.400
 I don't try every time when they think 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.290
 that there is an opponent besides the wall 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.970
 they shoot through and if you have smoke 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.640
 from the jackpot and tempt you as well for 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.380
 infarction and defeat that is through it 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.660
 kill like cousins note also trusts 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.549
 because I will put you some as always 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.260
 background clips where the fights 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.970
 urban when they see to be a lot 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.370
 near the smoked jacket buffalo 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.799
 difference because pierce walls 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.710
 doors crap windows gone to 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.720
 directly hit the opponent who 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.970
 the miur does not understand therefore I am dead 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.150
 impossible therefore the gaming smoke is 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.340
 always always always gigantic 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.960
 a good choice 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.310
 said this as always no gun 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.240
 nothing at all this crap because 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.850
 they are wasted points 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.800
 let's talk about the skills that remain 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.930
 until we die as you see one did 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.600
 slight change to my classes that 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.900
 class that I do in fact how you are 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.910
 looking at missing a concentration that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.890
 average as concentration is needed 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.840
 I put a thick in deadly silence 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.460
 in this case or as it seems or put 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.690
 report graphically said that yes 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.550
 call to relationship for those who don't 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.430
 I always forget then why I put it 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.110
 of silent boys because very often 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.010
 as I said to face an opponent 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.660
 when we have useful range within 25 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.180
 meters so only when it is very close 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.220
 to us if there are other assholes he said 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.530
 this correct that we kill we must 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.360
 be aware that we are wary 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.220
 who died when the senator then 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.830
 a hundred so much and I hope to give this 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.380
 because cursed and it is better than when 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.780
 we move to don't mess with us 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.250
 eb the enemies we hear them better then it is 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.320
 precisely for this reason that for this 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.600
 class I chose deadly silence 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.670
 sailer so we don't mess 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.930
 even if we accidentally have to run e 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.160
 at the same time then instead there 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.720
 we feel much better 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.100
 I tried it with this class is 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.780
 really a top 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.270
 if instead you have type for example 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.530
 face the map where you really want 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.750
 use half rics and environments 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.680
 there are only a few districts then I would remove 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.690
 this is really putting it 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.210
 concentration where the clashes, however 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.070
 they are more remote rather than 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.630
 close together but you already know that if they are 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.250
 distance feedback to use one 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.840
 machine gun already wrong 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.420
 something so don't be pissed off if 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.710
 die then the silence was quiet 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.300
 as always then I play on loan 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.590
 jackal hardline for the bread of the 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.020
 you softly appear a bettor 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.030
 because it's a point I didn't want to point it 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.770
 although as always a take down in 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.840
 this case 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.819
 a good idea and then guys like always 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.080
 the rest regarding the compensation 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.240
 by assault what came out to get 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.870
 as always looming support that 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.150
 what do you want 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.069
 if you use public support of 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.319
 use the boc brake as always 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.150
 so much boys I always say why though 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.840
 you want there is no problem for 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.849
 regards the rewards from 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.849
 specialist in this case I'm done 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.620
 already a first draft I would start at the beginning 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.500
 all of them because from one then 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.360
 put me in the first reload while 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.800
 run nfa regional while helmet 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.720
 because it always happened at least that 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.550
 they memorize other charges because 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.169
 someone hit him in the foot then 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.360
 victory of the star 80,000 demo waterfalls 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.370
 he laughs and we put all this to the end 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.830
 which can help us resist then 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.630
 strength iq resistance can be 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.310
 go existence in the other primaries 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.560
 good alternatives I veil those 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.000
 illustrious could be in the tract 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.000
 of the case we want to be faster 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.530
 admire marathon painting as always 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.580
 agility and a random reason or for example 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.430
 predator if you want to use operator 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:35.240
 serious agility because even if we give one 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.310
 good alternative or a ghost takedown e 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.349
 in the case hear but the enemy steps 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.639
 it seems a bit silly to me to use 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:41.870
 these two because it should also 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.930
 be a good alternative 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.789
 anyway here you play a little 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.620
 I would prefer or this combination because 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.919
 it is very good of concentration afterwards 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.240
 when you are up and killstreak it was 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.569
 no it could even be really the 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.490
 as a ghost alternative all of them 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:00.349
 two existences and mountains dauni 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.819
 said this guy milano soon with 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.319
 the near me and hosting games 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:04.539
 ends up on the facebook page but for 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.539
 all the updates 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:07.539
 anesthetic
