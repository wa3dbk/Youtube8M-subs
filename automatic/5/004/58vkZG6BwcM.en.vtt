something like that what I did was I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.420 
something like that what I did was I
looped<00:01:16.470> made<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> loop<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.390> took

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
looped made a loop like that and took

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
looped made a loop like that and took
and<00:01:25.850> being<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.299> there's<00:01:27.570> there's

and being see it or not there's there's
kind<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> gap<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:29.119> between<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.450> agitator

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990

kind of a gap there between the agitator
and<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> upper<00:01:31.500> part<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.990> cinched<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and the upper part and I cinched that

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.780 
and the upper part and I cinched that
loop<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.530> around<00:01:34.770> there<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:36.140> then<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.409> took

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.179 

this<00:01:41.790> bar<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.060> threw<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.149> over<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.390> top

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
this bar and threw it over the top

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.289 
this bar and threw it over the top
originally<00:01:47.189> what<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.369> did<00:01:47.549> was<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.759> cinched<00:01:48.149> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
originally what I did was I cinched that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.420 
originally what I did was I cinched that
loop<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.780> down<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> bottom<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.560> pulled

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
loop up down on the bottom and pulled

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.819 
loop up down on the bottom and pulled
these<00:01:50.610> two<00:01:51.020> strings<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.619> tied<00:01:52.799> a

these two strings up here and tied a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.929 
these two strings up here and tied a
square<00:01:53.189> knot<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.520> there<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.759> basically<00:01:56.759> what

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
square knot in there and basically what

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.560 
square knot in there and basically what
I<00:01:56.969> did<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.630> slowly<00:01:58.369> levered<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.759> till

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
I did was I slowly levered this up till

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.600 
I did was I slowly levered this up till
this<00:02:00.750> pop

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.649 

and<00:02:04.610> then<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:04.880> came<00:02:05.090> out

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
and then it came out

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.290 
and then it came out
I<00:02:05.689> don't<00:02:06.229> think<00:02:06.409> see<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.649> or<00:02:06.740> not<00:02:07.149> there's<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
I don't think see it or not there's a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.110 
I don't think see it or not there's a
number<00:02:08.599> of<00:02:09.289> fingers<00:02:09.649> on<00:02:10.009> here<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.489> grab<00:02:10.819> this

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
number of fingers on here that grab this

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.339 
number of fingers on here that grab this
thing<00:02:11.450> down<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.780> had<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.230> all<00:02:15.319> the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
pry that up out of there it's all there

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.880 
pry that up out of there it's all there
is<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.580> use<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:34.940> rope<00:02:35.239> method

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
is to it and I use this rope method

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.690 
is to it and I use this rope method
I<00:02:37.750> believe<00:02:38.750> what<00:02:38.959> happened<00:02:39.410> was<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.890> believe

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
I believe what happened was I believe

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.030 
I believe what happened was I believe
that<00:02:41.000> there's<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.209> seal<00:02:41.599> down<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.110> here<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
that there's a seal down in here in the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.030 
that there's a seal down in here in the
seal<00:02:46.340> leaked<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:50.500> went<00:02:51.500> down<00:02:51.680> into<00:02:51.920> that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
seal leaked and went down into that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:01.270 
seal leaked and went down into that
transmission<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.090> screwed<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.480> all<00:02:53.569> up<00:02:56.530> so<00:03:00.280> um

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
transmission and screwed it all up so um

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.000 
transmission and screwed it all up so um
I<00:03:01.910> guess<00:03:02.810> it's<00:03:02.840> always<00:03:03.290> about<00:03:03.440> taking<00:03:03.950> that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
I guess it's always about taking that

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.740 
I guess it's always about taking that
