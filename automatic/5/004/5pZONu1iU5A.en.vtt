that is the only unit that really

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.950 
that is the only unit that really

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.450 
double factories by lazy gamer so double
factory<00:03:20.370> play<00:03:21.770> double<00:03:22.770> factory<00:03:23.040> play<00:03:23.250> and

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
factory play double factory play and

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.370 
factory play double factory play and
that<00:03:23.910> may<00:03:24.210> mean<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.540> we<00:03:24.810> are<00:03:24.840> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.290> be

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
that may mean that we are going to be

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.710 
that may mean that we are going to be
getting<00:03:25.470> hellions<00:03:26.040> once<00:03:26.340> again<00:03:26.670> I'm<00:03:27.360> kind<00:03:27.630> of

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
getting hellions once again I'm kind of

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.960 
getting hellions once again I'm kind of
curious<00:03:27.900> as<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:28.700> what<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.790> actually

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
curious as to what what is actually

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.000 
curious as to what what is actually
going<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.330> be<00:03:30.420> trained<00:03:30.810> out<00:03:31.020> of<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.620> we

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
going to be trained out of here and we

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.290 
going to be trained out of here and we
may<00:03:32.190> get<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.520> infernal<00:03:32.910> pre<00:03:33.060> igniter

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
may get the infernal pre igniter

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.600 
may get the infernal pre igniter
research<00:03:33.750> as<00:03:33.960> we<00:03:34.440> are<00:03:34.560> also<00:03:34.770> getting<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.550> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
research as we are also getting on the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.040 
research as we are also getting on the
command<00:03:35.940> center<00:03:36.120> being<00:03:36.360> built<00:03:36.570> over<00:03:36.780> here<00:03:36.900> it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
command center being built over here it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.260 
command center being built over here it
could<00:03:37.230> be<00:03:37.380> also<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.680> trick<00:03:38.070> lazy<00:03:38.670> gamer<00:03:39.000> might

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
could be also a trick lazy gamer might

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.940 
could be also a trick lazy gamer might
may<00:03:39.420> try<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.660> train<00:03:39.900> up<00:03:40.050> siege<00:03:40.350> tanks<00:03:40.770> here

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
may try to train up siege tanks here

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.890 
may try to train up siege tanks here
while<00:03:41.490> getting<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.970> blue<00:03:42.210> flame<00:03:42.450> research

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
while getting the blue flame research

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.630 
while getting the blue flame research
here<00:03:43.440> but<00:03:43.890> no<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.340> going<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.580> be

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
here but no it is just going to be

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.790 
here but no it is just going to be
double<00:03:45.060> hellions<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.080> hellions<00:03:46.440> will<00:03:46.680> be

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
double hellions so hellions will be

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.320 
double hellions so hellions will be
coming<00:03:47.010> out<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.490> particular<00:03:47.790> factory

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
coming out of this particular factory

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.230 
coming out of this particular factory
and<00:03:48.510> also<00:03:49.050> researching<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.620> blue<00:03:49.830> flame

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
and also researching that blue flame

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.880 
and also researching that blue flame
clouding<00:03:51.240> about<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.810> be<00:03:51.900> completed<00:03:52.470> with<00:03:52.680> this

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
clouding about to be completed with this

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
command center on the low ground and now

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.680 
command center on the low ground and now
going<00:03:55.590> for<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.860> reactor<00:03:56.520> over<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.570> is

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
going for a reactor over here so it is

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.020 
going for a reactor over here so it is
going<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.080> be<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:58.530> what<00:03:58.950> double<00:03:59.370> factories<00:03:59.820> one

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
going to be on what double factories one

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.480 
going to be on what double factories one
with<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.300> tech<00:04:00.510> lab<00:04:00.720> one<00:04:01.110> with<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.350> reactor<00:04:02.010> so

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
with the tech lab one with a reactor so

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.640 
with the tech lab one with a reactor so
that<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:02.730> going<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.940> be<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> lot<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.630> early<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.410> lot

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
that is going to be a lot of early a lot

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.710 
that is going to be a lot of early a lot
of<00:04:05.160> early<00:04:05.340> blue<00:04:05.730> flame<00:04:05.940> hellions<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.480> try<00:04:06.660> to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.870 
of early blue flame hellions to try to
deal<00:04:07.020> with<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.380> that's<00:04:08.190> definitely<00:04:08.490> going<00:04:08.790> to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
deal with and that's definitely going to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.090 
deal with and that's definitely going to
be<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:08.970> problem<00:04:09.240> as<00:04:09.420> cloud<00:04:09.750> still<00:04:10.500> training<00:04:10.860> up

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.890 
yet a marauder with concussive shell
much<00:04:17.250> much<00:04:17.580> better<00:04:17.609> against<00:04:18.480> those<00:04:18.600> hellions

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
much much better against those hellions

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.810 
much much better against those hellions
and<00:04:19.260> now<00:04:19.920> that<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.100> Reaper's<00:04:20.460> trying<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.730> make

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
its way out the Reaper may actually win

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.810 
its way out the Reaper may actually win
in<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.500> battle<00:04:22.860> against<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.460> Hellion

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
in that battle against that Hellion

Hellion already down to 18 hip points as
the<00:04:25.890> Reaper<00:04:26.190> would<00:04:26.400> have<00:04:26.490> been<00:04:26.580> able<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.850> shoot

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
the Reaper would have been able to shoot

the Reaper would have been able to shoot
it<00:04:27.180> down

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
it down

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.390

with one more round of attack the Reaper

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.880 
with one more round of attack the Reaper
has<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.120> careful<00:04:30.480> though<00:04:30.600> at<00:04:30.870> 22<00:04:31.560> hip

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890

large amount of gas I mean that is a
