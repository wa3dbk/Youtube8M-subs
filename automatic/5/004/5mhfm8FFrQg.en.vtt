00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
then again they have Activision as a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.709 
then again they have Activision as a
publishable<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:34.430> they<00:00:35.430> didn't<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.820> EA<00:00:36.239> back

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
cool is that so that's probably why

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.310 
cool is that so that's probably why
teams<00:01:00.180> long<00:01:00.420> night<00:01:00.600> filled<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:00.870> such<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> good
