00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
much now I'm okay yeah this this kind of

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.640 
much now I'm okay yeah this this kind of
went<00:04:03.150> blew<00:04:04.150> up<00:04:04.299> in<00:04:04.480> his<00:04:04.569> face<00:04:04.629> I<00:04:05.109> actually

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
went blew up in his face I actually

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.860 
went blew up in his face I actually
believe<00:04:06.159> that<00:04:06.190> d<00:04:06.579> 4<00:04:06.879> is<00:04:07.030> not<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.269> good<00:04:07.540> move<00:04:07.690> in

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
believe that d 4 is not a good move in

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.599 
believe that d 4 is not a good move in
this<00:04:08.019> position<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.680> happens<00:04:09.010> quite<00:04:09.340> often

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
this position it happens quite often

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.839 
this position it happens quite often
that<00:04:09.760> they<00:04:10.000> play<00:04:10.239> it<00:04:10.390> but<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:12.010> opens<00:04:12.519> up<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
that they play it but it it opens up the

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.879 
that they play it but it it opens up the
position<00:04:13.299> at<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> moment<00:04:13.959> where<00:04:14.109> black<00:04:14.409> is<00:04:14.440> kind

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
position at a moment where black is kind

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.060 
position at a moment where black is kind
of<00:04:15.040> ready<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.609> it<00:04:15.870> maybe<00:04:16.870> be<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.350> Bishop<00:04:17.709> b2<00:04:17.889> I

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
of ready for it maybe be to Bishop b2 I

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.949 
of ready for it maybe be to Bishop b2 I
mean<00:04:18.310> white<00:04:18.489> it's<00:04:18.880> not<00:04:19.030> substantially<00:04:19.750> worse

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
mean white it's not substantially worse

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.340 
mean white it's not substantially worse
it's<00:04:20.260> just<00:04:20.410> that<00:04:21.120> here<00:04:22.120> after<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:22.900> think

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
it's just that here after that I think

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.629 
it's just that here after that I think
I'm<00:04:23.500> really<00:04:24.130> comfortable<00:04:26.130> I'm<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.250> little<00:04:27.280> bit

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
I'm really comfortable I'm a little bit

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.550 
I'm really comfortable I'm a little bit
better<00:04:27.760> develop<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.690> Bishop<00:04:29.080> is<00:04:29.199> strong

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
better develop and this Bishop is strong

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.719 
better develop and this Bishop is strong
I<00:04:30.810> had<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:32.020> had<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.470> number<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:33.010> times<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.639> I

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
I had I had this a number of times and I

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.230 
I had I had this a number of times and I
think<00:04:33.970> like<00:04:34.150> is<00:04:34.479> this<00:04:34.660> really<00:04:34.930> okay<00:04:35.729> and<00:04:36.729> this

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
think like is this really okay and this

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.790 
think like is this really okay and this
is<00:04:37.389> simply<00:04:37.690> blundering<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.710> pawn<00:04:40.770> Joe<00:04:41.770> and

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
is simply blundering the pawn Joe and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.270 
is simply blundering the pawn Joe and
here<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.430> exchange<00:04:43.410> champ<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.740> was<00:04:44.919> kind<00:04:45.190> of

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
here the exchange champ that was kind of

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.000 
here the exchange champ that was kind of
a<00:04:45.900> disaster<00:04:49.260> yeah<00:04:50.260> I<00:04:50.440> was<00:04:50.620> thinking<00:04:50.919> you

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
a disaster yeah I was thinking you

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.100 
a disaster yeah I was thinking you
should<00:04:51.039> maybe<00:04:51.490> keep<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.240> bishop<00:04:52.630> somehow<00:04:53.050> to

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
should maybe keep the bishop somehow to

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.700 
should maybe keep the bishop somehow to
make<00:04:54.060> things<00:04:55.060> more<00:04:55.360> complicated<00:04:55.570> but<00:04:56.320> all<00:04:56.650> i

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
make things more complicated but all i

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:04.620 
make things more complicated but all i
have<00:04:56.919> i<00:04:57.160> have<00:04:57.190> those<00:04:57.550> moves<00:04:57.880> also<00:05:02.970> yeah<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.510> was

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
have i have those moves also yeah it was

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.750

a<00:05:04.660> pretty<00:05:04.900> pretty<00:05:05.470> straightforward<00:05:06.340> victory

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
a pretty pretty straightforward victory

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.529 
a pretty pretty straightforward victory
kind<00:05:07.270> of<00:05:07.389> anti<00:05:07.830> climatic<00:05:09.180> usually<00:05:10.180> have<00:05:10.330> those
