thing now I'm glad that they decided to

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.399

even<00:01:20.770> make<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.979> new<00:01:21.219> transformation<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.720> I

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
even make a new transformation and I

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.020 
even make a new transformation and I
have<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.799> same<00:01:23.979> feeling<00:01:24.039> as<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.520> did<00:01:24.820> when<00:01:24.970> I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
have the same feeling as I did when I

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.899

when<00:01:25.659> I<00:01:25.689> first<00:01:25.780> saw<00:01:26.470> super<00:01:27.100> saying<00:01:27.310> god<00:01:27.549> I

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
when I first saw super saying god I

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.060 
when I first saw super saying god I
thought<00:01:28.450> Super<00:01:28.750> Saiyan<00:01:28.990> God<00:01:29.170> was<00:01:29.500> kind<00:01:29.950> of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
thought Super Saiyan God was kind of

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.130 
thought Super Saiyan God was kind of
lazy<00:01:30.310> look<00:01:30.820> exactly<00:01:31.270> like<00:01:31.299> KO<00:01:31.570> pen<00:01:31.899> or

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
lazy look exactly like KO pen or
