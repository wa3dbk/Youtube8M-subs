 hello all these species to youtube and 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.209
 in this video I'm going to show you a tweet 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.700
 it's called uptick dock this tweet what 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.599
 what it does is recreate us a bit the dow 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.669
 that we can find on a mac this 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.160
 clip we can download it so 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:25.250
 free in an iphone em repository 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.859
 that I'm going to leave here underneath I do not know 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.039
 if you have noticed but in my blog 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.129
 some little lights appear these little lights 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.880
 are the applications of the dock that I have 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:40.990
 open in the background 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.080
 well basically this click what it does 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.270
 it is because as you can see we see the three 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.550
 little lights in the obligations that I have 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.550
 open in the background and if I 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.520
 there will be some notification 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.710
 application that I had in the dock 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.230
 I would vote, it's worth constantly good 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.290
 also if I enter any application 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.089
 that you have in the dock will vote is worth 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.120
 the time to open the let's go I'm going to do 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.400
 a little demonstration as you see I'm going to 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.190
 safari and 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.780
 the application as good has made a 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.420
 small boat 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.600
 if for example a notification will arrive 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 to whatever application there was in 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.110
 the dock for example the whatsapp would vote 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.280
 telling me that I have a notification 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.770
 As you can see, I received a whatsapp and I did not 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.020
 would leave the application to vote until 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.390
 clicks and whatsapp and read what 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.960
 they have written me good uned we have 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.420
 downloaded this tweet in settings we 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.110
 there is a small shortcut in the 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.850
 which we can enable or disable the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.300
 tweet to choose or not to when entering a 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.820
 application vote 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:05.730
 choose when you have a notification 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.970
 is voting the application and choose 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.070
 when you vote the application when you receive a 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.990
 notification I have it constantly 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.480
 ok we can put it to 30 seconds each 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.860
 one minute or every one and a half minutes 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.379
 this works perfectly with ios 6 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.370
