00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
obviously the tech setup on the car on
your<00:01:38.789> option<00:01:39.209> side<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.409> that's<00:01:40.649> how<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
your option side so that's how it

champagne in the bedroom that was left

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.949 
champagne in the bedroom that was left
over<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.420> good<00:01:45.660> fun<00:01:45.860> difficult<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.979> say

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
over so it's good fun difficult to say

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.180 
over so it's good fun difficult to say
what<00:01:48.959> sort<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> strategy<00:01:49.679> there<00:01:49.830> is<00:01:49.860> because

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
what sort of strategy there is because

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.919 
what sort of strategy there is because
effectively<00:01:50.670> you've<00:01:50.879> got<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.539> you<00:01:51.690> want<00:01:51.840> to

worried about pulling out at certain

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.999 
worried about pulling out at certain
times<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.940> watching<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.420> too<00:01:57.599> much<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.500> kind

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
times and watching it too much so I kind

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.249 
times and watching it too much so I kind
of<00:01:59.129> basically<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.629> bid<00:02:00.840> til<00:02:01.019> I<00:02:01.080> won

basically the car would got to around

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:08.330 
basically the car would got to around
about<00:02:05.250> 200<00:02:05.550> pounds<00:02:06.800> before<00:02:07.800> I<00:02:08.009> started

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
about 200 pounds before I started

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040

bidding<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.700> sort<00:02:08.909> of<00:02:08.940> watched<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.569> looked<00:02:09.929> at

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
bidding I sort of watched it I looked at

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.330 
bidding I sort of watched it I looked at
it<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.560> couple<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.769> days<00:02:10.890> here<00:02:11.159> and<00:02:11.280> there

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
it for a couple of days here and there

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.830 
it for a couple of days here and there
when<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.909> saw<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.330> had<00:02:12.450> gone<00:02:12.599> way<00:02:12.810> past

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
when I saw that had gone way past

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.540 
when I saw that had gone way past
anything<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.680> had<00:02:13.769> gone<00:02:13.860> before<00:02:14.010> thought

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
anything that had gone before thought

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.820 
anything that had gone before thought
well<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:15.239> surely<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:15.989> got<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.290> go<00:02:16.440> quite

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
well it's surely it's got to go quite

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.979 
well it's surely it's got to go quite
soon<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:17.970> what<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.180> got<00:02:18.300> involved<00:02:18.569> so

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
soon and that's what I got involved so

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.390 
soon and that's what I got involved so
I'd<00:02:19.379> imagine<00:02:19.500> if<00:02:19.739> we<00:02:19.830> run<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.099> quite<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> few

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
I'd imagine if we run in quite a few

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220 
I'd imagine if we run in quite a few
weeks<00:02:20.640> before<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.879> got<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.569> it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
weeks before I got going on it
