00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.670
 begins today the biology course of high school we will be together 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.979
 on this journey 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.989
 to studies 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.989
 Are you going to watch tv at odeh number nih? 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.589
 About Me 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.550
 to cut 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.290
 prices for customers 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.210
 every hour the opening 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.510
 Good Morning 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.340
 and nothing better to start the day than a good breakfast 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.140
 and today coffee has to be strengthened because the day of starting a new land 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.620
 that's right 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.940
 you just watched the first scene from the first tenor of the tenor course of 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.480
 biology 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.960
 you will study 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.310
 the public to the alive the alive beings from fungi bacteria and virus that attacks the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.230
 plants and animals leave employment highlighted especially humans 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.040
 which belongs to the group of animals with the functioning of the pib classification 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.680
 production and evolution of living beings 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.070
 are some of the aspects that the biology that studies with you will also 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.870
 recognize the doubts or phenomena related to archeology 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.610
 things that have already been achieved the observed since then yourself 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.750
 other people and to complete 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.359
 will receive tips that will help you 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.189
 to explain better or to find answers to the biological phenomena that 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.920
 happen in our daily lives 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.939
 The first one will take biology classes begins with the question 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.770
 What is breakfast? 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.900
 last year 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.820
 I am against the black river if it is 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.209
 none of this athlete 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.309
 can not face stone bono discipleship 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:12.719
 I can not see that they are paulo 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.299
 Yes you can 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.989
 what was the last time you ate last night at dinner but with the 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.279
 time you do not comment 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.559
 if we take it at 7 o'clock and it's now half past six 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.849
 the almost 12 hours 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.019
 in five thousand 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.769
 because much of that time only Sunday 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.049
 now imagine you spend during the day and 12 hours without eating 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.029
 What would happen if we went after 5min 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.779
 Mayan milestones and as a result of the crisis but fears to 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.689
 the resistance is greater 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.529
 I think it would give people torture 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.659
 for the purchase of people's council chairs 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.349
 for who is faithful 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.349
 weakness dizziness headache 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 This is what happens with people who spend many hours without eating 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.879
 I just wanted to say that I already spent all that the committee kept the grade 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:02.929
 Sundays 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:06.749
 all saying that one should not spend many hours without eating this invention 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:07.779
 of Brazil 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.280
 the breakfast is there 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.739
 to prepare people to face the day until lunch time 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.680
 in total 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.049
 It's good to have breakfast. 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.570
 this is the same thing 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.249
 coffee with milk bread with butter 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.419
 What did you have breakfast for today? 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.219
 if the crisis with one hand and one night in jail 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.469
 I have no hand 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.059
 coffee with milk 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.579
 water biscuits 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.579
 for this crime said 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.229
 by hit 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.229
 How was breakfast this? 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:49.119
 the doctors of the clubs acted a table of citrus juices and hot dishes 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.809
 cereal flakes with milk or tapioca 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.539
 cool aveiro eggs with bacon 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:59.849
 children with jelly with the French why is it that just like the Americans 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.319
 the breakfast 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.919
 may vary according to the country with the region of Brazil with the customs of the 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.689
 fourth city with the customs of a family 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:17.069
 the important thing is that without eating it does not give the food is the fuel of the body 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:22.429
 and to face a long day the body burns fuel to produce energy 

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.050
 clean energy 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.289
 in michigan 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.779
 Have to eat, I try to make the energy 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.849
 we have how to put what is more sugar kids coffee 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.849
 after all the region's sugar propagandist 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.939
 which makes use of the energy 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.939
 to see how good it is 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.960
 I'm a presenter and dancer biology course 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.979
 and I'm always next to the family that you just passed away 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.509
 clarify doubts with myself 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.550
 the coach's doubt is about the need to separate the food 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.590
 despite the great quality 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.190
 foods can be summarized in some substances they contain 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.520
 proteins fats vitamins minerals and carbohydrates carbohydrates 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.760
 your main source of energy that your body needs 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.849
 Do you know that kind of measure? 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.550
 the unit measured lenia is the calorie 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.710
 and abbreviations calorie sa tide 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.000
 to facilitate the calculations we use here in columbia 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.909
 abbreviation 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.999
 calm and muscle shearer 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:29.199
 aquino belt is a thousand times greater than the calorie 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.919
 a banana nanica for example 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.870
 provides 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.509
 97 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.620
 one thousand calories 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.059
 simplifying 60 miles 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:43.000
 your studies you will find a table like this 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.550
 which shows the amount of calories that various foods offers 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.259
 in this other table that is also in your book you will find the 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.140
 amount of daily calories that each person needs according to age 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.629
 insects 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.790
 a boy of 14 years for example 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.850
 it needs an average of two thousand seven hundred kilocalories 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.490
 Let's see how it will fill these needs. 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.190
 assuming he still has some calorie reserves from dinner 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.389
 yesterday night 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.669
 a typical coffee with sugar and a good French of 50 grams yesterday 282 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:17.889
 that calories 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.949
 I just want to sit in school for four hours. 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.389
 roriz not counting the round trip 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.070
 if she takes a glass of milk with which they feel a kilocalorie 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.790
 and a hot egg that contains 78 calories should it suggest a 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.790
 total of 424 than the calories 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.349
 with the work it was 97 kilometers 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:45.080
 518 kilos and a half calories what will be enough activities that the Senate 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.080
 It will take in the morning. 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.719
 who lives near the access 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.999
 so the broker takes advantage of the study trip to the students 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.139
 we now have how the body withdraws energy and food
