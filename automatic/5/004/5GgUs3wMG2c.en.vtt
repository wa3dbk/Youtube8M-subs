00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
at the cars just parked so you need to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.010

moments when you freeze something is

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.050 
moments when you freeze something is

on<00:03:30.570> sometimes<00:03:31.570> subjects<00:03:31.930> are<00:03:32.050> just<00:03:32.200> moving

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
on sometimes subjects are just moving

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.120 
on sometimes subjects are just moving
too<00:03:32.680> quickly

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
too quickly

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.370 
too quickly
they're<00:03:33.850> coming<00:03:34.120> really<00:03:34.360> fast<00:03:34.450> at<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.050> or<00:03:35.260> an

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
they're coming really fast at you or an

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.110 
they're coming really fast at you or an
acute<00:03:35.740> angle<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.460> cannot<00:03:36.850> lock

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
acute angle and you just cannot lock

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.910 
acute angle and you just cannot lock
focus<00:03:37.330> so<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.260> trick<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.500> dealing<00:03:38.770> with<00:03:38.800> this

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
focus so the trick to dealing with this

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.580 
focus so the trick to dealing with this
problem<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.550> pre<00:03:39.820> focus<00:03:40.240> you<00:03:41.050> pick<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> spot

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
problem is you pre focus you pick a spot

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.630 
problem is you pre focus you pick a spot
in<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.770> scene<00:03:42.010> where<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.310> know<00:03:42.490> your

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
in the scene where you know your

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.670 
in the scene where you know your
subjects<00:03:42.970> gonna<00:03:43.120> cross<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.780> just<00:03:44.500> as<00:03:44.590> they

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
subjects gonna cross and just as they

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.479 
subjects gonna cross and just as they
hit<00:03:44.800> that<00:03:44.950> spot<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.610> take<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.270> picture

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.949 

so<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.610> bursar<00:03:53.970> not<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.209> burst<00:03:54.360> that's<00:03:54.750> the

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
so the bursar not to burst that's the

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.170 
so the bursar not to burst that's the
question<00:03:55.379> now<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:56.489> might<00:03:56.730> think<00:03:56.760> you've<00:03:57.060> got

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
question now you might think you've got

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.610 
question now you might think you've got
a<00:03:57.209> really<00:03:57.390> fast<00:03:57.629> motor<00:03:57.930> drive<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.349> it's<00:03:58.500> gonna

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
a really fast motor drive and it's gonna

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.280 
a really fast motor drive and it's gonna
be<00:03:58.769> easy<00:03:59.239> you're<00:04:00.239> gonna<00:04:00.300> grab<00:04:00.599> any<00:04:00.840> ill<00:04:01.019> shot

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
be easy you're gonna grab any ill shot

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.229 
be easy you're gonna grab any ill shot
you<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.560> see<00:04:01.739> lots<00:04:02.069> of<00:04:02.250> action<00:04:02.640> stopping

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
you can see lots of action stopping

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.360 
you can see lots of action stopping
action<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:04.260> problem<00:04:04.590> with<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> burst<00:04:04.950> rate<00:04:05.190> is

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
action the problem with a burst rate is

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.130 
action the problem with a burst rate is
that<00:04:05.580> sometimes<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.269> actual<00:04:06.599> image<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.930> want

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
that sometimes the actual image you want

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.250 
that sometimes the actual image you want
falls<00:04:07.590> between<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.950> frames<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.670> miss<00:04:08.910> it

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
falls between the frames and you miss it

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.930 
falls between the frames and you miss it
so<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.290> think<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:10.709> best<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.310> start<00:04:11.580> shooting<00:04:11.879> a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
so I think it's best to start shooting a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.630 
so I think it's best to start shooting a
one-shot<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.720> pick<00:04:13.410> your<00:04:13.560> subjects<00:04:13.980> property

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
one-shot and pick your subjects property

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.759 
one-shot and pick your subjects property
watch<00:04:14.970> for<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.269> action<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:16.019> decisive<00:04:16.590> moment
