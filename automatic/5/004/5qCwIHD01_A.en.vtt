00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.600
 carlitos is worth his man template the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.050

 miranda with so-and-so as your name walks 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.280
 with Augustine when it is not Augustinian but 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.280
 because it has expired 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.580
 how many people are ten or fifteen 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.580
 documents to enter and exit 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.420
 but not eating is less the great friendship 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.680
 wear 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.680
 the gaucho 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.160

 promoting a good movie uruguay 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.110
 the secret of his eyes' 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.310
 sometimes those things that the 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.750
 programs that want to ask me about the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.120
 film and sociology answer good 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.500
 but look when the actor speaks like that 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.500
 the movie is also promoted 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.709
 but sometimes it 's also good relationship 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.220
 with the production because they can pay no 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.220
 the movie was released 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.760
 it's a topic for people so do not suffer 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.380
 more of his subjects as digestive 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.299
 production of products and the event does not 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.530
 no no it's not good our but there was 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.060
 goodwill is not there to do it 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.140
 there are also some themes that comes 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:47.430
 up here is also good, well, it's 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:48.600

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.550
 learning for you 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:59.370
 and for me it is flower of 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:06.060
 Learning is a charm but it was nice 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:08.580
 also because of something really 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.820
 true is important production these 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.200
 intermediary goods people see what 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.500

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.060
