00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.850
 the dry handling course of the conti doms 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.130
 near Hannover 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.849
 3600 meters long and today the territory of the 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.279
 golf r from the outside almost a normal golf 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.090
 except for the note on the r 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.380
 freely translates that he for 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.200
 but before it on the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.570
 route goes the technical data 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:41.620
 Displacement 1984 cubic centimeter performance 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.510
 221 kw so 300 ps 380 nm maximum 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.800
 torque goes from zero to one hundred 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.879
 in 5 4 seconds 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:54.399
 topspeed 250 km h the price for the 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:56.530
 test car 41,000 125 euro the golf is coming 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.999
 with permanent all-wheel drive and in 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.519
 our case with manual 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:02.559
 six gear shift to the start the 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.420
 precise steering gives exact feedback 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.760
 It's a clean line on the road 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.730
 round trip needs thanks to the all-wheel there 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.350
 There are no traction problems at any time 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.780
 Let's go back a while before it 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.170
 it's not about the lap time 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.810
 all the gold what the golf he shines for vw 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.820
 almost untypical a really emotional 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.290
 car but to feel these emotions 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.840
 you do not just have to drive it dynamically 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.060
 but you also have to race here 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.409
 change mode because then the sound comes 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.509
 of the 300 ps mode 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.460
 really nice in the cab and 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.439
 wonderfully flatters my ear one feels 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.869
 almost to a nice old dtm 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.490
 engine reminds with the all-wheel-glued 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.079
 formally on the street but in the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.579
 I can not do the border area 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.140
 really between understeer and oversteer 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.090
 decide that would be too 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.039
 all criticism because how to do it 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.810
 almost boring at golf 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.020
 wont it is nothing to moan 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.140
 a completely successful car of the golf 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.179
 creates the round in 1 37 96 and who 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.390
 It would have thought the golf is not on 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:06.799
 fastest compared with bmw m1 35 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.110
 and very much in demand it is in short supply but he 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.879
 actually only looks left in 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.510
 the entire sport evaluation lands the 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.390
 golf r 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.030
 in second place wolfsburg so in 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.860
 the middle with 238 points between yes 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.239
 who makes the race in the end 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.340
 Munich with massive ps and rear-wheel drive 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.340
 or the Spaniard with front wheel drive 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.350
 this bmw is the last athlete under 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.000
 the compact is the small Munich 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.400
 among the compact so a bit of the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.050
 Rebell bmw does everything differently here 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 the other rear-drive combined with 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.220
 a straight-six 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.110
 you do not get that anywhere else 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.730
 is completely unexpected that is the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.530
 use in contrast to his 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.780
 competitors from the club pressure 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.430
 is clearly unsporting in the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.230
 border area bankers and not just there 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.370
 but also felt in every curve 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.830
 significantly more than his competitors 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.480
 Nevertheless, he is on the race track then 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:05.660
 with the best lap time on the way here 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:10.260
 still the data sheet bmw m1 35 displacement 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:15.210
 2979 cubic centimeters power 235 kw / 320 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.530
 ps 450 newtonmeter torque at 1250 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.200
 turns in the minute 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.890
 from zero to one hundred it goes to 5 2 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.700
 seconds of topspeed 250 km h the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.800
 test car costs 43 1610 euro 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.530
 even its eight-speed automatic does that 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.069
 sporting appearance of the m1 35i no 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.870
 cancellation 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.459
 on the race track, it shifts quickly 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.250
 and just like the driver is 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.410
 wishes in everyday life select the automatic 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.319
 the switch gears as precise and 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.550
 It is impossible beyond that 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.099
 the sportiest of these three 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.480
 Compact in every situation 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.620
 suitable for everyday use when the driver is 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.630
 but again really crack 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.700
 The landing gear wants to make that possible 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.709
 unfortunately not in sport mode 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.690
 tilts the m 15 and 30 lies 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.030
 pretty strong too strong for ours 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.739
 taste in the border area leaves the bmw 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.170
 very rear-wheel drive rear part 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.209
 that could wobble for unloved riders 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.730
 maybe too much was a surprise 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.910
 despite its soft chassis is the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.579
 bmw the fastest one minute 37 and 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.919
 seven tenths for the bmw best time 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.530
 nevertheless subject in this comparison 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.540
 the m1 35i is just too expensive 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.780
 at least you get one 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.100
 magnificent six-cylinder 237th 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.100
 points for the Munich 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.569
 Evil tongues claim the 280 ps strong 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.789
 seat leon cupra is a slender one 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.099
 golf r clown because he is from the same 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.410
 motor 20 ps less power 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.150
 may the cupra tow but also 100 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.400
 kilo less than the wolfsburger over 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:54.220
 the contidrom and here come his 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:58.680
 facts seat leon cupra 280 displacement 1984 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:03.370
 cubic centimeter power 206 kw / 280 ps 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.560
 350 newton meter at 1700 revolutions of 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.340
 0 to 100 in 6 5 seconds 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.460
 topspeed 250 km h the test car costs 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.470
 32 1730 euros 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.599
 the cupra brings his power to the 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.789
 front axle on the street and the whole 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.569
 without stopping, the Spaniards celebrate 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.210
 hinbekommen 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.860
 by the electromechanical 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.680
 differential lock xds from the gti 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.360
 have adjusted the esp so regulated 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.310
 discreet that they only through the 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.740
 flickering symbol in the cockpit neighbor 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.009
 she has always said yes 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.630
 to be young dynamic spanish brand 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.909
 and nice that you are with the seat leon 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.469
 cupra now finally have a car where it 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.780
 not just marketing but where 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.550
 you can feel this dynamic in every pore 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.039
 even with his big butt like me 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.719
 one off with the electro mechanical 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.270
 they also lock it up despite it 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:53.440
 Front drive the 280 ps force reasonable 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.300
 to bring to the street 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.740
 he supports a little but actually 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.050
 Never so that is really bothers and the 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.729
 The real surprise is that he is in 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.960
 really never really borderline 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.479
 to bring peace is seen 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.880
 the competitor golf r and also the bmw 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.550
 1's a little different as well 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.590
 the cooper in comparison with m 135 and 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.460
 Golf r beats shows his lap time 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.319
 on the test track a minute 37 89 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.580
 on the top and places himself 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.830
 between the two stronger ones 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.479
 competitors creating the fast round 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.610
 the cupra because he himself in 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.349
 fast curves relatively neutral behaves 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.370
 in everyday life, the chassis is thanks 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:30.099
 adaptive damper setting 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.719
 surprisingly comfortable move earlier 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.150
 per model were there clearly 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:37.930
 harder the comparison of compact athletes 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.379
 the Spaniard decides with 239 points 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.569
 for themselves 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:42.310
 faster than the golf r and clear 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.689
 cheaper than the two competitors 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.689
 he is too
