a few like smart little things that I've

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.580 
a few like smart little things that I've
made<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> difference<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.199> size<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.559> like

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590

the<00:00:44.160> fairings<00:00:45.079> now<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.230> pretty<00:00:46.500> sure<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
the fairings now I'm pretty sure on the

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.939 
the fairings now I'm pretty sure on the
pulse<00:00:47.219> when<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.239> put<00:00:48.390> sighs<00:00:48.600> stand<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:49.109> even

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
pulse when you put sighs stand down even

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.770 
pulse when you put sighs stand down even
if<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.340> neutral<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.969> will<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.539> turn<00:00:51.750> over

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
if it's in neutral it will not turn over

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.990 
if it's in neutral it will not turn over
I'm<00:00:52.199> pretty<00:00:52.649> sure<00:00:53.010> that's<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> case<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.850> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
I'm pretty sure that's the case in this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.979 
I'm pretty sure that's the case in this
in<00:00:54.239> neutral<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> side<00:00:55.469> stand<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.190> will

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
in neutral on the side stand it will

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.459 
in neutral on the side stand it will
take<00:00:57.989> over<00:00:58.640> now<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> before<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:01.050> bike<00:01:01.350> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that since we're I had a very early

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.679 
that since we're I had a very early
pulse<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:11.030> was<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.180> annoying

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
pulse but I was so annoying

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.620 
pulse but I was so annoying
and<00:01:14.750> what<00:01:15.750> else<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> carb<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and what else is there the carb the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.620 
and what else is there the carb the
choke<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> carb<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:20.090> variable<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.450> mine

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
choke on the carb is variable on a mine

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.810 
choke on the carb is variable on a mine
it<00:01:21.810> used<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.530> off<00:01:22.670> which<00:01:23.670> was

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it used to be on or off which was

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.230 
it used to be on or off which was
useless

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240

useless
it<00:01:24.570> wasn't<00:01:24.840> useless<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> works<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.770> was

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it wasn't useless it works but it was

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.429 
it wasn't useless it works but it was
either<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.479> that's<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> variable<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
either so that's you variable and the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.280 
either so that's you variable and the
noise<00:01:31.680> seriously<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> mean<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.000> sound<00:01:33.540> doesn't

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
that bit this is in fact see the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.029 
that bit this is in fact see the
sidestand<00:05:36.690> goes<00:05:36.990> up<00:05:37.199> turns<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.710> engine<00:05:37.919> off

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
sidestand goes up turns the engine off

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.890 
sidestand goes up turns the engine off
in<00:05:38.250> first<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:38.669> we<00:05:38.760> can<00:05:38.789> cut<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.120> engine<00:05:39.419> with

in first so we can cut the engine with

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.870 
in first so we can cut the engine with
the<00:05:39.930> kills<00:05:40.229> cut<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.220> engine<00:05:41.400> with<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.580> stand
