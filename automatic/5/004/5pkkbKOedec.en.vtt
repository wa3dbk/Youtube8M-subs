00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
comparatively small box is the d5 200 so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.760 
comparatively small box is the d5 200 so
here's<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> Box<00:00:54.270> open<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.920> what's<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
here's the Box open it up see what's in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
here's the Box open it up see what's in
first<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.730> reference<00:01:00.300> manual

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
first of all we get the reference manual

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
first of all we get the reference manual
on<00:01:01.050> DVD<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.039> CD

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
on DVD or CD

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.719 
on DVD or CD
I<00:01:02.879> guess<00:01:03.589> cd-rom<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.550> should<00:01:05.700> be

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I guess cd-rom so that should be

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.419 
I guess cd-rom so that should be
interesting<00:01:05.910> with<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.080> later<00:01:07.429> and

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
interesting with a little bit later and

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.130 
interesting with a little bit later and
then<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.450> user's<00:01:09.720> manual

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
then we get the user's manual

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.800 
then we get the user's manual
so<00:01:10.830> we'll<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.460> scanning<00:01:11.910> through<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so we'll be scanning through that and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
so we'll be scanning through that and
we're<00:01:12.929> probably<00:01:13.140> doing<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.530> few<00:01:13.710> videos<00:01:13.740> off

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
we're probably doing a few videos off

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
we're probably doing a few videos off

cable<00:01:48.420> which<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:52.469> outside<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
cable which I think the outside of the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.109 
cable which I think the outside of the
box

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.660 

ok<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.899> rated

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
ok to be rated

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.510 
ok to be rated
we<00:01:59.670> have<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:00.990> eyepiece<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.920> goes

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
we have this is the eyepiece that goes

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.859 
we have this is the eyepiece that goes
over<00:02:02.969> obviously<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.960> find<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:05.869> followed

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
over obviously but you find it followed

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.270 
over obviously but you find it followed
by<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.310> USB<00:02:09.619> cable<00:02:10.619> which<00:02:10.769> enables

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
by this is the USB cable which enables

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.490 
by this is the USB cable which enables
you<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.459> take<00:02:12.180> stuff<00:02:12.480> obviously<00:02:12.989> off<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you to take stuff obviously off the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.530 
you to take stuff obviously off the
memory<00:02:13.769> card<00:02:14.040> onto<00:02:14.549> your<00:02:14.730> computer<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
memory card onto your computer and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.479 
memory card onto your computer and
upload<00:02:16.380> firmware<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.549> guess<00:02:17.790> also<00:02:18.030> Canadian

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
upload firmware I guess also Canadian

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.710 
upload firmware I guess also Canadian
this<00:02:20.489> will<00:02:20.970> be<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.690> battery<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
this will be the battery so this is a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.729 
this will be the battery so this is a
lithium-ion<00:02:25.410> battery<00:02:25.769> pack<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:28.380> will<00:02:28.470> need<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
lithium-ion battery pack we will need to

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.770 
lithium-ion battery pack we will need to
recharge<00:02:29.130> your<00:02:29.430> charger<00:02:30.030> before<00:02:30.389> we<00:02:30.570> try

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
recharge your charger before we try

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.759 
recharge your charger before we try
switch<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.139> the<00:02:31.230> camera<00:02:31.560> off<00:02:32.540> advice<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.900> this

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
switch to the camera off advice and this

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.379 
switch to the camera off advice and this
is<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> battery<00:02:35.430> charger<00:02:35.880> which<00:02:36.090> obviously

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
is the battery charger which obviously

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.039 
is the battery charger which obviously
you<00:02:36.690> will<00:02:36.870> need<00:02:37.019> in<00:02:37.620> order<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.919> do<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:39.049> now

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
you will need in order to do that now

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:48.860 
you will need in order to do that now
let's<00:02:40.650> take<00:02:42.380> right<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.260> next<00:02:46.290> bit<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:47.870> here

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
let's take right so the next bit is here

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.689 
let's take right so the next bit is here
which<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.919> guess<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.459> exciting<00:02:55.489> that's<00:02:56.489> all

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:56.699 
which I guess is the exciting that's all

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:57.759 
which I guess is the exciting that's all
there<00:02:56.880> is

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
there is

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:06.530 
there is
yeah<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.040> here<00:02:59.820> is<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.870> new<00:03:01.280> Nikon<00:03:03.320> d200<00:03:05.540> mono

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
yeah and here is the new Nikon d200 mono

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.240 
yeah and here is the new Nikon d200 mono
mr.<00:03:07.109> side<00:03:07.350> there<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.859> go

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
mr. side there you go

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.699 
mr. side there you go
so<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.359> it<00:03:09.510> as<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.840> can<00:03:10.019> see<00:03:10.199> it's<00:03:10.590> a

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
so this is it as you can see it's a

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.539 
so this is it as you can see it's a
little<00:03:10.829> bit<00:03:10.979> smaller<00:03:11.370> than<00:03:11.699> the<00:03:12.150> d5<00:03:12.959> 100<00:03:13.560> but

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
little bit smaller than the d5 100 but

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.550 
little bit smaller than the d5 100 but
it's<00:03:14.669> pretty<00:03:14.820> good<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.180> your<00:03:15.269> hands<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:16.290> got

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.620 
it's pretty good in your hands it's got
all<00:03:16.709> those<00:03:16.889> things<00:03:16.949> that<00:03:17.579> we've<00:03:18.120> been<00:03:18.329> reading

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
all those things that we've been reading

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.259

battery<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:24.000> afraid<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:25.080> will<00:03:25.319> have<00:03:25.530> to

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
battery so I'm afraid this will have to
