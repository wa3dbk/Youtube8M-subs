refer to them as lakes one here one here

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.690 
refer to them as lakes one here one here
one<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.900> they<00:01:36.900> claim<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.770> lakes

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
one up here they claim that it's lakes

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.830 
one up here they claim that it's lakes
that<00:01:38.880> were<00:01:39.090> filled<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:41.210> vegetation<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that were filled with vegetation in the

that were filled with vegetation in the
summer<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:44.540> more<00:01:46.040> sediment<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
summer and then more sediment that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.789 
summer and then more sediment that
didn't<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:48.030> vegetation<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> winter<00:01:49.170> so

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
didn't have vegetation in the winter so

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.520 
didn't have vegetation in the winter so
you<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.040> layer<00:01:50.310> after<00:01:50.610> layer<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.360> oil<00:01:52.049> shale

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you have layer after layer of oil shale

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.639 
you have layer after layer of oil shale
and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.070> non<00:01:53.340> oil<00:01:53.579> shale<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:55.200> over

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and then non oil shale and it's over

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.730 
and then non oil shale and it's over
four<00:01:55.920> trillion<00:01:56.340> barrels<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.500> don't<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.619> of

economically<00:02:45.370> viable<00:02:45.819> if<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.720> price<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.200> oil

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
economically viable if the price of oil

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.930 
economically viable if the price of oil
goes<00:02:47.470> up<00:02:47.769> in<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.010> future<00:02:48.370> all<00:02:48.549> of<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.819> will<00:02:48.909> be

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
goes up in the future all of it will be

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.379 
goes up in the future all of it will be
viable<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:52.090> idea<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:53.250> something

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
viable so the idea is that something

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.240 
viable so the idea is that something
caused<00:02:55.389> this<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.079> I<00:02:56.530> don't<00:02:56.799> think<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.129> was

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
caused this and I don't think it was

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.520 
caused this and I don't think it was
vegetation<00:02:58.060> i<00:02:58.180> think<00:02:58.389> it<00:02:58.480> was<00:02:58.599> oil<00:02:58.870> from<00:02:59.200> above

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530

were back in the early 1900s so I

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.199 
were back in the early 1900s so I

it's recent I don't believe there are
