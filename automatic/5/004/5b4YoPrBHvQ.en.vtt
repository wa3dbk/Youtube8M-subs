I've<00:00:07.200> put<00:00:07.560> my<00:00:07.649> first<00:00:07.919> piece<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.340> bench<00:00:08.550> top<00:00:08.820> in

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
I've put my first piece of bench top in

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.430 
I've put my first piece of bench top in
and<00:00:09.300> because<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:09.719> working<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.139> an<00:00:10.260> old

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
and because we're working in an old

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680 
and because we're working in an old
house<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.190> walls<00:00:11.400> are<00:00:11.730> all<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.179> out<00:00:12.300> so

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
house the walls are all in and out so

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.419 
house the walls are all in and out so
what<00:00:12.840> we're<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:14.009> scribe

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
what we're going to have to do is scribe

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.400 
what we're going to have to do is scribe
a<00:00:14.549> line<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:15.240> suit<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> profile<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.199> wall

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
a line to suit the profile of the wall

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.349 
a line to suit the profile of the wall
make<00:00:17.010> sure<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.550> bench<00:00:17.730> top<00:00:17.940> goes<00:00:18.150> back

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
make sure the bench top goes back

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
make sure the bench top goes back
parallel<00:00:18.980> 35<00:00:20.240> it's<00:00:21.240> coming<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:22.130> 35<00:00:23.130> this

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
parallel 35 it's coming in here 35 this

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.540 
parallel 35 it's coming in here 35 this
is<00:00:24.150> exactly<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.900> same<00:00:25.080> process<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.830> used<00:00:26.160> when

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
is exactly the same process we used when

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.550 
is exactly the same process we used when
we<00:00:26.609> trim<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> end<00:00:27.330> panel<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.869> measure<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.380> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
we trim the end panel to measure out of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.710 
we trim the end panel to measure out of
level<00:00:28.859> floor<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.849> case<00:00:30.150> our<00:00:30.330> wall<00:00:30.570> is

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
level floor in this case our wall is

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.659 
level floor in this case our wall is
only<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> few<00:00:31.230> millimeters<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.009> true<00:00:32.250> so

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
only a few millimeters out of true so

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.459 
only a few millimeters out of true so
just<00:00:32.700> holding<00:00:33.180> our<00:00:33.329> pencil<00:00:33.719> flat<00:00:33.989> against<00:00:34.410> the

just holding our pencil flat against the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.350 
just holding our pencil flat against the
wall<00:00:34.530> will<00:00:35.130> mark<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> bench<00:00:35.700> top<00:00:35.940> far<00:00:36.180> enough

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
wall will mark the bench top far enough

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.139 
wall will mark the bench top far enough
out<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.110> cover<00:00:37.350> those<00:00:37.559> few<00:00:37.860> mil<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.760> slide<00:00:39.000> it

along<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.660> there's<00:00:40.350> your<00:00:40.590> line<00:00:41.210> now<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.420> just

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
along and there's your line now I'm just

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
along and there's your line now I'm just
going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> shave<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.410> off<00:00:43.469> using<00:00:44.100> an

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
going to shave that off using an

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.000 
going to shave that off using an
electric<00:00:44.910> plane<00:00:45.180> my<00:00:45.930> bench<00:00:46.140> tops<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it's time to cut out a hole for a sink

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.330 
it's time to cut out a hole for a sink
now<00:00:51.930> I've<00:00:52.050> got<00:00:52.230> my<00:00:52.320> template<00:00:52.770> sitting<00:00:53.129> down

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
now I've got my template sitting down

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.740 
now I've got my template sitting down
there's<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.000> couple<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.360> things<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.719> should

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
there's a couple of things you should

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
there's a couple of things you should
watch<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.289> before<00:00:55.800> cutting<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.250> your

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
watch out for before cutting out your

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
watch out for before cutting out your
bench<00:00:56.579> top<00:00:56.850> make<00:00:57.360> sure<00:00:57.390> our<00:00:57.780> bowl<00:00:58.079> sits<00:00:58.710> within

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
bench top make sure our bowl sits within

the<00:00:59.129> framework<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.730> our<00:00:59.850> cabinetry<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:01.140> have

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the framework of our cabinetry we have

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
the framework of our cabinetry we have
to<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> minimum<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:02.010> 55<00:01:02.340> millimeters<00:01:03.000> left

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
to have a minimum of 55 millimeters left

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
to have a minimum of 55 millimeters left
on<00:01:03.480> our<00:01:03.510> bench<00:01:03.840> top<00:01:04.110> from<00:01:04.650> our<00:01:04.799> cut<00:01:05.070> mark<00:01:05.339> I'm

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
on our bench top from our cut mark I'm

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.649 
on our bench top from our cut mark I'm
just<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.119> throw<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> little<00:01:06.420> bit<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
just going to throw a little bit of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.270 
just going to throw a little bit of
masking<00:01:06.960> tape<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.830> hold<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.100> bowl

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
masking tape just to hold the bowl

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
masking tape just to hold the bowl
pattern<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.000> position<00:01:09.540> now<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.619> mark

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
pattern in position now we can mark

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
pattern in position now we can mark
around<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.189> our<00:01:11.250> pencil<00:01:11.640> good<00:01:12.360> heavy<00:01:12.600> line

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
around with our pencil good heavy line

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
around with our pencil good heavy line
now<00:01:13.680> put<00:01:13.860> some<00:01:13.979> masking<00:01:14.340> tape<00:01:14.369> over<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> line

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
now put some masking tape over the line

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.359 
now put some masking tape over the line
this<00:01:15.720> prevents<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> laminate<00:01:16.920> from<00:01:17.100> chipping

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
this prevents the laminate from chipping

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.179 
this prevents the laminate from chipping
when<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.790> use<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> jig<00:01:18.299> saw<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.479> cut<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> out

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
when I use the jig saw to cut it out

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.100 
when I use the jig saw to cut it out
lift<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> section<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.820> bench<00:01:21.000> top<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:21.450> before

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
lift the section of bench top off before

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.510 
lift the section of bench top off before
you<00:01:22.200> start<00:01:22.229> cutting<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> hole<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you start cutting the hole out for the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.310 
you start cutting the hole out for the
sink<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.330> no<00:01:24.600> chance<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.140> cutting

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
sink so there's no chance of cutting

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
sink so there's no chance of cutting
into<00:01:25.560> what's<00:01:25.890> underneath<00:01:26.250> we're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
into what's underneath we're going to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.510 
into what's underneath we're going to
drill<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> starter<00:01:27.930> hole<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> jigsaw

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.890 

now<00:01:37.520> we're<00:01:37.700> just<00:01:37.940> about<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.330> foot<00:01:38.540> our<00:01:38.660> bench

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
now we're just about a foot our bench

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.540 
now we're just about a foot our bench
top<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.350> permanently<00:01:39.710> before<00:01:40.250> we<00:01:40.370> do<00:01:40.520> that

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
top and permanently before we do that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.970 
top and permanently before we do that
we're<00:01:41.120> going<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.300> use<00:01:41.480> these<00:01:41.720> brackets<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.770> fit

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
we're going to use these brackets to fit

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.440 
we're going to use these brackets to fit
the<00:01:43.070> bench<00:01:43.280> top<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.030> back<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
the bench top to the back of the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.810 
the bench top to the back of the
cabinetry<00:01:45.040> I'm<00:01:46.040> now<00:01:46.220> going<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.460> start<00:01:46.550> by

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
cabinetry I'm now going to start by

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.850 
cabinetry I'm now going to start by
gluing<00:01:47.000> out<00:01:47.300> two<00:01:47.510> sections<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.020> bench<00:01:48.170> top<00:01:48.440> so

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
gluing out two sections of bench top so

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.800 
gluing out two sections of bench top so
just<00:01:48.890> very<00:01:49.130> carefully<00:01:49.430> read<00:01:49.970> this<00:01:50.180> on<00:01:50.420> either

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
just very carefully read this on either

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.240 
just very carefully read this on either
side<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.200> your<00:01:51.350> join<00:01:51.590> don't<00:01:52.040> worry<00:01:52.160> about

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
side of your join don't worry about

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.070 
side of your join don't worry about
putting<00:01:52.580> too<00:01:52.700> much<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.360> can<00:01:53.540> always<00:01:53.840> take

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
putting too much on we can always take

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.730 
putting too much on we can always take
that<00:01:54.110> off<00:01:54.350> later

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
that off later

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.370 
that off later
very<00:01:55.460> gently<00:01:56.030> lower<00:01:56.720> our<00:01:56.870> bench<00:01:57.140> into

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
very gently lower our bench into

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.860 
very gently lower our bench into
position<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:59.030> get<00:01:59.180> underneath<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.690> bench

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
position and get underneath the bench

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.240 
position and get underneath the bench
and<00:02:00.110> put<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.470> our<00:02:00.710> bench<00:02:00.980> connectors<00:02:03.160> come<00:02:04.160> up

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
and put on our bench connectors come up

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.710 
and put on our bench connectors come up
on<00:02:04.430> top<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.790> have<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:04.970> lot<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.330> see<00:02:05.480> how<00:02:05.600> it's

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
on top to have a lot to see how it's

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.070 
on top to have a lot to see how it's
going

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
going

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.570 
going
