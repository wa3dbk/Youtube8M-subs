00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
are asking me about so I was able to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
are asking me about so I was able to
actually<00:00:48.960> witness<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.829> actually<00:00:50.789> see<00:00:51.030> his

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
actually witness and actually see his

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.229 
actually witness and actually see his
technique<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.899> he<00:00:52.050> uses<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.829> he<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
technique that he uses and he has a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.270 
technique that he uses and he has a
special<00:00:54.750> technique<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> had<00:00:55.770> never<00:00:55.980> known

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
special technique that I had never known

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.510 
special technique that I had never known
before<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:57.480> he<00:00:57.690> uses<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.710> does<00:00:59.370> not

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
before that he uses that is does not

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
before that he uses that is does not
cause<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> trauma<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.870> body

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
cause a lot of trauma to the body

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.920 
cause a lot of trauma to the body
therefore<00:01:01.620> allowing<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.969> patient<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> feel

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
therefore allowing the patient to feel

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.429 
therefore allowing the patient to feel
virtually<00:01:04.650> less<00:01:05.549> pain<00:01:05.880> little<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.689> no<00:01:06.930> pain<00:01:07.200> at

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
virtually less pain little to no pain at

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.590 
virtually less pain little to no pain at
all<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> procedure<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.450> he's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
all because of the procedure that he's

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.530 
all because of the procedure that he's
doing<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:11.729> his<00:01:12.090> technique

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
doing and it is actually his technique

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.679 
doing and it is actually his technique
that<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.960> able<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> see<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.400> he<00:01:14.790> takes<00:01:15.509> his

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that I was able to see that he takes his

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.020 
that I was able to see that he takes his
time<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.320> he<00:01:17.100> uses<00:01:17.810> special<00:01:18.810> tools<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
time and he uses special tools that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.120 
time and he uses special tools that
traditionally<00:01:21.030> other<00:01:21.360> doctors<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.290> haven't

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
traditionally other doctors have haven't

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.109 
traditionally other doctors have haven't
used<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:24.049> maybe<00:01:25.049> take<00:01:25.950> away<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> time

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
used to maybe take away from the time

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.300 
used to maybe take away from the time
involved<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.290> their<00:01:28.470> fear<00:01:28.740> would<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
involved is what their fear would be and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.950 
involved is what their fear would be and
doctor<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> doesn't<00:01:30.630> rush<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
doctor will go to doesn't rush the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.980 
doctor will go to doesn't rush the
surgery<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.040> he<00:01:32.310> takes<00:01:32.579> his<00:01:32.759> time<00:01:32.939> he<00:01:33.689> tries

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
surgery so he takes his time he tries

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
surgery so he takes his time he tries
not<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> cause<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> lot<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> trauma<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> body

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
not to cause a lot of trauma to the body

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.710 
not to cause a lot of trauma to the body
there<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.530> having<00:01:38.130> very<00:01:38.159> much<00:01:38.579> blood<00:01:39.450> at

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
there for not having very much blood at

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.520 
there for not having very much blood at

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
fact that I didn't even see any blood
