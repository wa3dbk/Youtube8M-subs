weird<00:01:13.219> with<00:01:13.369> this<00:01:13.520> world<00:01:13.789> but<00:01:14.210> if<00:01:15.020> not<00:01:15.710> I'm

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
weird with this world but if not I'm

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.350 
weird with this world but if not I'm
gonna<00:01:17.479> go<00:01:17.750> record<00:01:18.740> something<00:01:19.130> else<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:19.820> I

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360

guess I'm just gonna cut it off
or<00:01:24.830> restart<00:01:25.400> recording<00:01:26.210> when<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.360> find

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
not not it's not a mod actually it's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.070 
not not it's not a mod actually it's
gonna<00:01:41.870> random<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:44.090> aim<00:01:44.240> is<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.450> little<00:01:44.720> harder

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
gonna random the aim is a little harder

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.740 
gonna random the aim is a little harder
on<00:01:45.230> it<00:01:45.410> though<00:01:45.560> I'll<00:01:45.800> tell<00:01:46.010> you<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.570> but<00:01:47.570> it's

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
on it though I'll tell you that but it's

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.960 
on it though I'll tell you that but it's
still<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.320> I'm<00:01:48.860> running<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.310> little<00:01:49.550> laggy<00:01:49.730> if

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
still and I'm running a little laggy if

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.190 
still and I'm running a little laggy if
you<00:01:50.090> hadn't<00:01:50.300> noticed<00:01:50.330> I<00:01:50.720> changed<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you hadn't noticed I changed the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.360 
you hadn't noticed I changed the
distance<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.740> little<00:01:51.860> bit<00:01:52.040> I'm<00:01:52.190> going<00:01:52.310> to

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
distance a little bit I'm going to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.370 
distance a little bit I'm going to
recording<00:01:52.760> fraps<00:01:53.060> with<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.480> distance<00:01:53.900> it's<00:01:54.110> a

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
recording fraps with the distance it's a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.190 
recording fraps with the distance it's a
little<00:01:55.010> different<00:01:55.280> but<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.150> can<00:01:56.780> shoot<00:01:56.960> arrows

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
little different but I can shoot arrows

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.410 
little different but I can shoot arrows
so<00:01:57.620> I<00:01:59.560> don't<00:02:00.560> think<00:02:00.740> it's<00:02:00.860> very<00:02:01.280> on<00:02:01.670> target

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
so I don't think it's very on target

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.000 
so I don't think it's very on target
they<00:02:02.780> just<00:02:02.990> kind<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.290> shoot<00:02:03.500> wherever<00:02:03.830> they

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
they just kind of shoot wherever they

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.270 
they just kind of shoot wherever they
want<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.280> shoot<00:02:04.720> but<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.960> guess<00:02:06.710> that's<00:02:07.130> okay

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
want to shoot but I guess that's okay

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.889 
want to shoot but I guess that's okay
because<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.910> still<00:02:08.179> cool<00:02:08.420> having<00:02:08.810> this

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
because it's still cool having this

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.410 
because it's still cool having this
heads-up<00:02:09.260> display<00:02:09.710> and<00:02:09.890> stuff<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.429> think<00:02:11.270> it's

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
heads-up display and stuff I think it's

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.450 
heads-up display and stuff I think it's

this called over here these piggies kill
some<00:02:26.209> piggies<00:02:26.510> see<00:02:26.780> how<00:02:26.840> far<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.140> get<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.380> ooh

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.650 

now<00:02:33.330> there's<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.450> way<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.110> zoom<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:36.239> like<00:02:37.239> if<00:02:37.480> you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
now there's a way to zoom in like if you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.400 
now there's a way to zoom in like if you
like<00:02:37.989> with<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> gun<00:02:39.660> then<00:02:40.660> try<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:40.959> figure<00:02:41.170> that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
like with a gun then try to figure that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.770 
like with a gun then try to figure that
out<00:02:41.470> like<00:02:42.430> how<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.819> kind<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.150> zooms<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.599> right

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
out like how it kind of zooms in right

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.119 
out like how it kind of zooms in right
there<00:02:43.959> there's<00:02:44.140> actually<00:02:44.260> way<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.680> get<00:02:44.950> like

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
there there's actually way to get like

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.610 
there there's actually way to get like
the<00:02:45.310> battle<00:02:45.730> rifle<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:47.170> then<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.349> can't<00:02:47.560> zoom

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the battle rifle and then you can't zoom

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.650 
the battle rifle and then you can't zoom
in<00:02:47.950> with<00:02:48.129> this<00:02:48.280> assault<00:02:48.879> rifle<00:02:49.000> that's<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.629> I

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
in with this assault rifle that's on I

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.410 
in with this assault rifle that's on I
know<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.830> I'm<00:02:51.010> gonna<00:02:51.160> see<00:02:51.459> if<00:02:51.849> there's<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.239> way

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
know but I'm gonna see if there's a way

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.000 
know but I'm gonna see if there's a way
to<00:02:52.450> make<00:02:52.629> it<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:53.110> do<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.470> maybe<00:02:53.830> like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
to make it just do it maybe like

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.900 
to make it just do it maybe like
binoculars<00:02:54.670> or<00:02:54.819> something<00:02:55.090> if<00:02:55.209> it's<00:02:55.360> English

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
binoculars or something if it's English

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.490 
binoculars or something if it's English
yeah<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.239> guess<00:02:58.540> it's<00:02:59.019> pretty<00:02:59.200> accurate

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
yeah so I guess it's pretty accurate

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.009 
yeah so I guess it's pretty accurate
it's<00:02:59.950> pretty<00:03:00.160> cool<00:03:00.430> mod<00:03:00.700> or<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.420> keep<00:03:01.780> saying

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
it's pretty cool mod or I keep saying

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.069 
it's pretty cool mod or I keep saying
mod<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.500> not<00:03:02.620> really<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.890> mod<00:03:03.160> it's<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.989> sort<00:03:04.989> of

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
mod it's not really a mod it's a sort of

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.780 
mod it's not really a mod it's a sort of
like<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> random<00:03:05.709> thing<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.099> popped<00:03:06.310> up<00:03:06.519> for

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
like a random thing that popped up for

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.089 
like a random thing that popped up for
me<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.180> think<00:03:10.360> it's<00:03:10.690> pretty<00:03:11.410> cool

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
me but I think it's pretty cool

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.920 
me but I think it's pretty cool
I<00:03:12.130> didn't<00:03:12.849> say<00:03:12.940> not<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.180> time<00:03:13.510> because<00:03:13.750> it's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
I didn't say not that time because it's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.949 
I didn't say not that time because it's
actually<00:03:14.140> not<00:03:14.349> a<00:03:14.530> mod<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:15.069> know<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:16.000> keep<00:03:16.660> saying

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
actually not a mod I know I keep saying
