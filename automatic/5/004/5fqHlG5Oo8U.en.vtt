warning signs and I'm now to number six

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.950 
warning signs and I'm now to number six
and<00:00:49.950> number<00:00:50.010> six<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:51.649> triangulation<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
and number six is triangulation and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.229 
and number six is triangulation and
these<00:00:54.960> warning<00:00:55.350> signs<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.610> telling<00:00:57.030> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
usually gang up on one thus a triangle

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.560 
usually gang up on one thus a triangle
and<00:01:07.549> family<00:01:08.549> says<00:01:08.760> lists<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.119> don't<00:01:09.360> like

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and family says lists that don't like

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.250 
and family says lists that don't like
change<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.229> all<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.939> they<00:01:11.939> want<00:01:12.299> things<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.229> be

care you might have to family members

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
care you might have to family members
ganging<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> third<00:01:27.810> because<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
ganging up on the third because the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.520 
ganging up on the third because the
third<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.400> wants<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.150> get<00:01:30.390> care<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:31.049> her<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
third one wants to get care for her and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.640 
third one wants to get care for her and
the<00:01:32.100> other<00:01:32.250> two<00:01:32.840> don't<00:01:33.840> want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.439> this

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the other two don't want to do this

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.170 
the other two don't want to do this
because<00:01:35.180> they<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> inherit<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.409> money

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
because they want to inherit the money

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.149 
because they want to inherit the money
or<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.329> could<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.200> still<00:01:40.979> want<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
or it could be that they still want to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
or it could be that they still want to
keep<00:01:41.220> their<00:01:41.520> mother<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.939> home<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
keep their mother at home the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.030 
keep their mother at home the
triangulation<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.670> when<00:01:45.030> two

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
triangulation is just that when two

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.219 
triangulation is just that when two
members<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> family

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
members of the family

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.969 
members of the family
and<00:01:49.070> that's<00:01:49.750> because<00:01:50.750> what<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.259> want<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:51.860> the

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
and that's because what you want in the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.100 
and that's because what you want in the
nearly<00:01:52.189> normal<00:01:52.759> family<00:01:53.240> or<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.630> presents

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
nearly normal family or is it presents

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.190 
nearly normal family or is it presents
itself<00:01:54.439> is<00:01:54.799> when<00:01:55.130> when<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.329> situation<00:01:57.049> occurs

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
itself is when when a situation occurs

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.600 
itself is when when a situation occurs
where<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.130> have<00:01:58.369> an<00:01:58.520> older<00:01:58.789> person<00:01:59.240> who<00:01:59.509> is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
where you have an older person who is

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.289 
where you have an older person who is
disabled<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.860> nearly<00:02:03.860> normal<00:02:03.979> family<00:02:04.700> they

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
disabled the nearly normal family they

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.650 
disabled the nearly normal family they
lock<00:02:05.780> nerves<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:07.420> triangulation<00:02:08.420> they're

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
lock nerves and triangulation they're

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.600 
lock nerves and triangulation they're
not<00:02:08.840> locking<00:02:09.110> arms<00:02:09.590> at<00:02:09.769> all<00:02:09.890> they're<00:02:10.340> blaming

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
not locking arms at all they're blaming

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.680 
not locking arms at all they're blaming
each<00:02:10.940> other<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.590> next<00:02:12.830> one<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:14.060> sense<00:02:14.450> of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
each other so the next one is a sense of

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.600 
each other so the next one is a sense of
entitlement<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.890> person<00:02:16.220> who's<00:02:16.370> filing

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
entitlement and the person who's filing

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.400 
entitlement and the person who's filing
or<00:02:16.849> not<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.840> have<00:02:18.019> just<00:02:18.230> been

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
or not this that I have just been

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.470 
or not this that I have just been
talking<00:02:18.650> about<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.099> very<00:02:19.280> wealthy<00:02:19.640> suburb<00:02:20.209> in

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
New York Bronxville and so entitlement

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.729 
New York Bronxville and so entitlement
