00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.370
 acquire rhythm 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.389
 We are going to rest and different bikes. 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.740
 Please left remains a 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.740
 your great stories 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.839
 because very small bag count a 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.150
 story of a great hero of our 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:32.670
 this young man was abandoned when he was born 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 but a noble lady found him and the 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.930
 created as his son 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.400
 this time we went through many 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.210
 difficulties 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.330
 were difficult times hunting was scarce 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.510
 many had nothing to eat 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.540
 on completing a certain age to marry 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.450
 our hero was very hopeful because 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.350
 I had to bring food and change the whole 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.510
 situation 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.910
 but this task would become more 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.730
 difficult than he imagined 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.510
 the more he tried the more he 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.260
 fabricated senses failed and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:17.060
 totally unable to help our new 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.060
 a gang turn when suddenly the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 trash that runs where it looks like cell phone 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.190
 Why run from where we came from? 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.470
 my tribe goes hungry I am unable to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.650
 to help if you prefer the death of 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.050
 to be just a weight my body then to be 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.470
 willing to sacrifice for their tribe 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.110
 I understand but that would help more 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.570
 How could I not exist I can not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.150
 to spend everything in life has more than one 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.270
 you should not give up like this. 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.780
 easy to try again fail not 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.560
 prefer death itself, it helps and descends 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.190
 to you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.140
 another chance as it would be possible 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.690
 I can stay longer than a second 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.780
 chance with a new way to reach the 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.650
 things just became the cowboy 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.679
 hunter our hero happened to see in the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.740
 dark with the same quality as the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.790
 half a day full of hope 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.070
 renewed 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.070
 He decides to return to the tribe. 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.510
 after a while everything changed our tribe 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.290
 now it was beginning to thrive 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.070
 all thanks to the hunter who saw the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.600
 Night that would be cool wanted so bad 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:41.510
 known he learned one thing until 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.100
 even with great failure can change the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.550
 life of us all 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.570
 believe anyone can make the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.080
 difference 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.980
 just believe that it's time 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.210
 children 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.850

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.590

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.590
 a new hope
