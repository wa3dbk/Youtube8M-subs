00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:26.983 
General Jackson?

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:30.086 
Do you know what these
decorations signify?

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:35.725 size:78% position:61%
I was wondering
if someone would tell me.

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:43.967  line:85%
This is Santa's sled.

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:43.967 align:start size:19% position:81%
I see.

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:49.839
And this is stuff made of candy.

00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:54.611
This is a gingerbread snowflake.

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:58.581 
And this is a paper
chain of angels.

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:06.189 align:start size:75% position:25%
Did you make this angel?

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:08.124 align:start size:38% position:63%
It's lovely.

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.997 align:start size:69% position:31% line:85%
How old are you, Jane?

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.997 
I'm 5 years old.

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:16.833  line:85%
How old are you?

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:16.833 align:start size:22% position:78%
I'm 38.

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:21.838 
My father is 38.
He's a soldier like you.

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:24.908 
I haven't seen him
for more than a year.

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:28.545 align:start size:78% position:22%
I've not met your father,

00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:32.715 align:end position:100%
but I'm told he's a very
good man, very brave man.

00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:36.586
I'm sure he misses you
as much as I miss my daughter.

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:39.822 
When did you last see
your daughter?

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:44.227 align:start size:63% position:38%
I've never seen her.

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:46.863 size:84% position:58%
She was born just days ago.

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:52.035 size:88% position:56%
I want to see her more
than anything in this world.

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:56.973
I want to see her as much as
your father wants to see you.

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:03.880 
You see that star
at the top of the tree?

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.616 align:start size:69% position:31%
The star of Bethlehem.

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:09.886 size:63% position:69%
The star that showed
the wise men

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:12.655 size:66% position:67%
where they could find
the baby Jesus.

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:16.392 
Mother says that star
will show Daddy

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.127
how to find his way back home.

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:27.303
Well, your mother's very wise,
very good person.

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:30.073 align:start size:81% position:19%
Your daddy will come home.

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:34.510 align:start size:47% position:53%
All the daddies
will come home.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.949
Oh, my.
