00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the first video was renzo revoredo 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.080
 then Juan Manuel Vargas and now is the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 forward Claudio Pizarro who suffered 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.730
 an injury to the right knee when 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.210
 you played a practice match with the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.920
 sub-17 roster of sporting crystal he 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.750
 I had a ball divided with others 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.710
 games in which a little annoyance in the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.910
 right knee then this one has this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 annoy us at the sheikh 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.849
 anti-inflammatory but rather a 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.179
 resonance to complete the diagnosis 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.529
 if they are things that we are we are that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.780
 are likely to happen on the computer 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.850
 I think they have been training hard and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.850
 a few days ago and good they are feeling 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 the work but but as I repeat 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.129
 let's hope that the thing is the best 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.110
 way and we can all be all 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.120
 United 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.280
 the picture is uncertain but for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 Caution underwent an MRI 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.090
 magnetic to rule out a problem 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.090
 internal ligament 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 but anyway it stays like this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.129
 ligament that we are shelves we are going to 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.600
 complement the diagnosis with 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.839
 resonance we already have a diagnosis 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 pizjuÃ¡n is diagnostic is completed 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.750
 with people and with that we are 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.189
 it really is a traumatic event in 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.020
 soccer is a sport as always 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.390
 contact missions at the contact level of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.509
 the ball and can be resolved twice 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.369
 with stimuli on the other hand the doctor of 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.500
 the selection claimed that some 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.929
 players are reacting well to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.020
 treatment that is being done 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.759
 as is the case with Rodriguez and the ball 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.110
 it's going away I 'm pretty good at 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.880
 tear that occurred in japan that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.369
 is doing physical work with the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 barrero position very good and does not feel 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.039
 upset now I think that the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.600
 next week he's already playing ball 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.730
 with that member and I think it goes 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.130
 good way let's observe it 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.010
 what happens that he has second day of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 choosing a small tear then 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.740
 let's hope we appeal to the good 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.300
 recovery of the organism that the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.330
 athlete is a lot is completely 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.730
 different the team of all is against 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.220
 the time the cup america will start in 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.560
 two weeks and approximately seven 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.110
 the players who have an injury 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.090
 and that they risk losing the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.090
 longed for the international tournament
