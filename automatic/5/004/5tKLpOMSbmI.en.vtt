00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you gonna do it quickly because you just

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.140 
you gonna do it quickly because you just
I'm<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.049> much<00:02:25.170> more<00:02:25.230> accurate<00:02:25.769> when<00:02:25.920> I'm

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
I'm just so much more accurate when I'm

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.910 
I'm just so much more accurate when I'm
guessing<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.330> for<00:02:27.599> me<00:02:27.720> aliasing<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.769> way

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
guessing so for me aliasing is the way

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.670 
guessing so for me aliasing is the way
to<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.209> unless<00:02:30.209> they're<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:31.560> I'm

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
to go unless they're I just know I'm

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.250 
to go unless they're I just know I'm
gonna<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.920> accurate<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.549> I'm<00:02:32.700> gonna<00:02:33.260> hip

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
gonna be accurate then I'm gonna hip

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.979 
gonna be accurate then I'm gonna hip
fire<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.920> also<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.180> hit<00:02:36.390> far<00:02:36.569> before<00:02:36.780> I

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
we're like the game's fault like it I

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.950 
we're like the game's fault like it I
just<00:04:38.759> if<00:04:38.940> I<00:04:39.030> would<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.240> just<00:04:39.330> been<00:04:39.750> more

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
just if I would have just been more

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.230 
just if I would have just been more
accurate<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.410> would<00:04:40.560> have<00:04:40.650> killed<00:04:40.830> him<00:04:41.240> but

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
accurate I would have killed him but

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.200 
accurate I would have killed him but
yeah<00:04:43.069> what<00:04:44.069> was<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.310> same<00:04:44.520> oh<00:04:44.849> yeah<00:04:45.150> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
yeah what was the same oh yeah the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.730 
yeah what was the same oh yeah the
dispatcher<00:04:45.599> from<00:04:45.870> black<00:04:46.050> ops<00:04:46.199> it<00:04:46.319> wasn't<00:04:46.620> even

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
dispatcher from black ops it wasn't even

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.100 
dispatcher from black ops it wasn't even
really<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.250> powerful<00:04:47.520> like<00:04:48.479> range<00:04:48.780> wasn't

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
really that powerful like range wasn't

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.800 
really that powerful like range wasn't
even<00:04:49.259> that<00:04:49.349> good<00:04:49.759> but<00:04:50.759> it<00:04:50.789> was<00:04:51.000> just<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.300> uh

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
even that good but it was just that uh

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.409 
even that good but it was just that uh
the<00:04:52.530> maps<00:04:52.770> were<00:04:52.979> so<00:04:53.190> good<00:04:53.460> for<00:04:53.669> flanking<00:04:53.940> and

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
the maps were so good for flanking and

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.409 
the maps were so good for flanking and
and<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:56.220> suppressor<00:04:56.729> really<00:04:57.000> held<00:04:57.210> for

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
and the suppressor really held for

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.290 
and the suppressor really held for
flanking<00:04:57.630> song<00:04:58.080> yeah<00:04:59.039> that's<00:04:59.370> probably<00:04:59.789> the

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
flanking song yeah that's probably the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.930 
flanking song yeah that's probably the
reason<00:05:00.389> why<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:01.020> did<00:05:01.320> I<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:02.070> was<00:05:02.460> really<00:05:02.759> good

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
reason why I did I I was really good

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.020 
reason why I did I I was really good

douche but I'm just saying that I was
felt<00:05:09.660> really<00:05:09.900> comfortable<00:05:10.139> using<00:05:10.680> that<00:05:10.919> gun

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
felt really comfortable using that gun

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.890 
felt really comfortable using that gun
like<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.610> was<00:05:11.759> easily<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.150> best<00:05:12.360> con<00:05:12.599> for<00:05:12.810> me

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
like it was easily the best con for me

like it was easily the best con for me
in<00:05:13.020> that<00:05:13.050> game<00:05:13.400> but<00:05:14.400> yeah<00:05:14.550> that's<00:05:14.789> not<00:05:15.000> the

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
in that game but yeah that's not the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.060 
in that game but yeah that's not the
