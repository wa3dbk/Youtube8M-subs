00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.840
 Call of Duty Black Ops and all children should clarify and cordially 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.640
 welcome 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.139
 to another of the MPAA Jakobsen 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.869
 This time live germination couples something that has not given long 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.019
 just because I am at the moment 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.460
 play very very important because at the moment I very little desire for color 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.569
 Arab 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:23.650
 I think 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.300
 It should also be a goodbye because it starts my YouTube career 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.210
 not always like that 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.450
 and 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.170
 this is my biggest topic staying with the project 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.220
 and 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.770
 I do not know what to say I did not write anything down and 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.580
 That's why I want to be around so much, but I'll leave it soon 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.580
 be his opponent of me is the pieces 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.050
 You've just played a round the first in three weeks 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.310
 I think I 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.790
 taken up to the 1 required 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.580
 and 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.239
 he already has a lot to the front 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.239
 and therefore refrain 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.200
 which felt pretty good that something pretty well followed you 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.930
 We liked it 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.380
 mw2 UBS lobbyist scrapped paw 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.080
 first dies 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.410
 Although I played it a lot when I played it was very good 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.410
 found even if the best odds were 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.460
 that does not fit that bad now 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.660
 I'm just wondering why it is too many freaks and their good to relatively many freaks 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:38.610
 I have to go to the table 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 Star Wars but to say that did not hit us 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.040
 he does not mean that Cardoso does a lot of Fox though, too 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.040
 and the songs follow the Sophie episode 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.460
 then it comes already dead 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.320
 yes, I knew it 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.400
 what have I pressed synonymous s.Nissan 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.430
 Capsaicin I've got to catch the kicker times maybe has 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.300
 you seen how bad it makes you upload on KÃ¼nzell in the field one 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300
 has a doctrine 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.279
 Jakobs down 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.389
 up on your lap and betrayed occupation so fast 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
 Prof 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.439
 so off too 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.549
 I have drugs 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.549
 People abbot popping 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:29.989
 People 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989
 Sustainability shot 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.209
 I have to be hiding 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.629
 and I can not stay there because otherwise I would be berated as a camper what 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.149
 does not like it 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:45.569
 I would like to invest Bouffier 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.619
 a weekend without a PC 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:49.639
 in a 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.359
 in the wilderness 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.419
 if we mean you 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.429
 Also the weather I honestly do not have it anymore 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.429
 say fishing again 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.209
 he is a lot of fun 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.329
 do not necessarily watch 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.789
 but catch Haas himself 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.809
 interrupted 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.229
 I think I took mixed threat back which is about the same 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.409
 the laaber 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:23.029
 Maier has to paint her judgment so catch well and get per drag 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.009
 view 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:26.279
 I only have to 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.389
 other players kick 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.149
 that was nothing 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.769
 that was what 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.769
 a grenade 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.189
 a9 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.059
 the North 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.059
 but significantly reduced 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.939
 I could go straight for two rallies 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.359
 i could be worthy i will do it you do not know 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:08.389
 so it wanted to be ridiculous to vote 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.079
 but I want to report it 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.079
 because then I can already witness that 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.819
 Fri. 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:22.120
 and a round 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.680
 online video Reporter Milk provides considerable care in the parish of 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.979
 to save and kill them 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.979
 Porsche under over are already there 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.569
 and he will be us and we can not 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.580
 convinced throughout the world 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.580
 later than continue playing and shooting dogs in the head he stretches 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.159
 also on the slopes 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.300
 Herbert have luggage 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.830
 were very crazy war 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.189
 Plattling at the authority Matthies of it is why 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.430
 but that is 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.400
 what's the killing people there were on other people's shoots 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.970
 rororo bocholt-barlo under Vettel I'm bitter 9 I hear they are 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.139
 outside 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.279
 his father was denied by the britpop band 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.490

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.490
 H 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.050
 he is cucumbers 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.139
 why I do not go so far as we are looking for 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.999
 my team is clear that not every man stands winner 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.479
 really good with the song 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.879
 Aachen 8 Marien 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.699
 11 9 I'm the only positive aspect says thank you topics said Raue 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.460
 I wish I had such players as we 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.309
 by Reiner Wellmann 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:05.490
 Ronald again 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.490
 and leads skaters over the 11th 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:14.809
 August follows 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.869

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:20.639
 Dr, I hope so 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.979
 this something 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.040
 KIG will be concerned to call it he rose IMF estimated this reaffirmed 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:26.629
 in The Field 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:27.980
 fallen 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.809
 But they go up for that 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:31.569
 and 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:33.309
 See you next time at TUI
