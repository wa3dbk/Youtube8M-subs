00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.560 

that<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:33.080> so<00:00:33.590> lacy<00:00:34.160> this<00:00:34.490> is<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:35.300> is<00:00:35.450> how

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
that is so lacy this is this is how

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.880 
that is so lacy this is this is how
we're<00:00:35.750> making<00:00:35.900> our<00:00:36.200> connection<00:00:36.680> right<00:00:36.830> here

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
we're making our connection right here

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.440 
we're making our connection right here
then<00:00:37.870> that<00:00:39.700> there's<00:00:40.700> a<00:00:40.790> couple<00:00:41.000> of<00:00:41.210> different

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
then that there's a couple of different

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.660 
then that there's a couple of different
ways<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:41.750> do<00:00:41.900> that<00:00:42.080> that's<00:00:42.320> just<00:00:42.590> a<00:00:42.770> inline

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
ways to do that that's just a inline

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.640 
ways to do that that's just a inline
splice<00:00:44.000> where<00:00:44.870> it's<00:00:44.990> compression<00:00:45.500> by

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
splice where it's compression by

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.140 
splice where it's compression by
compression<00:00:46.900> there<00:00:47.900> a<00:00:47.930> barbed<00:00:49.000> coupler<00:00:50.000> on

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
compression there a barbed coupler on

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.400 
compression there a barbed coupler on
the<00:00:50.300> end<00:00:50.450> of<00:00:50.600> it<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.900> then<00:00:51.110> there's<00:00:51.320> a

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
the end of it and then there's a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.030 
the end of it and then there's a
self-threading<00:00:52.930> caller<00:00:53.930> that<00:00:54.379> bites<00:00:54.800> down

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
self-threading caller that bites down

00:00:55.040 --> 00:03:02.080 
self-threading caller that bites down
over<00:00:55.340> that<00:00:55.460> tubing

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.310 

watch<00:03:03.090> them<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.450> sprinkler<00:03:03.690> comes<00:03:03.990> around

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
watch them that sprinkler comes around

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.500 
watch them that sprinkler comes around
you're<00:03:05.100> still<00:03:05.340> getting<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.640> distance<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.330> mean

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
you're still getting the distance I mean

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.280 
you're still getting the distance I mean
you<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.230> be<00:03:07.350> as<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.590> noise<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:07.980> want<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.340> really

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
you can be as a noise you want to really

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.230 
you can be as a noise you want to really
hit<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.440> am<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.920> added<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.280> customers<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:11.910> Idaho

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
hit I am I added to customers in Idaho

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.050
