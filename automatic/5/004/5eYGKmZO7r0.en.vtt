of it so we got the operating system in
full<00:00:43.680> blown<00:00:45.500> up<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.800> running<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.640> look

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
full blown up and running here so look

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.110 
full blown up and running here so look
at<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> very<00:00:49.170> quick<00:00:49.680> brief<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.430> demo<00:00:50.730> now

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
at a very quick brief little demo now

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
last few days I've been trying this the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
last few days I've been trying this the
wireless<00:01:10.740> connection<00:01:11.460> drivers<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.090> been<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
wireless connection drivers have been a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.289 
wireless connection drivers have been a
bit<00:01:12.689> flawed<00:01:13.020> they've<00:01:13.439> been<00:01:13.710> disconnected<00:01:14.310> now

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
bit flawed they've been disconnected now

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.090 
bit flawed they've been disconnected now
I've<00:01:15.630> heard<00:01:15.900> rumors<00:01:16.170> about<00:01:16.439> something<00:01:17.040> like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
I've heard rumors about something like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.539 
I've heard rumors about something like
an<00:01:17.250> ndiswrapper<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:19.590> isn't<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.070> good<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.430> how

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
an ndiswrapper that isn't so good as how

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429 
an ndiswrapper that isn't so good as how
they<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.880> whilst<00:01:21.210> working<00:01:21.630> i<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.320> if

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
they got whilst working i don't know if

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.810 
they got whilst working i don't know if
it's<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.220> i<00:01:23.250> don't<00:01:23.369> even<00:01:23.610> know<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it's to do that i don't even know that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.420 
it's to do that i don't even know that
exists<00:01:24.390> since<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.810> has<00:01:25.080> been<00:01:25.259> told<00:01:25.530> I've<00:01:25.770> not

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
exists since what has been told I've not

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
exists since what has been told I've not
managed<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.540> knowledge<00:01:27.869> into<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
managed to get much knowledge into this

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.490 
managed to get much knowledge into this
so<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:29.460> open<00:01:29.850> google<00:01:30.659> chrome's<00:01:31.020> linux

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so we open google chrome's linux

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
so we open google chrome's linux
equivalent<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.549> also<00:01:32.700> run<00:01:32.970> by<00:01:33.000> google

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
equivalent which is also run by google

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.249 
equivalent which is also run by google
chrome<00:01:33.960> them<00:01:34.290> i<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.900> go<00:01:36.900> away<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
chrome them i think it is go away with a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.490 
chrome them i think it is go away with a
bit<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:40.159> dead<00:01:41.159> giggle<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:43.110> wifis

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
bit that dead giggle and the wifis

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.550 
bit that dead giggle and the wifis
moments<00:01:43.950> working<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.820> let's<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.560> therefore

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
moments working so let's see therefore

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219 
moments working so let's see therefore
the<00:01:46.649> features<00:01:47.159> yet<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.509> still<00:01:48.780> got<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> f11

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the features yet you still got the f11

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.030 
the features yet you still got the f11
full<00:01:49.829> screen<00:01:50.220> features<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.939> Google<00:01:51.270> crime<00:01:51.570> so
