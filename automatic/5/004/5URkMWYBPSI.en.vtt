welcome to another tutorial by all three

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.340 
welcome to another tutorial by all three
dtek<00:00:02.669> in<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:03.629> tutorial<00:00:03.810> we're<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.200> to

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
dtek in this tutorial we're going to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.680 
dtek in this tutorial we're going to
show<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.650> make<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:05.009> basic<00:00:05.430> create<00:00:06.270> for<00:00:06.569> your

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
show you to make a basic create for your

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.790 
show you to make a basic create for your
scenes<00:00:07.130> first<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.280> all<00:00:08.400> add<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.269> cube<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.650> your

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
scenes first of all add a cube to your

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.770 
scenes first of all add a cube to your
scene<00:00:11.840> and<00:00:13.460> now<00:00:14.460> there's<00:00:14.700> two<00:00:15.360> different<00:00:15.599> ways

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
scene and now there's two different ways

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.960 
scene and now there's two different ways
I<00:00:15.990> know<00:00:16.109> doing<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.590> cross<00:00:17.550> show<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
I know doing this cross show you the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.400 
I know doing this cross show you the
simplest<00:00:19.640> basically<00:00:20.640> cube<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.320> either

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
simplest basically cube you can either

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.460 
simplest basically cube you can either
press<00:00:22.650> C<00:00:22.949> or<00:00:23.689> functions<00:00:24.689> make<00:00:24.990> edit<00:00:25.260> bulb

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
press C or functions make edit bulb

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.140 
press C or functions make edit bulb
which<00:00:25.619> will<00:00:25.769> mix<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> cube<00:00:26.340> editable<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.970> you

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
which will mix the cube editable and you

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.050 
which will mix the cube editable and you
can<00:00:27.269> select<00:00:27.830> each<00:00:28.830> separate<00:00:29.519> phase<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.939> your

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
can select each separate phase of your

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.280 
can select each separate phase of your
cube<00:00:30.769> or<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:33.530> go<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.559> cube<00:00:35.250> object<00:00:36.290> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
cube or you can go to cube object and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.139 
cube or you can go to cube object and
then<00:00:37.410> select<00:00:37.829> separate<00:00:38.160> services<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.000> when

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
then select separate services and when

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.720 
then select separate services and when
you<00:00:39.270> make<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.629> editable<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.370> each<00:00:41.489> face

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
you make this editable you got each face

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
you make this editable you got each face
there<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> think<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.510> takes<00:00:42.750> longer<00:00:43.140> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
there but I think this takes longer so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.569 
there but I think this takes longer so
i'm<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> show<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> quickest<00:00:44.430> way

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
i'm going to show you the quickest way

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.440 
i'm going to show you the quickest way
so<00:00:45.230> basically<00:00:46.230> cube<00:00:46.550> take<00:00:47.550> off<00:00:47.730> separate

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
so basically cube take off separate

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.069 
so basically cube take off separate
surfaces<00:00:49.610> c4<00:00:50.610> editable<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.239> i<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:51.899> select

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
surfaces c4 editable and i will select

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.959 
surfaces c4 editable and i will select
each<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.120> faces<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> material

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
each one the faces and out of material

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.849 
each one the faces and out of material
this<00:00:56.969> wouldn't<00:00:57.719> create<00:00:57.960> material<00:00:58.500> which<00:00:58.710> i

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
this wouldn't create material which i

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.130 
this wouldn't create material which i
found<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.399> google<00:00:59.879> i<00:01:00.059> find<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> pretty

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
found from google i find this a pretty

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.980 
found from google i find this a pretty
good<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.930> looks<00:01:04.080> quite<00:01:04.290> effective

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
good one that looks quite effective

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.670 
good one that looks quite effective
basically<00:01:06.990> select<00:01:07.610> each<00:01:08.610> face<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.500> drag

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
basically select each face and just drag

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.460 
basically select each face and just drag
and<00:01:10.740> drop<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> material<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.260> as<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> can

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and drop the material to it as you can

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.160 
and drop the material to it as you can
see<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.189> can't<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.610> these<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:14.909> materials

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
see you can't see these two materials

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.469 
see you can't see these two materials
but<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.409> still<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:16.860> when<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.130> render<00:01:17.479> as

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
but they still there when you render as

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.760 
but they still there when you render as
you<00:01:18.659> look<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.020> you've<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.290> each<00:01:19.530> face

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you look here you've got each face

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.539 
you look here you've got each face
selected<00:01:21.200> will<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.409> add<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.710> last<00:01:22.920> three

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
selected will just add the last three

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.789 
selected will just add the last three
and<00:01:27.350> there<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:29.000> that's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.329> very<00:01:31.229> simple

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and there you go that's a very simple

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.050 
and there you go that's a very simple
tutorial<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.460> make<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> crate

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420 

I<00:01:39.119> will<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.350> look<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.649> bit<00:01:41.100> better

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
I will just make this look a bit better

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.450 
I will just make this look a bit better
we'll<00:01:42.000> add<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> floor<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.689> light

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.790 

just<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.690> looks<00:01:50.900> a<00:01:51.020> bit<00:01:51.170> more<00:01:51.409> effective

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.120 

add<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:58.860> shadow<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.800> there<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.100> go

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
add a shadow with this and there you go

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.139 
add a shadow with this and there you go
that's<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.350> simple<00:02:07.350> crate<00:02:07.950> which<00:02:08.820> you<00:02:08.940> cannot

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
that's a simple crate which you cannot

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.320 
that's a simple crate which you cannot
do<00:02:09.360> any<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:10.080> scenes<00:02:10.730> more<00:02:11.730> tutorials<00:02:12.210> can

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
do any of your scenes more tutorials can

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.590 
do any of your scenes more tutorials can
