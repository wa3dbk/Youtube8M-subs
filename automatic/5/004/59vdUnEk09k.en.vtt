new into this ones they're a little bit

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
new into this ones they're a little bit
better<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> interface<00:01:25.590> for

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
better and I know on the interface for

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.460 
better and I know on the interface for
there<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> dial<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.090> radial<00:01:27.450> dial<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.320> can

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
there is a dial a radial dial you can

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.770 
there is a dial a radial dial you can
map<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.090> newer<00:01:30.240> versions<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
map up to you know in newer versions of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.710 
map up to you know in newer versions of
Photoshop<00:01:31.200> there<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> rotate<00:01:32.220> button<00:01:32.720> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
Photoshop there is a rotate button and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.649 
Photoshop there is a rotate button and
you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.650> map<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.579> rotation<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.479> it's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you can map that to rotation so it's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
you can map that to rotation so it's
like<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.079> equivalent<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.950> spinning

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
like you know equivalent to spinning

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.100 
like you know equivalent to spinning
your<00:01:38.610> paper<00:01:38.790> around<00:01:39.119> which<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> super<00:01:39.900> useful

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
your paper around which is super useful

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.740 
your paper around which is super useful
but<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> mean<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.909> other<00:01:42.360> things<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
but I mean you know it's other things to

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
but I mean you know it's other things to
be<00:01:42.840> aware<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.470> you're<00:01:43.590> right-handed
