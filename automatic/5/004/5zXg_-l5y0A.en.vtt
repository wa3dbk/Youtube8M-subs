00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
as this end also uses 3.5 millimeter and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.800 
as this end also uses 3.5 millimeter and
not<00:03:22.930> any<00:03:23.080> proprietary<00:03:24.570> connection<00:03:25.570> which

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
not any proprietary connection which

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.699
