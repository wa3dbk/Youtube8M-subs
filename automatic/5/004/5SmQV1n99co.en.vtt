would look to ston assuring it looked
almost<00:00:11.730> like<00:00:11.849> some<00:00:12.120> sort<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.360> terraforming

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
almost like some sort of terraforming

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.749 
almost like some sort of terraforming
device<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.590> way<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.920> mix<00:00:14.160> those<00:00:14.429> shots

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
device the way that you mix those shots

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.660 
device the way that you mix those shots
but<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.929> real<00:00:16.289> terms<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.039> achieved

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
but in real terms what have you achieved

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.410 
but in real terms what have you achieved
well<00:00:18.420> we've<00:00:19.199> achieved<00:00:19.640> documentation<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
well we've achieved documentation of a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.230 
well we've achieved documentation of a
project<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.109> China<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.340> China<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
project in China so in China the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.620 
project in China so in China the
government<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.170> people<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:26.630> basically

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
government and the people have basically

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
government and the people have basically
taken<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> place<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.500> was<00:00:28.529> historically

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
taken a place which was historically

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.609 
taken a place which was historically
degraded<00:00:30.060> over<00:00:30.179> very<00:00:30.630> long<00:00:30.840> periods<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.380> time

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
degraded over very long periods of time

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.630 
degraded over very long periods of time
and<00:00:32.210> analyzed<00:00:33.210> why<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:34.469> degradation<00:00:35.340> was

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and analyzed why that degradation was

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.970 
and analyzed why that degradation was
taking<00:00:36.000> place<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.570> they<00:00:37.290> found<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.950> was

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
taking place and they found that it was

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.030 
taking place and they found that it was
the<00:00:38.399> loss<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.180> biodiversity<00:00:39.570> loss<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.500> biomass

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the loss of biodiversity loss of biomass

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.970 
the loss of biodiversity loss of biomass
loss<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.820> accumulated<00:00:42.540> organic<00:00:43.020> matter<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
loss of accumulated organic matter that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.819 
loss of accumulated organic matter that
was<00:00:44.160> disrupting<00:00:45.050> infiltration<00:00:46.050> retention<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
was disrupting infiltration retention of

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
was disrupting infiltration retention of
rainfall<00:00:47.340> which<00:00:48.059> also<00:00:48.300> changes

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
rainfall which also changes

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.680 
rainfall which also changes
photosynthesis<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> nutrient<00:00:50.789> okay<00:00:51.270> what

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
photosynthesis and nutrient okay what

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.510 
photosynthesis and nutrient okay what
are<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.320> composite<00:00:52.829> bits<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.370> this

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
are the the composite bits of this

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.119 
are the the composite bits of this
jigsaw<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.780> kept<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.379> place<00:00:55.530> for

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
jigsaw that have to be kept in place for

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.490 
jigsaw that have to be kept in place for
this<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.120> land<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.109> come<00:00:58.289> through

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this kind of land to then come through

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.729 
this kind of land to then come through
the<00:00:58.590> system<00:00:58.890> well<00:01:00.199> probably<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.469> most

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the system well probably the most

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
the system well probably the most
startling<00:01:02.699> thing<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.480> they

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
startling thing is that they

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.980 
startling thing is that they
transitioned<00:01:04.680> all<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.280> people<00:01:05.580> away<00:01:05.880> from

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
transitioned all the people away from

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.719 
transitioned all the people away from
subsistence<00:01:06.990> agriculture<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.580> you're

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
subsistence agriculture so if you're

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.539 
subsistence agriculture so if you're
going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.090> leave<00:01:09.360> people<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.619> poverty<00:01:11.250> it's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
going to leave people in poverty it's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.190 
going to leave people in poverty it's
going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.850> very<00:01:12.060> difficult<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.689> restore

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
going to be very difficult to restore

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.289 
going to be very difficult to restore
these<00:01:13.380> areas<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.990> simultaneously<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
these areas so it's simultaneously a

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.660 
these areas so it's simultaneously a
transition<00:01:18.299> for<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> people<00:01:19.049> so

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
transition for the people so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
transition for the people so
sociologically<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.780> economically<00:01:21.780> okay<00:01:22.590> if

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
sociologically and economically okay if

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.890 
sociologically and economically okay if
the<00:01:23.100> political<00:01:23.430> dynamic<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> there<00:01:24.720> because

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the political dynamic is there because

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
the political dynamic is there because
that's<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.439> effect<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.890> we're<00:01:26.040> saying<00:01:26.250> here

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that's in effect what we're saying here

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490 
that's in effect what we're saying here
if<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> political<00:01:26.970> dynamic<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.960> place<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
if the political dynamic is in place is

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.280 
if the political dynamic is in place is
the<00:01:28.860> process<00:01:29.310> easy<00:01:29.960> well<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.020> wouldn't<00:01:31.229> say

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the process easy well I wouldn't say

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.429 
the process easy well I wouldn't say
it's<00:01:31.500> easy<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.400> mean<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.600> fact<00:01:33.869> extremely

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it's easy I mean it's in fact extremely

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.679 
it's easy I mean it's in fact extremely
complex<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> number<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
complex because you have a number of

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
complex because you have a number of
systems<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.530> working<00:01:37.829> together<00:01:37.950> but

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
systems which are working together but

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.100 
systems which are working together but
you<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> vicious<00:01:39.570> cycle<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.400> you're

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
you have a vicious cycle which if you're

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.810 
you have a vicious cycle which if you're
disrupting<00:01:43.110> long-term<00:01:43.710> evolutionary<00:01:44.369> trends

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
disrupting long-term evolutionary trends

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
disrupting long-term evolutionary trends
then<00:01:45.000> you're<00:01:45.149> kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> trapped<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
then you're kind of trapped in this in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.969 
then you're kind of trapped in this in
this<00:01:47.490> destructive<00:01:48.390> vicious<00:01:49.259> cycle<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:49.860> if

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
this destructive vicious cycle but if

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.520 
this destructive vicious cycle but if
you<00:01:50.130> understand<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.720> infiltration

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you understand that infiltration

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.980 
you understand that infiltration
retention<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.340> rainfall<00:01:53.909> accumulation<00:01:54.899> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
retention of rainfall accumulation of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.560 
retention of rainfall accumulation of
organic<00:01:55.110> matter<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.280> role<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> biomass<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
organic matter the role of biomass and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.209 
organic matter the role of biomass and
the<00:01:57.630> role<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.869> biodiversity<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.009> can

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the role of biodiversity then you can

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.940 
the role of biodiversity then you can
actually<00:01:59.520> get<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.299> virtuous<00:02:00.840> circle<00:02:01.049> which

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
actually get a virtuous circle which

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.280 
actually get a virtuous circle which
will<00:02:02.130> restore<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.790> ok<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:03.840> now<00:02:03.990> got

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
will restore this ok if we have now got

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
will restore this ok if we have now got
an<00:02:04.469> understanding<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> how<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> break<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
an understanding of how to break that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.749 
an understanding of how to break that
cycle<00:02:06.420> what's<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.320> stop<00:02:07.380> us<00:02:07.560> doing<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.489> at

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
cycle what's to stop us doing this at

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880 
cycle what's to stop us doing this at
some<00:02:09.149> point<00:02:09.179> further<00:02:09.720> down<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> road<00:02:10.289> for<00:02:10.709> all

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
some point further down the road for all

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.740 
some point further down the road for all
the<00:02:11.069> different<00:02:11.370> bits<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.760> planet<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.180> we

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the different bits of the planet that we

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.360 
the different bits of the planet that we
told<00:02:13.050> increasingly<00:02:13.710> being<00:02:13.950> affected<00:02:14.310> by

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
told increasingly being affected by

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.890 
told increasingly being affected by
global<00:02:14.490> warming<00:02:14.700> or<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.300> ask<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.570> question

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
global warming or to ask the question

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.960 
global warming or to ask the question
another<00:02:16.020> way<00:02:16.170> why<00:02:16.920> can't<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.460> just<00:02:17.640> carry<00:02:17.880> on

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
another way why can't we just carry on

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.850 
another way why can't we just carry on
abusing<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> planet<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:19.530> at<00:02:19.650> some

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
abusing the planet and then at some

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.680 
abusing the planet and then at some
point<00:02:19.890> say<00:02:20.310> oh<00:02:20.490> well<00:02:20.700> we<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.300> do<00:02:21.420> what<00:02:21.570> they've

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
point say oh well we can do what they've

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.440 
point say oh well we can do what they've
done<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.960> China<00:02:22.160> well<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.670> come<00:02:24.270> to

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
done in China well I think you come to

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.170 
done in China well I think you come to
collapse<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:26.010> mean<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.820> early

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
collapse so I mean one of the early

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.140 
collapse so I mean one of the early
things<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.720> you've<00:02:27.840> seen<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.290> that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
things that you've seen is that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.430 
things that you've seen is that
civilizations<00:02:30.150> actually<00:02:30.630> collapsed<00:02:31.290> because

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
civilizations actually collapsed because

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.520 
civilizations actually collapsed because
their<00:02:31.770> ecosystems<00:02:32.490> failed<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.380> what<00:02:34.380> we're

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
their ecosystems failed and what we're

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.320 
their ecosystems failed and what we're
seeing<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.520> we<00:02:35.700> need<00:02:36.030> to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
seeing here is that we need to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.780 
seeing here is that we need to
understand<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.110> come<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.440> line<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
understand and come in line with the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.760 
understand and come in line with the
ecosystem<00:02:39.390> function<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.050> we<00:02:40.170> understand

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
ecosystem function so if we understand

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.610 
ecosystem function so if we understand
what<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.820> ecosystem<00:02:42.450> function<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.230> we

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
what the ecosystem function is and we

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.710 
what the ecosystem function is and we
work<00:02:43.860> together<00:02:44.130> with<00:02:44.640> nature<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:45.330> can<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.690> a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
work together with nature we can have a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.050 
work together with nature we can have a
much<00:02:45.989> better<00:02:46.170> result<00:02:46.650> than<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:47.100> we<00:02:47.280> if<00:02:47.850> we

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
much better result than if we if we

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.350 
much better result than if we if we
break<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:50.310> know<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.550> earlier<00:02:51.060> we

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
break it so you know the earlier we

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.530 
break it so you know the earlier we
intervene<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.520> restore<00:02:53.520> these<00:02:53.700> areas<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
intervene and restore these areas the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.840 
intervene and restore these areas the
implication<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.920> see<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.520> that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
implication that we that I see is that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.210 
implication that we that I see is that
we<00:02:56.970> should<00:02:57.180> restore<00:02:57.510> every<00:02:58.140> bit<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.650> degraded

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
we should restore every bit of degraded

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.250 
we should restore every bit of degraded
land<00:02:59.430> now<00:02:59.790> what<00:03:00.600> does<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.810> mean<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.020> other

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
land now what does this mean for other

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.520 
land now what does this mean for other
countries<00:03:01.500> other<00:03:01.980> continents<00:03:02.640> well<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.930> mean

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
countries other continents well I mean

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.060 
countries other continents well I mean
we're<00:03:04.920> interested<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:06.650> addressing<00:03:07.650> human

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
we're interested in in addressing human

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.190 
we're interested in in addressing human
impact<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.640> climate<00:03:09.030> change<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:09.750> want<00:03:09.989> to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
impact on climate change so we want to

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.650 
impact on climate change so we want to
sequester<00:03:10.620> carbon<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.880> carbon<00:03:12.480> was

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
sequester carbon so carbon was

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.420 
sequester carbon so carbon was
originally<00:03:13.260> removed<00:03:13.620> from<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.950> atmosphere

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
originally removed from the atmosphere

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.270 
originally removed from the atmosphere
by<00:03:14.570> photosynthesis<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:15.750> here<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.620> have<00:03:16.830> huge

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
by photosynthesis so here we have huge

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.890 
by photosynthesis so here we have huge
areas<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.060> planet<00:03:18.360> which<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:18.780> been

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
areas of the planet which have been

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.009 
areas of the planet which have been
degraded<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.709> we<00:03:20.489> can<00:03:20.820> do<00:03:21.180> photosynthesis

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
degraded and we can do photosynthesis

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.199 
degraded and we can do photosynthesis
there<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.500> we<00:03:22.860> restore<00:03:23.400> their<00:03:23.700> functionality

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
there if we restore their functionality

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.180 
there if we restore their functionality
so<00:03:24.750> does<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:24.930> mean<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.470> process<00:03:25.950> is

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
so does that mean that this process is

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.130 
so does that mean that this process is
being<00:03:26.370> worked<00:03:26.670> through<00:03:26.790> or<00:03:27.239> has<00:03:27.540> been<00:03:27.870> worked

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
being worked through or has been worked

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.000 
being worked through or has been worked
through<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.590> other<00:03:28.799> locations<00:03:29.400> we've<00:03:30.360> seen<00:03:30.720> in

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
through in other locations we've seen in

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.710 
through in other locations we've seen in
Ethiopia<00:03:32.010> we've<00:03:32.310> seen<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:32.640> Rwanda<00:03:33.239> actually

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
Ethiopia we've seen in Rwanda actually

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.410 
Ethiopia we've seen in Rwanda actually
everywhere<00:03:34.230> where<00:03:34.620> we've<00:03:34.799> tried<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.850> gone<00:03:36.120> to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
everywhere where we've tried and gone to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.350 
everywhere where we've tried and gone to
look<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.959> see<00:03:37.590> would<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.190> work<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.880> has<00:03:39.150> it

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
look and see would this work it has it

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.190 
look and see would this work it has it
has<00:03:39.780> worked<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.799> if<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.519> understand<00:03:42.420> why

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
has worked so if you understand why

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.280 
has worked so if you understand why
these<00:03:43.260> places<00:03:44.010> are<00:03:44.430> are<00:03:45.000> becoming<00:03:45.840> less<00:03:46.230> and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
these places are are becoming less and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.880 
these places are are becoming less and
less<00:03:46.530> fertile<00:03:47.340> less<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.000> less<00:03:48.180> moist<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:48.930> you

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
less fertile less and less moist and you

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.220 
less fertile less and less moist and you
intervene<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.000> change<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.570> then<00:03:51.900> actually

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
intervene to change that then actually

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.289 
intervene to change that then actually
every<00:03:52.739> place<00:03:52.980> where<00:03:53.190> we've<00:03:53.370> we've<00:03:53.880> gone<00:03:54.120> to

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
every place where we've we've gone to

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.710 
every place where we've we've gone to
look<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.750> has<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.769> has<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:56.790> has<00:03:56.850> worked<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:57.570> we

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
look it has it has it has worked but we

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.020 
look it has it has it has worked but we
need<00:03:57.959> further<00:03:58.730> investigations<00:03:59.730> so<00:03:59.880> what's

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
need further investigations so what's

need further investigations so what's
the<00:04:00.150> implications<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.930> what<00:04:00.989> we're

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
the implications of what we're

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.920 
the implications of what we're
cataloging<00:04:02.340> here<00:04:02.519> now<00:04:02.670> looking<00:04:03.090> forward<00:04:03.420> to

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
cataloging here now looking forward to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.440 
cataloging here now looking forward to
the<00:04:04.019> climate<00:04:04.350> change<00:04:04.560> summit<00:04:04.620> in<00:04:05.040> Copenhagen

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
the climate change summit in Copenhagen

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.030 
the climate change summit in Copenhagen
well<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.480> think<00:04:06.630> we've<00:04:06.930> talked<00:04:07.290> about<00:04:07.680> energy

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
well I think we've talked about energy

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.150 
well I think we've talked about energy
efficiency<00:04:08.630> we've<00:04:09.630> talked<00:04:09.989> about<00:04:10.230> conserving

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
efficiency we've talked about conserving

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.580 
efficiency we've talked about conserving
the<00:04:11.340> last<00:04:11.610> remaining<00:04:12.150> ecosystems<00:04:13.079> but

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
the last remaining ecosystems but

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.380 
the last remaining ecosystems but
there's<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.799> really<00:04:14.280> big<00:04:14.579> thing<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:15.180> need

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
there's a really big thing that we need

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.509 
there's a really big thing that we need
to<00:04:15.510> do<00:04:15.720> which<00:04:16.079> we<00:04:16.290> need<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.620> look<00:04:16.829> at<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.100> areas

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
to do which we need to look at the areas

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.219 
to do which we need to look at the areas
of<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.729> planet<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.359> have<00:04:18.510> already<00:04:18.720> been

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
of the planet that have already been

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.529 
of the planet that have already been
degraded<00:04:19.739> by<00:04:19.859> human<00:04:20.160> beings<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.669> see<00:04:21.270> whether

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
degraded by human beings and see whether

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.510 
degraded by human beings and see whether
we<00:04:21.810> could<00:04:21.959> restore<00:04:22.169> that<00:04:22.650> because<00:04:23.010> that's<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
we could restore that because that's the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.120 
we could restore that because that's the
biggest<00:04:23.820> upside<00:04:24.390> for<00:04:25.289> carbon<00:04:25.860> sea

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
biggest upside for carbon sea

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.390 
biggest upside for carbon sea
Qwest<00:04:26.310> raishin<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.750> factor<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.650> 1<00:04:29.010> in

the biomass but in the in the soil
organic<00:04:32.310> matter<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.880> have<00:04:33.060> even<00:04:33.450> higher

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
organic matter you have even higher

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.980 
organic matter you have even higher
potential<00:04:34.980> for<00:04:35.220> carbon<00:04:35.430> sequestration<00:04:36.180> so

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
potential for carbon sequestration so

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.110 
potential for carbon sequestration so
you<00:04:37.050> have<00:04:37.320> probably<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.890> factor<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.400> between<00:04:38.760> 4
