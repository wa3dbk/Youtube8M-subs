00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.850
 songs of a song from time to time 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.140
 all a drama because the tweets are not 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.030
 we know well if this last function of 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.100

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.229
 evolution but good there I found out and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:59.860

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:01.830
 trip travel ticket not put the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.760
 but then well we found out I do not know 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.090
 we saw the tickets and I just do not know 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.640
 with first row travel mere row 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.110
 I arrived with expectations of nothing can 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.840
 sanction allows friendship fits me 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.140
 mention that first row 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.260
 in this case 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 is that we can say the clear places 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:47.420

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.880

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.880
 I did not know this I had already gone to see the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.040
 bad life and then this I do not 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.530
 I knew what it was but he says it was very 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.190
 little you know that if it's how it is like 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.190
 as the living room of my house 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:11.959
 then if not the house not but if you do 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.239
 it's a very small thing then when 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.310
 same first row I said any 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.040
 first but not really because we were 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.950
 well from Mauritius apart 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.459
 apart the work is the in a bed in 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.459
 boxer shorts 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.550
 that I would have loved more 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.290
 been a spirit you know liberation online or 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.100
 if it had been of those men who 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.810
 they sleep naked 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.810
 but looking without a shirt 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.330
 it is appreciated it is appreciated that insurance is going 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.710
 to like but I do not know what 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.840
 unbelievable truth really sorry 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.430
 tell 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.910
 all the relationships that a man 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.239
 homosexual may have or have had or 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.400
 I could have it, it's really a 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.620
 incredible script there is a confirmation 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.780
 that is half eye but by the lic 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.000
 but 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.540
 or it is not noticed because this magnificent 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.630
 magnificent but not even that is not 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.040
 as he explained them I felt it as a 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.829
 hour as such because it does not have as a 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.650
 script as well as such thing is a song 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.540
 after another song like cats have been seen 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.040
 in cats there are no scripts song song 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.540
 song song the situation like this is this 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.360
 that's how it is and as Ricardo says 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.770
 it's exactly like all the facets and 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.870
 the kind of relationships that a 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.190
 gay man in the world there are from 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:47.320
 the closet herodes of elaboration of 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:49.780
 costumes the actor's forgiveness 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.380
 the actor so I do not come with actors 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.380
