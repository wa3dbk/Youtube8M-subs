in like the beginning of the level i do
in<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.450> beginning<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.959> levels<00:03:46.350> so

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
in like the beginning of the levels so

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.640 
in like the beginning of the levels so
we<00:03:46.680> don't<00:03:46.860> want<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> go<00:03:47.280> down<00:03:47.489> there<00:03:47.870> so
