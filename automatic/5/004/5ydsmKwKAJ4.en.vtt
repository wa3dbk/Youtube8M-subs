00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
bullet okay so the first thing we want

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.510 
bullet okay so the first thing we want
to<00:00:31.199> do<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.710> let's<00:00:33.260> click<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.800> alien<00:00:35.010> ship

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to do is let's click on the alien ship

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.620 
to do is let's click on the alien ship
up<00:00:36.060> here<00:00:36.570> wants<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> prototype<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.630> okay

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
up here wants the prototype of it okay

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.230 
up here wants the prototype of it okay
and<00:00:40.500> we're<00:00:40.830> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> create<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.340> new<00:00:41.400> rule<00:00:41.850> but

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
and we're going to create a new rule but

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.090 
and we're going to create a new rule but
before<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.690> create<00:00:42.990> this<00:00:43.200> duel<00:00:43.440> let's<00:00:43.860> go

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
before we create this duel let's go

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920 
before we create this duel let's go
ahead<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.280> collapse<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.900> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
ahead and collapse these so we have a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.520 
ahead and collapse these so we have a
little<00:00:46.140> bit<00:00:46.260> more<00:00:46.530> room<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.970> screen<00:00:48.530> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
little bit more room on the screen so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.920 
little bit more room on the screen so
we'll<00:00:49.710> create<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.370> new<00:00:50.580> rule<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:53.090> in<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.540> role

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
we'll create a new rule and in that role

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.400 
we'll create a new rule and in that role
we<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.740> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.310> drag<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.270> condition<00:00:58.080> on

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
we are going to drag in a condition on

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.020 
we are going to drag in a condition on
collision<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.339> basically<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.940> we

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
collision here and basically what we

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.990 
collision here and basically what we
want<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> say<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.570> when<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.860> alien<00:01:08.550> actor

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
want to say is when the alien actor

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.470 
want to say is when the alien actor
overlaps<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:10.080> collides<00:01:10.620> with<00:01:10.860> actor<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.790> title

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
overlaps or collides with actor of title

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.470 
overlaps or collides with actor of title
it's<00:01:13.230> a<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:13.590> arrow<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.400> second<00:01:14.940> down<00:01:15.120> arrow

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
it's a down arrow here second down arrow

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.500 
it's a down arrow here second down arrow
and<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.860> want<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.730> collides<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
and we want when it collides with the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.350 
and we want when it collides with the
bullet<00:01:19.400> what<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.550> want<00:01:20.730> to<00:01:20.820> happen<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.240> it

the actor to disappear this active to
you<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.210> basically<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.860> disappearing<00:01:29.550> act

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
you know basically the disappearing act

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.370 
you know basically the disappearing act
here<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.960> destroy<00:01:32.479> action<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.050> we<00:01:34.260> are

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
here is the destroy action and so we are

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
here is the destroy action and so we are
looking<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.010> destroy<00:01:35.550> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> action

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
looking for the destroy of the action

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.800 
looking for the destroy of the action
section<00:01:37.110> trying<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> under<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> do

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
section trying that in and under the do

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.219 
section trying that in and under the do
it'll<00:01:40.470> destroy<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.729> actors<00:01:42.450> would<00:01:42.600> destroy

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it'll destroy this actors would destroy

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.490 
it'll destroy this actors would destroy
itself<00:01:43.880> okay<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.690> basically<00:01:45.870> we<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> do

this pretty much the same exact thing

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.060 
this pretty much the same exact thing
here<00:01:48.920> for<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.010> bullet<00:01:50.370> so<00:01:50.610> okay<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.870> let's<00:01:52.080> go

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
here for the bullet so okay so let's go

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
here for the bullet so okay so let's go
to<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> bullet<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:55.729> create<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.970> new<00:01:57.720> rule<00:01:57.930> in

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
to the bullet now create a new rule in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.980 
to the bullet now create a new rule in
that<00:02:00.090> will<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.570> will<00:02:00.750> drag<00:02:01.080> in<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:03.049> condition<00:02:04.049> on

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
that will we will drag in a condition on

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.069 
that will we will drag in a condition on
collision<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:09.529> actor<00:02:10.529> when<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.310> bullet

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
collision of actor when the bullet

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.160 
collision of actor when the bullet
collides

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
collides

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.729 
collides
with<00:02:14.819> actor<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:16.000> type<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:18.160> time<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.750> enemy

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
with actor of type this time the enemy

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.070 
with actor of type this time the enemy
our<00:02:21.550> alien<00:02:23.610> what<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:24.790> wanted<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.120> do<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.780> want

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
our alien what we wanted to do we want

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.380 
our alien what we wanted to do we want
it<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:27.360> action<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:29.110> destroy<00:02:29.800> itself<00:02:32.700> okay<00:02:33.700> now

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
it to action to destroy itself okay now

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:47.150 
it to action to destroy itself okay now
let's<00:02:34.420> go<00:02:34.989> ahead<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.170> test<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:38.850> so

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.970 

there<00:02:48.160> we<00:02:48.340> go<00:02:48.520> so<00:02:49.390> both<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.870> bullet<00:02:50.170> let's<00:02:50.680> do

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
there we go so both the bullet let's do

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.750 
there we go so both the bullet let's do
that<00:02:51.130> again<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.730> can<00:02:51.790> see<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:56.460> keep<00:02:57.460> an<00:02:57.640> eye

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that again so you can see it keep an eye

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.210 
that again so you can see it keep an eye
on<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.060> bullet<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.290> alien<00:03:00.510> there<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:01.720> go

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
on that bullet and the alien there we go

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.200 
on that bullet and the alien there we go
both<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.520> bullet<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.030> alien<00:03:04.690> disappear

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
both the bullet and the alien disappear

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.090 
both the bullet and the alien disappear
so<00:03:07.210> that's<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.600> end<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.080> video<00:03:08.290> we<00:03:09.070> will

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
so that's the end of this video we will

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.450 
so that's the end of this video we will
see<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.090> next<00:03:10.240> one
