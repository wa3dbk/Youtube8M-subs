00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
see there's the low overhead right there

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.260 
see there's the low overhead right there
that<00:01:53.010> leads<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.400> corner<00:01:53.700> tangle<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:57.090> best

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that leads to the corner tangle the best

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.790
