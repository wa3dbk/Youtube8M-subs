 classic tracks in sochi very high 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.540

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.769
 fatherland grand prix will go fine here 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.140
 They say what Russian does not like 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.500

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.210
 Russian pilots formula 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.479
 in the form of the first places, or not so 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.660
 a lot of only 22 and this is a multi 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.479
 national sport and i would i think not 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.289

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.310
 when they happen this too 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.560
