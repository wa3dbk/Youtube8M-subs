00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.500
 March is not all luque again 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.800
 making a video of reviewed today she is 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.929
 making a different movie saying that 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.680
 of the application for android 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:21.449
 bertoucci piano I found it very valid 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.000
 update that they did to 5,810 in 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:30.260
 does not reach 96 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.020
 I particularly liked it here. 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.010
 good to talk first the perfect piano 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.690
 started there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:45.539
 The application for you is a year one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:49.440
 keyboard with one hand and everything 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.690
 computer by simulating a keypad in the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.690
 Android started with a 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.150
 the piano even after they inserted there 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:07.500
 new instruments and everything is a 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:11.420
 synthesizer case 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.950
 it is also in this update that 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 I had option for you're here is the album 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.020
 that the most acute 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.260
 making a base make a melody here 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.250
 and in this update sorry program 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.970
 fantasy 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.970
 they put here for 2 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.480
 players the other problem 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.800
 note the program you the girlfriend then 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.680
 that's it 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:52.750
 after the year they had increased there 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.640
 placing a pad is to remember one 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.370
 Little Sam, right? 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 the dynamics of the sampa and could also change 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.850
 an instrument 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:11.310
 hopefully hopefully hopefully not it was it was very 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.310
 this is good but 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.720
 the coolest thing I thought neutralization 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.080
 by the play agent, too. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.710
 it was joÃ£o xii who inspired the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.920
 making this video is a good thing 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:36.340
 Valid if dealing with android you go 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:42.650
 build a small drumbeat 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:52.480
 your android and he will touch it will 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.480
 playing this one glass plays the sound made 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.250
 This rhythm you created it is 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.800
 playing 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.620
 remembering that if you call and in the background 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.630
 earpiece is the one you put on 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.569
 those boxes that here we 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:13.330
 flame funky cxinde with a quality 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:18.150
 legal are severe acceptable 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:24.340
 so you what which would be the advantage 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 And you and the guitar are playing 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.870
 alone you want to set a rhythm one 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.830
 tutor you create a metal riff by 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.330
 example is at grandma's house and he wants 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.320
 play alone 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:45.370
 This is a rhythm mark you can use with 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:50.860
 the metronome too and that's it you can 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.400
 be calling on the phone I said 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:59.530
 to make the most of it and with this 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:05.290
 dynamics will be good 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.910
 capturing at dn the capacitor then 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.500
 I do not think it will get so bad 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:15.780
 the biggest disadvantage at the moment would be that 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:23.890
 does not have an attack plate in which only one 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:26.470
 raid put it that the head do not have 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.470
 a plate of attack at the moment 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.080
 I found it very interesting 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:39.669
 is talking about this video would be and is here 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:44.969
 oh it would be the kind a mixer is to come back with 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:48.599
 Come back and come and play Pedro. 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:55.319
 come back here to put the ring and open 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:05:01.549
 pit bull and pay attention to the 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:06.179
 butt 16 will note let's do it again 

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:10.459
 worth it so it's a kay and you can 

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:17.360
 ta cryan is no longer to change the equalization 

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:17.360
 a quick way of each piece of seven 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.180
 let the world's most serious 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.080
 it will not stay that thing took note 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:35.060
 Is not this interesting? 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.310
 if you are i league in the box will 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.930
 give a change a sound if she stays 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.460
 very sharp is the equalizer that 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:51.740
 more is better not the tone with 253 13 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:57.850
 has the symbol the box the bass drum has and has 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.850
 An attack deal but it started now. 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.700
 better then have people increase the 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.690
 speed here bpm such as to decrease 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:14.590
 it's also people you change too 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.590
 putting on tv roc percussion ipp hop 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:31.990
 and also has members in here some 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:34.449
 luchin the moon 1111 cool here 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.830
 interesting very interesting if 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.449
 they are dealing with android 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.449
 I found it quite valid 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:52.080
 or so it's there 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:57.240
 This is the video talking about this team. 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:00.110
 year the new update and for this date 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.110
 I hope you enjoyed
