okay<00:00:07.639> so<00:00:08.639> I'm<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.090> be<00:00:09.240> demonstrating

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
okay so I'm going to be demonstrating

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.330 
okay so I'm going to be demonstrating
using<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.190> USB<00:00:11.460> game<00:00:12.210> controller<00:00:12.750> as<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:14.009> MIDI

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
using a USB game controller as a MIDI

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.279 
using a USB game controller as a MIDI
device<00:00:16.279> I've<00:00:17.279> used<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.789> freeware<00:00:18.270> program<00:00:19.050> for

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
device I've used a freeware program for

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.670 
device I've used a freeware program for

injunction<00:00:25.680> allows<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.340> take<00:00:26.550> any<00:00:26.789> USB

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
injunction allows you to take any USB

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.820 
injunction allows you to take any USB
device<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:29.029> map<00:00:30.029> its<00:00:30.269> buttons<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> inputs<00:00:31.439> as

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
device and map its buttons and inputs as

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.799 
device and map its buttons and inputs as
many<00:00:32.550> inputs<00:00:34.520> this<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:35.940> be<00:00:36.000> ported<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
many inputs this can then be ported to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.910 
many inputs this can then be ported to
Ableton<00:00:37.469> Live<00:00:38.480> as<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:40.050> MIDI<00:00:40.500> controller<00:00:42.920> so

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
Ableton Live as a MIDI controller so

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.000 
Ableton Live as a MIDI controller so
I've<00:00:44.100> taken<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.640> game<00:00:44.910> controller<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.680> maps

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I've taken this game controller and maps

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.029 
I've taken this game controller and maps
it<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> beat<00:00:47.730> repeat<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> first<00:00:49.710> thing

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
it to the beat repeat the first thing

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
it to the beat repeat the first thing
that<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.280> mapped<00:00:51.620> was<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.980> would<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.989> r-1

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that I mapped was what would be the r-1

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.340 
that I mapped was what would be the r-1
button<00:00:55.129> on<00:00:56.129> lots<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> game<00:00:56.789> controllers<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.780> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
button on lots of game controllers and I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.799 
button on lots of game controllers and I
mapped<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.969> sort<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> trigger<00:01:00.570> because

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
mapped that sort of as a trigger because

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.570 
mapped that sort of as a trigger because
it<00:01:00.989> felt<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> trigger<00:01:01.649> finger<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:08.310> next

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it felt like the trigger finger the next

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
it felt like the trigger finger the next
thing<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.790> mapped<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.200> joystick<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
thing I mapped was the right joystick to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
thing I mapped was the right joystick to
the<00:01:11.670> grid<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> grid<00:01:15.090> effects<00:01:15.630> how<00:01:16.409> big<00:01:16.710> or

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the grid so the grid effects how big or

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.850 
the grid so the grid effects how big or
small<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> piece<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.360> repeating<00:01:18.990> for

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
small of a piece is repeating for

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.100 
small of a piece is repeating for
example<00:01:20.960> 1/16

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
example 1/16

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.420 
example 1/16
down<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.920> one<00:01:24.480> 256th<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.880> way<00:01:28.030> up<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.600> a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
down to one 256th all the way up to a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.430 
down to one 256th all the way up to a
full<00:01:30.430> bar<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.460> other<00:01:36.520> thing<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.000> met<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:38.290> the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
full bar the other thing I met was the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.040 
full bar the other thing I met was the
left<00:01:38.620> joystick<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.030> filter<00:01:40.510> falling<00:01:40.990> to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
left joystick to the filter falling to

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.570 
left joystick to the filter falling to
be<00:01:41.170> repeat<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.940> x-axis<00:01:44.160> being<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.400> frequency

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
be repeat the x-axis being the frequency

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.900 
be repeat the x-axis being the frequency
and<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.540> y-axis<00:01:47.610> being<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.850> resonance<00:01:50.910> so

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
and the y-axis being the resonance so

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.150 
and the y-axis being the resonance so
now<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.150> we've<00:01:52.390> got<00:01:52.570> all<00:01:52.600> this<00:01:52.900> together<00:01:53.160> we

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
now that we've got all this together we

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:26.699 
now that we've got all this together we
have<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.340> little<00:01:54.550> fun

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.340 

and<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:28.010> on
