00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.250 
core out we want to remove that bitter
white<00:01:40.100> part<00:01:40.400> there<00:01:40.610> that's<00:01:40.850> it's<00:01:41.840> bitter<00:01:42.110> if

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
white part there that's it's bitter if

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.630 
white part there that's it's bitter if
you<00:01:42.380> eat<00:01:42.440> it<00:01:42.590> now<00:01:43.010> we're<00:01:43.160> going<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.340> cut<00:01:43.550> it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
you eat it now we're going to cut it

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.790 
you eat it now we're going to cut it
into<00:01:43.760> about<00:01:44.000> half-inch<00:01:44.660> wide<00:01:44.930> slices<00:01:45.350> and

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
into about half-inch wide slices and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.520 
into about half-inch wide slices and
it's<00:01:46.550> much<00:01:46.730> easier<00:01:46.760> to<00:01:47.210> cut<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> pepper<00:01:47.660> on<00:01:47.930> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's much easier to cut a pepper on the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.830 
it's much easier to cut a pepper on the
inside<00:01:49.420> rather<00:01:50.420> than<00:01:50.570> on<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.810> outside

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
inside rather than on the outside

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.080 
inside rather than on the outside
because<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.500> outside<00:01:52.010> shell<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.760> pretty

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
because that outside shell is pretty

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.740 
because that outside shell is pretty
hard<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.330> cut<00:01:53.540> through<00:01:53.860> we<00:01:54.860> take<00:01:55.040> those<00:01:55.750> slices

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
hard to cut through we take those slices

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.860 
hard to cut through we take those slices
we<00:01:57.200> turn<00:01:57.410> them<00:01:57.530> around<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.510> we<00:01:59.510> just<00:01:59.540> simply

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
we turn them around and we just simply

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.570 
we turn them around and we just simply
dice<00:02:00.830> them<00:02:01.070> up<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.270> quarter<00:02:02.570> inch<00:02:02.720> dice<00:02:02.960> and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
dice them up in a quarter inch dice and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:14.240 
dice them up in a quarter inch dice and
that's<00:02:04.580> how<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.850> dice<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.210> pepper

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.310
