00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:08.380
 hello today we will see how 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.750
 germinating seeds aranda this good 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.540
 we this seedbed already have it 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.420
 for about two months and 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.640
 half this one if it takes a bit since the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.280
 cranberry is not a germinating seed 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.130
 easily this if you take your time there 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.320
 that have patience mega despair 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.699
 good though this is how can 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.100
 see this is a tupper sandwich 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.079
 this one that continues inside 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.000
 this does not have this 4 napkins 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.120
 12 in the background the nuns put the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.370
 seeds and put two more on this 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.829
 Thread me you open it from time to time what 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.620
 you can put in a place where you from the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.149
 sun certain time of certain certain part 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.480
 of the day so that it reaches a temperature 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.600
 of which is this charity so that 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.260
 germinate this as I told you already 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.490
 I had this one as you can see 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.180
 this seed already has a giggle if it 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.860
 reaches to distinguish 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.520
 it's this little militia that you see there 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.730
 here he is just taking out the seed 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.530
 I say the good the revisita the giggle and 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.430
 here comes another one that is hardly in the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.700
 is pulling up a total of 13 out of 6 that 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.200
 we have put is a good number but there 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.010
 to remember that as it is a difficult 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.680
 cultivation will not always reach all 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.100
 adulthood we must remember that it is a 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.979
 bush that is children or then you have to 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.690
 take care of them well this later this was 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.740
 everything for today after we will see more 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.240
 go ahead how is this this memory 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.270
 always keep the paper moist 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.090
 they can leave it in a dark place 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.649
 where where I talk about light in this case 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.860
 as the stage is transparent because I 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.810
 I had to put on a xbox is that radiated 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.220
 very hot I feel but it is not 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.540
 transparent can be put 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.890
 perfectly in the sun 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.600
 obviously taking care of the levels of 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.750
 temperature and humidity you have for 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.489
 that do not cost the seeds of this 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.580
 well this has been all thanks for your 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.580
 Attention
