is I have said it before but I'll just

is I have said it before but I'll just
say<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:01.970> again<00:03:02.300> in<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.540> video<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:02.989> sorry

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
from being we've done it my hair is

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.720 
from being we've done it my hair is
straight<00:03:04.900> yet<00:03:05.900> King<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.620> think<00:03:07.070> interlocking

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
straight yet King I think interlocking

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.760 
straight yet King I think interlocking
is<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:07.850> better<00:03:08.180> method<00:03:08.450> if<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.140> don't<00:03:09.560> have

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
is a better method if you don't have

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.390 
is a better method if you don't have
oily<00:03:10.370> hair<00:03:10.720> because<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:12.260> allows<00:03:12.830> your<00:03:13.070> hair<00:03:13.340> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
oily hair because it allows your hair to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.370 
oily hair because it allows your hair to
stay<00:03:13.820> together<00:03:13.970> long<00:03:14.450> enough<00:03:14.480> in<00:03:14.930> order<00:03:15.110> to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
stay together long enough in order to

if I palm rolled my hair it would take

out of the coil and you know you really

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.569 
inter locking your locks and I did that

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:33.830 
inter locking your locks and I did that
around<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.979> four<00:04:32.370> or<00:04:32.729> five<00:04:32.759> month<00:04:33.419> mark

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.610 
around the the four or five month mark
once<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.860> already<00:04:35.069> have<00:04:35.460> your<00:04:35.639> hair<00:04:35.940> coils

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
strand twisted and you find that it's

strand twisted and you find that it's
not<00:04:41.280> stained<00:04:41.639> like<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.419> therefore<00:04:43.289> it's

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
not stained like that and therefore it's

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.779 
not stained like that and therefore it's
not<00:04:43.620> locking<00:04:43.889> because<00:04:44.099> if<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:44.370> doesn't<00:04:44.520> stay

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
not locking because if it doesn't stay

not locking because if it doesn't stay
it<00:04:45.030> won't<00:04:45.150> lock<00:04:45.389> once<00:04:45.840> you're<00:04:45.990> already<00:04:46.139> in

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
it won't lock once you're already in

it won't lock once you're already in
that<00:04:46.530> situation<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.490> think<00:04:47.849> the<00:04:48.120> best<00:04:48.150> thing<00:04:48.509> to

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
that situation I think the best thing to

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.689 
that situation I think the best thing to
do<00:04:48.780> is<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.229> start<00:04:49.560> interlocking<00:04:50.370> your<00:04:50.550> new

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
do is to start interlocking your new

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.300 
do is to start interlocking your new
growth<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:52.050> best<00:04:52.259> way<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.440> do<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.889> is<00:04:53.099> to

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
growth and the best way to do that is to

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.999 
growth and the best way to do that is to
put<00:04:53.789> your<00:04:54.000> finger<00:04:54.300> all<00:04:54.569> into<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.560> root<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:55.919> the

put your finger all into the root of the
hair<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.520> go<00:04:56.909> all<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.360> way<00:04:57.389> down<00:04:57.780> until<00:04:58.110> you

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
probably have a problem and I find that

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.040 
probably have a problem and I find that
highly<00:05:29.460> unlikely<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:30.240> think<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.810> lot<00:05:31.020> of

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
highly unlikely I think that a lot of

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.689 
highly unlikely I think that a lot of
times<00:05:31.380> when<00:05:31.620> locks<00:05:31.800> issues<00:05:32.099> tell<00:05:32.340> you<00:05:32.460> things

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
times when locks issues tell you things

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.610 
times when locks issues tell you things
like<00:05:32.880> oh<00:05:33.180> you'll<00:05:33.449> get<00:05:33.630> gaps<00:05:33.930> in<00:05:34.139> your<00:05:34.169> locks<00:05:34.440> if

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
like oh you'll get gaps in your locks if

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.390 
like oh you'll get gaps in your locks if
you<00:05:34.710> switch<00:05:34.919> to<00:05:34.949> interlocking<00:05:35.729> or<00:05:37.159> your<00:05:38.159> locks

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
you switch to interlocking or your locks

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.520 
you switch to interlocking or your locks
will<00:05:38.669> break<00:05:39.000> or<00:05:39.360> they'll<00:05:39.570> fall<00:05:39.870> off<00:05:39.900> or

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
will break or they'll fall off or

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.480 
will break or they'll fall off or
whatever<00:05:40.770> it's<00:05:40.979> just<00:05:41.009> because<00:05:41.250> they<00:05:41.340> don't

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
whatever it's just because they don't

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.969 
whatever it's just because they don't
know<00:05:41.580> how<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.759> do<00:05:41.969> it<00:05:42.169> your<00:05:43.169> locks<00:05:43.469> do<00:05:43.680> need<00:05:43.830> not

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
know how to do it your locks do need not

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.850 
know how to do it your locks do need not
be<00:05:44.130> locking<00:05:44.340> because<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:46.229> may<00:05:46.380> be<00:05:46.409> using<00:05:46.710> the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
be locking because you may be using the

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.450 
be locking because you may be using the
wrong<00:05:46.949> method<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:48.419> lock<00:05:48.599> your<00:05:48.780> hair<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:49.460> the

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
wrong method to lock your hair and the

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.360 
wrong method to lock your hair and the
method<00:05:50.789> that<00:05:50.820> you<00:05:51.090> use<00:05:52.190> depends<00:05:53.190> on<00:05:53.219> the

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
method that you use depends on the

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.760 
method that you use depends on the
texture<00:05:53.849> of<00:05:54.120> your<00:05:54.150> hair<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:55.020> if<00:05:55.409> you<00:05:55.560> have

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
texture of your hair and if you have

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.510 
texture of your hair and if you have
kinky<00:05:56.190> yet<00:05:56.909> straight<00:05:57.270> hair<00:05:57.599> or<00:05:58.069> coyly<00:05:59.069> yet

kinky yet straight hair or coyly yet
soft<00:05:59.880> hair<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.449> not<00:06:00.780> kinky<00:06:01.740> and<00:06:01.919> coily<00:06:02.699> hair

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
soft hair and not kinky and coily hair

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.040 
soft hair and not kinky and coily hair
it<00:06:03.419> may<00:06:04.199> be<00:06:04.259> better<00:06:04.800> for<00:06:04.919> you<00:06:05.250> to<00:06:05.400> try

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
it may be better for you to try

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.850 
it may be better for you to try
interlocking<00:06:07.080> or<00:06:08.690> braid<00:06:09.690> locking<00:06:10.229> or

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
interlocking or braid locking or

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.749 
interlocking or braid locking or
something<00:06:11.219> like<00:06:11.310> that

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
something like that

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.730 
something like that
so<00:06:12.300> there's<00:06:12.750> different<00:06:13.080> methods<00:06:13.560> you<00:06:13.620> can

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
so there's different methods you can

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.559 
so there's different methods you can
braid<00:06:14.009> the<00:06:14.159> new<00:06:14.280> growth<00:06:14.639> interlock<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.449> new

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569
