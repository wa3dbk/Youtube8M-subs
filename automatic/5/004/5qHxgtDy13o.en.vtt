00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.079
 we start with the excuses 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.079
 and you're telling yourself what excuses 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.800
 you know what the excuses are the most common cows the excuses are a 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.649
 comfortable way to bypass our responsibilities and justify our 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.640
 mediocrity 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.900
 finding guilty for everything that was always under our control 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 the excuses are a way of saying 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.330
 I did not do it but it was not my fault 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.010
 I have not been able to succeed in my business but it is the president's fault that all year 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.180
 the economy 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.270
 failed the exam but the fault was the teacher who did not give us enough time 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 for study 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.060
 I have not advanced in my work but it is my boss's fault that they do not appreciate and 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.190
 talent 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.550
 failed and marriage but it was my wife's fault that she did not make an effort to 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.800
 understand 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.420
 and they have all these excuses in common 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.110
 all serve a single purpose to free ourselves from all responsibility and 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.270
 place them in the role of victim 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.530
 It is not my fault 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.650
 I wanted 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.010
 I had the best intentions that I was not willing 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.370
 but the fault lies with my wife or husband or the boss or in a group of the young government and 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.759
 partner in 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.310
 mine or god of Piscean 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.520
 today the biggest culprit of all 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.450
 destiny 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.100
 and the worst of all is that while we think that the fault lies with someone else 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.490
 we will do absolutely nothing to remedy this situation 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.170
 after all it is not our fault 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.820
 there are only three truths about excuses the first is that if 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.470
 he really wants is to find an apology to justify anything 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 I assure you that the sore without major difficulty 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.040
 the second thing which you can be sure once you start that use any 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.570
 excuse is that you will find allies 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.690
 yes no matter how incredible yap south doha your excuse may sound 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.980
 find people who create it and share it so much that you'll hear them 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.689
 say I know how you feel because the same thing happens to me 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.370
 finally the third truth about the eavesdropping 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.190
 is that one of the actresses 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.349
 you will notice immediately that nothing will have changed 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.099
 the problem we are avoiding to face through the excuse will continue 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.059
 same 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.939
 do not open advanced towards its solution but on the contrary to works 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.939
 retreated 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.829
 every time you use that excuse you take it a step closer to becoming 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.329
 in your reality 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.140
 for example 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.839
 every time you say I do not have time 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:52.249
 to justify not doing what you know you should do 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:55.619
 but it's a little more control over your time and your life 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:03:00.209
 and soon you begin to notice that you are living a reactive life of urgency 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.359
 in the emergency room 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.489
 no time to do what is really important to you with 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.409
 every use of your excuse 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.030
 with every time you say I do not have time this excuse wants a greater validity 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.169
 until it ends up becoming true 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.499
 because the truth is that we all have all the time we need, not even a 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.339
 minute plus one minute less 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:26.489
 both the winner and the unsuccessful have 24 hours in their day the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.799
 only difference between them is the way they choose to invest their time 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:36.049
 undoubtedly eavesdropping is a simple way to weaken dealing with the 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.010
 worst enemy of success 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.199
 mediocrity 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.199
 forget the excuses 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.669
 your friends do not need it 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.329
 and your enemies will not believe them anyway, so start with 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.040
 remove it
