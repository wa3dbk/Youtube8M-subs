Hi it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.839
Today, we are going to show you how to change
the Drive Belt on your front load washer,

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:06.390
and it’s a pretty easy job.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.150
All we’re going to need is a Phillips screwdriver
and maybe a pair of needle nose pliers.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.390
Let me show you how it is done.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.210
On the first step in this repair it should
be to disconnect the power to the appliance,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.570
if your dryer has a cord on it simply remove
it from the receptacle, if it’s hard-wired

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.660
find the breaker and turn it off.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.159
Now the next step in this repair will be to
remove the main tops so that we have access

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:36.200
to the screws holding the front panel on,
and now there are two screws that hold the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:50.780
top in place and locate it here and here,
so we are simply going to remove those, the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.350
two screws removed we will lift up on the
front of the top panel, kind of tilt it so

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:11.409
that it disengages on the control panel and
we can set that aside, and there are two screws

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:20.860
that hold the front panel in place and are
located in each top corner, so remove those,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:30.340
hold the front panel in place, as you remove
the last screw, and we will tilt the front

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:39.950
panel forward, the drum will drop off of the
drum glide, and in the lower left corner there

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.959
will be some wires that connect to the door
switch, so we need to remove several of those

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.950
before we can remove the front panel.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.100
Take note of the color codes of the wires
and where they are located, and you may need

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:03.759
a pair of needle nose pliers to remove the
terminals.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.990
Once we remove those wires we can lift the
front panel off of the base, and we can set

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.140
that aside.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.150
Now with the front panel removed we have access
to change the belt and the belt is loaded

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.709
around the drum over top of the Idler, back
around the motor pulley and back up around

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.709
the drum.

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.200
Now the only access we have is through here
and through here, now you will be able to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.599
feel the Idler, so what we are going to do
is pull the Idler towards the center of the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.579
drum to release the tension on it, and then
we can roll the belt off of it, and there

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:48.250
are some sharp edges here so it’s probably
a good idea to put some sports gloves on just

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:59.579
to protect yourself.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:16.810
Now with the belt off of the Idler you will
be able to maneuver that towards the front

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:35.000
of the drum, and simply slide it off of the
front of the drum, and we will take our new

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.830
belt and there is a flat side to that belt
and a groove side, and the groove side is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.510
going to lay up against the drum, it’s also
going to go around the motor pulley as well

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.310
the flat side of the belt will lay on the
Idler pulley.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.980
So first we will just to make sure we get
the belt all the way around the drum, keeping

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:13.590
the groove side towards the drum, so that
we don’t get any twists 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:25.090
in it, now with a little tension on it, just
move it back to its position, now again we

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.330
are going to reach in on both sides, and we
will rotate that belt around the motor pulley,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.660
and we are going to pull the Idler pulley
again towards the center of the dryer, and

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:53.500
roll the belt onto the Idler pulley.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:16.520
Just with your hands feel to make sure that
that belt is on the motor, and you can see

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.200
the blower wheel turning, so that indicates
that it is set in the pulley, make sure it

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:39.580
is centered in the pulley, very slowly turn
the drum till we get the belt lined up with

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.530
the drum again, make sure that there are no
twists in it.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:56.080
Now with a couple of four revolutions taking
note of where the belt is positioned on the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:05.120
drum, and it should center itself into that
rear groove.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:16.949
There, now we are ready to reinstall the front
panel, we will locate the square holes in

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:23.181
the bottom of the front panel with the tabs
that protrude from the base frame and line

00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:35.430
that up, next we will reconnect the wire to
the door switch, make sure all the electrical

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.889
connections are secure, and we will tilt the
front panel into place, and we will have to

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:47.950
lift up on the drum a bit to set it on top
of the bearing, and there is a couple of tabs

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:54.990
on top of the front panel that line up with
a slot in the cabinet, hold the front panel

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:13.190
in place, we will reinstall the two screws,
now we are ready to put the main top in place,

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:24.199
and then we will locate those three slots
with the three tabs on the control panel.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:45.699
Make sure the 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:51.650
control panel is firmly engaged with the top,
and now we can reinstall the two long screws

00:07:51.650 --> 00:08:01.610
up through the front panel into the main top.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:13.289
Make sure they are nice and tight 
and our repair is complete.

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:17.949
I told you it was an easy job, thanks for
watching and good luck with your repair.
