 basic techniques such as fattening of heads and 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.460
 aware what clients and power chord are 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.940
 all this is easy to search on my 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.340
 canal music schools are taught that there is 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.059
 so-called gamma or frets 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.000
 seven notes or sometimes five or six notes 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.640
 of which people put melodies 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.390
 the most popular way is major 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.250
 and minor 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.460
 let's listen to major 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.460
 from 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.400
 now with the game the simplest melody 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.400
 using notes only from major key 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.130
 kindergarten is shorter but what about us 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.130
 can not a knife 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.630
 and now melodies in minor 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.659
 sad cache sad but not metal but 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.520
 now let's hear the real one 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.520
 metallic vicious risky varnish 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.360
 on 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.229
 but 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.440
 now divine lark melody 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.770
 not bad not bad but what if now 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.510
 do you play entu from each note in varnish 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.430
 risk getting along for convenience now i'm 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.300
 I will name the frets on which I live these 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.880
 the quinte 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.300
 tonic but torrent 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.300
 one 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.410
 run 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 6 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.150
 ten 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.150
 and 12. 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.900
 drove the song lac risk 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.630
 she is 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.150
 but 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.129
 but 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.360
 but 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.290
 now i will compose my own 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.840
 a short little song in Latvian 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.740
 using both power clients chords so 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.740
 single notes 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.710
 and this is my song that just came up 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.850
 as well as the future you have invented 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.300
 song in the Latvian fret easy 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.190
 she transposes other guitar systems 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.560
 i will just borrow the same ones 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.560
 fret numbers on another guitar 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.039
 but 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.820
 finally nishtyak hard for boys 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:34.200
 so itâ€™s important to remember the distance 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.350
 in terms of tonics 1 3 5 lats and so on 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.690
 for successful songwriting 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.330
 in almost any guitar system 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.010
 it is important to understand where this is our tonic 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:49.830
 is where the beginning of the scale is where the beginning 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.900
 melody and root and so to say but what 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.820
 if this very tonic is notorious 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.180
 move and play and not at zero 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.100
 fret 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.100
 and on the second it will turn out like this 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.100
 by and large opportunities 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.300
 limitless and strict rules and 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.420
 there are no restrictions in music 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.730
 experiment 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.460
