top my head but I think the nines were
$27.99<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.299> 250<00:01:37.140> plus<00:01:37.380> tax<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.009> believe<00:01:38.700> these

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
$27.99 for 250 plus tax I believe these

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.200 
$27.99 for 250 plus tax I believe these
were<00:01:38.909> 34<00:01:39.659> 95<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> 40<00:01:40.890> Cal<00:01:41.070> plus<00:01:41.729> tax<00:01:42.030> but

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
were 34 95 for the 40 Cal plus tax but

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
were 34 95 for the 40 Cal plus tax but
they<00:01:42.299> had<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> whole<00:01:42.720> shelf<00:01:42.960> full<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.259> them

they had a whole shelf full of them

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.510 
they had a whole shelf full of them

there<00:03:40.120> roughly<00:03:41.120> that's<00:03:41.449> probably<00:03:41.750> all

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
there roughly that's probably all

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.420

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
pounds of this and actually I thought

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.690 
pounds of this and actually I thought
I'd<00:04:38.570> get<00:04:38.660> pretty<00:04:38.900> good<00:04:38.960> on<00:04:39.260> it

$79.99 for four pounds of long shot and
you<00:04:44.480> know<00:04:44.570> not<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:44.780> for<00:04:45.020> shotguns<00:04:45.800> obviously

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
you know not just for shotguns obviously

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.560 
you know not just for shotguns obviously
you<00:04:46.550> guys<00:04:46.670> know<00:04:46.730> probably<00:04:47.240> know<00:04:47.300> more<00:04:47.480> about

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
have my data book with me at this moment

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.150 
have my data book with me at this moment
but<00:04:58.610> uh<00:04:58.670> and<00:04:59.150> then<00:04:59.750> here's<00:05:00.020> some<00:05:00.080> these<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.010> got
