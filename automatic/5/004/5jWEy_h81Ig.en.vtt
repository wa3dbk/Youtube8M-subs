what's also cool is that you can now do

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the SMGs that you can do wilt on the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.109 
the SMGs that you can do wilt on the
positive<00:01:07.080> side<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.979> carry<00:01:08.280> more<00:01:08.520> bullets<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
positive side you carry more bullets and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
positive side you carry more bullets and
it's<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.900> halo<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> alternate<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
it's like halo so you alternate the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.690 
it's like halo so you alternate the
triggers<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.790> left<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.619> on<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.280> negative

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
triggers like left right on the negative

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.179 
triggers like left right on the negative
side<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.570> can't<00:01:15.900> aim<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> sights<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
side you can't aim down the sights to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.630 
side you can't aim down the sights to
these<00:01:17.340> weapons<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.590> it's<00:01:19.590> more<00:01:20.430> difficult

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
these weapons and it's more difficult

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.080 
these weapons and it's more difficult
aiming<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.990> unless<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.220> really<00:01:23.640> good

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
aiming so unless you're really good

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
aiming so unless you're really good
you're<00:01:24.900> probably<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.619> picked<00:01:25.860> off

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100

so<00:02:11.250> let's<00:02:11.700> say<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> fifth

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
so let's say you go on a fifth

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.070 
so let's say you go on a fifth
the<00:02:13.340> killing<00:02:13.760> rampage<00:02:14.330> which<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.810> probably

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the killing rampage which is probably

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.660 
the killing rampage which is probably
not<00:02:15.350> going<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.710> happen<00:02:15.890> because<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.490> game

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
not going to happen because this game

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.730 
not going to happen because this game
was<00:02:16.880> crazy<00:02:17.120> difficult<00:02:17.720> but<00:02:18.290> let's<00:02:18.470> say<00:02:18.620> it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
was crazy difficult but let's say it

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.430 
was crazy difficult but let's say it
happened<00:02:19.480> yeah<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.540> would<00:02:20.750> basically<00:02:20.930> you

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
happened yeah you would basically you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.230 
happened yeah you would basically you
could<00:02:21.590> save<00:02:21.890> all<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.250> your<00:02:22.460> kill<00:02:22.730> streaks<00:02:23.030> and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
could save all of your kill streaks and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.510 
could save all of your kill streaks and
use<00:02:23.690> them<00:02:23.930> one<00:02:24.170> after<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.470> other<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:25.280> one

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
use them one after the other so one

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.370 
use them one after the other so one
second<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> could<00:02:26.210> use<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.780> know<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.930> UAV

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
second you could use you know a UAV

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.040 
second you could use you know a UAV
radar<00:02:28.010> then<00:02:28.670> hit<00:02:28.940> somebody<00:02:29.360> with<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.600> predator

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
radar then hit somebody with a predator

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.930 
radar then hit somebody with a predator
missile<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.400> know<00:02:31.520> hit<00:02:31.700> them<00:02:31.880> again

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
missile and then you know hit them again

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.060 
missile and then you know hit them again
with<00:02:32.209> an<00:02:32.360> airstrike<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:33.560> keep<00:02:33.740> going

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
with an airstrike and just keep going

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.100 
with an airstrike and just keep going
and<00:02:34.100> going<00:02:34.220> until<00:02:34.520> you're<00:02:34.820> done<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.959> don't

played<00:03:41.540> on<00:03:42.079> three<00:03:42.410> new<00:03:42.560> maps<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:44.090> first<00:03:44.360> map

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
played on three new maps the first map

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.080 
played on three new maps the first map
was<00:03:44.870> called<00:03:45.110> high-rise<00:03:45.590> high-rise<00:03:46.579> took

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
was called high-rise high-rise took

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.390 
was called high-rise high-rise took
place<00:03:47.420> on<00:03:47.720> top<00:03:47.930> of<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.170> building<00:03:48.380> both<00:03:49.040> teams

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
place on top of the building both teams

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.300 
place on top of the building both teams
start<00:03:49.850> out<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.290> two<00:03:51.290> different<00:03:51.500> offices<00:03:52.070> and

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
start out in two different offices and

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.520 
start out in two different offices and
converge<00:03:53.060> in<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.480> center<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.019> map<00:03:54.200> on<00:03:54.380> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
converge in the center of the map on the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.680 
converge in the center of the map on the
roof<00:03:54.739> what's<00:03:55.430> cool<00:03:55.730> about<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:56.180> map<00:03:56.480> is

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
roof what's cool about this map is

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.870 
roof what's cool about this map is
there's<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.739> lot<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.920> construction<00:03:58.430> taking

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
there's a lot of construction taking

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.690 
there's a lot of construction taking
place<00:03:59.030> so<00:03:59.900> if<00:04:00.019> you<00:04:00.140> want<00:04:00.350> to<00:04:00.440> snipe<00:04:00.769> you<00:04:01.370> can<00:04:01.549> go

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
longer to put the shield away then it

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.360 
longer to put the shield away then it
would<00:05:37.839> a<00:05:37.870> machine<00:05:38.379> gun<00:05:38.560> so<00:05:39.039> you<00:05:39.099> leave

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
would a machine gun so you leave
