00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello everyone today, January 28, 2015 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.469
 I want to introduce you to the sun today 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.750
 track because 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.029
 my tracker is long 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.500
 tell me how this scheme came to me 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.880
 I'll just say that I watched the video 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 on youtube and decided to repeat 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.800
 users gave the scheme gave the printed 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.300
 fee is generally a full explanation on 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.280
 connection for short around here well 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.940
 this scheme seemed to me so much 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.940
 just simple that just think and we 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.530
 so try to repeat this 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.309
 Iâ€™ll show you now that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:59.300
 It turned out that the scheme itself see what 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.350
 not a screenshot turned out beautiful here 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.120
 the only one not standing this one 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.400
 capacitor 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.729
 I did not apply the scheme, I thought that he did not 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:15.780
 need so here is the scheme itself 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.450
 signet I painted signet myself 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.950
 drew nakosyachil of course a little 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.509
 mirror image in the end had to 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.729
 You see how to place on the scheme 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:35.280
 now everything is fixed at the moment 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.979
 signet finalized all assembled 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.300
 added a diode bridge this in order to 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.509
 from polarity reversal 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.960
 I have already managed to ignite on this board 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.929
 one track before confused plus minus 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:54.720
 Well, there is power or ass this chip 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:57.630
 rap shock so this is our executive 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.090
 the device on the relay that is so here 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.689
 organized door reverse two relays through 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:13.739
 two diodes now let me show you 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:15.320
 how everything works in principle there is nothing 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.940
 there is no difficult 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:26.129
 so that the screw on the nut 6 long 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:30.159
 and the nuts are welded the bolt is the axis 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:34.599
 screwdriver starts to spin twist 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:38.230
 stud nut on the thread goes or ships 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:41.049
 right or left here here is the axis and 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.409
 it turns out we have all this construction 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:49.209
 there are two photoresistors that 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:53.670
 will track the light so everything seems 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:56.019
 I understand what we do now 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.620
 put on camera from the other side 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.120
 so that this is the direction to see and 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.180
 I connect the power well, in principle, you can and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.730
 Now connect the power here so much 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:13.680
 so than us on batteries batteries 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.680
 1278 well, and that's how it looks 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:23.129
 it is now rotating in one direction 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 this is another 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:34.560
 turned the table first left then 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.560
 right and drove the twist so to speak 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.810
 the main thing not to pull out 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.810
 need to understand 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.830
 now pull the corner same turned out stupid 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.960
 and on breaking these 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:09.170
 so what now twist in the opposite 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.170
 side and and and twist up 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.960
 now so experiment a little bit i 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.190
 shut down 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.190
 one forged wheels 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.080
 on the back of the card 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:22.930
 don't swing it rocks and moves like 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.500
 god is holy catching with lighting same little 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.340
 it is already evening over the score of 15 minutes 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.639
 5 that is , happiness will be in her soon 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:37.139
 what I want to say at the end of the scheme 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.639
 working I liked how it works 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.850
 I started it immediately from the first 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.850
 same times 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:50.520
 adjustable too easy to repeat can 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.950
 virtually any 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.950
 that 's something like this all good luck
