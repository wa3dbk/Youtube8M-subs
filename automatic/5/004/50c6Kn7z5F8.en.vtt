in<00:00:05.860> this<00:00:06.190> video<00:00:06.520> we're<00:00:06.880> going<00:00:07.029> to<00:00:07.149> take<00:00:07.359> a<00:00:07.390> look

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.299 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:07.720> a<00:00:07.750> really<00:00:08.139> cool<00:00:08.350> way<00:00:08.559> of<00:00:08.590> practicing

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
at a really cool way of practicing

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.820 
at a really cool way of practicing
chords<00:00:09.639> on<00:00:09.790> the<00:00:09.820> guitar<00:00:10.320> we're<00:00:11.320> going<00:00:11.530> to<00:00:11.680> be

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
chords on the guitar we're going to be

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.150 
chords on the guitar we're going to be
discussing<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.760> tonal<00:00:13.719> principle<00:00:14.289> called<00:00:14.650> the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
discussing a tonal principle called the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.590 
discussing a tonal principle called the
cycle<00:00:15.670> five<00:00:16.000> chord<00:00:16.780> progression<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.460> what<00:00:19.449> it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
cycle five chord progression and what it

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.259 
cycle five chord progression and what it
is<00:00:19.720> really<00:00:20.020> is<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.440> way<00:00:20.740> of<00:00:20.769> arranging<00:00:21.699> the

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
is really is a way of arranging the

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
is really is a way of arranging the
scale<00:00:22.630> chords<00:00:23.259> of<00:00:23.830> any<00:00:24.220> key<00:00:24.490> and<00:00:25.140> putting<00:00:26.140> them

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
scale chords of any key and putting them

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.800 
scale chords of any key and putting them
in<00:00:26.560> a<00:00:26.830> really<00:00:27.580> neat<00:00:27.880> sounding<00:00:28.539> chord

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
in a really neat sounding chord

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.010 
in a really neat sounding chord
progression<00:00:29.999> so<00:00:30.999> we'll<00:00:31.210> be<00:00:31.329> working<00:00:31.749> in<00:00:31.900> the

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
progression so we'll be working in the

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.680 
progression so we'll be working in the
key<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.349> C<00:00:32.680> so<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.880> first<00:00:34.120> thing<00:00:34.420> we're<00:00:34.570> going

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
key of C so the first thing we're going

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.290 
key of C so the first thing we're going
to<00:00:34.810> do<00:00:35.079> is<00:00:35.410> have<00:00:36.010> a<00:00:36.070> look<00:00:36.190> at<00:00:36.340> our<00:00:36.489> circle<00:00:37.180> of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
to do is have a look at our circle of

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.880 
to do is have a look at our circle of
fifths<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.750> we're<00:00:37.870> all<00:00:38.050> familiar<00:00:38.199> with<00:00:38.500> and

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
fifths that we're all familiar with and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.010 
fifths that we're all familiar with and
I'm<00:00:39.670> going<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:39.910> go<00:00:40.090> through<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.600> eliminate

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
I'm going to go through and eliminate

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.020 
I'm going to go through and eliminate
all<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.379> notes<00:00:41.620> than<00:00:41.890> not<00:00:42.129> in<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.430> key<00:00:42.609> of<00:00:42.760> C

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
all the notes than not in the key of C

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.049 
all the notes than not in the key of C
so<00:00:43.750> taking<00:00:44.289> our<00:00:44.379> B<00:00:44.590> flat<00:00:44.920> E<00:00:45.190> flat<00:00:45.940> a<00:00:46.570> flat<00:00:47.230> D

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
so taking our B flat E flat a flat D

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.040 
so taking our B flat E flat a flat D
flat<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.269> F<00:00:49.809> sharp<00:00:50.109> and<00:00:51.390> now<00:00:52.390> here's<00:00:52.780> what<00:00:53.019> our

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
flat and F sharp and now here's what our

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.970 
flat and F sharp and now here's what our
cycle<00:00:53.769> five<00:00:54.420> looks<00:00:55.420> like<00:00:55.750> now<00:00:56.679> that<00:00:56.710> we've

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
cycle five looks like now that we've

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.970 
cycle five looks like now that we've
taken<00:00:57.219> out<00:00:57.579> all<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.789> notes<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:59.649> not<00:00:59.829> in

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
taken out all the notes that are not in

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.520 
taken out all the notes that are not in
the<00:01:00.070> key<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.370> C<00:01:00.609> we've<00:01:01.090> just<00:01:01.390> left<00:01:01.660> the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
the key of C we've just left the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.200 
the key of C we've just left the
positioning<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:05.410> notes<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.980> the<00:01:06.210> same

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
positioning of the notes in the same

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.600 
positioning of the notes in the same
order<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.350> same<00:01:08.560> sequence<00:01:08.980> as<00:01:09.310> they<00:01:09.490> would

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
order the same sequence as they would

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.510 
order the same sequence as they would
appear<00:01:09.960> around<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.230> original<00:01:11.740> circle<00:01:12.400> of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
appear around the original circle of

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.730 
appear around the original circle of
fifths<00:01:12.700> but<00:01:13.690> we've<00:01:13.810> just<00:01:13.840> taken<00:01:14.440> out<00:01:14.590> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
fifths but we've just taken out the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.600 
fifths but we've just taken out the
notes<00:01:14.980> that<00:01:15.310> are<00:01:16.150> not<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.480> key<00:01:16.660> of<00:01:16.690> C<00:01:17.020> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
notes that are not in the key of C so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.360 
notes that are not in the key of C so
what<00:01:18.610> this<00:01:19.000> diagram<00:01:19.600> represents<00:01:19.750> is<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:21.070> root

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
what this diagram represents is the root

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:29.190 
what this diagram represents is the root
movement<00:01:23.280> around<00:01:25.410> circle<00:01:26.410> of<00:01:26.530> fifths<00:01:26.760> in<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
movement around circle of fifths in the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.550 
movement around circle of fifths in the
key<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.530> C<00:01:30.690> now<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.750> next<00:01:32.050> thing<00:01:32.170> I'm<00:01:32.260> going<00:01:32.320> to

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
key of C now the next thing I'm going to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.930 
key of C now the next thing I'm going to
do<00:01:32.800> is<00:01:34.500> put<00:01:35.500> in<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.890> chord<00:01:36.160> qualities<00:01:36.340> I'm

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
do is put in the chord qualities I'm

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.940 
do is put in the chord qualities I'm
going<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.300> add<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.720> chord<00:01:37.990> qualities<00:01:38.170> in<00:01:38.680> and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
going to add the chord qualities in and

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.100 
going to add the chord qualities in and
in<00:01:39.550> this<00:01:39.670> case<00:01:39.940> this<00:01:40.150> would<00:01:40.330> be<00:01:40.480> C<00:01:40.750> major

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
in this case this would be C major

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.100 
in this case this would be C major
seventh<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.780> would<00:01:43.990> be<00:01:44.110> F<00:01:44.260> major<00:01:44.560> seven<00:01:46.110> B

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
seventh this would be F major seven B

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.000 
seventh this would be F major seven B
minor<00:01:47.410> 7<00:01:47.680> flat<00:01:47.860> 5<00:01:48.070> e<00:01:49.290> minor<00:01:50.290> 7<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:51.420> minor<00:01:52.420> 7<00:01:53.010> D

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
minor 7 flat 5 e minor 7 a minor 7 D

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.290 
minor 7 flat 5 e minor 7 a minor 7 D
minor<00:01:54.280> 7<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:55.410> g7<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.710> let's<00:01:59.980> recap<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:01.060> first

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
minor 7 and g7 so let's recap the first

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.270 
minor 7 and g7 so let's recap the first
thing<00:02:01.570> we<00:02:01.720> did<00:02:01.960> was<00:02:02.380> eliminate<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:03.010> notes

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
thing we did was eliminate the notes

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.300 
thing we did was eliminate the notes
that<00:02:03.430> were<00:02:03.730> not<00:02:03.910> in<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.150> key<00:02:04.330> of<00:02:04.450> C<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.310> this

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
that were not in the key of C and this

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.720 
that were not in the key of C and this
left<00:02:06.580> us<00:02:06.790> with<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.240> root<00:02:07.750> notes<00:02:08.080> C<00:02:09.069> F<00:02:09.629> B<00:02:10.629> e<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:11.860> D

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
left us with the root notes C F B e a D

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.959 
left us with the root notes C F B e a D
and<00:02:12.760> G<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.450> then<00:02:14.260> we<00:02:14.409> filled<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.859> the<00:02:14.969> scale

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
and G and then we filled in the scale

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.880 
and G and then we filled in the scale
chord<00:02:16.480> quality

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
chord quality

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.370 
chord quality
that<00:02:18.430> relates<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.240> each<00:02:19.420> root<00:02:19.720> note<00:02:19.960> in<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
that relates to each root note in the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.980 
that relates to each root note in the
key<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.590> C<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.430> now<00:02:21.460> we<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.910> C<00:02:22.120> major<00:02:22.330> seven<00:02:22.810> F

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
key of C so now we have C major seven F

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.130 
key of C so now we have C major seven F
major<00:02:23.230> seven<00:02:23.740> B<00:02:24.520> minor<00:02:24.760> seven<00:02:25.090> flat<00:02:25.120> five<00:02:25.300> or<00:02:25.870> B

why<00:02:50.170> it's<00:02:50.380> called

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
why it's called

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.880 
why it's called
a<00:02:51.010> cycle<00:02:51.940> five<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.870> that's<00:02:53.260> because<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
a cycle five and that's because the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.610 
a cycle five and that's because the
distance<00:02:54.280> between<00:02:54.430> all<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.330> root<00:02:55.540> notes<00:02:55.840> when

interval distance between each of the
root<00:03:02.470> notes<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.760> fifth<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:05.019> distance

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
root notes is a fifth the distance

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.640 
root notes is a fifth the distance

there's many different ways we can play
this<00:03:18.550> chord<00:03:18.850> progression<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.750> guitar<00:03:20.310> for

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
this chord progression on the guitar for

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.100 
this chord progression on the guitar for
the<00:03:21.430> purpose<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.000> video<00:03:22.329> I'm<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:22.930> going

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
the purpose of this video I'm just going

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.069 
the purpose of this video I'm just going
to<00:03:23.200> set<00:03:23.470> two<00:03:23.680> criterias<00:03:24.579> when<00:03:25.390> I'm<00:03:25.510> selecting

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
to set two criterias when I'm selecting

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.180 
to set two criterias when I'm selecting
the<00:03:26.230> chords<00:03:28.290> firstly<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.530> each<00:03:29.709> chord<00:03:30.040> will

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
the chords firstly that each chord will

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.660 
the chords firstly that each chord will
only<00:03:30.340> have<00:03:30.640> four<00:03:30.910> notes<00:03:31.239> in<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:32.670> secondly

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
only have four notes in it and secondly

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.270 
only have four notes in it and secondly
that<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.120> chords<00:03:34.540> will<00:03:34.720> be<00:03:34.840> close<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:36.250> each

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
that the chords will be close to each

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.550 
that the chords will be close to each
other<00:03:36.640> on<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.030> guitar<00:03:37.329> fretboard<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.500> we

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
other on the guitar fretboard so that we

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.949 
other on the guitar fretboard so that we
don't<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.040> move<00:03:39.220> around<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.940> great<00:03:40.660> deal

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
don't have to move around a great deal

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.800 
don't have to move around a great deal
and<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:42.579> is<00:03:42.730> how<00:03:42.850> I'm<00:03:43.030> playing<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.600> C

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
and so this is how I'm playing the C

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.009 
and so this is how I'm playing the C
major<00:03:44.079> seventh<00:03:44.590> chord<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:46.150> root<00:03:46.180> note<00:03:46.780> is

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
major seventh chord the root note is

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.780 
major seventh chord the root note is
marked<00:03:47.920> with<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.280> clear<00:03:48.670> daughter

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.759 

and<00:03:52.879> here's<00:03:53.629> the<00:03:53.780> f<00:03:53.870> major<00:03:54.110> seventh<00:03:54.709> chord

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
and here's the f major seventh chord

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.970 
and here's the f major seventh chord
shape<00:03:55.250> I'm<00:03:55.459> using<00:03:55.989> again<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.379> root<00:03:57.560> note<00:03:57.799> is

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
shape I'm using again the root note is

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.280 
shape I'm using again the root note is
marked<00:03:58.340> as<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.579> clear<00:03:58.849> dot<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.329> take

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
marked as a clear dot and take

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.470 
marked as a clear dot and take
particular<00:04:00.620> notice<00:04:01.040> how<00:04:01.400> I'm<00:04:01.670> barring<00:04:02.299> the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
particular notice how I'm barring the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.720 
particular notice how I'm barring the

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
third finger it's a good idea to

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.449 
third finger it's a good idea to
practice<00:04:08.090> these<00:04:08.900> chords<00:04:09.379> in<00:04:09.530> pairs<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.310> other

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
practice these chords in pairs in other

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.729 
practice these chords in pairs in other
words<00:04:10.700> practice<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.420> C<00:04:11.599> major<00:04:11.870> 7th<00:04:12.439> shape

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
words practice the C major 7th shape

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.779 
words practice the C major 7th shape
moving<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.879> the<00:04:13.970> F<00:04:14.090> major<00:04:14.390> 7th<00:04:14.959> shape<00:04:15.789> before

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
moving to the F major 7th shape before

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.060 
moving to the F major 7th shape before
we<00:04:17.060> go<00:04:17.209> any<00:04:17.419> further<00:04:17.630> let's<00:04:18.380> have<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.620> listen<00:04:18.829> to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
we go any further let's have a listen to

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.789 
we go any further let's have a listen to
the<00:04:19.220> cycle<00:04:19.699> 5<00:04:19.970> chord<00:04:20.449> progression<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:21.530> we<00:04:21.650> can

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
the cycle 5 chord progression so we can

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.830 
the cycle 5 chord progression so we can
hear<00:04:22.070> how<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.250> whole<00:04:22.639> chord<00:04:23.479> sequence<00:04:24.110> sounds
