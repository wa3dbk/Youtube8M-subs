happens<00:01:29.650> anyway<00:01:30.040> later<00:01:30.280> on<00:01:30.550> is<00:01:30.970> when<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.600> top

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
happens anyway later on is when the top

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.830 
happens anyway later on is when the top
layer<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.050> lip<00:01:32.530> gloss<00:01:32.610> begins<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:34.330> fade<00:01:34.540> away

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
layer of lip gloss begins to fade away

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.770 
layer of lip gloss begins to fade away
or<00:01:35.290> if<00:01:35.410> you've<00:01:35.560> been<00:01:35.740> eating<00:01:36.010> or<00:01:36.430> drinking<00:01:36.780> the

or if you've been eating or drinking the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.140 
or if you've been eating or drinking the
sugar<00:01:38.020> gloss<00:01:38.320> blossom<00:01:38.890> works<00:01:39.100> as<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.400> stain<00:01:39.760> so

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
sugar gloss blossom works as a stain so

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.109 
sugar gloss blossom works as a stain so
there<00:01:40.420> will<00:01:40.720> still<00:01:40.990> be<00:01:41.050> color<00:01:41.470> left<00:01:42.100> over<00:01:42.610> and

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
there will still be color left over and

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.600 
there will still be color left over and
I<00:01:43.240> like<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.720> it<00:01:43.869> works<00:01:44.110> for<00:01:44.410> me<00:01:44.590> there<00:01:45.400> are

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
have naturally rosy cheeks but you can

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.309 
have naturally rosy cheeks but you can
tell<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.560> difference<00:03:46.769> if<00:03:47.219> you<00:03:47.340> look<00:03:47.549> closely

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
really is the word that I would use to

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.729 
really is the word that I would use to
its<00:04:17.849> at<00:04:18.000> end<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.989> that's<00:04:19.199> how<00:04:19.409> I<00:04:19.440> would

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
its at end and that's how I would

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.979 
its at end and that's how I would
describe<00:04:19.859> gloss<00:04:20.430> blossom<00:04:20.940> as<00:04:21.060> well<00:04:21.269> by<00:04:21.930> the

describe gloss blossom as well by the

describe gloss blossom as well by the
way<00:04:22.199> there<00:04:22.530> are<00:04:22.560> non<00:04:23.010> shimmer<00:04:23.400> versions<00:04:24.030> of

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
way there are non shimmer versions of

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.810 
way there are non shimmer versions of
both<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.780> these<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.470> haven't<00:04:25.800> tried<00:04:26.099> those<00:04:26.460> but

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
both of these I haven't tried those but

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.480 
both of these I haven't tried those but
the<00:04:27.599> packaging<00:04:28.320> looks<00:04:28.349> very<00:04:28.710> similar<00:04:28.949> and<00:04:29.340> I

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
the packaging looks very similar and I

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.980 
the packaging looks very similar and I
can<00:04:29.639> only<00:04:29.759> imagine<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.330> they<00:04:30.539> are<00:04:30.630> probably

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
can only imagine that they are probably

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.950 
can only imagine that they are probably
pretty<00:04:31.979> much<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.370> same<00:04:32.720> except<00:04:33.720> for<00:04:33.870> the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
pretty much the same except for the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.240 
pretty much the same except for the
shimmer<00:04:34.229> you<00:04:34.889> can't<00:04:35.130> even<00:04:35.430> see<00:04:36.380> shimmer<00:04:37.380> like

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
shimmer you can't even see shimmer like

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
shimmer you can't even see shimmer like
a<00:04:38.310> crazy<00:04:39.289> shimmer<00:04:40.430> maybe<00:04:41.430> if<00:04:41.550> you<00:04:41.639> look<00:04:41.820> really

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
a crazy shimmer maybe if you look really

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.249 
a crazy shimmer maybe if you look really
