another tip that I would like to give
you<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.340> are<00:01:41.399> not<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> manual<00:01:42.179> flash

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you is if you are not the manual flash

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.810 
you is if you are not the manual flash
shooter<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.070> used<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> setup<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
shooter if you are not used to setup the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.289 
shooter if you are not used to setup the
flashes<00:01:45.179> manually<00:01:45.679> use<00:01:46.679> ETTL<00:01:47.310> use<00:01:47.549> eye<00:01:47.729> TTL

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
flashes manually use ETTL use eye TTL

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.239 
flashes manually use ETTL use eye TTL
whatever<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:48.840> camera<00:01:49.170> system<00:01:49.590> supports<00:01:50.070> I

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
whatever your camera system supports I

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.169 
whatever your camera system supports I
personally<00:01:51.030> love<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.600> use<00:01:51.749> ETTL<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:53.219> makes

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
personally love to use ETTL which makes

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.480 
personally love to use ETTL which makes
it<00:01:54.329> very<00:01:54.390> flexible<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.469> Emily<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:56.009> get<00:01:56.219> very

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it very flexible so Emily can get very

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.669 
it very flexible so Emily can get very
close<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.850> subject<00:01:57.569> or<00:01:57.749> further<00:01:58.020> away<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
close to subject or further away and

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.919 
close to subject or further away and
each<00:01:58.829> TTL<00:01:59.159> will<00:01:59.340> take<00:01:59.579> care<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.420> right

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
each TTL will take care of the right

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.380 
each TTL will take care of the right
amount<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.409> fill<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.890> flash<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
amount of fill in flash I don't have to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.169 
amount of fill in flash I don't have to
care<00:02:03.659> Emily<00:02:04.469> doesn't<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.859> to<00:02:05.039> care<00:02:05.310> it's

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
care Emily doesn't have to care it's

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.150 
care Emily doesn't have to care it's
done<00:02:06.420> automatically<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.499> just<00:02:07.799> sweet

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
done automatically and that's just sweet

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.999
