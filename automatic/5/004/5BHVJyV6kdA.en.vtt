I mean if if you notice the difference

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
I mean if if you notice the difference
in<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.360> league<00:01:57.600> compared<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.290> was

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
in this league compared to what it was

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.630 
in this league compared to what it was
maybe<00:01:58.649> 10<00:01:58.920> years<00:01:59.040> ago<00:01:59.780> yeah<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:02.369> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
maybe 10 years ago yeah it just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880 
maybe 10 years ago yeah it just
obviously<00:02:02.820> feels<00:02:03.240> younger<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.469> obviously

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
obviously feels younger and obviously

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.240 
obviously feels younger and obviously
I'm<00:02:05.189> older<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.820> kids<00:02:06.030> are<00:02:06.560> but<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.979> then

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
I'm older and the kids are but back then

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.070 
I'm older and the kids are but back then
there<00:02:08.459> was<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> different<00:02:09.080> collective

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
there was a different collective

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.270 
there was a different collective
bargaining<00:02:10.379> agreement<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.709> there<00:02:10.860> was<00:02:11.039> I

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
bargaining agreement and there was I

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.240 
bargaining agreement and there was I
think<00:02:11.459> generally<00:02:11.910> older<00:02:12.150> players<00:02:12.390> around<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
think generally older players around the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.490 
think generally older players around the
so<00:02:14.970> not<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.600> say<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.900> any<00:02:16.020> more<00:02:16.110> or<00:02:16.380> less

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so not to say it's any more or less

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.380 
so not to say it's any more or less
competitive<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.100> can't<00:02:17.520> recall

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
competitive I can't recall

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.640 
competitive I can't recall
you<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.630> what<00:02:18.750> teams<00:02:18.959> back<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.350> would<00:02:19.560> have

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you know what teams back then would have

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.280 
you know what teams back then would have
done<00:02:19.800> compared<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.310> teams<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.810> know<00:02:21.900> here<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
done compared to teams you know here and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.190 
done compared to teams you know here and
now<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.970> hard<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.209> really<00:02:24.420> say<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:24.990> you
