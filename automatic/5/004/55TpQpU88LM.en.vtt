all right as far as the mufflers go
they're<00:01:27.740> all<00:01:27.770> looking<00:01:28.159> good<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.880> heat<00:01:29.120> shield

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
they're all looking good the heat shield

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.620 
they're all looking good the heat shield
down<00:01:29.720> here<00:01:29.990> kind<00:01:30.320> of<00:01:30.700> has<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.729> crack<00:01:32.119> on<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:32.479> so

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
down here kind of has a crack on it so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.940 
down here kind of has a crack on it so
occasionally<00:01:33.470> about<00:01:35.200> 5,000<00:01:36.200> rpm<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:36.770> can

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
occasionally about 5,000 rpm you can

hardly noticeable with your helmet on
though<00:01:42.220> only<00:01:43.220> reason<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.610> heard<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.060> because

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
though only reason I heard it is because

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.490

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:03:11.860 

give<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.010> little<00:02:00.220> bit<00:02:00.370> more<00:02:00.430> choke<00:02:00.940> here

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.259 

it<00:03:12.870> sounds<00:03:13.530> pretty<00:03:13.890> good<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.610> haven't<00:03:14.940> had<00:03:15.120> any

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
it sounds pretty good I haven't had any

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.400 
it sounds pretty good I haven't had any
problems<00:03:15.660> with<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.930> at<00:03:16.019> all

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
problems with it at all

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.160 
problems with it at all
apart<00:03:17.190> from<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:18.000> know<00:03:18.150> winter<00:03:18.480> battery

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
apart from just you know winter battery

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.559 
apart from just you know winter battery
dying<00:03:19.410> had<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:21.060> put<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> trickle<00:03:21.540> charge

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
dying had to just put a trickle charge

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.559 
dying had to just put a trickle charge
on<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.349> works<00:03:22.800> really<00:03:23.640> well<00:03:26.180> one<00:03:27.180> issue<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
on it it works really well one issue I

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.070 
on it it works really well one issue I
did<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:28.019> with<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:29.730> petcock<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.660> not

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
did have with it is this petcock is not

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.610 
did have with it is this petcock is not
the<00:03:31.290> original<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.930> took<00:03:34.110> me<00:03:34.260> forever<00:03:34.470> to

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
the original so it took me forever to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.440 
the original so it took me forever to
figure<00:03:34.920> out<00:03:35.069> why<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.250> wasn't<00:03:35.670> getting<00:03:35.940> gas<00:03:36.120> but

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
figure out why I wasn't getting gas but

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.000 
figure out why I wasn't getting gas but
I<00:03:36.480> found<00:03:36.690> out<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.590> actually<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.920> to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
I found out that you actually have to

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.390 
I found out that you actually have to
set<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.810> primer<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.140> let's<00:03:40.680> say<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:41.099> runs

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
set this on primer and let's say it runs

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.240 
set this on primer and let's say it runs
full<00:03:41.610> gas<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:42.090> way<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.330> they<00:03:42.599> have<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:43.250> petcock

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
full gas that way so they have a petcock

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.930 
full gas that way so they have a petcock
that<00:03:44.549> is<00:03:44.670> backwards<00:03:44.940> basically<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.319> it's<00:03:46.680> just

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
that is backwards basically so it's just

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.479 
that is backwards basically so it's just
