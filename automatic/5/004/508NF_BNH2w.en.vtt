00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.480
 Youtube channel 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.340
 today we talk about a product 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.769
 revolutionary that we have learned to 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.110
 to know during the world championship in brazil 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.960
 this summer and it is the trusov sock 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.679
 we saw it worn by the champions 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.429
 of the national and now I have learned 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.589
 sorry the pun took it 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:28.929
 foot even in the major championships 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:30.489
 Europeans and in series you see it at your feet 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.560
 of the most important players 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.630
 recognize these for these graphics 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.530
 white dots that are just right 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.080
 above the ankle 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.530
 then the trusov sock is made of a 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:46.150
 very fine and elastic material that goes 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.950
 perfectly cover up this 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.560
 it's just a graphic you see 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.780
 the brand is right to recognize who 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.490
 is wearing this type of sock 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.890
 the most important peculiarity are 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.370
 these revolutionary findings that yes 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.079
 found inside and under the foot that 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.730
 is an anti-slip technology that 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.100
 allows the foot to remain beyond that 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.740
 dry and because the socks very much 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.270
 breathable this type of sock 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.850
 allows to have an increase of 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.210
 stability and grip of about 45 per 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.280
 one hundred 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.740
 what it means this means that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.689
 we will have a firm foot and a firm footing 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.609
 inside the shoe and will allow us 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.249
 to be more reactive faster because 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.139
 we wo n't have that annoying feeling 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.909
 to slip inside inside 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:30.490
 of the upper itself even when the 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.429
 foot will be more sweaty than the bearings like 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.709
 we said were made with 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.319
 a technology that is activated precisely 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:41.920
 when foot starts to sweat inside 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:44.380
 of the packaging box we can 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.409
 find instructions on how to 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.469
 uses servos 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.270
 first a scissor a sock 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.649
 in this case red because we have it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.950
 taken of the same color 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.100
 in fact in the field you will have to have for 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.060
 regulation the same color and then in the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.569
 time and socks 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.770
 now let's see how together 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.810
 fit our trusov perfectly 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.190
 we all cry 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.690
 let's just raise the persistent as 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.060
 adheres to imperfection 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.690
 then we take a sock as well e 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.769
 we cut the parts just the foot does not 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.519
 can we recommend that there be a 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.340
 adequate space to then put the tape 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:38.900

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.069
 we do the same procedure 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:58.319
