 The free fall asleep podcast the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.170
 I have been producing this for you since 2010 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.330
 So I sat down in the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.640
 week in the evening on this sofa and take 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.870
 you can watch an episode on it live 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.820

 but most simply load episode 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.340
 after that it goes over the 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.079
 website fall asleep podcast.de there can

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.540
 download 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.940
 even easier is if you have a program 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.790
 used on the pc or mac for example 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.130
 itunes or on the iphone there are those 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.899

 you find in the google place gate 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.310
 I'll tell you at the beginning of each episode 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.979
 a little something from my life or 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.750
 talk to some topic so that you 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.310
 be well distracted and I respect 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.080
 that it is not that exciting 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.460
 is so you can fall asleep but 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.250
 Everyone is interested in something else 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.600
 and that happens sometimes that some 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.610
 the butt not to fall asleep people 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 but listen to longer car rides 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.140
 when cleaning while jogging or when too 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.240
 I always read at the end of the episode 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.010
 From a book before that should be a very 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.000
 be boring with it you too 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.729
 could really be a grind 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.710
 since the beginning of the podcast that's immanuel 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.350

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.150
 change with other books all 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.159
