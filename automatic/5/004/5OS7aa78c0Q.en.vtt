this video is to show you how to put

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.009 
this video is to show you how to put
LEDs<00:00:06.859> to<00:00:08.599> LEDs<00:00:09.599> go<00:00:09.960> through<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.679> base<00:00:11.840> all<00:00:12.840> I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
LEDs to LEDs go through the base all I

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.939 
LEDs to LEDs go through the base all I
got<00:00:13.259> was<00:00:14.719> so<00:00:16.220> from<00:00:17.220> $12<00:00:17.789> NV<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.570> Walmart<00:00:18.990> the
