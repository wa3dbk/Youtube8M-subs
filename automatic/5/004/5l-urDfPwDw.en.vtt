is related to protocols and method

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.610 
is related to protocols and method
development<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.360> lot<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.810> labs<00:02:38.080> have<00:02:38.319> kind<00:02:38.530> of

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
development a lot of labs have kind of

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.170 
development a lot of labs have kind of
focused<00:02:39.040> on<00:02:39.250> different<00:02:39.459> research

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
focused on different research

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.390 
focused on different research
applications<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:41.319> optimize<00:02:41.830> those<00:02:42.069> for

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
applications and optimize those for

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.460 
applications and optimize those for
their<00:02:42.549> samples<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.959> said<00:02:44.230> there's<00:02:44.410> a

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
their samples but that said there's a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.930 
their samples but that said there's a
lot<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.680> work<00:02:44.980> being<00:02:45.250> done<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.730> try<00:02:45.849> to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
lot of work being done to try to

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.240 
lot of work being done to try to
integrate<00:02:46.269> those<00:02:47.019> capabilities<00:02:47.739> those

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
integrate those capabilities those

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.039 
integrate those capabilities those
methodologies<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.540> there<00:02:49.750> are<00:02:49.870> more

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
methodologies so that there are more
