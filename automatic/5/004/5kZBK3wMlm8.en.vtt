 cycling videos for 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.230
 growing cyclists we here with 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.900
 the eldest son will be hike 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.190
 re going 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.910
 so here I have a mess fees 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.720
 but the average for the bear comes says 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.970
 pump up the wheel well as if almost 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.130
 ten years old child and he's modern 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.500
 the child already on the Internet knows how 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.809
 sit in u-tuba knows movies where 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.149
 what to download alimentary thing stick 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.219
 the wheel can't be like that for these kids i 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.820
 now quickly show how to seal 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.430
 wheel 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.680
 sit there youtube there is a problem at night 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.600
 type though there if you 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320
 can not ask or anything else 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.300
 learn to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.079
 forever basically elementary and the wheel 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 stick up here what naborchiki it costs 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.410
 dollar 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.739
 bought on such a set of 3 kopecks 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.379
 stand up at any bike shop there or 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.890
 somewhere you buy everything here there is glue 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.960
 there are trays trays on the foil here 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 but the foil is very easy to peel off 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 Foil neatly removed and there 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 she is on this camera all wheel 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.229
 also disassemble the key for 15 but here 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 me a little lasse fagot for a child 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.670
 small nothing is nothing complicated here 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.220
 so here they took a trowel once or twice and sealed it 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 Now I will show you specifically how we do it. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.270
 do as we find a hole as we 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.720
 glue 5 minutes of work and your bike 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.689
 I went further look so we 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:49.259
 removed the wheel means got it out 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:52.700
 we will now pump the camera 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.700
 quick pump com 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.390
 Well, then you can either in the water or by hand 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.460
 Well, in principle, I found a hole here 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.600
 here it blows my fingers 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.100
 felt but you can drop under the water and 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:26.270
 under the water support on the bubbles notice 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.930
 so here she is a little hole further we take 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:40.290
 a quick piece of sandpaper some 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:42.800
 we wipe this place so that it is 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:49.260
 rough to glue well 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:52.280
 took it all further degreased well I 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.100
 on duty at my hands always 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:01.830
 solvent well before and did gasoline 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:05.120
 there's nothing wrong with that 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:11.820
 improvised means necessary course 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:14.660
 with a cloth but everything is degreased like this 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.660
 and neat 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:25.150
 degrease and get our set here 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.150
 there is glue 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.790
 nothing complicated nothing complicated 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.790
 literally a 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:46.849
 smeared means sticking so little to 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.849
 with a margin 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.670
 and all put let dry up a little 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:06.049
 put let it dry we will be further 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:12.629
 Well, we take from this set boat 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:16.650
 here a tray for 10 years is enough here from her 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.289
 remove the foil here I just took off here 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.740
 remove from foil and so here 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.840
 we stack and we press well 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.440
 I'm already dying 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:32.160
 plenochku this I do not deny that I have it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.690
 she took off the foil sheathed 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.060
 very well removed from the foil tore off 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:43.320
 here and here stuck but this cellophane 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:47.910
 chick he stays with me 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.960
 swallow in there that's what you start 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:55.500
 tear it off somewhere 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:00.599
 will start the edge a little bit tear us 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:03.110
 you need well that's all basically starting 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:07.620
 collect the wheel wait here is not necessary 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:12.409
 literally 10 minutes and everything and collect 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:16.760
 wheel back on the bike all 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:19.639
 Here is such a quick work of 3 seconds and 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.090
 no problems and the children do not have to wait and 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.970
 ask dad 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.349
 for dad to do something for everyone 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.349
 wait for the next video
