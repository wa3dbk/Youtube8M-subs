00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.960
 Michael Wester of the play in the point piece 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.369
 there is this in the first row 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.189
 do you think you're on sunday? 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 especially under pressure against frankfurt yes 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.270
 what does pressure mean we are allowed to 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.739
 Do not overpressure because of this 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.029
 does not like to talk about pushers but clearly 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.259
 we can make the difference by 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.329
 we all three perform well 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.940
 and we can make our team to victory 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.390
 Shoot as much as we need to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.000
 like 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.110
 So if I do not need a gate we need it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.250
 I'm happy when I'm three 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.440
 makes gates and we win is me 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.289
 just as childlike player of the league 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.530
 in a row with Petr Sykora the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.089
 best center you are almost pure of the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.969
 statistics ago considered at the moment the 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.649
 number three you have so in the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.719
 series of internal francs 100 plays 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.120
 that does not matter to you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.930
 personally does not matter what we want 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.490
 to be succesfull 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.340
 that we are there right now 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.510
 keep going and I think so bad 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.430
 is not that in the points behind 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 manuel blade and peter sikora to stand 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 the fans are looking forward for weeks and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.720
 months on sunday how it looks 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.790
 you as a team we look forward to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.800
 Of course we share this joy 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.630
 full house we want the fans 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.700
 inspire in our game and as 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.930
 winner of the place makes it so 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.190
 In any case, the two top meet 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.600
 teams of the top league west I think 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.410
 we are clear on paper 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.300
 the two best teams 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.090
 yes we will give our last shirt 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.180
 to be happy and victorious from the ice 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.940
 go 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.850
 It will definitely but I fuck 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.670
 kasseler must say we win 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.000
 what do you want from the fans 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.910
 House 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.390
 good mood and us forward 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.760
 whip 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.880
 now the past week is the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.320
 personality stephan kreuzmann came up 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.149
 the extra oil poured into the fire 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.760
 Has a defender before the season starts 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.680
 The first ones have signed with you 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.360
 played nine league games with you 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.720
 And now it's time to go to Frankfurt 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.680
 how do you deal with it as a team? 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.200
 the relevance for you from the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.019
 now tasks and against Frankfurt even 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.609
 not that must be ticked off no one thinks 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.930
 I do not mean that in here 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.150
 the exhibition but it would have been the same 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.799
 could be very hurt that the boys 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.939
 that are there we have to be ready and 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.260
 when we are ready then we can 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.260
 also win and that the goal
