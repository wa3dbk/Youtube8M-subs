they<00:00:39.970> can't<00:00:40.270> they<00:00:40.570> want<00:00:41.020> to<00:00:41.170> say<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:42.190> it's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
just like a relaxer and that's very far

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.860 
just like a relaxer and that's very far
from<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.100> truth<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:45.910> today<00:00:46.240> I<00:00:46.270> kind<00:00:46.540> of<00:00:46.690> want

with a relaxer and first off the relaxed
are<00:00:56.860> actually<00:00:57.460> if<00:00:58.180> we<00:00:58.660> know<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:59.050> pH<00:00:59.260> scale<00:00:59.920> and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
are actually if we know the pH scale and

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.520 
are actually if we know the pH scale and
some<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.940> us<00:01:01.060> doing<00:01:01.210> some<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.570> us<00:01:01.690> don't<00:01:01.900> but<00:01:02.260> if

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
some of us doing some of us don't but if

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.740 
some of us doing some of us don't but if
we<00:01:03.010> know<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.250> pH<00:01:03.430> scale<00:01:03.880> the<00:01:04.119> relaxer<00:01:04.659> is

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
we know the pH scale the relaxer is

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.530 
we know the pH scale the relaxer is
actually<00:01:05.379> alkaline<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.399> it<00:01:07.090> sits<00:01:07.329> on<00:01:07.420> the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
actually alkaline and it sits on the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.140 
actually alkaline and it sits on the
opposite<00:01:07.990> side<00:01:08.259> of<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.560> pH<00:01:08.890> scale<00:01:09.250> then<00:01:09.820> a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
opposite side of the pH scale then a

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.880 
opposite side of the pH scale then a
keratin<00:01:10.990> treatment<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:12.370> with<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:12.880> said<00:01:13.180> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
keratin treatment so with that said the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.040 
keratin treatment so with that said the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
of the relaxer it can be a challenge

of the relaxer it can be a challenge
because<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:54.370> can<00:02:54.609> cause<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.849> little<00:02:55.420> bit<00:02:55.569> of

excessive<00:02:56.769> shedding<00:02:57.010> because<00:02:57.910> we<00:02:58.090> have<00:02:58.239> two

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
excessive shedding because we have two

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.509 
excessive shedding because we have two

our new growth in the new growth gravity

down to the scalp and gravitate towards

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
the scalp in the ends which will be

the scalp in the ends which will be
previously<00:03:16.329> relaxed<00:03:16.810> hair<00:03:17.579> gravity<00:03:18.579> would

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
previously relaxed hair gravity would

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.569 
previously relaxed hair gravity would
naturally<00:03:19.090> want<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.390> make<00:03:19.569> it<00:03:19.780> fall<00:03:20.620> towards

naturally want to make it fall towards
the<00:03:21.730> ground<00:03:22.200> with<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.230> we<00:03:24.069> have<00:03:24.280> this

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
the ground with that we have this

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.839 
the ground with that we have this
previously<00:03:25.650> relaxed<00:03:26.650> hair<00:03:26.889> that's<00:03:27.609> been

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
previously relaxed hair that's been

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.879 
previously relaxed hair that's been
taken<00:03:28.209> out<00:03:28.299> of<00:03:28.359> its<00:03:28.569> natural<00:03:28.750> state<00:03:29.109> and<00:03:29.650> then

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
taken out of its natural state and then

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.440 
taken out of its natural state and then
we<00:03:30.010> have<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.579> virgin<00:03:31.000> hair

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
we have the virgin hair

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.180 
we have the virgin hair
so<00:03:31.750> which<00:03:32.139> hair<00:03:32.379> do<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.650> think<00:03:32.919> is<00:03:33.040> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
so which hair do you think is the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.339 
so which hair do you think is the
strongest<00:03:33.669> it's<00:03:34.180> going<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.599> be<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.930> virgin

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
strongest it's going to be that virgin

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.699 
strongest it's going to be that virgin
here<00:03:35.560> at<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.739> scalp<00:03:36.069> so<00:03:36.639> as<00:03:36.819> it's<00:03:37.590> once<00:03:38.590> a

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
here at the scalp so as it's once a

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.920 
here at the scalp so as it's once a
compact<00:03:39.190> down<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.669> the<00:03:39.790> scalp<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.359> leave<00:03:40.480> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
compact down to the scalp and leave the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.400 
compact down to the scalp and leave the
relaxed<00:03:41.410> here<00:03:41.560> wants<00:03:41.859> to<00:03:42.090> hang<00:03:43.090> down<00:03:43.419> the

relaxed here wants to hang down the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.080 
relaxed here wants to hang down the
virgin<00:03:44.799> here<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.069> going<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.370> win<00:03:45.519> there's<00:03:46.000> a

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
virgin here is going to win there's a

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.180 
virgin here is going to win there's a
tug-of-war<00:03:46.419> going<00:03:47.410> on<00:03:47.650> between<00:03:47.859> the<00:03:48.160> two

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
tug-of-war going on between the two

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.099 
tug-of-war going on between the two
textures<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.760> hair<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.299> that's<00:03:49.780> where<00:03:50.019> the

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
textures of hair and that's where the

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.740 
textures of hair and that's where the
breakage<00:03:50.500> comes<00:03:50.799> into<00:03:51.129> play<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:51.940> that's<00:03:52.540> why

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
breakage comes into play so that's why

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.289 
breakage comes into play so that's why
sometimes<00:03:53.079> it's<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.250> battle<00:03:54.819> trying<00:03:55.090> to

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
sometimes it's it's a battle trying to

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.729 
sometimes it's it's a battle trying to
grow<00:03:55.480> out<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.930> relaxer

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
grow out of the relaxer

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.610 
grow out of the relaxer
especially<00:03:57.370> when<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.669> have<00:03:58.379> lengthy<00:03:59.379> here

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
especially when you have lengthy here

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.319 
especially when you have lengthy here
like<00:03:59.859> like<00:04:00.220> myself<00:04:01.500> now<00:04:02.500> when<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.340> used<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.180> have

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
like like myself now when I used to have

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.780 
like like myself now when I used to have
a<00:04:04.359> short<00:04:04.750> haircut<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.620> about<00:04:06.220> five<00:04:06.459> years<00:04:06.639> ago

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
a short haircut and about five years ago

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.770 
a short haircut and about five years ago
I<00:04:07.030> grew<00:04:07.419> out<00:04:07.449> of<00:04:07.750> my<00:04:07.900> short<00:04:08.319> haircut<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.040> as<00:04:09.730> I

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
I grew out of my short haircut and as I

the opposite side of the pH scale and

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.300 
the opposite side of the pH scale and
they<00:04:41.889> are<00:04:42.630> composed<00:04:43.630> of<00:04:43.930> keratin<00:04:44.590> which<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.070> a

they are composed of keratin which is a

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.670 
they are composed of keratin which is a
part<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.330> what<00:04:46.510> our<00:04:46.540> hair<00:04:46.870> is<00:04:47.020> composed<00:04:47.470> of

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
naturally which is keratin amino acid so

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.240 
naturally which is keratin amino acid so
it's<00:04:51.370> designed<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.330> restore<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.470> restructure
