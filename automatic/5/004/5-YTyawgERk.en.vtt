00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.450 

all<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.319> well<00:00:01.530> I've<00:00:01.650> decided<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:02.159> take<00:00:02.429> a

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
all right well I've decided to take a

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.280 
all right well I've decided to take a
little<00:00:02.730> break<00:00:03.060> from<00:00:03.330> my<00:00:03.570> Stubblefield

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
little break from my Stubblefield

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.590 
little break from my Stubblefield
project<00:00:04.980> until<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.670> understand<00:00:06.270> more<00:00:06.540> about

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
project until I understand more about

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.600 
project until I understand more about
why<00:00:07.170> they<00:00:07.410> work<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.799> how<00:00:07.859> they<00:00:07.980> work<00:00:08.340> because

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
why they work and how they work because

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.910 
why they work and how they work because
they're<00:00:08.790> expensive<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.840> copper<00:00:10.530> covered

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
they're expensive the copper covered

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.870 
they're expensive the copper covered
wire<00:00:11.190> that's<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:12.150> requires<00:00:13.099> was<00:00:14.099> expensive<00:00:14.730> so

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
wire that's it requires was expensive so

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.430 
wire that's it requires was expensive so
I<00:00:14.910> don't<00:00:15.179> want<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.599> any<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:16.049> until<00:00:16.320> I

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
I don't want to do any more until I

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.980 
I don't want to do any more until I
figure<00:00:16.770> out<00:00:16.830> why<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.670> how<00:00:18.090> these<00:00:18.330> things<00:00:18.600> work

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
figure out why and how these things work

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.240 
figure out why and how these things work
so<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.369> went<00:00:20.820> into<00:00:21.630> another<00:00:21.810> project<00:00:22.230> briefly<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
so I went into another project briefly I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.009 
so I went into another project briefly I
was<00:00:23.609> at<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> store<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> other<00:00:24.330> day<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.930> I've

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
was at the store the other day and I've

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
was at the store the other day and I've
always<00:00:25.199> wanted<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.740> make<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> pulse<00:00:26.430> motor<00:00:26.820> or

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
always wanted to make a pulse motor or

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.359 
always wanted to make a pulse motor or
try<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:28.019> out<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.369> roll<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:30.199> wire<00:00:31.369> this

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
try one out of just a roll of wire this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.040 
try one out of just a roll of wire this
is<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.969> plain<00:00:33.530> wire<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:35.660> not<00:00:36.660> even

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
is just plain wire it's not even

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.590 
is just plain wire it's not even
unwrapped<00:00:37.700> there's<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> little<00:00:39.030> piece<00:00:39.270> at<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
unwrapped there's a little piece at the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 
unwrapped there's a little piece at the
bottom<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> tied<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.760> then

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
bottom here that I tied on to and then

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
bottom here that I tied on to and then
that's<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.020> other<00:00:43.170> end<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.100> it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that's just the other end there and it's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.660 
that's just the other end there and it's
Radio<00:00:45.300> Shack<00:00:46.070> speaker<00:00:47.070> wire<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.500> it's<00:00:49.670> 75

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
Radio Shack speaker wire and it's 75

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.270 
Radio Shack speaker wire and it's 75
feet<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:53.239> 24<00:00:54.239> gauge<00:00:54.600> solid<00:00:55.530> wire<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.989> I<00:00:58.280> was

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
feet of 24 gauge solid wire and I was

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.770 
feet of 24 gauge solid wire and I was
just<00:00:59.489> wondering<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.120> could<00:01:00.270> take<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
just wondering if you could take one of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
just wondering if you could take one of
these<00:01:00.899> coils<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:02.070> I've<00:01:02.160> seen<00:01:02.340> some<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
these coils because I've seen some of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
these coils because I've seen some of
the<00:01:02.730> other<00:01:02.879> guys<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> pulse

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the other guys do it and get a pulse

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.899 
the other guys do it and get a pulse
motor<00:01:05.240> to<00:01:06.240> work<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.979> answer<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.310> yeah<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
motor to work and the answer is yeah you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.899 
motor to work and the answer is yeah you
can<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.500> made<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.460> circuit

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
can and I just made up a little circuit

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.510 
can and I just made up a little circuit
here<00:01:12.119> which<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> basically<00:01:12.869> Abedini<00:01:13.530> jewel

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
here which is basically Abedini jewel

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390 
here which is basically Abedini jewel
thief<00:01:14.880> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.979> call<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
thief kind of thing here and I call it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.990 
thief kind of thing here and I call it
the<00:01:17.549> speaker<00:01:18.330> wire<00:01:18.540> pulse<00:01:18.960> motor<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.549> I'm<00:01:20.759> lit

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the speaker wire pulse motor and I'm lit

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.890 
the speaker wire pulse motor and I'm lit
motor<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> date<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.409> happened<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
motor that's the date it happened and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.800 
motor that's the date it happened and
just<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.140> TI<00:01:25.740> p<00:01:25.860> 305<00:01:26.580> five<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.390> come<00:01:27.600> off<00:01:27.780> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
just a TI p 305 five you come off of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.340 
just a TI p 305 five you come off of
here<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> collector<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> back<00:01:29.340> EMF<00:01:29.579> of

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
here on the collector of the back EMF of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.170 
here on the collector of the back EMF of
one<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.500> 400<00:01:31.890> seven<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> protection

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
one in 400 seven you put a protection

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.760 
one in 400 seven you put a protection
knee<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> way<00:01:34.619> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
knee on here because of the way this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.999 
knee on here because of the way this
runs<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.490> need<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.689> diode<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> this

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
runs you really need it a diode and this

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
runs you really need it a diode and this
is<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> Bedini<00:01:38.670> basic<00:01:39.479> Heatley<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
is the Bedini basic Heatley here and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.679 
is the Bedini basic Heatley here and
I've<00:01:41.280> connected<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.850> coil<00:01:42.180> either

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
I've connected the coil either

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
I've connected the coil either
differently<00:01:43.409> or<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> same<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.369> sure<00:01:44.610> but

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
differently or the same I'm not sure but

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600 
differently or the same I'm not sure but
this<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.060> connected<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> fuel<00:01:46.229> T<00:01:46.610> where

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
this is connected like a fuel T where

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.630 
this is connected like a fuel T where
one<00:01:48.240> part<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.409> coil<00:01:49.740> goes<00:01:50.040> onto<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> other

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
one part of the coil goes onto the other

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
one part of the coil goes onto the other
part<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> coil<00:01:51.420> ties<00:01:51.810> into<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> plus<00:01:52.439> rail

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
part of the coil ties into the plus rail

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.370 
part of the coil ties into the plus rail
and<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> way<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> goes<00:01:55.049> but

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and then this is the way it goes but

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.039 
and then this is the way it goes but
draws<00:01:56.340> quite<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> bit<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.969> juice<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.810> works

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
draws quite a bit of juice but it works

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.889 
draws quite a bit of juice but it works
so<00:01:58.799> I'm<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> show<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
so I'm going to show it here with the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.209 
so I'm going to show it here with the
four<00:02:01.500> double<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:03.049> 1.2<00:02:04.049> volt<00:02:04.439> batteries<00:02:04.979> it's

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
four double a 1.2 volt batteries it's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.119 
four double a 1.2 volt batteries it's
about<00:02:05.520> four<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> half<00:02:06.210> volts<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
about four and a half volts and that

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.609 
about four and a half volts and that
coil<00:02:08.459> hooked<00:02:08.819> up<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> circuit<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.170> and

coil hooked up to the circuit here and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.410 
coil hooked up to the circuit here and
then<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.129> these<00:02:11.250> lights<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.760> America<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
then one of these lights of America is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.630 
then one of these lights of America is
going<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.599> light<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> back

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
going to light up on the back

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.270 
going to light up on the back
EML<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.750> then<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.200> demonstrate<00:02:15.740> this<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.069> made

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
EML and then to demonstrate this I made

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.610 
EML and then to demonstrate this I made
this<00:02:16.430> little<00:02:16.640> motor<00:02:17.569> kind<00:02:17.959> of<00:02:18.080> thing<00:02:18.319> here

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
this little motor kind of thing here

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.920 
this little motor kind of thing here
it's<00:02:18.770> just<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.220> piece<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.520> plastic<00:02:19.819> bottom<00:02:20.660> part

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
it's just a piece of plastic bottom part

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.890 
it's just a piece of plastic bottom part
of<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.200> pill<00:02:22.040> bottle<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.880> one<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.750> those

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
of a pill bottle and one of those

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.070 
of a pill bottle and one of those
diametrically<00:02:24.740> opposed<00:02:25.250> magnets<00:02:26.180> like<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.959> was

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
diametrically opposed magnets like I was

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.440 
diametrically opposed magnets like I was
using<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.680> mirror<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.250> just<00:02:29.180> made<00:02:29.420> a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
using on the mirror and just made a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.530 
using on the mirror and just made a
little<00:02:29.660> little<00:02:30.590> motor<00:02:30.830> thing<00:02:31.160> here<00:02:31.430> for<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.820> so

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
little little motor thing here for it so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.320 
little little motor thing here for it so
I'll<00:02:32.870> put<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.050> here<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.640> very<00:02:35.030> noisy

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
I'll put that here and it's very noisy

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.300 
I'll put that here and it's very noisy
it's<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.930> loud<00:02:36.140> thing<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.340> here<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.790> go

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
it's a loud thing so here we go

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.949 
it's a loud thing so here we go
what's<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.520> neon<00:02:40.850> light<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.239> there's<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.570> neon

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
what's the neon light up there's a neon

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.979 
what's the neon light up there's a neon
lighten<00:02:42.260> up<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:43.610> self<00:02:44.000> oscillates<00:02:44.660> quite

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
lighten up this self oscillates quite

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.020 
lighten up this self oscillates quite
nicely<00:02:45.230> there's<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.739> lights<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.220> America<00:02:46.760> bulb

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
nicely there's a lights of America bulb

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.280 
nicely there's a lights of America bulb
on<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.890> goes<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.070> motor

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.430 

ah

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.600 

I<00:02:59.500> can<00:02:59.830> take<00:03:00.070> this<00:03:00.280> off<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.970> now<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:03.490> other

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
I can take this off and now that other

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:24.400 
I can take this off and now that other
ways<00:03:03.940> too

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:44.600 

Oh

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.040 

I'll<00:03:45.610> pick<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:45.850> away<00:03:46.120> for<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> second<00:03:46.840> what<00:03:47.020> I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
I'll pick it away for a second what I

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.690 
I'll pick it away for a second what I
wanted<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.530> demonstrate<00:03:48.040> here<00:03:48.250> though<00:03:48.430> was

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
wanted to demonstrate here though was

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.720 
wanted to demonstrate here though was
this<00:03:49.140> this<00:03:50.140> circuit<00:03:50.560> will<00:03:50.740> self<00:03:51.070> oscillate

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
this this circuit will self oscillate

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.180 
this this circuit will self oscillate
and<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:52.750> notice<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.080> motors<00:03:53.410> not<00:03:53.590> even<00:03:53.920> there

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
and you notice the motors not even there

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.510 
and you notice the motors not even there
and<00:03:54.490> it<00:03:54.850> will<00:03:54.910> self<00:03:55.210> oscillate<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.440> make<00:03:57.280> this

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
and it will self oscillate and make this

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.080 
and it will self oscillate and make this
real<00:03:57.940> nice<00:03:58.300> back<00:03:58.750> EMF<00:03:59.170> voltage<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.910> did

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
real nice back EMF voltage and I did

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.690 
real nice back EMF voltage and I did
like<00:04:01.330> this<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:01.960> it'll<00:04:02.740> it'll<00:04:03.040> go<00:04:03.250> on<00:04:03.430> down

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
like this and it'll it'll go on down

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.750 
like this and it'll it'll go on down
there<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.030> still<00:04:04.570> hold<00:04:04.900> light<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.320> about<00:04:05.980> 30

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
there and still hold light it about 30

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.120 
there and still hold light it about 30
milliamps<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:07.810> running<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.380> motors<00:04:08.770> way<00:04:08.980> up

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
milliamps and running the motors way up

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.810 
milliamps and running the motors way up
there<00:04:09.370> around<00:04:09.670> 70<00:04:10.570> milliamps<00:04:10.990> on<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.680> five<00:04:12.550> volt

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
there around 70 milliamps on a five volt

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.020 
there around 70 milliamps on a five volt
source<00:04:13.240> and<00:04:13.660> then<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.620> neon<00:04:14.830> comes<00:04:15.370> on<00:04:15.580> get

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
source and then that neon comes on get

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.560 
source and then that neon comes on get
it<00:04:16.150> up<00:04:16.239> too<00:04:16.450> bright<00:04:16.750> here<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:19.180> had<00:04:19.330> a<00:04:19.360> lot<00:04:19.540> of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
it up too bright here but I had a lot of

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.180 
it up too bright here but I had a lot of
fun<00:04:19.840> with<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.170> this<00:04:20.410> was<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> lot<00:04:20.830> of<00:04:20.860> fun<00:04:21.070> to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
fun with this this was a lot of fun to

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.490 
fun with this this was a lot of fun to
play<00:04:21.220> around<00:04:21.640> with<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.180> make<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.140> little<00:04:23.320> a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
play around with and make it a little a

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.830 
play around with and make it a little a
pulse<00:04:23.950> motor<00:04:24.250> like<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:24.700> was<00:04:24.910> fun<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:28.660> have

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
pulse motor like this was fun you have

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.600 
pulse motor like this was fun you have
to<00:04:28.990> have<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.290> at<00:04:29.410> just<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.800> right<00:04:29.920> frequency<00:04:29.980> R

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
to have it at just the right frequency R

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:46.600 
to have it at just the right frequency R
this<00:04:30.790> thing<00:04:31.000> won't<00:04:31.150> run

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.279 

anyway<00:04:47.610> that's<00:04:47.789> my<00:04:48.060> display<00:04:48.509> for<00:04:48.750> today<00:04:49.050> this

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
anyway that's my display for today this

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.869 
anyway that's my display for today this
is<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.560> speaker<00:04:50.159> wire<00:04:50.460> pulse<00:04:51.300> motor<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:53.250> put

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
is the speaker wire pulse motor that put

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.110 
is the speaker wire pulse motor that put
together<00:04:54.000> off<00:04:54.479> of<00:04:54.689> a<00:04:54.780> roll<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.229> speaker<00:04:55.650> wire

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
together off of a roll of speaker wire

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.740 
together off of a roll of speaker wire
that<00:04:57.120> was<00:04:57.300> fun

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
that was fun
