00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
about helping them we need to really

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.469 
about helping them we need to really

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
learn if we're going to and we will use

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.320 
learn if we're going to and we will use
these<00:02:11.900> new<00:02:12.260> materials<00:02:12.490> as<00:02:13.490> well<00:02:13.550> as<00:02:13.940> old<00:02:14.150> to

in<00:02:19.220> exactly<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> same<00:02:19.850> way<00:02:20.030> we<00:02:20.300> really<00:02:20.510> need

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
in exactly the same way we really need

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.330 
in exactly the same way we really need
to<00:02:20.690> understand<00:02:21.260> who<00:02:21.440> our<00:02:21.470> learners<00:02:21.890> are<00:02:22.040> my

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
to understand who our learners are my

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.160 
to understand who our learners are my
materials<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.150> meant<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.510> be<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.690> system

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
materials then I meant to be a system

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.220 
materials then I meant to be a system
that<00:02:24.490> replaces<00:02:25.490> another<00:02:25.730> system<00:02:26.209> or<00:02:26.600> even<00:02:27.080> any

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
that replaces another system or even any

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.290 
that replaces another system or even any
method<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.070> would<00:02:28.220> call<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.430> an<00:02:28.580> approach<00:02:28.970> and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
method I would call it an approach and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.290 
method I would call it an approach and
especially<00:02:30.220> approach<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.430> materials<00:02:31.970> design

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
especially approach to materials design

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.410 
especially approach to materials design
that<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:33.739> teachers<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.400> use<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:35.000> build<00:02:35.180> on

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that then teachers to use to build on

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.690 
that then teachers to use to build on
and<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:36.350> other<00:02:36.470> things<00:02:36.590> with<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.220> past<00:02:37.370> I
