observed even in the presence of client

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.000 
observed even in the presence of client
match<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.630> hence<00:03:58.930> we<00:03:59.110> can<00:03:59.140> conclude<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.740> a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
match and hence we can conclude that a

my<00:04:06.730> question<00:04:07.090> for<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.360> is<00:04:07.660> there<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.140> need<00:04:08.410> for

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
my question for you is there a need for

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.920 
my question for you is there a need for
client<00:04:08.920> match<00:04:09.100> now<00:04:09.850> for<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.180> second<00:04:10.540> test<00:04:10.720> we

client match now for the second test we

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.020 
client match now for the second test we
will<00:04:11.080> use<00:04:11.230> iPad<00:04:11.770> to<00:04:11.980> verify<00:04:12.400> whether<00:04:12.580> client

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
will use iPad to verify whether client

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.360 
will use iPad to verify whether client
match<00:04:13.180> offers<00:04:13.690> any<00:04:13.960> help<00:04:14.290> in<00:04:14.560> triggering<00:04:15.010> the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.730 
with our iPad from roommate to room be
as<00:04:57.270> expected<00:04:58.270> we<00:04:58.480> are<00:04:58.750> observing<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.320> drop<00:04:59.560> in

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
as expected we are observing the drop in

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.710 
as expected we are observing the drop in
pain<00:04:59.950> traffic<00:05:00.400> during<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.730> room<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:01.510> let's

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
pain traffic during the room so let's

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.440 
pain traffic during the room so let's
wait<00:05:01.930> for<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.260> Pink's<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.800> return<00:05:03.210> well<00:05:04.210> the

wait for the Pink's to return well the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.180 
wait for the Pink's to return well the
pink<00:05:04.690> traffic<00:05:05.020> has<00:05:05.170> now<00:05:05.320> resumed<00:05:05.770> so<00:05:06.010> let's

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
pink traffic has now resumed so let's

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.950 
pink traffic has now resumed so let's
verify<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.610> current<00:05:06.970> Association<00:05:07.660> of<00:05:07.780> the

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
verify the current Association of the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.920 
verify the current Association of the
iPad<00:05:08.320> from<00:05:08.590> controller<00:05:09.100> console<00:05:09.780> from<00:05:10.780> the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
iPad from controller console from the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.780 
iPad from controller console from the
client<00:05:11.140> match<00:05:11.410> database<00:05:11.950> we<00:05:12.250> can<00:05:12.430> see<00:05:12.640> that

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
client match database we can see that

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.510 
client match database we can see that
iPad<00:05:13.210> has<00:05:13.330> moved<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.780> access<00:05:14.169> point<00:05:14.500> in<00:05:14.740> room<00:05:15.280> B

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
iPad has moved to access point in room B

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.150 
iPad has moved to access point in room B
but<00:05:16.210> from<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.570> client<00:05:16.810> roaming<00:05:17.230> history<00:05:17.650> we

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
but from the client roaming history we

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.950 
but from the client roaming history we
can<00:05:18.370> see<00:05:18.610> that<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:18.910> reason<00:05:19.360> for<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:19.690> move

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
can see that the reason for this move

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.740 
can see that the reason for this move
was<00:05:20.530> triggered<00:05:20.980> by<00:05:21.010> iPad<00:05:21.669> itself<00:05:22.150> by<00:05:22.450> Diaw

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
was triggered by iPad itself by Diaw

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.350 
was triggered by iPad itself by Diaw
vacating<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.890> from<00:05:24.190> roommate<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:24.820> then

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
vacating it from roommate and then

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.020 
vacating it from roommate and then
associating<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.260> room<00:05:26.470> be<00:05:26.680> kind<00:05:27.490> match<00:05:27.730> did

associating the room be kind match did

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.840 
associating the room be kind match did
not<00:05:28.270> play<00:05:28.570> any<00:05:28.840> role<00:05:29.230> in<00:05:29.290> helping<00:05:29.890> iPad<00:05:30.460> during

not play any role in helping iPad during
this<00:05:31.000> move<00:05:31.270> like<00:05:31.780> it<00:05:31.990> did<00:05:32.169> for<00:05:32.200> samsung<00:05:32.800> galaxy

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
this move like it did for samsung galaxy

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.360 
this move like it did for samsung galaxy
tab<00:05:33.780> based<00:05:34.780> on<00:05:34.960> our<00:05:35.080> test<00:05:35.320> results<00:05:35.830> we<00:05:36.220> can

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
tab based on our test results we can

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.660 
tab based on our test results we can
conclude<00:05:36.640> that<00:05:36.970> client<00:05:37.330> match

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
conclude that client match

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.110 
conclude that client match
is<00:05:37.760> not<00:05:38.030> agnostic<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:39.020> mobile<00:05:39.380> device<00:05:39.740> type

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
is not agnostic of mobile device type
