when I heard about reverse charades and
the<00:00:54.480> idea<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.110> simple<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.430> one

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the idea this is simple is that one

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
the idea this is simple is that one
person<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> guesser<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> team<00:00:58.770> acts

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
person is the guesser and the team acts

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.860 
person is the guesser and the team acts
out<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.420> thing<00:01:01.460> there<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.579> changing<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.390> minor

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
out the thing there is changing a minor

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
out the thing there is changing a minor
detail<00:01:04.260> that's<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> matter<00:01:05.189> much

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
