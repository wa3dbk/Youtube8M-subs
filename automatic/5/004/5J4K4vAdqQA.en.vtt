00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
anyway this is a condenser microphone

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.760 
anyway this is a condenser microphone
I'm<00:01:15.930> gonna<00:01:16.080> try<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> talk<00:01:16.650> about

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I'm gonna try not to talk about

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.929 
I'm gonna try not to talk about
microphones<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> whole<00:01:17.490> video<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
microphones the whole video because I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.520 
microphones the whole video because I
know<00:01:18.000> most<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.390> guys<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.470> care

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
know most of you guys really do not care

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.890 
know most of you guys really do not care
but<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.240> dynamic<00:01:21.509> microphone

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
but it's this is a dynamic microphone

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.160 
but it's this is a dynamic microphone
not<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> condenser<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:24.990> like

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
not a condenser so I have to be like

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
not a condenser so I have to be like
really<00:01:25.439> close<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> microphone<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
really close to the microphone so you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.590 
really close to the microphone so you
know<00:01:27.680> there's<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
know there's that and I think that it I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.210 
know there's that and I think that it I
think<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> sounds<00:01:31.170> better<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.650> that's<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
think it sounds better so that's to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.590 
think it sounds better so that's to
