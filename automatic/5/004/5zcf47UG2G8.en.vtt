very important step right here got the

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.670 
very important step right here got the
new<00:00:03.449> plugs<00:00:04.339> get<00:00:05.339> yourself<00:00:05.670> Canon<00:00:06.680> anti-seize

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
new plugs get yourself Canon anti-seize

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.790 
new plugs get yourself Canon anti-seize
I<00:00:07.980> bought<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:09.030> 22<00:00:09.570> years<00:00:09.840> ago<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.320> it's

everything yeah you don't want these

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.590 
everything yeah you don't want these
plugs<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:16.460> basically<00:00:17.460> get<00:00:17.730> too<00:00:17.880> hot<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.210> bake

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
plugs to basically get too hot and bake

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.140 
plugs to basically get too hot and bake
themselves<00:00:18.810> into<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.380> aluminum<00:00:19.740> head<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.160> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
themselves into that aluminum head and a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.570 
themselves into that aluminum head and a
little<00:00:21.689> bit<00:00:21.900> will<00:00:21.990> do<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.369> let's<00:00:23.369> put<00:00:23.550> a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
little bit will do you let's put a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.150 
little bit will do you let's put a
little<00:00:23.670> bit<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> spark<00:00:24.269> plug<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.130> I'm<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
little bit on the spark plug and I'm a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.830 
little bit on the spark plug and I'm a
little<00:00:26.519> anal<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.210> take<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.420> finger<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
little anal so I just take my finger and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.330 
little anal so I just take my finger and
kind<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.199> roll<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.410> around<00:00:28.500> keep<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> off<00:00:29.310> the

kind of roll it around keep it off the
tip<00:00:29.640> keep<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.330> off<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> very<00:00:30.840> end<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:32.180> should

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
tip keep it off the very end that should

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.240 
tip keep it off the very end that should

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
do it right there just make all four

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.520 
do it right there just make all four
plugs<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> you're<00:00:36.210> good<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> go

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
showed you guys on how to get the plug

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.119 
showed you guys on how to get the plug
out<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.260> same<00:00:40.500> way<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> put<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
out the same way I'm going to put it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.430 
out the same way I'm going to put it
back<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.460> put<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> plug<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> end<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
back in put that a plug on the end of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.290 
back in put that a plug on the end of
the<00:00:43.500> hose<00:00:44.030> drop<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> down<00:00:45.300> into<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> cylinder

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
the hose drop it down into the cylinder

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.430 
the hose drop it down into the cylinder
finger<00:00:48.300> tight<00:00:50.090> see<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.140> turn<00:00:52.320> it

till it stops pull the rubber hose off
go<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> next<00:01:02.579> plug<00:01:03.320> do<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> same<00:01:04.680> thing

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
go to the next plug do the same thing

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.660 
go to the next plug do the same thing
drop<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.240> there<00:01:06.390> till<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.630> gets<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.960> center

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
drop it in there till it gets the center

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.250 
drop it in there till it gets the center

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
retail street value is see how that sits

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.540 
retail street value is see how that sits
in<00:02:22.540> there<00:02:22.660> real<00:02:22.810> nice<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:24.040> then<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.220> get<00:02:24.430> your

and that's going to keep the oil from

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.250 
and that's going to keep the oil from
going<00:02:31.060> down<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.600> saw<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.050> number

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
going down and like you saw that number

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.680 
going down and like you saw that number
three<00:02:32.650> cylinder<00:02:33.160> was<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.730> coated<00:02:34.330> with<00:02:34.480> oil

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
three cylinder was just coated with oil

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.570 
three cylinder was just coated with oil
so<00:02:35.620> we're<00:02:35.739> going<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> let<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.130> sit<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.519> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
so we're going to let this sit in the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.780 
so we're going to let this sit in the
Sun<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:38.170> kind<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.530> fit<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.580> there<00:02:39.760> and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790

down<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.130> remaining<00:02:51.610> bolts<00:02:52.420> put<00:02:53.319> your<00:02:53.560> coil

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
down the remaining bolts put your coil

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.370 
down the remaining bolts put your coil
packs<00:02:54.280> back<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> spark<00:02:55.060> plugs<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:55.569> once

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
packs back on the spark plugs and once

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.809 
packs back on the spark plugs and once
we<00:02:56.500> get<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.680> coil<00:02:56.890> packs<00:02:57.130> back<00:02:57.340> on<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.580> spark

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
we get the coil packs back on the spark

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.420 
we get the coil packs back on the spark
plugs<00:02:58.090> will<00:02:59.080> fire<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.830> thing<00:02:59.890> up<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.250> check

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
plugs will fire this thing up and check

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.059 
plugs will fire this thing up and check
for<00:03:00.459> leaks<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.269> we're<00:03:01.510> about<00:03:01.600> 95%<00:03:02.470> done<00:03:02.530> really

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
for leaks so we're about 95% done really
