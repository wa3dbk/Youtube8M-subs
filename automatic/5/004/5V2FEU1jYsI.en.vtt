00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
and I think that was two weeks ago and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.540 
and I think that was two weeks ago and
at<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.810> point<00:00:24.840> during<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.410> day<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.830> had<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
two top comments and I thought I'd just

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.660

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.000 
account um about 50 of those 52 probably
60<00:05:13.449> somewhere<00:05:14.449> in<00:05:14.570> there<00:05:14.720> were<00:05:15.080> just

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
60 somewhere in there were just

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.909 
60 somewhere in there were just
disconnects<00:05:16.930> where<00:05:17.930> my<00:05:18.139> internet<00:05:18.500> will<00:05:18.590> drop

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
disconnects where my internet will drop

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.260 
disconnects where my internet will drop
and<00:05:19.220> then<00:05:19.310> it'll<00:05:19.490> just<00:05:19.729> kick<00:05:19.880> me<00:05:19.940> out<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.150> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
and then it'll just kick me out of the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.029 
and then it'll just kick me out of the
game<00:05:20.449> or<00:05:20.720> it'll<00:05:20.870> do<00:05:21.020> that<00:05:21.199> like<00:05:21.500> waiting<00:05:21.860> for

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
game or it'll do that like waiting for

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.830 
game or it'll do that like waiting for
players<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.460> it<00:05:22.729> will<00:05:22.820> count<00:05:22.970> down<00:05:23.120> from<00:05:23.360> 19

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
players and it will count down from 19

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.279 
players and it will count down from 19
or<00:05:24.080> whatever<00:05:25.750> so<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.810> was<00:05:26.900> really<00:05:26.990> excited

or whatever so I was really excited

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.890 
or whatever so I was really excited
about<00:05:27.530> not<00:05:27.830> lagging<00:05:28.310> out<00:05:28.430> anymore<00:05:28.729> to<00:05:29.120> see<00:05:29.300> if

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
about not lagging out anymore to see if

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.610 
about not lagging out anymore to see if
my<00:05:30.410> connection<00:05:31.070> would<00:05:31.990> allow<00:05:32.990> me<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.320> play<00:05:33.500> for

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
my connection would allow me to play for

my connection would allow me to play for
longer<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.250> that's<00:05:34.490> something<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:35.000> hope

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
longer and that's something that I hope

with the Lakers they're not that great
from<00:06:45.500> the<00:06:45.590> free-throw<00:06:45.800> line<00:06:45.980> at<00:06:46.250> all<00:06:46.370> i<00:06:46.610> think

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
from the free-throw line at all i think

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.110 
from the free-throw line at all i think
kobe<00:06:48.200> and<00:06:48.230> pau<00:06:48.530> gasol<00:06:49.160> are<00:06:49.310> like<00:06:49.460> the<00:06:49.610> best<00:06:49.790> and

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
kobe and pau gasol are like the best and

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.760 
kobe and pau gasol are like the best and
I'm<00:06:50.450> don't<00:06:50.960> quote<00:06:51.140> me<00:06:51.320> on<00:06:51.350> this<00:06:51.440> but<00:06:51.590> I<00:06:51.740> think

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
I'm don't quote me on this but I think

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.510 
I'm don't quote me on this but I think
their<00:06:52.070> free<00:06:52.340> throws<00:06:52.370> are<00:06:52.670> like<00:06:52.880> 80<00:06:53.150> 85<00:06:54.520> their

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
their free throws are like 80 85 their

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.300 
their free throws are like 80 85 their
little<00:06:55.730> ratings<00:06:56.240> or<00:06:56.390> whatever<00:06:56.630> and<00:06:57.560> I<00:06:58.040> still

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
little ratings or whatever and I still

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.830 
little ratings or whatever and I still
managed<00:06:58.580> to<00:06:58.610> go<00:06:58.790> ninety<00:06:59.240> percent<00:06:59.420> from<00:06:59.720> the

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
managed to go ninety percent from the

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.270 
managed to go ninety percent from the
free-throw<00:07:00.050> line<00:07:00.200> out<00:07:00.530> of<00:07:00.650> like<00:07:00.830> I<00:07:00.980> think<00:07:01.190> a

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
free-throw line out of like I think a

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.700 
free-throw line out of like I think a
thousand<00:07:01.760> free<00:07:01.940> throws<00:07:02.180> I<00:07:02.390> think<00:07:02.870> I'm<00:07:02.930> a<00:07:03.020> 900

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
thousand free throws I think I'm a 900

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.250 
thousand free throws I think I'm a 900
of<00:07:03.830> a<00:07:03.890> thousand<00:07:04.660> so<00:07:05.660> that's<00:07:05.990> something<00:07:06.140> to

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
of a thousand so that's something to

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.170 
of a thousand so that's something to
