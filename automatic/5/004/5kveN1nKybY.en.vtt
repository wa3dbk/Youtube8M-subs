00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
viewing angles and everything so

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
viewing angles and everything so
basically<00:01:39.540> take<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> cover<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> fold<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
back and there you have stand very

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.520 
back and there you have stand very
simple<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:44.310> first<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:45.320> conspicuous<00:01:46.320> about

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
simple at first I was conspicuous about

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
simple at first I was conspicuous about
this<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.070> wondering<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.090> would<00:01:48.450> actually

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
this and wondering if it would actually

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.260 
this and wondering if it would actually
hold<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:50.430> seems<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.180> be

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
hold because it seems that it would be

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.179 
hold because it seems that it would be
