bigger and a little more square and he's

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.170 
bigger and a little more square and he's
gonna<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:32.669> ahead<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:33.960> behind<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> wall

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
gonna go ahead one by behind the wall

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
gonna go ahead one by behind the wall
what<00:00:36.180> he's<00:00:36.300> doing<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.750> easy<00:00:36.930> creating<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.969> sort

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
what he's doing is easy creating a sort

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
what he's doing is easy creating a sort
of<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.270> half<00:00:39.840> stud<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> drywall<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> school

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
of a half stud for the drywall to school

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.240 
of a half stud for the drywall to school
so<00:00:42.480> he's<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.469> ahead<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.920> he's<00:00:44.070> going

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so he's going to go ahead and he's going

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.799 
so he's going to go ahead and he's going
to<00:00:44.309> screw<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> piece<00:00:45.059> into<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> existing

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to screw that piece into the existing

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.319 
to screw that piece into the existing
drywall<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.430> he's<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> create<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
drywall and then he's going to create a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.619 
drywall and then he's going to create a
small<00:00:48.660> pass<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.289> he<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.590> sit<00:00:49.829> into<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.640> so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
small pass and he can sit into that so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
small pass and he can sit into that so
this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.129> pretty<00:00:53.370> cool<00:00:53.579> way<00:00:53.640> of

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
this is a this is a pretty cool way of

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
this is a this is a pretty cool way of
patching<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.360> off<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> small<00:00:55.320> hole

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
patching them off you have a small hole

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
patching them off you have a small hole
and<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.800> don't<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> demo<00:00:56.460> open<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and you don't want to demo open the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:11.630 
and you don't want to demo open the
whole<00:00:57.149> wall<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> patch<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.050> ring<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> what

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
whole wall to patch the ring so what

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
whole wall to patch the ring so what
he's<00:01:11.790> done<00:01:12.030> right<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> he's<00:01:12.600> created<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
he's done right there is he's created a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.719 
he's done right there is he's created a
brace<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.100> wood<00:01:14.689> against<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> drywall

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
brace of wood against the drywall

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
brace of wood against the drywall
supported<00:01:17.729> by<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> drywall<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.840> screw<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
supported by the drywall to screw in a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:02:23.050 
supported by the drywall to screw in a
small<00:01:19.920> patch

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.420 

see<00:02:24.060> that's<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> mess<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.349> basic<00:02:25.680> idea<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.099> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
see that's the mess of basic idea is you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.490 
see that's the mess of basic idea is you
go<00:02:26.610> ahead<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:26.970> would<00:02:27.360> screw<00:02:27.720> one<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.290> one

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
go ahead and would screw one in on one

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.580 
go ahead and would screw one in on one
side<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:30.049> lipless<00:02:31.049> threw<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.440> into

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
side and I have a lipless threw it into

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:43.490 
side and I have a lipless threw it into
the<00:02:31.769> other<00:02:31.920> side<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:43.019> one<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.319> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the other side to this is one of the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.380 
the other side to this is one of the
ways<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.920> patching<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:46.170> way
