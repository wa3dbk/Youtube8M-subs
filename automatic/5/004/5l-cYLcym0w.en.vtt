00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.580
 the is designed now they were once 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.710
 sheets of newspapers magazines or boxes of 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.500
 cardboard that they have become 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.100
 striking materials of unique textures 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.230
 whose light beams and give them and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.829
 they make up the first line of accessories 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.140
 of recycled paper in this country I like 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.899
 that is maintained as is the material that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.210
 you look for the material as such that 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.840
 all my accounts are not uniform no no 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.910
 it's like a machine let's say no more than 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.579
 accessories with identity is the name of 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.679
 this collection that has more than one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.900
 Thirty original designs 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.810
 Various textures and colors 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.690
 also rescue the spinning and weaving of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.330
 something more free paper not the colors that 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.340
 that flow we have celestial reds will make 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.170
 so I think that nowadays 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.970
 you can use at any time of the year 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.370
 fashion has changed a lot 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.340
 evolved a lot is part of what 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.200
 I think it allows you to be freer but 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.380
 the value that labor gives to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.160
 these beautiful pieces encloses a series 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.200
 of natural secrets and homemade recipes 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.200
 like the paste that were already 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.920
 used in the 17th century and that the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.619
 make more valuable the paste is one is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.280
 one as a kind of porridge that 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.200
 we call night of flour with water and a 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.630
 little sugar I do not complain basic with what 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.830
 which is used to make papier-mâché 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.729
 accessories that connect us with the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 nature and they impregnate us with their aromas 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.460
 like this necklace designed in shell 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.320
 cocoa that envelops us with its fragrance 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.190
 chocolate besides being a proposal 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.080
 so rich in textures in colors 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.530
 obviously rescued 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.810
 the idea of ​​recycling to propose us 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.900
 reuse the materials although it is so 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.939
 important today 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.650
 whenever I have some jewel of it 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.720
 people ask me why materials 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.849
 because it also does not look like the material that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.040
 it's because of the treatment he already gives him and 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.090
 design discovers those of the jewel not 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.010
 the paper is my thing I think that really 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.109
 always swimming by working with paper 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.159
 it's something that I like I enjoy it a lot and 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:47.859
 it has become part of my life creations 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.159
 that make paper a symphony of 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:54.280
 colors textures and designs that charge 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.930
 life in a woman's body and they give her 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.400
 more life to our planet for cnn 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.400
