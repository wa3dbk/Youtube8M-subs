for<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:33.719> tasks<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.290> should<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.739> fine

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
for my tasks it should be just fine

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
for my tasks it should be just fine
as<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.570> quite<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.140> bit<00:00:37.440> smaller

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739

than the rat one another thing that I
seen<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:43.230> people<00:00:43.530> aren't<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:43.770> showing<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
seen the people aren't really showing is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.709 
seen the people aren't really showing is
the<00:00:44.340> skyline<00:00:44.640> that's<00:00:45.030> probably<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:45.420> favorite

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719

matches<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:48.719> well<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> Ontario

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
thing I did notice with this particular

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.890 
thing I did notice with this particular
knife<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.909> lockup<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.600> I'm

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
knife is that the the lockup is I'm

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 
knife is that the the lockup is I'm
saying<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.320> pretty<00:01:25.740> late<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> box

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
saying is pretty late for out the box

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
saying is pretty late for out the box
right<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.409> looks<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.829> per<00:01:28.950> inch

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
right there it looks like it's per inch

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.890 
right there it looks like it's per inch
half<00:01:29.280> way<00:01:30.470> but<00:01:31.470> actually<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.070> person<00:01:32.900> it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
half way but actually in person it's

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
half way but actually in person it's
actually<00:01:34.380> getting<00:01:34.560> pretty<00:01:34.770> close<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.430> end

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
actually getting pretty close to the end

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.440 
actually getting pretty close to the end
compared<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> my<00:01:37.020> rat<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.790> which<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> pretty

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
compared to my rat one which is pretty

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
compared to my rat one which is pretty
much<00:01:39.600> I'd<00:01:39.869> say<00:01:39.900> about<00:01:40.259> early<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.829> medium

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
much I'd say about early to medium

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.749 
much I'd say about early to medium
lockup<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> guess<00:01:43.829> small<00:01:44.159> medium<00:01:44.610> duty

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
lockup but for I guess small medium duty

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.280 
lockup but for I guess small medium duty
tasks<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> think<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.720> should<00:01:45.899> pretty<00:01:46.079> much<00:01:46.200> be

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
tasks I think that should pretty much be

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.120 
tasks I think that should pretty much be
fine<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.579> here's<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:47.820> another<00:01:48.000> quick

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
fine so here's just another quick

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.830 
fine so here's just another quick

blur<00:01:59.430> thrown<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.909> there<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.329> better

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
blur thrown in there just for better

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.580 
blur thrown in there just for better
reference<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.520> quick<00:02:02.759> overview

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
reference this is just my quick overview

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.399 
reference this is just my quick overview
I<00:02:04.590> say<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.399> handle<00:02:05.820> material<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.140> grip

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
I say the handle material and the grip

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.420 
I say the handle material and the grip
I'd<00:02:07.860> say<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.250> actually<00:02:09.379> really<00:02:10.379> good<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:11.039> such

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
I'd say is actually really good for such

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.860 
I'd say is actually really good for such
a<00:02:11.459> small<00:02:11.790> blade

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
a small blade

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.420 
a small blade
course<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.260> rat<00:02:13.440> one<00:02:13.680> being<00:02:13.950> bigger<00:02:14.220> and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
course the rat one being bigger and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.949 
course the rat one being bigger and
wider<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:15.000> fits<00:02:15.450> your<00:02:15.569> hand<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.290> well<00:02:17.959> I'd

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
wider just fits your hand so well I'd

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.710 
wider just fits your hand so well I'd
say<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> rat<00:02:19.500> two<00:02:19.709> compared<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.159> the<00:02:20.250> skyline

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
say the rat two compared to the skyline

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.580 
say the rat two compared to the skyline
which<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.840> haven't<00:02:21.989> seen<00:02:22.170> anywhere<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
which I haven't seen anywhere the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.809 
which I haven't seen anywhere the
skyline<00:02:22.980> I'd<00:02:23.819> say<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.360> terms<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.049> the

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
skyline I'd say in terms of the the

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.460 
skyline I'd say in terms of the the
handle<00:02:26.819> material<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.900> winds<00:02:28.170> just

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
handle material it just of winds just

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.440 
handle material it just of winds just
because<00:02:28.799> of<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.909> good<00:02:30.120> traction

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
because of that a really good traction

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.740 
because of that a really good traction
g2<00:02:31.019> but<00:02:32.239> with<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.480> jimping<00:02:35.450> right<00:02:36.450> there<00:02:36.659> on

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
g2 but with that jimping right there on

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.259 
g2 but with that jimping right there on
that<00:02:36.870> rat<00:02:37.140> -<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.829> just<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.459> finger

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
that rat - it's just and that finger

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.259 
that rat - it's just and that finger
choil<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:40.040> think<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.129> get<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> really<00:02:41.610> firm<00:02:42.000> lock

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
choil I think you get a really firm lock

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.339 
choil I think you get a really firm lock
up<00:02:43.489> especially<00:02:44.489> even<00:02:45.180> though<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.629> say<00:02:46.109> if<00:02:46.230> your

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
up especially even though I say if your

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.630 
up especially even though I say if your
hands<00:02:46.500> were<00:02:46.650> wet<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:47.129> might<00:02:47.280> cause<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> problem

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
hands were wet it might cause a problem

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.890 
hands were wet it might cause a problem
but<00:02:49.160> overall<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.579> think<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.390> rat<00:02:51.540> choosing<00:02:51.840> to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
but overall I think the rat choosing to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.539 
but overall I think the rat choosing to
be<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> solid<00:02:52.290> winner<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.739> don't<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.489> a

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
be a solid winner I don't have a

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.210 
be a solid winner I don't have a
tenacious<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.650> rat<00:02:55.799> two<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.069> definitely

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
tenacious but the rat two is definitely

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.830 
tenacious but the rat two is definitely
going<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.579> be<00:02:56.640> replacing<00:02:57.120> my<00:02:57.209> scaling<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.780> my

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
going to be replacing my scaling and my

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.550 
going to be replacing my scaling and my
EDC<00:02:58.140> rotation<00:02:59.959> probably<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.140> next<00:03:01.379> week

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
EDC rotation probably for the next week

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.380 
EDC rotation probably for the next week
or<00:03:01.680> two<00:03:01.739> until<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.370> get<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.730> better<00:03:02.879> feel<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.150> it

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
or two until I get a better feel of it

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.869 
or two until I get a better feel of it
but<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.079> hope<00:03:04.170> you'll<00:03:04.349> like<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.609> hope<00:03:05.609> this<00:03:05.760> was

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
but I hope you'll like it hope this was

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.119 
but I hope you'll like it hope this was
a<00:03:05.909> good<00:03:06.120> comparison<00:03:06.739> better<00:03:07.739> than<00:03:07.859> other<00:03:07.980> ones

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
a good comparison better than other ones

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.940 
a good comparison better than other ones
I've<00:03:08.310> seen<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.700> far<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.269> if<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.409> liked<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.829> hit

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
I've seen so far and if you liked it hit

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.039 
I've seen so far and if you liked it hit
like<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.489> hopefully<00:03:12.269> I'll<00:03:12.569> make<00:03:12.840> some<00:03:13.019> more

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
like and hopefully I'll make some more

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.040 
like and hopefully I'll make some more
video<00:03:13.379> soon<00:03:13.440> thanks
