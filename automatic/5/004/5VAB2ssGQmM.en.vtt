in<00:00:35.430> my<00:00:35.640> opinion<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.300> album<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.960> much<00:00:37.410> lighter

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
in my opinion this album is much lighter

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
in my opinion this album is much lighter
and<00:00:38.280> more<00:00:40.100> experimental<00:00:41.100> than<00:00:41.719> previous

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and more experimental than previous

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
and more experimental than previous
albums<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:44.070> shows<00:00:44.340> another<00:00:44.579> side

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
is the puppy track of the album in my

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.809 
is the puppy track of the album in my
opinion<00:04:45.479> um<00:04:45.779> and<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.979> uses<00:04:47.580> brass

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
opinion um and it uses brass

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.369 
opinion um and it uses brass
it's<00:04:48.569> great<00:04:48.659> it<00:04:48.840> makes<00:04:48.990> me<00:04:49.169> want<00:04:49.349> to

the<00:06:58.110> singing<00:06:58.320> style<00:06:58.680> it<00:06:58.830> was<00:06:58.950> a<00:06:58.980> little<00:06:59.220> weird

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
the singing style it was a little weird

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.460 
the singing style it was a little weird
I'm<00:06:59.790> used<00:07:00.000> to<00:07:00.060> it<00:07:00.210> now<00:07:00.240> to<00:07:00.420> great<00:07:00.810> track<00:07:01.080> I<00:07:01.260> just

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
I'm used to it now to great track I just

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.870 
I'm used to it now to great track I just
wanted<00:07:01.650> to<00:07:01.770> point<00:07:01.890> that<00:07:02.010> out<00:07:02.130> it's<00:07:02.670> not

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
wanted to point that out it's not

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.040 
wanted to point that out it's not
exactly<00:07:03.060> the<00:07:03.780> same<00:07:04.230> thing<00:07:04.680> um<00:07:04.950> and<00:07:06.020> overall<00:07:07.020> I

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
exactly the same thing um and overall I

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.020 
exactly the same thing um and overall I
think<00:07:07.230> this<00:07:07.470> album<00:07:07.890> is<00:07:07.980> a<00:07:08.550> dying<00:07:08.760> that

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
think this album is a dying that

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.570 
think this album is a dying that
a<00:07:09.090> tank<00:07:09.390> it's<00:07:10.380> better<00:07:10.710> than<00:07:10.890> ascension<00:07:11.340> in<00:07:11.460> my

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
a tank it's better than ascension in my

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.910 
a tank it's better than ascension in my
opinion<00:07:11.910> it<00:07:12.150> offers<00:07:12.480> more<00:07:12.750> all<00:07:13.140> essentially

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920 
opinion it offers more all essentially

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.070 
opinion it offers more all essentially
just<00:07:14.130> felt<00:07:14.340> a<00:07:14.490> little<00:07:14.610> bit<00:07:14.850> dark<00:07:15.240> it's<00:07:15.900> a<00:07:15.960> great

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
just felt a little bit dark it's a great

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.230 
just felt a little bit dark it's a great
album<00:07:16.320> don't<00:07:16.830> get<00:07:16.920> me<00:07:17.010> wrong<00:07:17.040> I<00:07:17.280> at<00:07:17.640> this<00:07:17.970> point

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
album don't get me wrong I at this point

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.660 
album don't get me wrong I at this point
it's<00:07:18.420> also<00:07:18.570> not<00:07:18.840> in<00:07:19.020> 10<00:07:19.290> I<00:07:19.500> grow<00:07:20.280> me<00:07:20.430> to<00:07:20.550> that

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
it's also not in 10 I grow me to that

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.170 
it's also not in 10 I grow me to that
point<00:07:20.850> but<00:07:21.660> I<00:07:21.990> think<00:07:22.860> dissensions<00:07:23.400> stronger

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
point but I think dissensions stronger

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.690 
point but I think dissensions stronger
