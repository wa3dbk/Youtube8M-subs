00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
service attack um

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.570 
service attack um
um<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.260> pretty<00:00:19.470> much<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:20.070> taking<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
um it's pretty much just taking up the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.420 
um it's pretty much just taking up the
resources<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.359> server<00:00:22.320> by<00:00:22.980> sending

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
resources of that server by sending

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
resources of that server by sending
packets<00:00:24.000> um<00:00:25.310> to<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.340> server<00:00:26.779> constantly<00:00:27.779> I'll

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
packets um to the server constantly I'll

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.890 
packets um to the server constantly I'll
show<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.010> guys<00:00:29.099> actually<00:00:29.340> how<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:30.269> done<00:00:30.480> or

show you guys actually how it's done or
one<00:00:31.710> method<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.099> how<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.340> done<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
one method of how it's done just go to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.840 
one method of how it's done just go to
command<00:00:33.600> prompt<00:00:34.520> um

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
command prompt um

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
command prompt um
and<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.420> you're<00:00:36.540> gonna<00:00:36.660> want<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> type<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and then you're gonna want to type it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.229 
and then you're gonna want to type it
ping<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> IP<00:00:38.460> address<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.030> want<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
ping and then the IP address you want to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.270 
ping and then the IP address you want to
send<00:00:39.450> these<00:00:39.540> packets<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.710> my<00:00:40.829> case<00:00:41.100> I'm

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
send these packets to in my case I'm

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.920 
send these packets to in my case I'm
just<00:00:41.550> gonna<00:00:41.640> use<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:41.879> local<00:00:42.210> computer<00:00:42.450> because

then<00:00:48.360> I'm<00:00:49.050> gonna<00:00:49.260> type<00:00:49.530> -<00:00:49.770> t<00:00:50.160> -<00:00:50.399> L<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
then I'm gonna type - t - L and then the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
then I'm gonna type - t - L and then the
amount<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.199> packet<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.980> bytes<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
amount of packet or bytes you want to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.260 
amount of packet or bytes you want to
send<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> server<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> let's<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:56.940> say

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.100 

25,000<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.899> now<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.680> pinging<00:01:02.420> my<00:01:03.420> computer

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
25,000 and now it's pinging my computer

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.940 
25,000 and now it's pinging my computer
20<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.369> sending<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.510> taking<00:01:07.409> twenty-five

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
20 it's sending and taking twenty-five

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.390 
20 it's sending and taking twenty-five
thousand<00:01:08.430> bytes<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:09.799> my<00:01:10.799> computer<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.310> my

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thousand bytes from my computer so my

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.590 
thousand bytes from my computer so my
internet<00:01:11.640> connection<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.150> gonna<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.390> very

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
internet connection is gonna be very

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.890 
internet connection is gonna be very
slow<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:15.000> look<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.509> takes

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
slow as you can see look it takes

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.340 
slow as you can see look it takes
forever<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:17.009> load<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.310> page<00:01:18.110> see<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.200> long

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
forever to load that page see how long

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.620 
forever to load that page see how long
that<00:01:19.590> took<00:01:19.710> now<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> cancel<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.030> load

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that took now if I cancel this and load

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.600 
that took now if I cancel this and load
it<00:01:21.750> again

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
it again

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.660 
it again
it<00:01:23.610> loads<00:01:23.790> much<00:01:24.240> faster<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:26.250> course<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it loads much faster so of course I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.340 
it loads much faster so of course I
could<00:01:26.820> increase<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.020> would<00:01:28.140> still

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
could increase that and that would still

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.789 
could increase that and that would still
my<00:01:28.439> connection<00:01:29.070> even<00:01:29.220> further<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.799> pretty

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
my connection even further so and pretty

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.870 
my connection even further so and pretty
much<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.369> did<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
much that's what they did to the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.690 
much that's what they did to the
minecraft.net<00:01:33.890> server<00:01:34.890> someone<00:01:35.490> did<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
minecraft.net server someone did that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
minecraft.net server someone did that
and<00:01:36.650> that<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.130> server<00:01:38.540> was<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> while

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and that the server was down for a while

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.100 
and that the server was down for a while
because<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.400> computer<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> was<00:01:42.630> taking

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
because that computer that was taking

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.810 
because that computer that was taking
all<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.439> memory<00:01:43.770> from<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:46.310> was<00:01:47.310> slowing<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
all that memory from it was slowing it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.499 
all that memory from it was slowing it
down<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:49.009> yeah<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.610> happened<00:01:51.000> the

down so yeah that's what happened the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.760 
down so yeah that's what happened the
