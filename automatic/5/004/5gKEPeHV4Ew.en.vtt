 pgw on the card detector and a new one 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.150
 against new domination match in the ground 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.430
 Attack mode are in the end I believe 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.320
 just got to the 90 kills but then 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 the hostie dashboard it's beer so 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 leave and this is the lobby 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.510
 crashed together and I could do it game 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.190
 not quite his games were at the end 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.050
 another three minutes to play so who is there 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.640
 Do not hurst out then it would be good and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.010
 gladly now and flowed become gameplay 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.719
 nonetheless 94 kills have become yes 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.700
 I want to tell you something about it later 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.170
 my channel and my career up 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.850
 now tell youtube yet 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.070
 faster here yet to the gameplay i 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.570
 I played as I said with the pbb that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.640
 fast magazine and decide 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.379
 whereupon the sexy gold camouflage as 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 I once have the goal four 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.609
 doing and killstreaks i play with that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.890
 orbital satellite so the blackbird then 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.329
 with the dogs and the swarm so mean 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.070
 recommendation from you when you are on 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.860
 highscore gameplays wanted to go through 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 he also rainha these killstreaks 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.610
 I also played very important 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.890
 in the first set with hardliner and ghost 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.540
 that means with these eyes that u2 perks 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.729
 do not put any first slot in the box 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 second spot with looters and im 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.630
 last hole with the tactic muscat us 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.820
 It also so my looters 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 That's why I always play it that way 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.689
 i have enough ammo that i have 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.579
 Just always sure that I can 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.479
 in my weapon enough ammunition off and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.070
 For example, if I am on one now 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.020
 gameplay with the pbb wants to go 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 I do not want to killzone after 56 others 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.229
 but have to pick up the weapon 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.430
 the weapon play because otherwise I can 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.140
 Also, do not say that it's a gameplay 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.610
 with the pgw is if i look after each one 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.110
 cancel the second child of the weapon 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.939
 that's why plunderers are just what 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.439
 It is really good that you like it here 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.759
 this is not the first goal here 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.079
 you just be c4 again and again 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.180
 can always refresh about such a 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.159
 raider paketieren runs and is in 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.390
 four again and again a new virus 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.549
 also really cool 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.530
 yes then with the tactics mask I have 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.540
 simply because of that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.130
 against bordering shop charges and against the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.990
 blender data is protected because of that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.490
 there is still a lot on this whole 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.690
 shock charges because you can not room 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 run in without being dazzled 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.260
 a braid is downright downright 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.880
 Always on the simple tactics 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.810
 she can pretty much do it 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.910
 defuse 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.470
 the knicks we also really radau 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.430
 made my wound under black and 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.080
 escalated properly 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.850
 I think I swan three times 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.200
 I am also reached here in my life 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.110
 do not see the excerpt here 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.730
 died would really be a great camp yet 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.320
 we would have been the three minutes on 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.850
 can still play the end and the horst 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.410
 changed out of the game then it would be 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.820
 it has become really a good hundred so 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.110
 I do not know whether scoreboard like 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.600
 times when the are opened I think 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.130
 80 90 money can be happy for me 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.140
 cell and write in the comments 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.480
 yes that should already be the gameplay 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.100
 have been more accurate now 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.290
 to my channel and what I do everything 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.390
 or what it is up to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.400
 I see my channel to see everything 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.380
 I've been here for about four months 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.970
 youtube represented with comments i 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.400
 Of course I started with the mw3 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.020
 Gameplay by default with fast 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.110
 moab she has to say in my 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.150
 channel are the good gameplays resp 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.410
 the highscore gameplays in the foreground 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.750
 that means I started with 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.450
 fast mavs with two to three minutes 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.030
 then with a series month with each 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.440
 weapon where I just humor with everyone 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.940
 weapon I could show the series 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.010
 200 all pass through because it's easy 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.270
 was not enough until the release of 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.890
 black ops 2 but then have the 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.330
 hottest and most important weapons shown 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.400
 where a bit harder for 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.840
 I always play so much 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.209
 a lot of fun what even then 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.090
 a very nice series with me was 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.010
 the series music gameplay so where I am 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.840
 just a gameplay a fast mo 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.640
 taken off so two minutes and then 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.560
 nice crisp music in the background 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.209
 so always arrived well arrived 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.310
 But the people are now the time 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.989
 from mw3 past 62 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.550
 outside and now it goes on with me 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.489
 with the black ops 2 gameplays and with 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.110
 The comment I bring mine so 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.980
 mainly the high score 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.110
 gameplaces means 90 90 kills in the 90's 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.610
 mostly then 100 river gameplays with 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.130
 commentary I usually play mostly 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.750
 solo in the ground attack and yes if you 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.950
 good round doing it, I invite that 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.690
 all too high the score 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.610
 gameplays maybe there are times 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.840
 no matter how expensive gameplays if I have something 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.130
 have a short time with music 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.540
 maybe in the background like that 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.190
 but sometimes change in the foreground 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.140
 but are the highscore chemnitz with 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.940
 my comments behind it 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.910
 another series started called that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.370
 gold home that means I show everyone 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.600
 Gold weapon a gameplay in the west one 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.980
 good score or a gameplay 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.350
 excerpt the whole I have now but 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.850
 converted into the series therefore can 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.330
 maybe it releases in black ops 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.860
 the diamond the diamond clue if you can 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.169
 in an arms class for example 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.840
 Everything says machines has all about gold 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.280
 then automatically get the diamond 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.919
 I know and I want it all right away 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.110
 put that with many or with all 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.940
 Diamond weapons show new gameplay and 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.440
 then tips and tricks you with 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.090
 On the way I give with the weapons 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.560
 game what you have to do to get highscores 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.000
 to reach or how the weapon easy 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.440
 best to play is what network 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.660
 meaningful on the weapon just such 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.370
 give tips with the sexy diamond clue 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.419
 the really cool is really really cool 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.560
 but looks like I may have been 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.480
 A weapon on diamond closer 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.280
 Enroll if the weapons are on gold 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.660
 plays as he says he always plays with 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.190
 the five same weapons always 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.780
 this is not a bit different here 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.610
 always exactly the same weapon game but 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.930
 but almost always the same weapons 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.340
 but plays a bit diversified 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.870
 get in and that's what you want 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.510
 really make every weapon friend now 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.820
 then going on diamond new 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.110
 not really interested and has 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.640
 I also look real when you with me 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.080
 it's a bit like watching over 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.400
 the sense of a guest commentary me 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.020
 Thank you again, of course 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.880

 looks over as I said with me there 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.620
 of course the black ops two gameplay 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.430
 what will come in the foreground now 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.919
 stand 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.240
 and yes that was already me to me 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.770
 say goodbye to me the gameplay 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.210
 Do not go a little bit , I put it 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.290
 the whole thing with music so maybe 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.610
 I have seen on my channel again 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.479
 I definitely enjoyed myself 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.790
 to introduce here 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.280
