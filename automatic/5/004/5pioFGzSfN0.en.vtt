 6 half horsepower gasoline engine 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.880
 four stroke fuel valve opened 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.900
 shut down and the same air leak 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:26.820
 closed the opening of the oil filter 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:30.320
 Minimum Maximum 10 times from its young 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.320
 between maxim oil level 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.470
 foam rubber ordinary foam rubber to remove dust 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:01:10.650

 1 and 2 ordinary cap 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.759
 lush you can fill your race went 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.759
 there 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.450
 so even less have maximum overboard 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.840
 engine 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.310
 minimum batch will be maximum 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.040
 turned off enlarged great 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.050
 engine 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.880
 if the oil level sensor is in fact 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.770
 Prim, my dear, this is a true cinema wheelbarrow 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.840
 earlier mass of oil falls if bear 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.450
 or the oil level drops the engine itself 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.180
 he immediately forgive work let out 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.230
 I want everything he gives presented to give 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.330
 spark and on the candle itself 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.820
 but for better it is the first to jump about 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.680
 which dropped the engine oil level 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.680
 this is also very good pen 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.840
 car near the two screws is a normal screw 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.439
 goes and so remove the calibrator pan 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.209
 the second screw goes with him and we let go 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.760
 if there will be 9 status ears on 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.459
 all there poured out of some water will lead 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.230
 the end of it all the same happens 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:39.370
 here comes the most idle seen here in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.590
 cruciform plastic screw 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.980
 it goes idle on the card itself 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.980
 viewer and fuel supply plus minus 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.359
 idle can be twisted and my style 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.400
 it will really be under load 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.109
 will burst idle you can turn the course 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.389
 it can be there plus or minus 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.099
 turn left town right air supply 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.079
 wait a possibility not cool flight 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.980
 valve burn can argue and move 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.439
 mounting not uid 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.069
 it's real that you can carburetor clean 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.069
