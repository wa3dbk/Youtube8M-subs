00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:22.370
 Now we look at the volume that already 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.600
 gave there is now let's go through 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.870
 process 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.410
 It's such a brush did not tell me 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.410
 step 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.760
 and you will see the effect it will give right 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:42.500
 your hair that already has the volume 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:49.040
 now actually this process of 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:51.860
 brush modeling process is only good 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.300
 a tip that is really cool is that you 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.970
 you can keep warm now to start this 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.870
 brushing process and now will do 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.870
 you see the result 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.590
 the process I use for you to place 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:31.020
 the brush wrap with hair and 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:35.729
 slide just slide a metal brush 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.639
 to whom is this modern heat the hair I 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.260
 I even prefer the brush that the babyliss 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.610
 I think it should be a temperature 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.350
 very tall 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.600
 if not with a thermal protector 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.600
 very cool, she just made her hair 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.260
 so people 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:15.220
 This is the process involves hair in the 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:19.780
 foam slip and warm air play 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:23.910
 dryer in your process to do 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:28.710
 these as a model love only for hair 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.710
 We already have the definition in the work 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.320
 james chu premium shine is a spray more 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.290
 then we end up applying it 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.900
 with a greater distance a little outta 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.340
 he does not weigh too much at certain points in the 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.380
 hair like your hair with hair 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.380
 queue can weigh very easy 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:28.830
 and then now we used fixation and 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.830
 in the end it left the hair loose 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.710
 we see your hair has movement 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.420
 that he has this problem is with 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.220
 move and photo she said 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:46.090
 Today I think it's cool, but with your finger. 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.650
 even with your hand so you do not lose that 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.360
 movement in the hair that we did and 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.060
 modeling that we did 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.430
 Guys I'm very happy with him. 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.760

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.600
