00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello very good 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:11.640
 to May 28 , 2013 in this video 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 We are accompanied by a copy of 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.740
 vogue 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.740
 8 years 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.880
 in this video I'm going to show you a 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.369
 transplant because it has not come to me 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.490
 convince the pot that I put 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.410
 too big for the specimen but 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.410
 since I did not have another one 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.150
 the plant there 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.920
 and also 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.480
 I want to transplant for another reason 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 why 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.570
 last year 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.570
 I burned myself 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.640
 in sunlight 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.739
 the earth dried up too 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.739
 and almost all the foliage dried up 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.370
 for a reason of those I also want 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.250
 change the substrate because I see that 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.500
 we are like this i am good 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.230
 one of the reasons is because of the size of 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.220
 the flower pot 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:19.770
 and for changing the substrate for this 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.770
 poor drainage and more airy 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.620
 has sprouted it puts it pretty much as almost 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.850
 all 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.250
 you can take care 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.320
 and if you got a lot and now it has sprouted 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.320
 again but it does not arrive 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.880
 does not come to sprout at all 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.290
 therefore but it does not get much higher 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.540
 of foliage 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.940
 to the back of a side 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:55.490
 from the Mount 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.470
 now when you have all the material for 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.830
 do the transplant the error of 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.830
 show 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.450
 is the transplant we are going to use 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.450
 a fork to untangle the root 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.950
 a punch or our bander to put 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.980
 the earth 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.610
 volcanic earth so you do not know that 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.610
 in the volcanic land 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:31.650
 the earth is a porous substrate and to 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.650
 do not know what the face is 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.270
 to retain moisture and that's why 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.360
 as well 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.820
 the bug what you want is a substrate 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.820
 loose in front 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.799
 and now it is imputed has also been 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.170
 it supports very well in cold but there is no need 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.310
 let the substrate dry a lot if not 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.970
 someone will pass 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.970
 We are going to use 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.740
 cantillo 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.300
 the substrate was universal 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.300
 that carries perlite 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.450
 for the humidity let's mix with iu 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.690
 earth and volcanic gravel 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.310
 Let's go there 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.780
 when you are 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.780
 I will teach you the root 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.960
 we take care the moss to return it to 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.960
 use 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.760
 we are going to use a wide pot and 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.810
 round 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.390
 I already know that it's the same a little like 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.960
 bigger than this time is that I do not have 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.730
 plus 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.960
 also and it will also come out of here 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.220
 what 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.000
 I want to reproduce a lot very much root 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.220
 in the pot then these flowerpots 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.010
 I am for the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.680
 to breed root base of growth and what 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.269
 let's separate from here so that 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.090
 reproduce more root you know that the 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.510
 two a lot of root are produced and the 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.670
 those who do not know both of them have to 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.310
 transplant every two years or every year 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.040
 because many roots are produced 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.770
 easily 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.690
 but be careful not to lower your 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.540
 traces must be left to dry but not 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.240
 completely 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:46.870
 and next year I'll show you the same 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:52.060
 copy and we have it already in a planter 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.060
 according to your style your size 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.909
 your idea 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.710
 When you finish transplanting the 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.540
 I'll show 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.760
 it was clear 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.440
 and it is already 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.150
 we have put a little bit of we have 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.640
 removed almost everyone that had 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.960
 we have put only around the trunk 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.960
 to hold moisture 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:29.169
 this model is quite large but at 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.169
 produce enough roots the tree 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.340
 in a few months everything will come 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.600
 look at the transplant last year at 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.600
 look at the entire illegal root 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:46.909
 and it removes a fat one that was also 

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:46.909
 clogging and it was not aesthetically pretty 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.979
 and good 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:57.480
 we'll see to see how it works 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.169
 in the next year I'll show it again 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.940
 we will remove the next transplant 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:09.160
 until next time and I hope you like it 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:12.180
 greetings to my friend bona bd and my 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.520
 friends jaime lamb 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.389
 is another partner that is not the name 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.389
 until next time
