00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
morning the baits are going to look like

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.229 
morning the baits are going to look like
that<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> bottom<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.879> my<00:00:41.969> right<00:00:42.210> hand

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
that on the bottom in my right hand

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.240 
that on the bottom in my right hand
there<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.739> straight<00:00:44.040> out

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
there they look like that straight out

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.400 
there they look like that straight out
of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> bag<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.120> wash<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
of the bag so if I wash them out when I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.869 
of the bag so if I wash them out when I
cast<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.980> first<00:00:47.250> thing<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.550> morning

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
cast that first thing in the morning

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
cast that first thing in the morning
with<00:00:48.000> these<00:00:48.120> washed<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.570> ones<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.260> look

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
with these washed out ones they look

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.170 
with these washed out ones they look
exactly<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.039> same<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.730> I've<00:00:50.879> put<00:00:51.090> in

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
exactly the same as the one I've put in

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.209 
exactly the same as the one I've put in
night<00:00:51.420> before<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.530> really<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.829> smell

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
night before it's not really the smell

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.920 
night before it's not really the smell
it's<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.030> look<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:54.840> looking

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it's the look that I'm really looking

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.220 
it's the look that I'm really looking
for<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.670> compare<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> two<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.050> see

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
for so compare the two there you can see

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.660 
for so compare the two there you can see
how<00:00:58.410> much<00:00:58.559> differently<00:00:59.010> look<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> think

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
how much differently look and I think

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.790 
how much differently look and I think
that's<00:00:59.820> getting<00:01:00.090> me<00:01:00.120> bite<00:01:00.390> sooner<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that's getting me bite sooner and the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200 
that's getting me bite sooner and the
other<00:01:01.949> thing<00:01:02.129> about<00:01:02.160> washing<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.699> baits<00:01:02.969> out

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
other thing about washing your baits out

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.030 
other thing about washing your baits out
is<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.600> drawing<00:01:04.049> water<00:01:04.229> into<00:01:04.710> them<00:01:04.860> before

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
is your drawing water into them before

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
is your drawing water into them before
you<00:01:05.339> check<00:01:05.580> them<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.820> onto<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.270> silty<00:01:06.600> bottom

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you check them out onto the silty bottom

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
you check them out onto the silty bottom
these<00:01:07.439> places<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.250> very<00:01:08.460> soft<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
these places are very very soft on the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.399 
these places are very very soft on the
bottom<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.450> smell<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> silk<00:01:10.229> can

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
bottom and that smell of the silk can

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.560 
bottom and that smell of the silk can
draw<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.950> bait<00:01:11.189> very<00:01:11.460> quickly<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.479> if

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
draw into the bait very quickly so if

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
draw into the bait very quickly so if
you<00:01:12.689> saturated<00:01:13.200> with<00:01:13.380> water<00:01:13.439> first<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.820> silk

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
you saturated with water first that silk

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.420 
you saturated with water first that silk
doesn't<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.140> quickly<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
doesn't go into them as quickly now you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.070 
doesn't go into them as quickly now you
don't<00:01:17.670> want<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:18.000> saturating<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:18.930> with

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
don't want to be saturating them with

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.840 
don't want to be saturating them with
normal<00:01:19.560> tap<00:01:19.799> water<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> use<00:01:20.580> light

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
normal tap water you want to use light

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.039 
normal tap water you want to use light
water<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.479> doesn't<00:01:21.750> matter<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.020> you're

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
water and it doesn't matter if you're

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.450 
water and it doesn't matter if you're
not<00:01:22.229> using<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> water<00:01:22.799> from<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> lake<00:01:23.189> you're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
not using the water from the lake you're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
not using the water from the lake you're
actually<00:01:23.580> fishing<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.689> use<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.020> we're

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
actually fishing you can use what we're

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.109

some<00:02:58.540> activate<00:02:59.500> syrup<00:02:59.890> get<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.280> smelly<00:03:00.580> as

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
some activate syrup get it as smelly as

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.199 
some activate syrup get it as smelly as
I<00:03:00.819> can<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:02.140> lastly<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.670> crumble<00:03:03.940> up

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
I can and lastly I like to crumble up

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.750 
I can and lastly I like to crumble up
some<00:03:04.239> Grange<00:03:04.750> boilies<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.440> put<00:03:05.590> those<00:03:05.739> in<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
some Grange boilies and put those in the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.160 
some Grange boilies and put those in the
reason<00:03:07.090> for<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.510> sometimes<00:03:08.019> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
reason for that is that sometimes the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.750 
reason for that is that sometimes the
fish<00:03:08.319> can<00:03:08.500> get<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.680> bit<00:03:08.860> preoccupied<00:03:09.280> on<00:03:09.670> the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
fish can get a bit preoccupied on the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.680 
fish can get a bit preoccupied on the
smaller<00:03:10.030> food<00:03:10.330> particles<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.170> by<00:03:11.739> fishing<00:03:12.690> or

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
smaller food particles and by fishing or

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.600 
smaller food particles and by fishing or
by<00:03:13.840> feeding<00:03:14.140> pieces<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:14.860> boilie<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.310> gives<00:03:15.489> you

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
by feeding pieces of boilie it gives you

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.070 
by feeding pieces of boilie it gives you
the<00:03:15.730> option<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:16.150> actually<00:03:16.480> fishing<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.840> small

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
the option of actually fishing a small

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.660 
the option of actually fishing a small
piece<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.319> boiling<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.890> hair<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.609> you

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
piece of boiling on the hair so you

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.009 
piece of boiling on the hair so you
don't<00:03:18.880> always<00:03:19.060> need<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.510> actually<00:03:19.660> use<00:03:19.989> a

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
don't always need to actually use a

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.750 
don't always need to actually use a
maggot<00:03:20.470> rig<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.829> can<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.280> fish<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> piece

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
maggot rig you can just fish a piece
