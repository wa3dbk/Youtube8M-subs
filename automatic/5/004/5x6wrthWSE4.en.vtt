00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.009
 well in this video we'll show you how 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 follow the corner 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.420
 already the staff is asking that I chose 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.849
 old disco music like I'll do 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.400
 this recording does not do it in the tone of de 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.990
 and then you do or after the transport 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.470
 for the other tone is because as mateus 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 santos will sing and the child and his voice 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.369
 is sharper you have chosen the tone 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.029
 was hurt by my good is a more tone 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.850
 practice for this song then doing 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.219
 alone and singing is slower for 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.870
 that you can understand which phrases 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.520
 that I can put on it 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.469
 just remembering that at the time of the same song 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.290
 thing do not have to download a man download 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.110
 more or less about 30 percent so that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.750
 the voice over skirt gets even better 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.980
 high that the agreement is a grandma's cue and gives a 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.980
 alone under the sound is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.910
 the sound is a joke 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:23.750
 the map 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.870
 Hmm 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.539
 rondon 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 apr 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.500
 Thanks Mateus, I'll do it for you. 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.490
 here then in that first part but 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.789
 he started there 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.789
 the first sentence was the second square and the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.170
 track that goes from the prof 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.060
 it's not changing the tone 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:03:00.840
 the phrase that prepared the refrain I climb 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:03:03.180
 intense and will repeat the sentence here 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.890
 you already have a legal basis and that 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.940
 do not sing and play sings and sun 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.940
 the phrases more and the same only the sun 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.769
 was made and top 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.120
 I hope I can help you there, who asked 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.799
 in the next 20 we show more 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.989
 a few sentences a little bit more 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.519
 evolved in other rhythms we also have 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.530
 here the people are asking what they are there 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.620
 who is actually on leave does not have 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.079
 teacher who needs this 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.700
 can take advantage of and improve its 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.989
 Based on the street corner remembering that not 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.690
 there is the goal of singing and low valuing the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.409
 the dynamic braga that the voice that above the 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.409
 instrument always
