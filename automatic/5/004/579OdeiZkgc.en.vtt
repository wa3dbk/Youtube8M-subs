00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:49.440
 I have a very moving memory andrée 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:56.040
 worshiped working in front of a species of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 two windows filled with light and there are 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.320
 a cat who would love to see andré malraux 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.980
 work and it was a little cat who 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:11.870
 were you going to stay quiet said according to 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.360
 the moods of andré where he was black 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:20.010

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.240
 was in the mood his steel gray oud when 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.120

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.870
 interesting things 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.909
 I will teach you something 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.280
 it is that malraux drawn 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.140
 that's where he draws cats and 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.049
 when he was really in a good mood 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.750
 when he was happy who was writing to me he 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.450
 made me at the end of a letter a 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.579
 little cat he draws and his cats like 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.969
 he caresses them that is to say he 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.750
 from the muzzle went through the 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.380
 small ears 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.829
 the course continues and his hand on 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.920
 the back and hair and until the end of the 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.869
 cat's tail is fine when he draws 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.340
 and his little cats it was the same 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.280
 pencil path on the paper know 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.780
 you that these beasts are fabulous 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.239
 we put ourselves 15 years to do 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.989
 assault hunting or chasing that that's 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.750
 to say it's a step that the ch has invented 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.150
 like that and that cat after six months 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.950
 of existence does another each to our 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.739
 chassis sas ocha which way 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.329
 extraordinary he us poor humans 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.250
 me for example took only one 16 17 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.879
 years to get to do this step by step 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.879
 near properly 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.959
 at rim has a busy career 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:46.880
 some titles come to mind the 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.880
 death of the swan bonaparte gisèle 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.340
 antinea in the atlantic the martyrdom of 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.489
 holy sebastian the surroundings of terms 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.489
 she 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.960
 the Lady of the Camellias 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.180
 Salome 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.780
 the exhibition at center Georges Pompidou 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.260
 to see you next to a father his cat 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.569
 schyle brought up a question if 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.769
 you were an animal which would you be 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.530
 in your opinion ideally globally I 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.709
 will be a dog cat 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:35.959
 I like the fidelity of the dog and I like the 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:38.030
 the next will grace is the dance 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.790
 hunt the dance then it's a small 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.629
 tenderness ball 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.239
 so the question that comes to mind 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.730
 that's why the animal is good because 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.590
 that an animal first chose you this 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.220
 ideal a cat is watching you and in his 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.530
 eyes we feel if he loves you and it's a 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.030
 sincere love this something is a 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.030
 meet a cat it's a meeting 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.010
 of love about this is what you 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.170
 have a little anecdote the compo a 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.459
 I have a great love story with a 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:15.019
 cat a species of shaar is maybe 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.519
 a dhabi cross that and we were on the 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.900
 French Riviera there were small 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:25.970
 bungalows like that and a day where have 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.880
 dined at the board of the terrace I received 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.919
 a kind of mass on the knees and 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.789
 it was this cat that took me by the neck 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.130
 kim had lots of little kisses and this 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.889
 cat has a crazy passion for 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.070
 he followed me like a dog and the 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.750
 night scratch at the shutter and he was coming 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.240
 put between my husband and me they 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.789
 lie down and with all his body he's me 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.849
 took by his little paws 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:56.590
 finally it was a fabulous passion is 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.590
 one of the most beautiful memories of the same 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.410
 despite writing something very beautiful 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.410
 on a cat in a cellar 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.680
 when I passed a burqa 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.350
 bloody a black cat got down from his 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.100
 shoulder and slowly gone to the 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:30.520
 darkness under the pitched cavalry of 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.600
 divine horses as if he had been the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.600
 secret of the universe 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.070
 I thought I knew you had received a 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.210
 abyss cat would you still be at the 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.770
 looking for the beautiful love story 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.270
 you counted us just now ah 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.900
 yes because I have not been to the end 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:54.050
 of my story is that this cat 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.750
 who puts and I liked of course that I 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.520
 would put strong I wanted to take him and the 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.500
 day of our departure julien my husband 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.990
 if he gets in the car he is taken 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.000
 to Paris and get into the car 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.460
 these six in the morning in his cell 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.460
 and this dog is back in the car 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.980
 at the moment my husband is going so a 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.690
 open door and she from my 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.240
 husband you have me to close the door 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:21.380
 elements on his side and the cat is 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.660
 party he left and then I have not 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.750
 wanted to look for it because I got 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.100
 said phew it's a wild cat that is 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.520
 that he wants to give to Paris will be 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.950
 unfortunate he must see his friends d 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.900
 other feral cats and they live 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.910
 maybe in community who knows what 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.580
 will come to paris in an apartment 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.600
 so maybe he chose freedom 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.900
 but I must say that I fat them 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:51.950
 tanks and it's a beautiful story 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.120
 I 'm trying to find a chaabi 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.190
 it like that because I would like 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.990
 find the same love years but that 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.200
 do we ever find 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.200
 now
