00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
Volkswagen owners that wanted me to go

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.940 
Volkswagen owners that wanted me to go
through<00:00:09.150> step-by-step<00:00:09.720> on<00:00:10.380> how<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.590> run<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
through step-by-step on how to run the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.860 
through step-by-step on how to run the
wires<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:12.000> would<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.210> been<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> 20

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
wires it would have been like a 20

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.990 
wires it would have been like a 20
minute<00:00:13.139> video<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.920> I'm<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.460> going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.700> sum<00:00:14.969> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
minute video so I'm just going to sum it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.540 
minute video so I'm just going to sum it
all<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.240> into<00:00:16.019> the<00:00:16.619> next<00:00:16.829> couple<00:00:17.009> minutes<00:00:17.249> just

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550

all up into the next couple minutes just
to<00:00:17.669> show<00:00:17.819> you<00:00:17.880> where<00:00:18.269> I<00:00:18.329> ran<00:00:18.689> the<00:00:18.839> wires<00:00:19.079> which

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
to show you where I ran the wires which

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.489 
to show you where I ran the wires which
wires<00:00:19.739> I<00:00:20.009> decided<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.519> run<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:20.939> sighs<00:00:21.569> I<00:00:21.989> want

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.499 
wires I decided to run with sighs I want

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.419 
wires I decided to run with sighs I want
to<00:00:22.589> call<00:00:22.739> a<00:00:22.769> four<00:00:23.130> gauge<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:25.099> is<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.339> it

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
to call a four gauge so here is what it

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.279 
to call a four gauge so here is what it
looks<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.789> now<00:00:27.119> okay<00:00:28.579> got<00:00:29.579> my<00:00:29.659> ma<00:00:30.659> audio<00:00:30.989> amp

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
looks like now okay got my ma audio amp

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.880 
looks like now okay got my ma audio amp
looking<00:00:31.649> nice<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.979> pretty<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.390> power

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
looking nice and pretty I have my power

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.610 
looking nice and pretty I have my power
coming<00:00:34.890> from<00:00:35.039> the<00:00:35.190> front<00:00:35.460> okay<00:00:36.109> now<00:00:37.109> I<00:00:37.440> just

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
coming from the front okay now I just

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.669 
coming from the front okay now I just
want<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.980> show<00:00:38.160> everybody<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.210> went<00:00:39.510> with

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
want to show everybody what I went with

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.500 
want to show everybody what I went with
I<00:00:40.739> went<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.489> four<00:00:41.789> gauge<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.420> I'm

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I went up going with four gauge and I'm

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.630 
I went up going with four gauge and I'm
going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> explain<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.109> everybody<00:00:43.320> why<00:00:43.679> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
going to explain to everybody why this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.349 
going to explain to everybody why this
is<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.999> zero<00:00:45.269> gauge<00:00:45.510> from<00:00:46.019> the<00:00:46.140> Explorer<00:00:46.589> okay

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
is the zero gauge from the Explorer okay

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.700 
is the zero gauge from the Explorer okay
now<00:00:49.010> if<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.309> hold<00:00:50.609> the<00:00:51.210> four<00:00:51.480> gauge<00:00:51.719> let<00:00:52.469> me<00:00:52.530> get

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
now if we hold the four gauge let me get

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.790 
now if we hold the four gauge let me get
it<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.519> light<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:53.909> to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.559> zero<00:00:55.559> gauge

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it out of the light up to the zero gauge

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.729 
it out of the light up to the zero gauge
it's<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.339> huge<00:00:56.609> difference<00:00:57.030> okay<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.749> mean<00:00:58.589> this

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it's a huge difference okay I mean this

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
it's a huge difference okay I mean this
is<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> oxygen<00:01:00.300> free

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is the good it's the oxygen free

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.380 
is the good it's the oxygen free
copper<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.550> tinned<00:01:02.879> aluminum

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
copper so it's not like tinned aluminum

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
copper so it's not like tinned aluminum
or<00:01:03.510> anything<00:01:03.659> like<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.929> it's<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
or anything like that it's it's going to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280 
or anything like that it's it's going to
handle<00:01:05.189> between<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.909> thousand<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.450> 1500<00:01:07.110> watts

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
handle between a thousand and 1500 watts

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.700 
handle between a thousand and 1500 watts
easy

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
easy

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.969 
easy
I'm<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:08.460> running<00:01:08.700> anything<00:01:09.210> crazy<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:10.320> 4

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I'm not running anything crazy the 4

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
I'm not running anything crazy the 4
channel<00:01:11.340> amplifier<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:12.210> came<00:01:12.450> from<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
channel amplifier that came from the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.510 
channel amplifier that came from the
factory<00:01:13.079> the<00:01:13.200> monsoon<00:01:13.590> amp<00:01:13.799> already<00:01:14.130> has<00:01:14.280> its

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
factory the monsoon amp already has its

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
factory the monsoon amp already has its
own<00:01:14.640> power<00:01:15.079> so<00:01:16.079> really<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.439> only<00:01:16.680> needed<00:01:17.100> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
own power so really I only needed this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.090 
own power so really I only needed this
for<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.899> amplifier<00:01:19.500> which<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.770> only<00:01:20.009> going

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
for this amplifier which is only going

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
for this amplifier which is only going
to<00:01:20.189> push<00:01:20.399> about<00:01:20.670> 600<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.600> 1000<00:01:22.079> watts

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
to push about 600 to 1000 watts

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
to push about 600 to 1000 watts
depending<00:01:22.649> on<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.369> how<00:01:23.460> many<00:01:23.610> subs<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
depending on you know how many subs I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.590 
depending on you know how many subs I
upgrade<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> future<00:01:25.670> now<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> mi

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600

I<00:01:33.960> needed<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.380> power

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I needed to power

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.560 
I needed to power
besides<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> subs<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:35.969> that's<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.420> why

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
besides the subs and that's kind of why

besides the subs and that's kind of why
I<00:01:36.840> ran<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.560> zero<00:01:37.829> gauge<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.060> me

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I ran with zero gauge and don't get me

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.209 
I ran with zero gauge and don't get me
wrong<00:01:39.210> when<00:01:39.719> I<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.140> big<00:01:40.320> three<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.649> am<00:01:40.950> gonna

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
wrong when I do the big three I am gonna

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.310 
wrong when I do the big three I am gonna
run<00:01:41.399> zero<00:01:41.700> gauge<00:01:41.909> under<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.270> hood<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:43.020> for

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
run zero gauge under the hood but for

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.910 
run zero gauge under the hood but for
this<00:01:43.439> build

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
this build

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.679 
this build
I<00:01:44.039> felt<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> appropriate<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.450> 4

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
I felt it appropriate to just go at 4

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.870 
I felt it appropriate to just go at 4
gauge<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.140> tried<00:01:46.469> putting<00:01:46.710> zero<00:01:47.100> gauge<00:01:47.280> under

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.039 
gauge I tried putting zero gauge under
the<00:01:48.000> carpet<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.509> running<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> through<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the carpet and running it through the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.230 
the carpet and running it through the
car<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> there's<00:01:49.859> absolutely<00:01:50.130> no<00:01:50.729> way

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
car and there's absolutely no way

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.929 
car and there's absolutely no way
it<00:01:51.899> would<00:01:52.109> have<00:01:52.170> fit<00:01:52.409> either<00:01:53.340> through<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
it would have fit either through the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.440 
it would have fit either through the
grommet<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.570> made<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.549> see<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.210> see

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
grommet that I made I see if you can see

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.870 
grommet that I made I see if you can see
under<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> dash<00:01:58.020> where<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.350> put<00:01:58.649> it

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
under the dash where I put it

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.279 
under the dash where I put it
for<00:01:59.880> looking<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> dash<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.049> okay

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289

you do is drill a hole and pass the wire

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.550 
you do is drill a hole and pass the wire
through

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560

this right here all these pieces of

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.660 
this right here all these pieces of
plastic<00:02:29.600> that<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.590> have<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.130> know<00:02:31.250> remove

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and then pry the carpet up with the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.150 
and then pry the carpet up with the
carpets<00:02:34.670> very<00:02:35.000> taut<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.350> very<00:02:36.650> tight

there's no room underneath this like

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.870 
there's no room underneath this like
there<00:02:39.710> wasn't<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.040> Explorer<00:02:40.460> like<00:02:40.700> there

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
there wasn't the Explorer like there

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.030 
there wasn't the Explorer like there
will<00:02:41.030> be<00:02:41.210> in<00:02:41.360> Fords<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.320> Chevys<00:02:42.710> and

these<00:02:43.400> European<00:02:43.970> cars<00:02:44.180> were<00:02:44.480> made<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:45.590> know<00:02:45.710> I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
these European cars were made you know I

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.130 
these European cars were made you know I
mean<00:02:46.640> they<00:02:46.910> were<00:02:46.970> made<00:02:47.210> to<00:02:47.390> exact<00:02:47.780> spec

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
mean they were made to exact spec

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.870 
mean they were made to exact spec
there's<00:02:48.380> no<00:02:48.620> slack<00:02:49.010> there's<00:02:49.340> no<00:02:49.460> room<00:02:49.730> under

there's no slack there's no room under

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.430 
there's no slack there's no room under
here<00:02:50.030> everything<00:02:50.840> was<00:02:50.930> made<00:02:51.140> really

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
here everything was made really

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.130 
here everything was made really
efficiently<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.160> for<00:02:53.150> me<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.540> run<00:02:53.780> zero

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
efficiently and for me to have run zero

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.960 
efficiently and for me to have run zero
gauge<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.680> would<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.070> I<00:02:55.280> would<00:02:55.490> have<00:02:55.580> had<00:02:55.820> to

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
gauge it would have I would have had to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.940 
gauge it would have I would have had to
run<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.210> under<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.480> car<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.930> with<00:02:57.410> my<00:02:57.710> car

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
run it under the car and with my car

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.500 
run it under the car and with my car
being<00:02:58.130> lowered<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.970> would<00:02:59.090> have<00:02:59.210> just<00:02:59.360> been<00:02:59.390> a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
being lowered it would have just been a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.390 
being lowered it would have just been a
complete<00:03:00.140> nightmare<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.040> that's<00:03:01.220> why

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
complete nightmare so that's why

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.220 
complete nightmare so that's why
I<00:03:01.430> want<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.730> go<00:03:01.910> on<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.060> four<00:03:02.300> gauge<00:03:02.540> okay<00:03:02.840> now

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
I want to go on a four gauge okay now

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.530 
I want to go on a four gauge okay now
what<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.380> did<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.000> removed<00:03:05.000> all<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.450> I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
what I did I removed all this like I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.570 
what I did I removed all this like I
just<00:03:05.600> told<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.050> guys<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.470> passed<00:03:07.130> my<00:03:07.310> four

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
just told you guys I passed my four

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.640 
just told you guys I passed my four
gauge<00:03:07.790> through<00:03:08.180> an<00:03:08.450> existing<00:03:09.050> grommet<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
gauge through an existing grommet in the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.830 
gauge through an existing grommet in the
firewall<00:03:10.490> there's<00:03:10.730> actually<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.270> there<00:03:11.540> and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
firewall there's actually one there and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.150 
firewall there's actually one there and
then<00:03:13.480> on<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.630> good<00:03:14.810> side<00:03:17.590> see<00:03:18.590> if<00:03:18.650> right

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
then on the good side see if right

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.650 
then on the good side see if right
behind<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:20.239> horn<00:03:20.510> okay<00:03:21.050> I<00:03:22.209> can't<00:03:23.209> really<00:03:23.360> see

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
behind the horn okay I can't really see

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.570 
behind the horn okay I can't really see
it<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:23.870> it's<00:03:23.930> right<00:03:24.470> behind<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:25.250> horn<00:03:25.489> right

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
it but it's right behind the horn right

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.550 
it but it's right behind the horn right
next<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.030> shot-tower<00:03:26.330> or<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.260> strut

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
next to the shot-tower or the strut

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.949 
next to the shot-tower or the strut
tower<00:03:27.739> um<00:03:28.070> right<00:03:28.970> behind<00:03:29.300> this<00:03:29.540> guy<00:03:29.720> right

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
tower um right behind this guy right

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.300 
tower um right behind this guy right
there<00:03:29.989> okay<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:30.620> it's<00:03:30.770> only<00:03:30.860> about<00:03:30.980> three

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
there okay so it's only about three

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.430 
there okay so it's only about three
inches<00:03:31.550> below<00:03:31.760> where<00:03:32.180> your<00:03:32.630> wipers<00:03:33.020> would<00:03:33.200> sit

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
inches below where your wipers would sit

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.610 
inches below where your wipers would sit
and<00:03:33.590> then<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.450> snaked<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.660> all<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.140> way<00:03:36.260> around

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
and then I snaked it all the way around

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.280 
and then I snaked it all the way around
to<00:03:36.830> my<00:03:36.920> airbox<00:03:37.280> LAN<00:03:37.670> take<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.239> then<00:03:38.930> all<00:03:39.170> the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
to my airbox LAN take and then all the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.930 
to my airbox LAN take and then all the
way<00:03:39.380> towards<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.770> battery<00:03:40.130> okay<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.760> then<00:03:40.850> I

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
way towards the battery okay and then I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.360 
way towards the battery okay and then I
covered<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.480> with<00:03:41.510> grommet<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.170> give<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.250> some

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
covered it with grommet to give it some

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.570 
covered it with grommet to give it some
sort<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.580> like<00:03:43.640> heat<00:03:43.880> shield<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.739> then<00:03:45.739> in<00:03:46.459> the

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
sort of like heat shield and then in the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.050 
sort of like heat shield and then in the
back<00:03:47.350> or<00:03:48.350> I'm<00:03:48.500> sorry<00:03:48.709> going<00:03:49.100> all<00:03:49.280> up<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.550> car<00:03:49.790> I

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
back or I'm sorry going all up the car I

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.910 
back or I'm sorry going all up the car I
removed<00:03:50.720> both<00:03:51.019> these<00:03:51.350> pieces<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.860> plastic

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.790 

this<00:03:57.920> piece<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.310> plastic<00:03:58.700> right<00:03:58.850> here<00:03:58.910> and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
this piece of plastic right here and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.449 
this piece of plastic right here and
then<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.920> wire

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
then the wire

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.410 
then the wire
if<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:01.670> pull<00:04:02.080> seat<00:04:03.080> down<00:04:03.760> goes<00:04:04.760> behind<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
if you pull seat down goes behind the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.990 
if you pull seat down goes behind the
seat<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.070> then<00:04:07.070> into<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.459> back<00:04:07.610> of<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.820> car

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
seat and then into the back of the car

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.530 
seat and then into the back of the car
okay<00:04:08.209> now<00:04:09.200> on<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.440> other<00:04:09.620> side<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.070> car

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
okay now on the other side of the car

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.240 
okay now on the other side of the car
you<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.900> run<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.170> RCA's<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:13.100> the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
you have it to run the RCA's and the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.580 
you have it to run the RCA's and the
reason<00:04:13.580> why<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.730> have<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.000> run<00:04:14.330> them<00:04:14.480> on<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
reason why you have to run them on the

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.099 
reason why you have to run them on the
opposite<00:04:15.980> side<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.370> car<00:04:16.580> okay<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:18.049> because

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
opposite side of the car okay is because

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.920 
opposite side of the car okay is because
the<00:04:18.980> power<00:04:19.190> wire<00:04:19.519> which<00:04:20.180> is<00:04:20.209> on<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.600> driver

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
the power wire which is on the driver

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.140 
the power wire which is on the driver
side<00:04:21.049> is<00:04:21.650> carrying<00:04:22.190> a<00:04:22.250> lot<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.490> current<00:04:22.820> that

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
side is carrying a lot of current that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.630 
side is carrying a lot of current that
interferes<00:04:23.930> with<00:04:24.620> sound<00:04:24.890> signal<00:04:25.310> traveling

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
interferes with sound signal traveling

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.740 
interferes with sound signal traveling
through<00:04:25.850> these<00:04:26.000> RCA<00:04:26.360> Z's

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
through these RCA Z's

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.240 
through these RCA Z's
audio<00:04:26.900> cables<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:27.530> that's<00:04:27.680> why<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.830> always<00:04:28.010> have

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
audio cables so that's why I always have

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.920 
audio cables so that's why I always have
to<00:04:28.400> run<00:04:28.910> them<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.150> opposite<00:04:29.540> sides<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.840> the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
to run them on opposite sides of the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.110 
to run them on opposite sides of the
vehicle<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.440> then<00:04:30.950> with<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.250> RCA's<00:04:31.730> you<00:04:31.940> also

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
vehicle and then with the RCA's you also

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.650 
vehicle and then with the RCA's you also
run<00:04:32.420> a<00:04:32.690> tiny<00:04:33.140> 18<00:04:33.560> gauge<00:04:33.770> wire<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.420> called

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
run a tiny 18 gauge wire this is called

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.330 
run a tiny 18 gauge wire this is called
your<00:04:35.810> remote<00:04:36.140> wire<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.620> what<00:04:36.890> this<00:04:37.040> does<00:04:37.220> is

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
your remote wire and what this does is

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.100 
your remote wire and what this does is
it<00:04:37.490> hooks<00:04:37.640> up<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.030> Blue<00:04:38.240> Room<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.930> blue

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
it hooks up to the Blue Room the blue

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.450 
it hooks up to the Blue Room the blue
wire<00:04:39.290> coming<00:04:39.590> out<00:04:39.710> of<00:04:39.770> your<00:04:39.860> head<00:04:39.980> unit<00:04:40.310> and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
wire coming out of your head unit and

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.130 
wire coming out of your head unit and
that's<00:04:41.210> what's<00:04:41.480> going<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.630> give<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.960> signal

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
that's what's going to give the signal

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.580 
that's what's going to give the signal
to<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.470> amp<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.680> tell<00:04:42.920> it<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.040> turn<00:04:43.220> on<00:04:43.430> now<00:04:44.590> I'm

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
to the amp to tell it to turn on now I'm

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.490 
to the amp to tell it to turn on now I'm
going<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.800> end<00:04:45.950> this<00:04:46.040> video<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:47.080> make<00:04:48.080> another

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
going to end this video and make another

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.440 
going to end this video and make another
one<00:04:48.590> kind<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.400> going<00:04:49.640> over<00:04:49.730> where<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.120> mount

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
one kind of going over where I mount

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.500 
one kind of going over where I mount
everything<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:51.590> for<00:04:51.800> right<00:04:51.950> now<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:53.120> amp<00:04:53.330> is

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
everything but for right now the amp is

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.940 
everything but for right now the amp is
going<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.750> be<00:04:53.840> right<00:04:54.050> here<00:04:54.320> right<00:04:54.560> next<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.830> my

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
going to be right here right next to my

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.430 
going to be right here right next to my
4<00:04:55.190> channel<00:04:55.520> my<00:04:56.330> battery<00:04:56.720> my<00:04:56.780> kinetic<00:04:57.260> is<00:04:57.320> going

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
4 channel my battery my kinetic is going

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.040 
4 channel my battery my kinetic is going
to<00:04:57.530> go<00:04:57.590> right<00:04:57.770> here<00:04:58.040> and<00:04:58.130> then<00:04:58.580> my<00:04:58.670> 15<00:04:59.120> box<00:04:59.360> is

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
to go right here and then my 15 box is

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.620 
to go right here and then my 15 box is
going<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.260> go<00:05:00.350> right<00:05:00.530> there<00:05:00.770> which<00:05:01.760> is

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
going to go right there which is

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.970 
going to go right there which is
currently<00:05:03.080> sitting<00:05:03.470> over<00:05:04.280> here<00:05:04.310> all<00:05:04.700> right

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
currently sitting over here all right

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.200 
currently sitting over here all right
then<00:05:06.980> I<00:05:07.040> have<00:05:07.220> my<00:05:07.310> kinetic<00:05:08.680> HC<00:05:09.680> mm<00:05:10.490> still

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
then I have my kinetic HC mm still

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.610 
then I have my kinetic HC mm still
pushing<00:05:11.600> about<00:05:11.780> twelve<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:12.110> a<00:05:12.200> half<00:05:12.230> volts

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
pushing about twelve and a half volts

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.940 
pushing about twelve and a half volts
this<00:05:13.040> thing<00:05:13.280> got<00:05:13.460> me<00:05:13.580> through<00:05:13.790> sandy<00:05:14.950> this

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
this thing got me through sandy this

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.110 
this thing got me through sandy this
actually<00:05:16.490> oddly<00:05:16.940> enough<00:05:17.030> was<00:05:18.020> in<00:05:18.290> my<00:05:18.530> Explorer

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
actually oddly enough was in my Explorer

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.520 
actually oddly enough was in my Explorer
when<00:05:20.120> I<00:05:20.390> was<00:05:20.600> under<00:05:20.780> five<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.140> a<00:05:21.169> half<00:05:21.200> feet<00:05:21.440> of

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
when I was under five and a half feet of

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.090 
when I was under five and a half feet of
water<00:05:21.620> during<00:05:22.040> sandy<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.580> this<00:05:23.419> is<00:05:23.480> what

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
water during sandy and this is what

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.850
