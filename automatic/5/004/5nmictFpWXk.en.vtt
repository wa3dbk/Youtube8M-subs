00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.789
 even though there is still hope in the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.769
 humanity and good thing that rescue the 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.050
 humanity has always been considered a 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.390
 virus for this planet and that is 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.189
 we are the main ones 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.189
 predators of our ecosystem 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:32.060
 until 2014 we are a total of 72 thousand 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.210
 millions of people but some of 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.160
 you have wondered how are you 72 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.420
 one billion people would be 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.420
 reflected on earth 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.540
 so you have an idea if we take 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.430
 the entire world population and the 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.880
 we will get together in the great colorado canyon 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.840
 we would not fill even a fraction 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.550
 of this 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 in fact the 72 billion people 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.750
 they would only form a small row as 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.750
 It is shown in this image 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.659
 now well taking into account that the damage 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.270
 the planet have not been caused solely 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.299
 the 72 billion people who 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.520
 live now but it has been fault 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.520
 of the totality of humanity at 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:28.030
 throughout the story we would have a total 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.030
 estimated 106 billion people 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.320
 the history of our planet would form 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.830
 only 15 batteries like the one shown in this 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.290
 image in the whole Grand Canyon and still 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.830
 not enough to cover it in your 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.830
 whole 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:51.170
 the great crack of the great canyon is 277 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.150
 thousand 446 kilometers long and one mine 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.300
 1.6 kilometers deep in some 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.300
 places 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.720
 this graphic was presented by michael 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.720
 stevens on his official youtube channel 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.590
 at the end, comparatively humanity 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.580
 it would be the size of a bacterium in 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.580
 relation to the earth
