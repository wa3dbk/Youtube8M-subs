00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hey people what have I know with 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.150
 your technician here on youtube today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.059
 from the beautiful garden here 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.889
 with super weather and it's almost 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.870
 there is a bit too hot today 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.429
 finally the tech news with a few 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.390
 small update that you then but 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:25.000
 after the intro 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:27.100
 [Music] 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.440
 as I said a few small innovations 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.900
 the innovation is there are only 5 news 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.850
 in the tech news why that is 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.260
 just watch a second channel video 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.610
 to explain in the description below 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.510
 I'll do it all again, why that ? 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.190
 will be changed 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.770
 That's why I can also imagine the same 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.720
 with the topic number one at xbox one 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.129
 controllers finally go under windows 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.800
 yes I know that I already a bit 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.960
 but you know I'm not 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.970
 always a whole list the xbox one 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.519
 controller you can finally synonymous s.PC 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.710
 use what causes me to do that 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.360
 I will buy soon if you 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.770
 just not so bad expensive 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 until now you need a micro usb 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.149
 cable that simply with the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.890
 controller connects controller 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.630
 cable pure computer cable rows driver 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 install and then the whole thing should be 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.500
 Where do the xbox work everywhere ? 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.820
 360 controller already under windows 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.990
 so it worked in as good as 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 every game 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.680
 I will not control anything 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.410
 for the pc also buy because I'm the thing 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.360
 Really cool, I hope that then 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.680
 Sometime soon that too because that 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.390
 So it will not work 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.369
 more the cable needs but you know 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.470
 already know wirelessly if I already 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.650
 have an xbox controller and you to that 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.479
 your pc will use you will find the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.970
 link to download the driver of course 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.710
 below in the video description again 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.960
 what microsoft have become 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 Battery problem was accepted well, the battery 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.049
 problem probably knows 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.330
 you have a smartphone tablet and that 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.799
 just keeps much short of microsoft 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.970
 now wants to pump in a lot of money 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.560
 simply those bad batteries or to 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.939
 to fight these problems 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.159
 you already have some progress 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.140
 Made by simply putting two batteries in 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.909
 have built a cell phone for example 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.250
 So two smaller batteries instead 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.159
 a great sense is for it 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.869
 smaller battery is for standby and low 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.239
 power tasks and the other battery 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.340
 then simply delivers the power without end 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.970
 that means working with the batteries 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.360
 closer to their efficiency maximum I say 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.019
 times 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.130
 and that allows much longer 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.110
 terms at least at standby 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.060
 because such a normal battery in the mobile phone is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.900
 so I say the mediocre 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.410
 that means he works at 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.000
 far from being most efficient if that 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.280
 mobile in standby is that means it 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.500
 More energy is consumed than 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.650
 actually necessary and exactly what you want 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.510
 solve it with microsoft I hope so 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.490
 that the whole thing works well and 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.680
 will soon be put into action 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.680
 namely, term increase of 20 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.660
 up to 50 percent with it possible and 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.520
 Enter number three which will be coats 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.620
 probably also published for linux 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.170
 means and that the oas runs then 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.300
 also this people interface something 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.310
 Of course all linux trailers are very nice 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.140
 and of course me as well 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.680
 because I love so basically all 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.930
 operating systems and gets pretty cool 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.270
 I think so if this one before 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.209
 court and linux more or less full 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.860
 then supports nvidia as he supports 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.860
 Pretty soon, too 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.220
 Let's hope for news number at least 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.080
 in america, four amazon has the feyr vo 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.520
 imagined long was already in the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.730
 it is finally rumored now it was 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.200
 one builds his own cellphone 720p is the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.540
 screen can represent one 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.160
 Snapdragon 800 so pretty good 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.560
 but a real best processor 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.630
 just two gb of working memory is too 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.000
 on board so pretty much standard of 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.489
 there would not be the rest of the 3d feature 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.580
 the device somehow carries your head and 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.019
 then 3d everything looks good for you 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.450
 that works no idea 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.799
 which is similar in first device 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.660
 be available in Germany I think 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.010
 it's just like the kindle with it 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.630
 it started the whole with in 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.970
 rolled out america then comes sometime 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.080
 to england what do I know someday 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.480
 At some point, Germany will arrive 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.940
 the series and I mean 650 dollars without 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.829
 contract is already a statement that 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.810
 So I mean the kindle devices 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.750
 are already pretty cheap and that 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.680
 it is already 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.840
 Of course, here comes amazons 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.120
 own android system for use that 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.410
 means is so heavily modified that 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.780
 is not even the place gate there 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.850
 The question is if you are really a cellphone 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.590
 that wants to get along without a place tor 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.940
 I dont know 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.229
 Of course you have to work again 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.880
 maybe there is also of that 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.490
 modding scene again, one energy award 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.040
 or so that they would not be 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.430
 bad and the 15 news for today is 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.960
 the nexus 8 or nexus 9 or how it works 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.700
 hot Whatever may well 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.669
 the new nexus is expected 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.530
 tablet by htc built in a weird way 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.479
 4 3-format I'm not quite 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.590
 sure if I should find it so cool 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.240
 because I'm on my tray 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.970
 mainly watching movies is there 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.530
 the new already practically the screen 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.210
 to 8-9 duty to be large 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.349
 probably as much as 8.9 inches or 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.330
 somehow so 1440 resolution have but 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.050
 now the processor will be like 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.389
 dak 1 what is rumored so far 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.520
 the strongest android processor should be 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.340
 I'm supposed to be because of that 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.110
 the demonstration unit was then 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.669
 with fan and everything and there still can 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.440
 times more power brought out 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.580
 Be as in a listless tablet 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.919
 but still, that's one thing 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.319
 gross processor oh yes and this 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.539
 nvidia k1 is in the 64 bit variant 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.819
 that means android 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:34.300
 could finally be 64 bit fit 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.530
 which would be nice a two gigabytes 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.900
 Memory should make things easy 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.330
 gets built by htc as I said that 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.310
 could be on an aluminum unibody 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.500
 housing really does suggest that 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.880
 That's the way to wait 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.520
 Of course I hope for one again 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.889
 prize-punk the man behind nexus 7 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.690
 could replace what is not just he 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.789
 have 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.219
 do you have any wishes or 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:59.590
 Requirements for the new nexus 8 or 9 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.960
 It should then be in the comments 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.669
 so that was again for this 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.349
 week with your tech news 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.349
 I am not a holiday 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.890
 For years you know how to thumb again 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.660
 subscribe to the top 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.660
 and so on you know that 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:26.880
 [Music] 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.579
 [Applause] 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.579
