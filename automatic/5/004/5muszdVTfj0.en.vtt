 the developments achieved in the technology of the dirincri the advances 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.190
 in genetics and cell biology 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.830
 up to unexpected limits the applications of biology for the 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.830
 development maybe late humanity 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.890
 these advances are not only conceptual but also technological admitted that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.240
 Biology is registered as a high impact science in society 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.310
 today in the dialogues they not only describe knowing and exploring nature if not 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.500
 that modified it bazán ignorance to the civil engineering the university 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.530
 national of colombia Medellin headquarters through its faculty of sciences 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.159
 poor the biological engineering program 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 with the characteristic of being the only one in the region the program seeks to expand 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.740
 the development possibilities offered by modern biology p 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.240
 his intention to train leaders in the field of biological processes in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.350
 Colombia professionals capable of proposing and promoting the development of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 new processes based on information from the inegi 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 that allows the use of the extensive biological resources with which 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.070
 account the network 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.880
 the country and so 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 contribute to its economic and social development 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.790
 He was begging for that purpose the undergraduate in the ball points to the formation of a 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.650
 new professional remembered that the romantic foundation this is it 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.710
 there are even in Colombia with a strong training in violence acp the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.350
 academic component that the program raises as the student in the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.589
 professional cycle 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.200
 where to expand your knowledge in driving optimization 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 and development of biological processes 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.599
 In addition, the official career students have the opportunity to 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.749
 deepen in areas of industrial biotechnology 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:28.879
 molecular biotechnology and environmental biology according to their attitudes and 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.730
 preferences not 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.189
 duc 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.650
 the headquarters has highly qualified academic staff and basic sciences 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.650
 applied sciences in the field of biotechnology 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.489
 It also has modern laboratories duly equipped 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.499
 where students and teachers perform work in the various groups of 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:52.729
 research several of them classified in the category still by 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.279
 colciencias a world 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.900
 issues such as the use of agroindustrial waste for the 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.959
 obtaining value-added products with application in the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.980
 pharmacological industry food and chemical cosmetics 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.790
 the decontamination of soils and waters through biological processes between 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 others are the object of study and research in this program 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.729
 the competences that identify the biological engineer of the university 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.959
 national of colombia headquarters Medellin in the labor context 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.479
 point to their leadership capacity in the construction of biological processes 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.479
 and participation in interdisciplinary work 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.120

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.620
 his professional performance is oriented to the task 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.690
 the technician and scientist in companies of the public and private sectors in the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.400
 fields of production of organic solvents alcoholic beverages 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.969
 known antibiotics 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.069
 also through the deepening lines 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.019
 the biological engineering graduate can continue his training as he has 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.099
 explained the graduate program 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.729
 especially in the one offered by the national university in the area of 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.729
 biotechnology

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.799
 not only the conservation of its great biodiversity if there is no commitment 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.919
 professional with the rational use of their natural resources 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.629
 for the benefit of current and future generations 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.060
 the national university of colombia based in medellín is the alternative of 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.889
 professionalization and the fields of biotechnology engineering people visit
