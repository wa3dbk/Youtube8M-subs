that<00:00:28.680> I've<00:00:28.859> enjoyed<00:00:29.250> playing<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:29.789> I've

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
that I've enjoyed playing but I've

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.700 
that I've enjoyed playing but I've
always<00:00:30.060> played<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.510> brief<00:00:30.720> spurts<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
always played in brief spurts and I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.290 
always played in brief spurts and I
don't<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.340> revisit<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.090> any

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300

don't think that this revisit is any
different<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.290> definitely<00:00:34.590> starting<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
different but I'm definitely starting to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
different but I'm definitely starting to
notice<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.760> appear<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.570> doing

notice that I don't appear to be doing
things<00:00:37.140> correctly<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> let<00:00:39.480> me

never-ending process essentially you
bump<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> difficulty<00:01:27.750> level<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> keep

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
bump up the difficulty level as you keep

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
bump up the difficulty level as you keep
doing<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.610> there's<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> whole

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
doing this and you know there's a whole

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.340 
doing this and you know there's a whole
bunch<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> new<00:01:30.329> challenges<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.049> things<00:01:31.229> like

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
bunch of new challenges with things like

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.539 
bunch of new challenges with things like
greater<00:01:31.590> rifts<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.890> all<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.280> mean<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.460> makes

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
greater rifts and all that mean it makes

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
greater rifts and all that mean it makes
sense<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.420> why<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.689> happening<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
sense I get why it's happening but that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.620 
sense I get why it's happening but that
is<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.280> how<00:01:35.939> I've<00:01:36.090> been<00:01:36.270> playing<00:01:36.540> the

game and I've sort of come to realize

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
game and I've sort of come to realize
that<00:01:38.729> even<00:01:39.420> though<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
quickly as possible hell I've even

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.539 
quickly as possible hell I've even
finished<00:01:47.549> leveling<00:01:48.119> 270<00:01:49.130> then<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.310> still

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
finished leveling 270 then I was still

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
finished leveling 270 then I was still
having<00:01:50.909> fun<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.720> at<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> end<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> day

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
having fun and so at the end of the day

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.039

even<00:01:53.310> though<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.610> doing<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.090> wrong<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.630> don't

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
even though I'm doing it wrong I don't

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.510 
even though I'm doing it wrong I don't
think<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> really<00:01:55.619> matters<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.340> guess<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
think it really matters and I guess a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.069 
think it really matters and I guess a
lot<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> comes<00:01:57.180> down<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.450> sort<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> how<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
lot of it comes down to sort of how you

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.950 
lot of it comes down to sort of how you
approach<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.890> game<00:01:59.040> right<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.119> am<00:02:00.570> definitely

Diablo 3 and how does that coincide with

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.420 
Diablo 3 and how does that coincide with

sort of your commitment to the game so

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
if you're a person who plays Diablo 3

if you're a person who plays Diablo 3
every<00:03:48.769> single<00:03:49.100> day<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.430> like<00:03:49.579> this<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:50.000> your

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
every single day and like this is your

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.600 
every single day and like this is your
game<00:03:50.720> then<00:03:51.380> if<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.980> or<00:03:52.130> someone<00:03:52.370> who's

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
game then if you or someone who's

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.069 
game then if you or someone who's
running<00:03:52.760> around<00:03:53.000> as<00:03:53.180> fast<00:03:53.420> as<00:03:53.630> possible

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
running around as fast as possible

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.509 
running around as fast as possible
blowing<00:03:54.350> up<00:03:54.440> elite<00:03:54.650> camps<00:03:54.950> as<00:03:55.040> quickly<00:03:55.310> as

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
blowing up elite camps as quickly as

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.670 
blowing up elite camps as quickly as
possible<00:03:55.549> it<00:03:56.390> makes<00:03:56.690> sense<00:03:56.930> because<00:03:57.170> this<00:03:57.530> is

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
possible it makes sense because this is

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.590 
possible it makes sense because this is
your<00:03:57.829> game<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.190> what<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.519> want<00:03:58.820> is<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.299> get

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
your game and what you want is to get

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.360 
your game and what you want is to get
that<00:03:59.780> better<00:03:59.989> gear<00:04:00.440> but<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.890> guess<00:04:01.100> for<00:04:01.310> me

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
that better gear but I guess for me

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.030 
that better gear but I guess for me
personally<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.269> hook<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:03.010> wanting<00:04:04.010> to

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
personally the hook of wanting to

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.910 
personally the hook of wanting to
acquire<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.640> better<00:04:04.880> gear<00:04:05.269> simply<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.620> bump

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
acquire that better gear simply to bump

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.880 
acquire that better gear simply to bump
the<00:04:07.100> difficulty<00:04:07.760> up<00:04:07.880> one<00:04:08.180> level<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:08.810> then<00:04:09.290> do

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
the difficulty up one level and then do

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.530 
the difficulty up one level and then do
the<00:04:10.070> same<00:04:10.280> thing<00:04:10.340> over<00:04:10.760> again<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:11.180> get<00:04:11.299> more

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
the same thing over again to get more

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.449 
the same thing over again to get more
gear<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.840> bump<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.500> difficulty<00:04:13.070> up<00:04:13.160> another

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
gear to bump the difficulty up another

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.729 
gear to bump the difficulty up another
level<00:04:13.730> that's<00:04:14.359> never<00:04:14.720> appealed<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.350> me<00:04:15.590> in

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
level that's never appealed to me in

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.219 
level that's never appealed to me in
this<00:04:16.579> style<00:04:17.030> of<00:04:17.239> game<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.750> that's<00:04:17.870> not<00:04:18.019> how<00:04:18.200> I

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
this style of game and that's not how I

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.990 
this style of game and that's not how I
approach<00:04:18.590> Diablo<00:04:19.130> 2<00:04:19.400> either

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
approach Diablo 2 either

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.909 
approach Diablo 2 either
Diablo<00:04:20.450> 2<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.870> game<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.289> just<00:04:21.500> played<00:04:21.709> to

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
Diablo 2 is a game that I just played to

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.219 
Diablo 2 is a game that I just played to
enjoy<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.400> atmosphere<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.539> combat<00:04:24.020> the

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.170 
enjoy the atmosphere and the combat the
gameplay<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:25.039> characters<00:04:25.580> would

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
gameplay the characters would

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.510 
gameplay the characters would
but<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:28.080> gear<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.770> it's<00:04:29.070> not<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:29.400> the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
but that that gear the it's not that the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.250 
but that that gear the it's not that the
gear<00:04:29.790> grind<00:04:30.120> isn't<00:04:30.450> appeal<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.840> me<00:04:30.930> because<00:04:31.140> it

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
gear grind isn't appeal to me because it

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.110 
gear grind isn't appeal to me because it
did<00:04:31.440> in<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.680> game<00:04:31.890> like<00:04:32.070> World<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.460> Warcraft<00:04:32.880> I

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
did in a game like World of Warcraft I

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.030 
did in a game like World of Warcraft I
guess<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.660> difference<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:34.200> WoW<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.800> gear

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
guess the difference in WoW is that gear

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.780 
guess the difference in WoW is that gear
grind<00:04:35.340> led<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.630> me<00:04:37.230> either<00:04:37.560> being<00:04:38.160> better<00:04:38.460> at

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
grind led to me either being better at

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.720 
grind led to me either being better at
defeating<00:04:39.540> other<00:04:39.810> players<00:04:40.170> in<00:04:40.440> PvP<00:04:40.950> or<00:04:41.130> having

the opportunity to get into these

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.820

endgame<00:04:45.000> raids<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.780> see<00:04:46.020> content<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.710> I

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
endgame raids to see content that I

5<00:04:52.350> it's<00:04:53.040> just<00:04:53.460> bumping<00:04:54.060> them<00:04:54.210> up<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.540> next

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750

has<00:04:58.200> not<00:04:58.350> hooked<00:04:58.590> me<00:04:58.770> personally<00:04:59.340> but<00:04:59.550> I<00:04:59.610> also

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
has not hooked me personally but I also

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.460 
has not hooked me personally but I also
get<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:00.180> that's<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.600> big<00:05:00.780> reason<00:05:00.960> why<00:05:01.140> people

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
get that that's a big reason why people

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.680 
get that that's a big reason why people
play<00:05:01.800> these<00:05:01.980> games<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:02.400> that's<00:05:02.850> why<00:05:03.090> all<00:05:03.630> of

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
play these games and that's why all of

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.600 
play these games and that's why all of
these<00:05:03.990> streamers<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.680> watch<00:05:04.890> are<00:05:05.220> doing

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
these streamers that I watch are doing

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.090 
these streamers that I watch are doing
what<00:05:05.820> they're<00:05:06.030> doing<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.570> why<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:06.840> have<00:05:07.770> just

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
what they're doing and why I have just

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.980 
what they're doing and why I have just
not<00:05:08.280> bothered<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.970> it<00:05:09.150> really<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.450> think<00:05:09.570> comes

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
not bothered to it really I think comes

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.480 
not bothered to it really I think comes
down<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.350> how<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.530> approach<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:11.130> game<00:05:11.280> what

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
down to how you approach the game what

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.220 
down to how you approach the game what
you're<00:05:11.640> looking<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:12.060> get<00:05:12.180> out<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:12.840> think

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
you're looking to get out of it I think

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.420 
you're looking to get out of it I think
that's<00:05:13.320> going<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.620> determine<00:05:14.010> your<00:05:14.160> play

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
that's going to determine your play

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.590 
that's going to determine your play
style<00:05:14.670> but<00:05:14.910> as<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.150> can<00:05:15.240> see<00:05:15.300> in<00:05:15.510> the

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
style but as you can see in the

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.450 
style but as you can see in the
background<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:16.230> pretty<00:05:16.680> much<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:16.920> mosey

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
background I pretty much just mosey

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.090 
background I pretty much just mosey
along<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:18.060> I'm<00:05:18.510> okay<00:05:18.870> with<00:05:18.900> that<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:19.920> how

it and how do you feel about people who
approach<00:05:26.070> it<00:05:26.220> differently<00:05:26.250> hopefully<00:05:26.940> we're

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
approach it differently hopefully we're

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.570 
approach it differently hopefully we're
all<00:05:27.120> accepting<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.870> different<00:05:28.590> ideas<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:28.980> you

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
all accepting of different ideas and you

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.670 
all accepting of different ideas and you
know<00:05:29.610> philosophies<00:05:30.450> on<00:05:30.720> gaming<00:05:31.140> but<00:05:31.530> I<00:05:31.560> know

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
know philosophies on gaming but I know

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.810 
know philosophies on gaming but I know
that<00:05:31.950> that's<00:05:32.040> not<00:05:32.190> always<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.610> case

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
that that's not always the case

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.120 
that that's not always the case
so<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.750> comments<00:05:34.170> section<00:05:34.470> should<00:05:34.620> be<00:05:34.680> fun<00:05:34.980> to
