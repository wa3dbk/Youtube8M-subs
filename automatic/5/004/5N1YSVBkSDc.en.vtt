00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.550
 my name is jolie lamb today I'm going to 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.920
 prepare the cachama with the butter that 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.110
 is a typical dish here in hamlets and 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.080
 for gold rivers are fished here in the 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.689
 region and even many people have 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.660
 hatchery of the same species can be 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.789
 fried can be baked as it is filled 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.949
 and even as the dish that I'm going to 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.160
 prepare today first we have to 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.349
 tuna to the cachama because it is a fish of 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.910
 thorns true not like the catfish that 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.190
 has a single backbone we are 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.579
 studying the cachama finely true 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.680
 so that the thorns are cut so that 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.300
 the person when he goes to eat does not 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 go choke with a thorn 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 I learned to cook with my mom this 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.800
 dish and other dishes 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.440
 that she taught me this fish has 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.460
 their 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.460
 his times 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 his rival in the months of February March and 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.890
 At the end of the year 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.329
 then we chop in two parts and the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.500
 season with a little marinade with 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.500
 true oregano 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.580
 on both sides inside and outside 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.070
 we put a little salt 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.430
 already seasoned the cachama this we go to 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.930
 next step that would chop the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.040
 dressings that these are true tomatoes and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.630
 fine diced onion 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.630
 we eat the tomatoes 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.280
 we chop the onion true first 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.159
 on wheels so we can we can 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.979
 then take out in squares we eat it 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.849
 also a lot in Holy Week, true that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:13.700
 you can not eat red meats we eat 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.700
 this type of fish we peel some as 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.020
 to add it 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.570
 to the dressings 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.240
 we are going to place in the cauldron the 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.010
 butter to melt and come back 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.010
 or place the tomatoes the onions 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.030
 well once again melted the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.160
 butter we add the tomatoes 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.160
 together with the onion and the garlic 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.250
 good is already 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.190
 almost ready to put him 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.400
 the cachavas true 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.150
 we place 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.150
 the cachamas 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.060
 true 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.650
 then this we let it cook a little 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.629
 to turn it around 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.150
 this we will accompany with some 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.150
 Real tostones of green banana 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.840
 that served as food to our 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.880
 aborigines who are our ancestors and 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.060
 has served throughout history and 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.430
 yet still with disasters 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.410
 natural that we have to live that 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.870
 we have propitiated ourselves still 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.520
 we keep sustaining us from that one of those 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.520
 fish for us a blessing
