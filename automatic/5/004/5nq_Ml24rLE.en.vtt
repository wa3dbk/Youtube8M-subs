00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
mouth all right so our strategy for this

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.240 
mouth all right so our strategy for this
one<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> gonna<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.689> cut<00:01:18.990> off<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.740> side<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
one is gonna be cut off this side of the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.429 
one is gonna be cut off this side of the
