00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 another risk of being put into 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.300
 discussion is that the game does not go 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.469
 well someone day but characterizes them 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.190
 it would be too simplistic now 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.570
 making up already not strong is the best way 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.850
 to get to the roundabout are the prices 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.850
 don't have a good race doing one 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.590
 strange on pato 6 of June when everyone 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.960
 those who are staying in the legs 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 spent very nice which is great proof 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.070
 and of great will of great character 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.180
 of great thickness to the duck of this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.980
 team of these guys 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.829
 what was more than the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.980
 as a tool of salinity so much 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.600
 however I am in this system with c1 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.760
 well in short our conditions 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.260
 thematic helped a little more 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.390
 field conditions of the soil itself 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.690
 and then the fact of knowing that the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.600
 paradoxical of greater value more tonic 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.570
 more difficult then that pinch of 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.809
 more unconscious attention if it is not that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.809
 don't come with fairy tales ready maybe 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.240
 to bring a little bit more soft in 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.470
 certain circumstances have determined me and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.810
 so maybe you 're wrong too 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.220
 occasions that we read invasion was 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.590
 surprising with the rings 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.049
 no he was as good as everyone else 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.060
 little quailrella from the moment 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.250
 which is part of this chain group 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.750
 quality of the characterists and others not 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 is that he has shown so many times he must 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.799
 still go a long way in the national team 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.780
 however for vans if the attacker more 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.130
 eclectic that you have sense that has played 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.280
 well on the band can not do even the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.010
 true will yes is not so 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.590
 maybe just a real first tip though 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.390
 a player who fits this 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.540
 proves quality above all 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.580
 spirit of will that knows how to adapt 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.020
 and to know how to adapt with the spirit 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.899
 just not what it is 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.100
 treating to do only one role because 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.860
 the fake one 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 There was a lot of talk about players 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.369
 no longer wants rational but poisons 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.170
 on the other hand, this national team 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.299
 friendship between a spirit of budel 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.550
 consumes desire to help but I do this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.500
 I ask you I ask you why everyone 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.330
 these speeches often come and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.330
 gladly you from us 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.530
 we care to do well to work at 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.019
 better than our chance 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.480
 also wrong as is normal 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.930
 but let's face it always considering 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.160
 those who are noticeable than others 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.800
 but they are not a response plan either 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.510
 just talk about the last thing and leave 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.790
 not very well at ben ten donadoni before 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.769
 of every objective difficulties are things 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.780
 which can destroy at this time 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.720
 given results and ranking you want 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.850
 seven missiles but I don't know if it should 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.220
 be optimistic surely serene 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.540
 soon surely serene because we have 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.530
 all worked well and above all 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.420
 those who are close but are 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.040
 especially this point of ragatzu 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.430
 this makes me turn away but then later 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.820
 optimism is a great word we'll see 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.820
 only at the end how will it be ok 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.330
 after that mine
