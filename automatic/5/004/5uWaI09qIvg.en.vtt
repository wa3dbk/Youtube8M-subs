midfield still looks a little bit

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
midfield still looks a little bit
suspect<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.470> reason<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.890> give<00:01:20.070> Phil

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
suspect for that reason I give Phil

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
suspect for that reason I give Phil
Jones<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> man<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.119> match<00:01:21.299> he<00:01:21.570> was

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
Jones the man of the match he was

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.450 
Jones the man of the match he was
excellent<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.500> marshalling<00:01:22.920> his<00:01:23.100> defense

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
excellent in marshalling his defense

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.520 
excellent in marshalling his defense
marshalling<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.060> midfield<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> he

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
marshalling the midfield and he

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.679 
marshalling the midfield and he
protected<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> back<00:01:26.400> fall<00:01:26.640> well<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.360> he<00:01:27.570> has

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
protected the back fall well so he has

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.789 
protected the back fall well so he has
to<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.020> man<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> match<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.619> thought

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
to get my man of the match I thought

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
to get my man of the match I thought
Chris<00:01:29.009> Smalling<00:01:29.549> played<00:01:29.909> decent<00:01:30.299> today<00:01:30.390> too
