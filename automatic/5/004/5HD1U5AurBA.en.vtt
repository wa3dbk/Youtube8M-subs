see here that there are something called

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.680 
see here that there are something called
the<00:02:11.879> channel

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the channel

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.500 
the channel
the<00:02:12.750> channel<00:02:13.140> here<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.650> RGB<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.460> can<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.090> RGB

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the channel here is RGB you can the RGB

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.810 
the channel here is RGB you can the RGB
which<00:02:15.780> deals<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.650> whole<00:02:16.800> image<00:02:17.190> or<00:02:17.610> you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
which deals with the whole image or you

which deals with the whole image or you
can<00:02:18.030> deal<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.510> each<00:02:19.290> channel<00:02:19.920> separately<00:02:20.640> if

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
can deal with each channel separately if

over here you can find that it is
enhance<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.770> more<00:04:51.240> than<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.660> can<00:04:52.870> imagine

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
enhance it more than you can imagine

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.290 
enhance it more than you can imagine
Robert<00:04:53.710> we<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:54.039> get<00:04:54.250> again<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.030> curves

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
Robert we can get again to the curves

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.670 
Robert we can get again to the curves
adjustment<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:57.699> then<00:04:57.880> get<00:04:58.599> here<00:04:58.930> into<00:04:59.560> the

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
adjustment and then get here into the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.339 
adjustment and then get here into the
curves<00:04:59.979> and<00:05:00.250> through<00:05:00.970> whole<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.539> whole<00:05:01.720> RGB

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
curves and through whole the whole RGB

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:09.450 
curves and through whole the whole RGB
we<00:05:02.530> can<00:05:03.210> lessen<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:06.039> bit<00:05:07.000> more<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:08.650> also<00:05:09.220> can

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
we can lessen it a bit more and also can

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.879 
we can lessen it a bit more and also can
get<00:05:09.759> again<00:05:10.449> into<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.960> blue<00:05:11.169> Channel<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:11.770> we

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
get again into the blue Channel and we

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.730 
get again into the blue Channel and we
can't<00:05:12.160> lesson<00:05:12.880> this<00:05:13.120> in<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.509> color<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:14.080> little

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
can't lesson this in the color a little

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.520 
can't lesson this in the color a little
bit<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:16.180> maybe<00:05:16.810> lowered<00:05:17.759> more<00:05:18.759> like<00:05:19.690> that<00:05:19.930> and

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
bit and maybe lowered more like that and

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.800 
bit and maybe lowered more like that and
so<00:05:20.710> you<00:05:21.009> can't<00:05:21.280> find<00:05:21.520> here<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:21.759> this<00:05:22.270> is<00:05:22.479> the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
so you can't find here that this is the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.480 
so you can't find here that this is the
image<00:05:22.990> we<00:05:23.409> started<00:05:24.220> with<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:25.750> is<00:05:26.080> the

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
image we started with and this is the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.409 
image we started with and this is the
image<00:05:27.490> that<00:05:27.699> we<00:05:28.180> have<00:05:29.550> settled<00:05:30.550> with<00:05:30.909> and<00:05:31.210> I

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
image that we have settled with and I

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.800 
image that we have settled with and I
think<00:05:31.479> that<00:05:31.720> this<00:05:32.139> is<00:05:32.320> more<00:05:32.680> advanced<00:05:33.810> more

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
think that this is more advanced more

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.560 
think that this is more advanced more
enhanced<00:05:35.380> than<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:36.460> first<00:05:36.699> one<00:05:36.970> this<00:05:37.360> is<00:05:37.419> a

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
enhanced than the first one this is a

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.110 
enhanced than the first one this is a
little<00:05:37.720> tutorial<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:39.039> show<00:05:39.099> you<00:05:39.250> how<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.639> have

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
little tutorial to show you how to have

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.600 
little tutorial to show you how to have
to<00:05:40.300> can<00:05:40.509> how<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.080> can<00:05:41.380> manipulate<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:42.580> image

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
to can how you can manipulate the image

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.149 
to can how you can manipulate the image
is<00:05:43.060> taking<00:05:43.449> on<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.690> water<00:05:43.900> however<00:05:44.469> we<00:05:44.949> can

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
is taking on the water however we can

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.029 
is taking on the water however we can
see<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.400> it<00:05:46.000> will<00:05:46.360> still<00:05:46.659> have<00:05:47.080> some<00:05:47.380> of<00:05:47.889> the

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
see that it will still have some of the

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.330 
see that it will still have some of the
bad<00:05:48.219> features<00:05:48.849> like<00:05:49.630> this<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:50.310> what<00:05:51.310> I

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
bad features like this and what I

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.959 
bad features like this and what I
recommend<00:05:52.090> when<00:05:52.659> you<00:05:52.750> are<00:05:52.780> using<00:05:53.349> these

recommend when you are using these

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.120 
recommend when you are using these
cameras<00:05:54.969> on<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.270> water<00:05:55.479> that<00:05:55.840> use<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.440> flash

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
cameras on the water that use the flash

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.990 
cameras on the water that use the flash
and<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:58.289> negative<00:05:59.289> and<00:05:59.770> the<00:06:00.159> film<00:06:00.490> coated
