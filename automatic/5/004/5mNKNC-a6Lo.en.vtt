 I would like to celebrate with all of you in 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.539
 first place the victory of the 'red' and 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.880

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.610
 August 28 we all 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.800
 a lot of desire on this occasion 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.660
 I bring a new commented gameplay is a 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.360
 both special because it not I'm going to 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.670
 show my game skills but 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.739
 that I try to analyze my rival that is 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.690
 a cif and since I do not know it too much 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.030
 I try to make these videos for 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.269
 later and be able to analyze well what 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.239
 they do what utilities they carry that weapons 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.149
 they carry and they use against me since as 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.159
 you will see it below is a very rival 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.079
 hard and that plays a lot better than me 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.179
 so that's why I wanted to show you what 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.159
 here starts the gameplay I'm with my 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.960
 Compi daga veloz in his first m today 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.579
 we are capturing the first base I see 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.739
 how an enemy approaches he planted 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.110
 all areas of the cane are eaten 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.580
 all the fear change ax practically 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.250
 I always do the same thing change in mind the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.590
 slow down and the 'number two' here he me 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.480
 put a poison that is is a poison that 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.490
 immobilize that are the purple chains 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.020
 they look and I get the whirlwind that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.840
 is 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.909
 the f1 that has stolen the whirlwind of 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.270
 warrior to another player and then not 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.179
 release this skill is every time you use 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.130
 the f1 is a steal then if it takes it 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.020
 improved in the trigger branch and that 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.659
 We have been seeing in the trades 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.119
 he puts 6 bunz those 6 bulls give him 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.100
 sweetness fury protection ' regeneration 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.170
 of life vigor and mike that is this that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.149
 here you see how he is about to die and 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.689
 just then that between somersault 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.549
 somersault is regenerating life and 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.090
 then when it's there almost almost to 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.770
 little dot goes back to hide and throws 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.079
 these these points that I comment is is 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.030
 quite pretty useful and I recommend you 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.649
 that you wear the combat tab out 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.470
 because this way you are watching 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.840
 the attacks he's shooting here you see 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.720
 that uses the f1 that I tell you the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.060
 The ability is to steal and well 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.000
 you are watching the numbers 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.020
 the weapons the blows that are getting into 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.120
 this time the cief carries dagger and dagger and 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.730
 dagger and pistol besides the elite that I've 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.560
 could see thanks to the recording of 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.650
 this video later and leads to the vassilis 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.510
 which turns into stone and then from 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.090
 utilities as you have seen the poison 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.040
 that immobilizes the a poison that puts a 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.840
 wound a bleeding and then the jasper to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.000
 pull all the corners faster 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.560
 besides breaking the fish that this one the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.069
 use at the beginning of combat 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.269
 here again throws me this poison that 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.220
 Immobilize what I always do 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.370
 try to put them in rice because that 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.290
 this way you do not eat it here 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.599
 reuse the f1 what you 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.959
 commented on the ability to steal that you see 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.060
 that all of them are put in their 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.849
 icon and the truth is that they last 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.590
 enough is the line is white that 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.260
 they have around is the duration that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.000
 It is consuming and well then not for not 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.819
 stop hiding what I try is 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.700
 try always moving around 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.870
 as in semicircles for in this way 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.769
 well 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.959
 have a little more mobility and about 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.629
 everything does not cross you here we have it to 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.659
 point of death we managed to kill him but 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.730
 well as you know the ten are pretty 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.290
 complicated to kill 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.299
 when they are in fall but they hide 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.489
 over and over again and again and the 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.590
 it's really awful there goes back to 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.420
 appear he threw all the marks of 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.930
 cane for nothing because as you know 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.079
 when they are fallen, they are not activated and 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.000
 well then just before getting 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.760
 finalize the whole thing a comrade arrives 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.329
 he's an engineer there plants us 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.629
 the barrel that explodes and knocks you down like 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.670
 you see today through the air I become 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.159
 leeds to get a lot of damage then the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.349
 robbery immediately sees me and comes for me and 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.870
 the truth that I make the mistake of not 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.849
 get out of this position and get in on 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.129
 astroc to endure more because it came 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:19.900
 for me and how do you see having so little 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:21.370
 life destroys me here they kill me so much 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.199
 there's a bit of fighting but they're 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.910
 they are pretty fast since I do not have 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.560
 that ability to go hiding everything 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.960
 the time but here I go back to 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.510
 revenge they just finished another 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.520
 my friend that is a ready item and 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.330
 Well, here we continue with the battle 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.100
 with the rogue that you see is an enemy 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.990
 worthy of admiration 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.740
 here he just died we are left with his 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.410
 fellow he 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.030
 the engineer just crossed me 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.729
 elementary and sta then has changed me 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.039
 the target then to change the putada 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.960
 is that I put the blow of the chain not 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.060
 I put it to you by not having it selected 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.389
 but well behind him in plan 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.080
 heavy and until I can not kill him not 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:08.759
 I do not stop here again put in 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.789
 the eastern area of ​​the barrel brings me back to 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.800
 push here I'm already there come back what 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.800
 we have managed to kill him he finished not me 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.470
 push and the truth is that it is quite 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.909
 horrific the necromancer has got like 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.580
 skill when a fear is dropped 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.380
 but it takes a long time to throw it away then 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.380
 I do not usually use them, I go to the theater 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.960
 because I see that there is another engineer not 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.330
 I want good is not an elemental ista 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.159
 I do not feel like eating more more times 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.319
 then I get in there and finally 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.160
 we get to kill him walks again on 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:41.410
 rock here 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.960
 I keep moving moving, you see that 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.930
 comes to me to sack and has there stuck 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.510
 between eyebrow and eyebrow again throw me his 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.820
 ability to poison with the chains here 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.370
 luckily I am with the companions and 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.920
 Well, I do not have a little easier 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.930
 to move because they also 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.510
 they are stopping me increase of arrow 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.460
 because I do not trust anymore and here I get the 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.990
 screenshot of the poster but good I am 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.850
 locked in there locked in 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.950
 I want to kill and as I see it above a 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.260
 little bit, so I'm throwing in 1 on the 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.990
 1 until until I kill him and now 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.570
 I remove the little sign and nothing then here 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.020
 we are going to finalize it already please a 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:23.560
 time but nothing still there in the 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.350
 blinding and nothing you see that throw there is a 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.420
 and strictly play area every day 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.160

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.990

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.310
