00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.950
 whipping boy play well that one has 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.600
 if you can not do it with the canes 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.129

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.140
 just this deckard cain has times 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.310
 Career as rap star is already done 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.090
 a while ago, you can always be 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.090
 still listen well 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.520
 The singing never goes out of fashion 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.119

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.600
 the diablo 3 reb originated in one 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.550

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.050
 in the closed beta back to go 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.820
 the paragon level is too slow 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.560
 At least the developers and 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.930
 make sure that you see you in the future 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.670
 Level up to six times faster 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.320
 manager is legal is stressed as well 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.970
 that this effect especially in the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.280
 higher paragon studies be noticeable 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.080
 In addition , the last drops were 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.640
 doubles and the dealers in Qatar will 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.830
 not so many djs in the future 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.300
 in the baggage has incidentally 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.040
 Blizzard still increases the monster damage 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.810
 and there were some adjustments when 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.369

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.370
 In kabul the result may be 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 let perfect shapes look fine 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.239

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.560
