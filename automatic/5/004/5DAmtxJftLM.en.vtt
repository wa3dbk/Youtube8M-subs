things actually refer to the same body

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.700 
things actually refer to the same body
of<00:00:11.309> work<00:00:11.790> essentially<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:13.410> there's<00:00:13.559> also

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
of work essentially but there's also

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.430 
of work essentially but there's also
like<00:00:14.040> computers<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.969> art<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.630> there's<00:00:15.960> like

like computers in art and there's like
several<00:00:16.740> other<00:00:16.980> topics<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.910> you'll<00:00:18.060> hear<00:00:18.180> me

is art well art is a I mean it's a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.689 
is art well art is a I mean it's a
discussion<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.320> about<00:00:25.740> philosophy<00:00:26.130> it's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
discussion it's about philosophy it's

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.880 
discussion it's about philosophy it's
not<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.150> terribly<00:00:27.630> useful<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.470> approach

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
not really terribly useful to approach

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.820 
not really terribly useful to approach
it<00:00:29.099> from<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.240> aspect<00:00:30.830> it's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it from that and at that aspect it's

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
it from that and at that aspect it's
much<00:00:32.099> better<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> talk<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:33.000> what's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
much better to talk about what's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.170 
much better to talk about what's
interesting<00:00:34.100> because<00:00:35.100> people<00:00:35.550> who<00:00:35.880> aren't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
interesting because people who aren't

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.520 
interesting because people who aren't
interested<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:36.780> experts<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.500> say

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
interested in what experts have to say

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.350 
interested in what experts have to say
they're<00:00:38.370> more<00:00:38.579> interested<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:39.149> their

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
they're more interested in what their

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.470 
they're more interested in what their
taste<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.899> when<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.500> comes<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.860> art<00:00:41.360> media<00:00:42.360> on

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
taste is when it comes to art media on

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.440 
taste is when it comes to art media on
the<00:00:42.600> other<00:00:42.719> hand<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.879> understandable

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the other hand is more understandable

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.500 
the other hand is more understandable
and<00:00:45.719> media<00:00:46.649> has<00:00:46.920> also<00:00:47.190> shifted<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:48.030> used<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.420> be

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and media has also shifted it used to be

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.100 
and media has also shifted it used to be
much<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.809> about<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:50.039> too<00:00:50.460> many<00:00:50.840> in<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> case

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
much more about one too many in the case

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.700 
much more about one too many in the case
of<00:00:52.140> print<00:00:52.680> media<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:53.309> broadcast<00:00:54.030> media<00:00:54.710> with

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
of print media or broadcast media with

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.610 
of print media or broadcast media with
the<00:00:55.739> advent<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.510> computers<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.289> Internet

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the advent of computers and the Internet

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.709 
the advent of computers and the Internet
this<00:00:59.190> has<00:00:59.309> become<00:00:59.430> much<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.879> about<00:01:00.059> many<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this has become much more about many to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.270 
this has become much more about many to
many<00:01:01.969> along<00:01:02.969> these<00:01:03.120> lines<00:01:03.180> though<00:01:04.010> art<00:01:05.010> has

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
many along these lines though art has

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.420 
many along these lines though art has
changed<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> last<00:01:06.299> century<00:01:07.110> at<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> early

methods of a discipline to criticize the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.719 
methods of a discipline to criticize the
discipline<00:01:36.479> itself<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.220> subvert<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> but

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
discipline itself not to subvert it but

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
discipline itself not to subvert it but
to<00:01:38.909> entrench<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.630> firmly<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.770> areas

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to entrench it more firmly in the areas

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
to entrench it more firmly in the areas
of<00:01:41.189> its<00:01:41.310> competence<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> let's<00:01:43.170> look<00:01:43.229> at

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
of its competence so let's look at

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.740 
of its competence so let's look at
painting<00:01:44.030> now<00:01:45.030> when<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:45.360> talking<00:01:45.509> about

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
painting now when we're talking about

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.569 
painting now when we're talking about
painting<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.130> sort<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
painting we all have like sort of a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
painting we all have like sort of a
basic<00:01:47.970> understanding<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.200> about

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
basic understanding of what it is about

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.990 
basic understanding of what it is about
we're<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.860> talking<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.189> house<00:01:50.490> painting

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
we're not talking about house painting

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.429 
we're not talking about house painting
so<00:01:51.180> much<00:01:51.329> we're<00:01:51.509> talking<00:01:51.750> about<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.110> fine

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
so much we're talking about like fine

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.039 
so much we're talking about like fine
art<00:01:52.770> painting<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:54.119> about<00:01:54.270> taking<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
art painting right it's about taking a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.730 
art painting right it's about taking a
substance<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.100> applying<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.610> surface<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
substance and applying it to surface and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.899 
substance and applying it to surface and
so<00:01:58.740> there<00:01:58.890> are<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.040> lot<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.340> things<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.759> we

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
so there are a lot of things that we

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.109 
so there are a lot of things that we
consider<00:02:00.270> along<00:02:00.990> these<00:02:01.140> lines<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:03.000> is

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
consider along these lines so what is

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
consider along these lines so what is
the<00:02:03.329> surface<00:02:03.680> what<00:02:04.680> type<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.430> paint<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.030> using

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
the surface what type of paint are using

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.300 
the surface what type of paint are using
and<00:02:06.600> how<00:02:06.659> are<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.020> applying<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
and how are you applying it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.760 
and how are you applying it
and<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.000> work<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.899> artists<00:02:10.200> hand<00:02:10.380> is

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
question well what does it mean then it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.440 
question well what does it mean then it

does appear that you're missing

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.240 
does appear that you're missing
something<00:03:57.690> now<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.560> could<00:03:58.859> say<00:03:59.010> that<00:03:59.040> it

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
something now you could say that it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.520 
something now you could say that it
means<00:03:59.370> nothing<00:03:59.880> that's<00:04:00.569> certainly<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.959> viable

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530
