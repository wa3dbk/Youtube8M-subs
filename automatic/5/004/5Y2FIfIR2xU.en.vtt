00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
placement of them this is obviously

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.570

common sense but I've seen some people

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.690 
common sense but I've seen some people
use<00:01:14.580> these<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> bit<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.259> an<00:01:16.350> idea<00:01:16.700> so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
use these like like a bit of an idea so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.590 
use these like like a bit of an idea so
yeah<00:01:18.770> this<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.369> I'd<00:01:20.549> use<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
yeah this this is how I'd use it and I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.289 
yeah this this is how I'd use it and I
drink<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> region<00:01:22.950> first<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.909> drink

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
drink the region first and then I drink

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.580 
drink the region first and then I drink
the<00:01:24.420> strength<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.049> them<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> way

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the strength and get them out of the way

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.870 
the strength and get them out of the way
then<00:01:25.830> replace<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.729> with

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
then replace it I don't know with

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.219 
then replace it I don't know with
another<00:01:27.150> instant<00:01:27.479> hammer<00:01:27.689> something<00:01:27.930> like

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
another instant hammer something like

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.740 
another instant hammer something like

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
going into a long fight because the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.679

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
sure the line of sight is constantly

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.890 
sure the line of sight is constantly
broken<00:02:56.880> if<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> line<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.329> sight<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.540> broken

show you a quick few clips to show why
blocking<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.650> important

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.160 

okay<00:03:18.129> gas<00:03:18.340> as<00:03:18.609> you<00:03:18.849> can<00:03:18.999> see<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.390> split<00:03:19.689> my

blocking whereas in this clip I am
blocking<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.329> reduces<00:03:31.719> the<00:03:31.870> damage<00:03:32.109> to

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
blocking and it reduces the damage to

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.440 
blocking and it reduces the damage to
one<00:03:32.530> point<00:03:32.799> five<00:03:33.069> hearts<00:03:33.489> per<00:03:33.730> hit
