this<00:00:02.250> tutorial<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.909> about<00:00:03.210> creating<00:00:03.750> a

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
this tutorial is about creating a

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.639 
this tutorial is about creating a
stencil<00:00:04.740> for<00:00:04.920> printing<00:00:05.930> it<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.140> not<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> true

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
stencil for printing it is not a true

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.709 
stencil for printing it is not a true
stencil<00:00:08.250> where<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.519> images<00:00:09.000> cut<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.389> like

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
stencil where the images cut out like

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.290 
stencil where the images cut out like
the<00:00:09.840> image<00:00:10.200> shown<00:00:10.469> here<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.820> form<00:00:12.150> of

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
the image shown here is the form of

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.609 
the image shown here is the form of
print<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.960> appears<00:00:13.410> as<00:00:13.620> if<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> stencil

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
print that appears as if it is a stencil

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.050 
print that appears as if it is a stencil

producing<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.779> logo<00:00:22.910> first<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.060> need<00:00:24.210> an<00:00:24.330> image

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
producing a logo first you need an image

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.380 
producing a logo first you need an image
with<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.050> reasonable<00:00:25.830> clear<00:00:26.670> background<00:00:27.240> like

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
with a reasonable clear background like

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.900 
with a reasonable clear background like
the<00:00:27.539> one<00:00:27.720> shown<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:28.439> now<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.160> duplicate<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the one shown here now I duplicate the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.790 
the one shown here now I duplicate the
image<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.019> need<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.710> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
image you don't really need to in this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.209 
image you don't really need to in this
case<00:00:32.120> let<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.210> go<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> colors<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.160> go<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
case let me go to colors we go to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.869 
case let me go to colors we go to
threshold<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.469> that<00:00:37.469> changes<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.579> form

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
threshold and that changes it to a form

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.200 
threshold and that changes it to a form
of<00:00:39.000> black<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.420> white<00:00:40.579> here<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.969> change

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
of black and white here you can change

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.810 
of black and white here you can change
the<00:00:42.420> threshold<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> darker<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.789> lighter

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the threshold to a darker or lighter

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.910 
the threshold to a darker or lighter
color<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.780> need<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> bring<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
color now we need to bring it up just a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.770 
color now we need to bring it up just a
little<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.670> some<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.940> D<00:00:50.940> saturation

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
little now some use the D saturation

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.240 
little now some use the D saturation
mode<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.320> found<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.860> particular

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
mode but I found in this particular

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.459 
mode but I found in this particular
image<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.940> took<00:00:54.149> too<00:00:54.360> much<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> detail

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
image it took too much of the detail

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.380 
image it took too much of the detail
away<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.800> wanted<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> heavy<00:00:56.460> look<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:57.149> though

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
away you wanted the heavy look as though

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.189 
away you wanted the heavy look as though
it's<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.660> stencil<00:00:59.059> okay<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.300> pretty<00:01:00.480> close

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
it's a stencil okay that's pretty close

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.240 
it's a stencil okay that's pretty close
I<00:01:01.430> click<00:01:02.430> OK<00:01:03.260> now<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.769> stencil

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
I click OK now I have my stencil

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
I click OK now I have my stencil
appearance<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.939> needs<00:01:06.119> tweaking<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
appearance but it needs tweaking up a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.520 
appearance but it needs tweaking up a
little<00:01:07.110> there's<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.950> bit<00:01:08.070> too<00:01:08.100> much

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
little there's a little bit too much

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
little there's a little bit too much
shows<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.760> eraser<00:01:12.390> tool

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
shows on there so I use the eraser tool

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.410 
shows on there so I use the eraser tool
and<00:01:12.960> erase<00:01:13.320> some<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> don't<00:01:15.180> want

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and erase some of the what I don't want

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.999 
and erase some of the what I don't want
in<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.840> particular<00:01:16.640> inch<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.360> stencil

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
in that particular inch in the stencil

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.170 
in that particular inch in the stencil
you<00:01:20.009> notice<00:01:20.340> there<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.790> took<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
you notice there that took the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
you notice there that took the
background<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.170> there<00:01:22.380> wasn't<00:01:22.530> much

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
background out because there wasn't much

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
background out because there wasn't much
detail<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> background<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> what

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
detail in the background which is what

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.620 
detail in the background which is what
we<00:01:24.990> need<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.470> format

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.710 

the<00:01:30.440> reason<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:30.860> made<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> duplication<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:32.360> so

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
the reason I made a duplication is so

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.930 
the reason I made a duplication is so
you<00:01:32.780> can<00:01:33.020> make<00:01:33.290> adjustments<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.340> image

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
you can make adjustments to the image

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.969 
you can make adjustments to the image
here<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.020> I'll<00:01:36.140> bring<00:01:36.320> down<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.770> opacity

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
here so I'll bring down the opacity

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.250 
here so I'll bring down the opacity
using<00:01:37.790> this<00:01:37.910> tool<00:01:38.180> at<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.479> top<00:01:38.690> here<00:01:38.900> or<00:01:39.140> your

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
using this tool at the top here or your

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.560 
using this tool at the top here or your
pasady<00:01:39.740> slider<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:40.700> can<00:01:40.820> see<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.210> image

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
pasady slider and you can see the image

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.320 
pasady slider and you can see the image
below<00:01:41.990> now<00:01:42.290> now<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.369> reason<00:01:43.760> I<00:01:43.880> did<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.119> is

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
below now now the reason I did that is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.260 
below now now the reason I did that is
because<00:01:44.530> there's<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.650> shadow<00:01:45.920> there<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.550> I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
because there's a shadow there and I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.749 
because there's a shadow there and I
need<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.600> erase<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.380> got<00:01:48.830> my<00:01:48.979> razor<00:01:49.369> picked

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
need to erase it so got my razor picked

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.690 
need to erase it so got my razor picked
and<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.509> just<00:01:50.720> click<00:01:50.960> on<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.740> area<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.310> raise

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
and I just click on that area and raise

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.770 
and I just click on that area and raise
it<00:01:52.970> around<00:01:53.300> there<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:54.160> slightly<00:01:55.160> it's<00:01:56.090> it

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
it around there just slightly it's it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.859 
it around there just slightly it's it
was<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:56.990> shadow<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.800> we<00:01:57.920> don't<00:01:58.100> really<00:01:58.310> need<00:01:58.640> it

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
was a shadow so we don't really need it

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.350 
was a shadow so we don't really need it
okay<00:01:59.869> a<00:02:00.110> little<00:02:00.860> bit<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.190> hair<00:02:01.850> sticking<00:02:02.119> up

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
okay a little bit of hair sticking up

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.749 
okay a little bit of hair sticking up
there<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.810> takes<00:02:03.020> whatever<00:02:03.310> appears<00:02:04.310> way<00:02:04.580> then

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
there it takes whatever appears way then

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.400

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
one is quite simple to use because it

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.930 
one is quite simple to use because it
draws<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.230> line<00:02:54.440> as<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.769> go<00:02:54.950> when<00:02:55.579> you<00:02:55.700> hold

from around there big a bit pick a
bigger<00:04:31.980> brush<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.550> just<00:04:33.270> use<00:04:33.480> those<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:34.170> get<00:04:34.440> the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
bigger brush I just use those to get the

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.830 
bigger brush I just use those to get the
size<00:04:34.890> of<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.220> line<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.430> wanted<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.390> move<00:04:36.630> that

size of the line I wanted and move that

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.530 
size of the line I wanted and move that
away<00:04:36.960> go<00:04:37.710> back<00:04:37.920> to<00:04:38.040> my<00:04:38.160> paintbrush<00:04:38.640> tool<00:04:38.910> and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
away go back to my paintbrush tool and

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.300 
away go back to my paintbrush tool and
just<00:04:39.750> fill<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.110> there<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.680> make<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.040> nice

just fill that in there and make a nice
and<00:04:41.580> black<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.300> appears<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.960> be<00:04:43.110> part<00:04:43.980> of

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
and black so it appears to be part of

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.160 
and black so it appears to be part of
the<00:04:44.190> stencil<00:04:45.860> smoking<00:04:46.860> like<00:04:47.040> from<00:04:47.250> steady<00:04:48.170> now
