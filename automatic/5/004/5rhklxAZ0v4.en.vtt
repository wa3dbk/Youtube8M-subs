those<00:02:09.830> plays<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.220> really<00:02:12.100> determined<00:02:13.100> kind

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
those plays that really determined kind

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.390 
those plays that really determined kind
of<00:02:13.670> how<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:14.209> know<00:02:14.360> who<00:02:14.570> executes<00:02:15.050> who<00:02:15.200> did<00:02:15.410> one

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
of how you know who executes who did one

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.890 
of how you know who executes who did one
of<00:02:16.459> those<00:02:16.550> places<00:02:16.760> covers<00:02:17.300> last<00:02:17.660> touch-up

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
of those places covers last touch-up

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.199 
of those places covers last touch-up
what<00:02:20.900> went<00:02:21.080> wrong<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.230> way<00:02:21.850> well<00:02:22.850> they<00:02:23.060> got

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
what went wrong that way well they got

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.260 
what went wrong that way well they got
to<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> edge<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.020> really<00:02:24.850> trying<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.030> stack

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
to the edge and really trying to stack

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.560 
to the edge and really trying to stack
up<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.660> Middle's<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.380> bear<00:02:28.040> defense<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.910> you

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
up the Middle's of bear defense and you

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.410 
up the Middle's of bear defense and you
know<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:30.070> without<00:02:31.070> seeing<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.150> got<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
know I without seeing it but I got a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.940 
know I without seeing it but I got a
feeling<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:33.440> six<00:02:33.739> probably<00:02:34.070> got<00:02:35.770> scooped<00:02:36.770> out

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
feeling the six probably got scooped out

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.400 
feeling the six probably got scooped out
of<00:02:37.160> his<00:02:37.340> gap<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.000> then<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.750> got<00:02:38.930> downhill

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
of his gap and then you got downhill

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.709 
of his gap and then you got downhill
pretty<00:02:39.560> fast
