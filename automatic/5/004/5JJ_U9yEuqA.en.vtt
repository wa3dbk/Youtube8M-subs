blackberry so expectation one should be

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.879 
blackberry so expectation one should be
better<00:00:12.570> looking<00:00:12.900> than<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> blackberry<00:00:13.559> after

better
I<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.139> remember<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.670> 3700<00:00:17.670> performs<00:00:18.119> so

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
I do remember it's a 3700 performs so

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.420 
I do remember it's a 3700 performs so
may<00:00:18.750> not<00:00:18.779> be<00:00:19.080> able<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.189> then

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
may not be able to do it but that then

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.439

what<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.969> say<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> mean<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.750> try

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
what can I say I mean I'm going to try

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.509 
what can I say I mean I'm going to try
and<00:02:06.990> type<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.350> little

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
and type a little

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.889 
and type a little
okay<00:02:09.519> this<00:02:09.640> throws<00:02:09.879> me<00:02:10.060> completely<00:02:10.569> off

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
okay this throws me completely off

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.660 
okay this throws me completely off
because<00:02:11.109> I'm<00:02:11.260> expecting<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.829> quality<00:02:12.219> I<00:02:12.400> don't

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
because I'm expecting a quality I don't

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.099 
because I'm expecting a quality I don't
know<00:02:12.909> if<00:02:12.999> maybe<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.389> first<00:02:13.629> time<00:02:13.900> you're

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
know if maybe the first time you're

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.839 
know if maybe the first time you're
getting<00:02:14.200> into<00:02:14.530> these<00:02:14.650> kind<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.010> phones<00:02:15.249> ABCD

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
getting into these kind of phones ABCD

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:16.860 
getting into these kind of phones ABCD
may<00:02:15.969> make<00:02:16.180> more<00:02:16.389> sense

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
may make more sense

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.199 
may make more sense
there<00:02:17.139> are<00:02:17.260> ABCD<00:02:18.010> keyboards<00:02:18.609> available<00:02:19.060> which

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
there are ABCD keyboards available which

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.239 
there are ABCD keyboards available which
people<00:02:19.480> say<00:02:19.629> are<00:02:19.719> much<00:02:19.900> faster<00:02:20.109> but<00:02:20.889> I<00:02:20.950> think

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.249 
people say are much faster but I think

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.619 
people say are much faster but I think
you'll<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.519> change<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.939> entire<00:02:22.239> world

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
you'll have to change the entire world

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.050 
you'll have to change the entire world
to<00:02:22.870> make<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.170> work<00:02:23.439> so<00:02:23.469> I'd<00:02:23.709> say<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.700> good

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
to make this work so I'd say it's a good

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.209 
to make this work so I'd say it's a good
gamble<00:02:25.599> I'm<00:02:25.750> giving<00:02:26.469> them<00:02:26.590> three

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
gamble I'm giving them three
