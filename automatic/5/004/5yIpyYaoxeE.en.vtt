00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.550
 new coaches to teach us the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.340
 quality the strategy and the power of 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.900
 your pokemon so be very comfortable 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.670
 because I'm sure we're going to 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.039
 enjoy but before let me 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.140
 introduce these coaches to me 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.359
 left side I have here I follow already I 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 has a girl who comes right 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.720
 directly from Korea and has the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.330
 life is eager to get their 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.460
 pokemon the rules are very simple was 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.339
 a 3 against 3 and the first one to stay 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.839
 without lost pokemon I simple south is the 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.540
 referee of this match so enter 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.699
 it's over there the Korean girl starts 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.799
 throwing his first pokemon can not stand 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.839
 more and send a game car on the other hand 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.120
 x and he throws his strip the trick as very 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.699
 powerful because of the physical part that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 a direct hit to the hangar seems 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.000
 who has chosen Spanish because it is more 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.769
 fast than a game gear if you go in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.080
 no type of bus you or are thrown truncated 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.940
 is saved to avenge by the focus band and 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.070
 attention for avenging has surprise a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.260
 defensive hangar that sneaks fire 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.729
 factual pulling a deck and I continue and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.080
 ensures one hundred percent that attack 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.360
 physical to be half 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.520
 for now the girl is withdrawn Korean 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.560
 great takes out his next pokemon for 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.030
 deal with that piece of tirán drum 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 of the testarazos that it is necessary to have 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.770
 very careful that I keep repeating the second 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 testarazo that goes directito to that signal 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.270
 pawn and hold it pretty full and that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.100
 that is burned imagine ladies and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.040
 gentlemen and pulling one had all his 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.440
 100% attack and I still withdraw throw tuna 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.270
 prefer to save it maybe for more 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.310
 go ahead and take out your six are a pokémon 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.680
 that can do a lot of damage to that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.210
 Pokemon type fairy of the Korean girl 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 that he puts a loud voice does not take away 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.500
 a lot of life is a third suspense and the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.290
 girl with the withdrawal back to silver 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.510
 no persecution of xixon puts him before 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.280
 to remove it this guy hit without this 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.560
 not very effective against a fairy type but 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.170
 he removes the doubles and in that turn he wants 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.869
 change as has been the case and out char 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.369
 hoist shiny 6 now has to go back 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.290
 concentrator that ski I follow because the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.869
 fire can not see it or in paint is 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.149
 that the game for 4 and it leaves throw truncate 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.070
 can stand calmly gives us that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.040
 type fire that goal is to take hoist 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.500
 and it's not going to be chat is mega char raise x 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.260
 saint and he changes the color quite 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.940
 clarito greenish I want in my opinion 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.740
 throwing that color and put a dance 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.510
 take advantage of the change to put dance 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.670
 dragon careful because now the girl 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.710
 Korean has its mega chéliz at the xv 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.570
 Hosted the attack and speed with 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.400
 that tuna is thrown that is depleted the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.770
 physical attack in half and the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.290
 burn is progressing every mega turn 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.480
 htx goes direct to the attack uses a 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.490
 angry attack very effective because it's kind 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.310
 of agon against team and truck that ends 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.500
 with him the first pokemon that we will see 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.840
 as here I still try for that mega 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.870
 Butcher x because that 's what he can not 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.940
 watch it come out heel flame a pokémon very 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.890
 fast thanks to his ability to 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.510
 sell worth a daring bird is going to 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.790
 remove quite a life a very attack 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.280
 powerful and leaves him with life already 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.320
 yellow but pickup damage to 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.230
 lose a little more life for the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.630
 Waiting life seems to be and anger again 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.840
 that mega guitar that is going to make a 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.880
 double and they killed it flame and also 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.400
 throwing a single one left 6 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.870
 for the moment is caught in anger and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.150
 he can not attack him with any 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.010
 game type attack but use it 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.110
 fist to the adviser I think he has surrendered 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.240
 for now here I still know that it is very 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.400
 annoyed is not very effective uses 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.200
 angry again and it can be a triple 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.140
 team is a hat-trick of that mega 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.270
 performs the x but stays stays in 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.970

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.600

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.300
 Silver uses again fist bullet up 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.880
