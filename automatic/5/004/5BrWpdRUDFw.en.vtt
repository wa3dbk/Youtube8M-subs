00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
TNT and then place redstone like ice
around<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.310> want<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> activate<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.330> with

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
around then you want to activate it with

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.149 
around then you want to activate it with
the<00:01:12.659> redstone<00:01:13.080> torch<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> lot<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> people

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the redstone torch now a lot of people

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.760 
the redstone torch now a lot of people
know<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.520> trick<00:01:14.880> John<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:19.110> as

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
know this trick John you don't and as

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
know this trick John you don't and as
you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.460> cannot<00:01:20.820> place<00:01:21.090> TNT<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
you can see you cannot place TNT on the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
you can see you cannot place TNT on the
ground<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> can't<00:01:22.830> spawn<00:01:23.100> an<00:01:23.280> egg<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
ground and you can't spawn an egg so you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030 
ground and you can't spawn an egg so you
can<00:01:24.030> also<00:01:24.299> spawn<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> bunch<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> eggs<00:01:25.650> also

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
can also spawn a bunch of eggs also

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
can also spawn a bunch of eggs also
using<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.820> trick<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
using this trick then you do that it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.249 
using this trick then you do that it
only<00:01:28.680> activated<00:01:29.189> once<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> quickly<00:01:30.840> break

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
only activated once if you quickly break

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.810 
only activated once if you quickly break
and<00:01:31.470> place<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.860> redstone<00:01:32.189> it'll<00:01:32.579> start

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and place this redstone it'll start

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.620 
and place this redstone it'll start
ticking<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.880> play<00:01:36.119> CNT

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
ticking like that and then you play CNT

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
ticking like that and then you play CNT
like<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.200> does<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.560> exploit<00:01:37.890> any<00:01:38.130> blocks

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
like this it does not exploit any blocks

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.920 
like this it does not exploit any blocks
but<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.030> annoy<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.479> crap<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.900> of
