00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
these positions is that I'm building a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.840 
these positions is that I'm building a
waterfall<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> these<00:01:00.059> are<00:01:00.300> caused<00:01:00.870> by<00:01:01.230> the

waterfall so these are caused by the
filter<00:01:02.850> will<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.180> buried<00:01:03.480> near<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.899> waterfall

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
filter will be buried near the waterfall

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.960 
filter will be buried near the waterfall
and<00:01:05.549> here's<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> include<00:01:06.350> your<00:01:07.350> socket<00:01:07.970> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and here's the include your socket you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.070 
and here's the include your socket you
can<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> weather<00:01:09.720> sealed<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> each<00:01:13.020> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
can see that weather sealed so each of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.320 
can see that weather sealed so each of
the<00:01:13.530> pumping<00:01:14.340> photos<00:01:14.729> connect<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.240> of

get I got from being King which you'll

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.539 
get I got from being King which you'll
run<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:29.240> underneath<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.390> paving<00:01:30.990> for

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
run up this underneath my paving for

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.480 
run up this underneath my paving for
these<00:01:32.549> junction<00:01:32.939> boxes<00:01:33.270> which<00:01:33.509> combo<00:01:33.990> fee

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
these junction boxes which combo fee

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.359 
these junction boxes which combo fee
held<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.670> power<00:01:36.000> system<00:01:36.890> which<00:01:37.890> includes<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
held a power system which includes the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.070 
held a power system which includes the
enclosure

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
enclosure

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.320 
enclosure
then<00:01:40.680> I've<00:01:40.800> just<00:01:40.830> drilled<00:01:41.280> holes<00:01:41.670> through<00:01:42.120> the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
then I've just drilled holes through the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.690 
then I've just drilled holes through the
French<00:01:43.140> doors<00:01:43.230> to<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.520> house

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
French doors to get these of the house

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.980 
French doors to get these of the house
and<00:01:45.380> then<00:01:46.380> once<00:01:46.650> inside<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> house<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:50.990> these

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and then once inside the house the these

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.230 
and then once inside the house the these
are<00:01:52.260> CDs<00:01:52.770> come<00:01:53.160> with<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.370> pack<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.820> well<00:01:53.850> so

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
are CDs come with a pack as well so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.930 
are CDs come with a pack as well so
there's<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.720> each<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.700> that's<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.350 

that's<00:01:59.940> all<00:02:00.270> done<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:01.850> will<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> water

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that's all done I will have a water

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.950 
that's all done I will have a water
feature<00:02:03.660> what<00:02:04.230> for<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.540> often<00:02:06.720> that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
feature what for but what often that

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.230 
feature what for but what often that
hose<00:02:07.170> will<00:02:07.530> start<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.880> run<00:02:09.060> down

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
hose will start about here and run down

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.030 
hose will start about here and run down
to<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.570> water<00:02:09.780> everything<00:02:10.710> else<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:11.009> be

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
to the water everything else will be

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.140 
to the water everything else will be
buried<00:02:11.450> or<00:02:12.450> concealed<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.670> that's<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.030> end

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
buried or concealed and that's the end

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.680 
buried or concealed and that's the end
and<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:16.080> nearly<00:02:17.000> think<00:02:18.000> you're<00:02:18.180> thinking<00:02:18.510> of

and you nearly think you're thinking of

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.730 
and you nearly think you're thinking of
being<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.740> sample<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> helps
