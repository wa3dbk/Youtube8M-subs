of the needler that we've seen in halos
2<00:00:50.110> through<00:00:50.350> 4<00:00:50.649> and<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:51.850> found<00:00:52.239> it<00:00:52.360> extremely

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
2 through 4 and I found it extremely

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.420 
2 through 4 and I found it extremely
awesome<00:00:52.989> that<00:00:53.410> you<00:00:53.620> can<00:00:53.800> actually<00:00:53.950> track<00:00:54.399> your

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
awesome that you can actually track your

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.280 
awesome that you can actually track your
enemy<00:00:54.850> while<00:00:55.000> shooting<00:00:55.300> now<00:00:55.870> it<00:00:55.989> doesn't<00:00:56.140> have

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
enemy while shooting now it doesn't have

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.799 
enemy while shooting now it doesn't have
the<00:00:56.440> long<00:00:56.649> range<00:00:57.210> distance<00:00:58.210> like<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.660> does

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
the long range distance like it does

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.360 
the long range distance like it does
with<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.140> kneeler<00:00:59.440> but<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.800> other<00:00:59.950> thing<00:01:00.190> is

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
with the kneeler but the other thing is

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.850 
with the kneeler but the other thing is
it's<00:01:00.640> not<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.879> semi-automatic<00:01:01.809> weapon<00:01:02.020> if<00:01:02.680> you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
it's not a semi-automatic weapon if you

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.650 
it's not a semi-automatic weapon if you
can<00:01:03.010> shoot<00:01:03.219> with<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.520> bolt<00:01:03.700> shot<00:01:03.820> it's<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.239> 3

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
can shoot with the bolt shot it's a 3

same<00:01:07.630> way<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.259> with<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:09.310> battle<00:01:10.060> rifle

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
