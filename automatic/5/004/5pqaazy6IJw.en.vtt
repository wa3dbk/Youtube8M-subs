00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.190
 how good 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.020
 you would not prefer not to be a doll 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.140
 as you like 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.050
 although from pnc and his mentioned that the part 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.390
 11 of the investigation is the last of 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.500
 the first season of gravity false is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.960
 will make an exception 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.920
 before starting the the will already make them a 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.079
 little warning why this exception 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.659
 welcome everyone to part 11.5 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.339
 from research to gravity false it 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.739
 supposed that the few data that 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.260
 mentioned in a few moments they would be 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.050
 added in part 12 or part 1 of the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.059
 second season of such research 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.430
 and the reason why this was done 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.769
 part is because in the previous parts 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.140
 comments have been found doing 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.509
 a request which pulls the songs 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 of gravity false and tsuru do not give that 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.460
 they have left some links in the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.110
 description of the video the first 11 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.240
 will take you to download folders 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.340
 unzip them from photos and photos 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.800
 catches that were used in these 11 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.590
 research videos including photos 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.330
 and unused captures warning the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.789
 names of the photos may have 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.450
 strange names from random numbers 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.340
 until the words I thought of this gems or 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.760
 trolling will take you to download a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.950
 letter 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.380
 unzip it with fanar images of 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 gravity false and another link will take them to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.090
 download a folder unzip it with 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.220
 gravity false music are actually 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.410
 many covers of the intro said folder 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.260
 contains the song you hear now 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.510
 same and many more warnings in 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.760
 the folder unzip it from the music 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.010
 has two folders inside which 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.440
 they are divided a folder contains 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.840
 cover and songs that you can use as 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.210
 background music for some video since 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.940
 its free download from the page of the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.860
 author and another folder contains music and 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.679
 covers that were downloaded so 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.960
 illegal so to speak and other links them 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.540
 will go download the first season 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.790
 of false gravity in Latin Spanish 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.980
 miniseries viper the already inexplicable 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.680
 and mabel the teeth life to both in 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.300
 Spanish and finally two other links 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.780
 so that two videos are downloaded 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.160
 small gravity false pilot version 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.950
 thanks to these gifts this is the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.500
 title of this part past gift and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.510
 future how many have felt that the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.090
 official clubs and the squid officer 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.910
 have a homosexual relationship 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.819
 something discreet and what the hell it looks like 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.819
 both were Mexican police 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.680
 corrupt, useless, foolish adults 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.750
 agreement attention to all units 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.750
 estimated in a whole melon in its 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.750
 mouth I repeat 2016 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.959
 everyone remembers the tale of search for 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.150
 the blind of the dotcom in a paragraph of 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.459
 the story mentions that a character from 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.230
 the story cut off his ear because 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.349
 seem in the intro one ear appears in 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.780
 a glass jar in chapter 9 the 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.880
 time traveler pig when dipper and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.040
 mabel travel through time 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.650
 They visited gravity files in different 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.900
 times like in the time of the pioneer in 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.900
 the prehistoric era in a bygone era 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.760
 to the year 2000 and a very distant future the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.360
 baby of time as much as blending 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.670
 blandÃ­n are from the year 207 1012 that would say 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.620
 that in that year gravity false or not only 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.690
 gravity false may also be the 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.330
 world entered a war as well 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.120
 say it and a curious fact of that time 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.519
 futuristic the planet earth does not have two 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.130
 two moons and then in the future you can 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.470
 that we have a second moon 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.660
 in the episode the dipper mailbox the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.180
 guide to the inexplicable when mabel 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.340
 send a video of herself getting into 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.360
 Sweet worms in the nose 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.790
 the mailbox answers with the following 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.920
 your video of the gummies disturbed me and 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.750
 insulted are not worthy of my great 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.290
 wisdom the age of enlightenment 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.080
 human will never get there that's weird anymore 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.989
 that the most logical thing is who has 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.269
 answered that message is a thousand schiffer 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.850
 since this guy knows everything about 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.740
 everything at any time and place or could 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.360
 have been the baby of time since 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.120
 presents the qualities before 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.190
 mentioned and it's also weird because the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.980
 answer that came to dipper mabel and his 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.350
 after the video is similar to what 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.139
 says the diary number 3 on the plane of 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.240
 portal construction 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.699
 your video of the quotes disturbed me and 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.530
 insulted me are not worthy of my great 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.620
 wisdom the age of enlightenment 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.419
 human will never come there is a 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.669
 contradiction in gravity false with 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.560
 regarding timelines as 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.539
 in chapter iv being a traveler 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.779
 time blending landing says that 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.729
 comes from the year 207 thousand 12 while 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.039
 Chapter mailbox when editing 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.199
 I asked in what years to end the world the 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.749
 response he receives says the world 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.210
 it will end in the year 3000 12 this would 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:12.219
 the question if humanity came to 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.590
 live on another planet since the earth 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:23.560
 stopped presenting optimal conditions 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:25.750
 for the existence of the world with 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.029
 about the chapter the hand that rocked 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.430
 mabel the title and some of the plot is 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:33.250
 based on an old movie called 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.960
 the hand that rocks the cradle 'thanks for 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.999
 see now if the last emission of the 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.490
 first inspiration for the series 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:41.490
 gravity false until next time 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.560
 plus 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:04.360
 for me
