so let's just go over here and so you're
gonna<00:00:55.150> need<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.770> cobblestone<00:00:57.060> five<00:00:58.060> redstone

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
gonna need to cobblestone five redstone

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.660 
gonna need to cobblestone five redstone
or<00:00:59.530> actually<00:00:59.920> it's<00:01:00.010> gonna<00:01:00.130> be<00:01:00.220> six<00:01:00.580> redstone

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
or actually it's gonna be six redstone

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.390 
or actually it's gonna be six redstone
to<00:01:03.670> power<00:01:04.090> railed<00:01:04.480> and<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.470> sticky<00:01:05.740> piston<00:01:06.190> it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
to power railed and a sticky piston it

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.540 
to power railed and a sticky piston it
has<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.820> be<00:01:06.910> a<00:01:06.940> sticky<00:01:07.240> cast<00:01:07.540> piston<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.550> I'll

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
has to be a sticky cast piston and I'll

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.270 
has to be a sticky cast piston and I'll
show<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:09.790> why

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
so basically well that this part will go

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.750 
so basically well that this part will go
right<00:01:16.390> here<00:01:16.660> you're<00:01:17.620> gonna<00:01:17.740> have<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:18.070> pick<00:01:18.460> it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
right here you're gonna have to pick it

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.020 
right here you're gonna have to pick it
up

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
gonna have to make it block and wide it

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.320 
gonna have to make it block and wide it
actually<00:01:24.250> doesn't<00:01:24.430> have<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.700> be<00:01:24.820> cobblestone

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
actually doesn't have to be cobblestone

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330 
actually doesn't have to be cobblestone
itself<00:01:25.660> but<00:01:26.020> what<00:01:26.350> you're<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.770> what

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
place the redstone torch just like it

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.010 
place the redstone torch just like it
well<00:01:30.490> pretty<00:01:30.910> much<00:01:31.060> exactly<00:01:31.390> how<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.750> is<00:01:31.869> over

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
well pretty much exactly how it is over

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.090 
well pretty much exactly how it is over
there

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
there

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.249 
there
the<00:01:33.369> whole<00:01:33.520> thing<00:01:33.790> just<00:01:34.119> showing<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.660> easier

the whole thing just showing it easier

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.030 
the whole thing just showing it easier
step<00:01:36.070> by<00:01:36.190> step<00:01:36.460> close<00:01:36.970> up<00:01:37.380> place<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.619> two

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
step by step close up place the two

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.460 
step by step close up place the two
redstone<00:01:39.520> on<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.759> top<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.330> these<00:01:40.900> connecting

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
redstone on the top and these connecting

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.890 
redstone on the top and these connecting
to<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.710> torches<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.670> you're<00:01:43.240> actually<00:01:43.360> I

forgot about this we're actually gonna
need<00:01:45.580> six<00:01:46.509> redstone<00:01:47.050> not<00:01:47.380> five<00:01:47.619> six

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
need six redstone not five six

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.469 
need six redstone not five six
so<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.390> want<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.659> put<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.170> piston<00:01:52.070> here<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.670> I

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
so you want to put the piston here and I

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.420 
so you want to put the piston here and I
accidentally<00:01:53.960> gave<00:01:54.170> all<00:01:54.440> my<00:01:54.470> power<00:01:55.159> around

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
here you're gonna need to power rail

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.530 
here you're gonna need to power rail
power<00:02:00.020> rails<00:02:00.500> my<00:02:01.159> bad<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.060> you're<00:02:02.210> gonna<00:02:02.300> want

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.499 
to place it like this it must be sticky
because<00:02:06.650> with<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.009> regular<00:02:07.460> piston<00:02:07.729> it's<00:02:08.179> just

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
because with a regular piston it's just

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.330 
because with a regular piston it's just
an<00:02:08.630> end<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.929> pushing<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> block<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.190> it's

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
an end of pushing the block and it's

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.920 
an end of pushing the block and it's
never<00:02:10.550> gonna<00:02:10.700> bring<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.420> back<00:02:11.570> because<00:02:11.720> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
never gonna bring it back because the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.970 
never gonna bring it back because the
sticky<00:02:12.170> piston<00:02:12.590> off

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
sticky piston off

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.240 
sticky piston off
it<00:02:13.220> pushes<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.180> since<00:02:14.630> it's<00:02:14.810> sticky<00:02:15.250> it

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
it pushes but since it's sticky it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.350 
it pushes but since it's sticky it
brings<00:02:16.550> them<00:02:16.670> right<00:02:16.730> back

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
brings them right back

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.260 
brings them right back
and<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:18.860> connect<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.520> right<00:02:20.000> there

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
and so just connect it and right there

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.590 
and so just connect it and right there
you<00:02:20.569> have<00:02:20.720> your<00:02:20.780> unlimited<00:02:21.650> power<00:02:22.100> rail

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600
