trying to do is lead the stroke with my
piling<00:01:15.780> side<00:01:15.960> head<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:17.400> order<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.909> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
piling side head and in order to do that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.830 
piling side head and in order to do that
I<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:18.689> driving<00:01:19.020> my<00:01:19.430> inside<00:01:20.430> leg

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
I can think about driving my inside leg

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
I can think about driving my inside leg
forward<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.520> when<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> rotate

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
forward so on like this when I rotate

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
forward so on like this when I rotate
and<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.600> set<00:01:24.900> my<00:01:25.020> blade<00:01:25.259> my<00:01:25.439> poly<00:01:25.740> side

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
and you can set my blade my poly side

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.499 
and you can set my blade my poly side
leg<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.540> bent<00:01:27.540> my<00:01:27.750> inside<00:01:28.080> leg<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.470> straighter

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
leg is bent my inside leg is straighter

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.719 
leg is bent my inside leg is straighter
after<00:01:30.509> completing<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.310> just<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.490> little

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
after completing this just this little

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.740 
after completing this just this little
bit<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> girl<00:01:33.450> my<00:01:34.200> hips<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.890> legs<00:01:35.100> should<00:01:35.310> be

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
bit of girl my hips my legs should be

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
bit of girl my hips my legs should be
changed<00:01:36.750> position<00:01:37.229> notice<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.890> dolly

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
changed position notice that my dolly

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.969
