00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.020
 hydrated 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.979
 in addition it stimulates the growth of 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.959
 hair renewal and protects the 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.560
 sun because of the ingredients that it 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.630

 We use it because we're going to do it. 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.330
 a quick thing to use will not go 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.130

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.460

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.950

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.350
 specified, including all 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.690
 ingredients which are the properties 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.300
 of the ingredients that we are going to use 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.270
 People are going to use half a banana. 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.130
 I use a half avocado but you can 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.650
 use a half- room because I know it's the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.330
 bacacheri in brazil is a little bigger than 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.790
 I have here a box him through 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.390
 to eliminate israel 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.110
 if I do not mistake the cinnamon for more or 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.750
 minus one tablespoon of cinnamon 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.620
 it helps to take the scent of the gem of 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.880
 egg we go there and it is also 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.500
 stimulant for the scalp to 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.860
 who wants the hair to grow more 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.019
 Fast there is great is the egg yolk you 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.430
 There are many people who are disgusted but do not have 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.560
 need only has one thing that people 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.680
 account has no problem to 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.090
 to pass on her hair and she beyond all 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.769
 nutrients is she has that had 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.890
 extremely restructuring for 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.209
 hair then it's worth you to put 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.220
 under the difference 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:58.569
 used two tablespoons of oil 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:03.129
 lime that also very nutrient 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.019
 two tablespoons of vinegar the end 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.100
 it will brighten you up and will help 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:12.880
 regulate a little bit of hair 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.930
 I'm using neglect in the apple area 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.110
 in the case of the boat mask the vinegar and 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.760
 balsamic vinegar has dark and thin 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.070
 Italian 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.270
 When I do it for me I use it on 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.660
 agrival sam michael 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.150
 but like everyone else to make it easier for me 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.560
 I know that we ourselves are not 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.300
 with facility in Brazil every year 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.560
 in the big apple was beaten in the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:42.420
 blender until it turns into a cream but there 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:47.170
 much easier to get through the hair 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:50.080
 had one of the goals and I will add 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.930
 pepper to recommend you to 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.760
 do a test if you are not allergic to me 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.110
 I have no problem with this and the 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.360
 first I put the first one 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.460
 I put the use in the same food kitchen 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.100
 that I put in the eye knows that there are 40 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.380
 days 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.090
 even with some spoonful of coffee and 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.340
 in my case I put essential oil 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.220
 cinnamon five drops of essential oil 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.230
 to increase the effect of the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.730
 cinnamon like you do not have 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.100
 no problem with cinnamon and the first 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.610
 oxygen shop for blood 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.410
 surface of the skin and help oxygenate 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.760
 path of state of children's health 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:36.430
 of the rivers and also the 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.660
 remembering that this is a premask 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.570
 shampoo 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.150
 so it is very valuable and you will 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:48.790
 use her to discuss dinner eca 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.650
 so I do it so I just go away 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:59.440
 to be easier to distribute 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:06:00.760
 masks world to be able to help us 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.250
 ingredients that we put 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.040
 Procopio was also so I spend 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.190
 enough on his lap and makes a pass 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.280
 put a touch and left 40 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.640
 - and then there the hair usually with 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.930
 shampoo conditioner and sergio hair from 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.630
 that if you 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.640
 ck the husband if you want to make a brush 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.870
 the day you finish the hair 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.430
 said to be accustomed 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.880
 It's just that you need to do it. 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.920
 before shampoos and will not take away the 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.110
 excess in her hair not by her 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.220
 worrying because it is very valuable 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.890
 So there's no way you can do it. 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.590
 mask after the ground as take off 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.970
 with water because your hair is never 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.580
 extremely valuable 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.890
 so I'm super liked that 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.540
 I hope that you make a recipe there. 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.330
 you do leave here in the comments 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.360
