00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.910
 what to do with the stress in which you live 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.579
 it also has to do with the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.219
 pollution with noise and good I'll 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.530
 I'm going to give you a wonderful recipe today 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.760
 you will love it and it is a game is very 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.510
 easy to prepare 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.970
 it is a juice vÃ­ctor that is to say there was 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.350
 detoxifier here I already have the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.670
 ingredients and it is very easy the only thing that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.070
 you need is to have a blender have 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.610
 good water drinking water of course are 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.950
 this is this recipe is for four 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.300
 for four glasses we will incorporate in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.300
 the blender 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 First 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 two 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.210
 3 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.560
 4 for your water acts 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.549
 spinach is very important that the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.950
 is first and then disinfects it there 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.320
 these droplets of iodine that you put them 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.970
 you leave 10 minutes and from vat to disinfect 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.909
 will kill any type of germ 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.009
 virus how different from disinfected 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.310
 for 10 minutes and good here is the 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.310
 spinach 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.460
 what I'm doing is boeing doing it 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.200
 at once because if this is not going to 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.890
 complicate a little bit because it 's pretty 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.890
 and this glass only for a liter looks 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.450
 I imagine they are actions but good 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.739
 and we are going to liquefy 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.750
 color this green bottle this is good 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.750
 son how rich is total popeye 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.980
 popeye 100% we will incorporate 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.980
 now we put cucumber too 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.950
 the amounts you will see there already 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.600
 written so that you do not have very 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.880
 present and we return as 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.490
 I do all this in steps so that you 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.990
 perfectly account of the 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.440
 ingredients and you are incorporating little to 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:18.010
 little and not doing all of the blow too 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.550
 let's put celery celery is 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.930
 very rich and we put this amount of 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.250
 celery and we do the same again 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.250
 we liquefy again 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:37.830
 free clean in asia the orientals 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.620
 like in ginger and then by 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.810
 course of their meals for question 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.900
 digestive and blood cleansing that 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.319
 is this is life we put it and the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.319
 smoothies 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.459
 it smells now if I hold strength already 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.290
 ginger incorporates all 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.600
 ingredients and gave him all this strength 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.819
 of which I am telling you this is the 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.650
 power of toks and we all lack what 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.310
 latest 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.770
 we need the juice of a lemon you have your 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.750
 squeezer 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.640

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.640
 little seed and good 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:30.550
 in combination all this already with lemon 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.550
 already makes this powerful recipe 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.480
 and finally we go back to liquefying 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:46.180

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.180
