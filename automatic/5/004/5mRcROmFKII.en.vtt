00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 nice guys, here I am not among you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.099
 if not the manga jons and sorry for 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.250
 the wait that had the flu but 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.320
 here I am back with a new video and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 today I will show you something called 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 all ag switch in this case will be 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.380
 let's say a home lag switch in the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.359
 sense that we can all have what it is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.150
 first of all the lag seal the la 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.420
 switch is something by which 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.329
 we can only do if we are hosts 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.829
 I can not make it a match either in 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.239
 private or in public 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.489
 Well today to my shock colleague and we'll do 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.100
 see in private because there is when 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
 online on published maybe it would take 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.530
 quite a while 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.260
 well to the gay here we have as well 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.800
 assignee when we do not hunt him 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.059
 because it is always a part is always a 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.160
 extra player I went in via game 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.949
 you can put any mode you want 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.490
 in facts or old team methods is 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.500
 the same will not change much 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.049
 the important thing that you do this you have to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.780
 crush now I also after during the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.259
 ride the vérité facebook to do the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.049
 lag switch you have to have like mine 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.579

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.540

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.770
 flower completely I do what the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.119
 race ahead of me 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.880
 some wonder what it can do 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.420
 this thing well this is touched to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.420

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.790

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.210
 half and in front of me 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.160

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.090
 when I decide my salary 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.520

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.080
 he is stalking the stalker went like cabbage 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.460
 you want to say ok choc but tt that forward 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.410
 to the team I tell you I move ok 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.110
 what I say then as it does meanwhile 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.520
 dishes vella judges go to start 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.490
 friends 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.960
 ok move right and left like 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.360
 you see going on facebook laga where 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.030
 net you see at least some screen that 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.370
 is flooding sack shock and of course 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.340
 he cannot confirm his ag, however, you 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.060
 more or less you see it try to jump and 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.600
 shock here seems to use the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.980
 teleportation for speed of light 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.740
 well I would say that this video is 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.600
 practically finished 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.810
 so we can say that this is the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.780
 of switches shown militates from middle age 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.290
 mode gaios so if I had said this 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.540
 the of switch and precisely that liked the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.310
 video on how to use it and how 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.290
 take advantage of this if you want it deserves a lot 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.350
 I like it and subscribe to the channel for 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.310
 to know new glitches that I will show you in 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.310
 beautiful future
