00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hey people i know since a felt 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.850
 eternity again with dm and I have 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.160
 such cool spring-like stuff 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.380
 bought and they are all in this bag 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.599
 in here and I would say I show 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.490
 Just what I bought something like this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.379
 you first I looked at his country 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 Stop the burghof all again 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.590
 I really have to take them with me 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.359
 a year not at all in the third video 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.130
 shown and in me I have this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.380
 Forgot to know but I have then 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.699
 seen and now and the desire for it 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.980
 and I think I will 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
 make dinner for me today or 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 I also entered 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.850
 bought thick juice I love this stuff 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.100
 really without end i like him will 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.180
 consistency really likes that tastes like that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.640
 good was too quark or müli in and yes 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 that's why it had to go with me and me 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 I think I have determined this year 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.670
 already at least three packs of it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 I also used cd 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.629
 such a mini geo I like 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.190
 videos of which really like 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.739
 that's the fragrance now 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.359
 Waterline and it smells really good 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.690
 fresh and I have the feeling that 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.610
 the cdu really help that one 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.140
 not so much sweats and the biggest 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.360
 I actually think that's the best for me 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.520
 Handbag and that's why it had to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.790
 with one more thing from cd that really 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 with was this shower gel or is called 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.009
 that you are spritzing and that is in the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.409
 scent rhubarb and it lies 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.340
 really as delicious as such a discount 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.509
 roll that you can kick somewhere 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.390
 I am looking forward to taking a shower 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.549
 and that's why I just wanted that too 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 take with you and again two nails 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.030
 Products taken because my nails 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.670
 at the moment I look okay 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.880
 just a mix of nails was 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.619
 some are still on it and yes 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240
 I sometimes catch you a bit 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.220
 to get back to me 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.200
 really disturbs world so you still have 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.270
 more tips against nail biting that writes 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.490
 like my comments but i have mine 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.479
 once the color sup shows of food 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.490
 I always wanted to take that with me 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.189
 have and I think that's one 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.930
 great green tone somehow and then have 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.229
 I still remember this light blue of p2 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.909
 taken in the color remember me and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.649
 I think that's very nice, above all 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.090
 for spring now I should have once 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.970
 I'll be glad of this again 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.800
 stay up light up n take me 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.080
 I used to like to wear it 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.090
 therefore really soft and above all very much 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.190
 good if you like the intimate angle or 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.800
 Apply on the waterline volt because 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.819
 he's not that tough and yes there 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.799
 I'm happy when I'm the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.120
 can then use my eyes 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.709
 just a little bit more 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.019
 you we have it if had such a 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.459
 a making of shadow cream taken away 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.500
 in the color thies 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.030
 that's just such a light blue and me 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.530
 think that looks pretty good, too 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.900
 nest especially in spring 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.670
 the eyes radiate a bit more 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.560
 because it's just so nice and dainty 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.540
 light blue is I have as well of 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.420
 East II two products taken once 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.440
 this miracle 3 shampoo and that's why 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.420
 I think so too in one 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.280
 seen my last videos and it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.799
 I think that's really good, above all 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.720
 There is a lot of volume in the hair 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.120
 and that really helps that fat one 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.129
 Unfortunately, the approach is to reduce 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.470
 smell now not so 100 percent 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.690
 but says I also find the size genuine 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.310
 perfect and maybe that's it 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.110
 I am relatively new to dm then 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.900
 again for this road here 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.459
 myth shampoo taken away and somehow 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.950
 far quite surprised when I later 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.769
 found that it was so after this 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.730
 cheap chewing gum the man should be his 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.319
 childhood knows 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.549
 I hope my hair does not feel like it 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.579
 will judge if I do that then 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.139
 use but to which I have only good 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.400
 is actually heard about this shampoo 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.870
 maybe you already have that 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.209
 sometimes you can use it 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.930
 your feedback so in the comments 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.220
 write 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.049
 I also have too many 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.299
 gaudy lips products taken 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.510
 one of manhattan's favorite 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.880
 lars three the number 43 h and it is 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.370
 really such a great choral iges 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.169
 I would say pink and had it right 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.120
 look forward to such a bright color 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.849
 The lips stars are the ones who think long 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.169
 and they do not smear that way 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.389
 I'm happy when I do that 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.829
 so in spring so when on my 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.389
 lips can still make a product 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.549
 Associations would have what I took 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.430
 is a perfect crime and care 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.769
 lipstick in this orange tone it is 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.750
 the number 34 English has no 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.639
 big names but I carry somehow 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.440
 orange really like spring and me 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.190
 have the feeling that orange on the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.049
 teeth 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.090
 makes it look a bit whiter and 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.799
 I've never had men before 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.139
 in a lipstick they were too 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.490
 not so expensive that's why I have that 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.690
 also taken and now I have 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.410
 also just on my lips so what 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.560
 something flashy and that's the color 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.150
 448 horror flourish by maybelline and 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.370
 yes that's just simply as a cora 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.500
 I really like that 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.790
 very nice for spring now 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.220
 I have two more things for you 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.520
 absolutely want to show off once from p2 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.729
 the bloody screams the compact blush in 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.680
 the color touch of very and that is so 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.630
 I have a lot of others 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.000
 youtuber already hear a huber talk 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.639
 and that 's just such a nice one 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.229
 blush with the slight shimmer proportion 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.900
 And I think in the spring sees this 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.000
 bronze is also very beautiful and that is 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.830
 also really wonderfully pigmented 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.270
 that's why it just did not have to 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.910
 one to the conclusion I've still here 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.060

 because I kinda felt like it 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.919
 sort out the make up and I am 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.630
 very curious how long that 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.430
 really holds and if it also my skin 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.470

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.570
