4g a we talked about this before the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.460 
4g a we talked about this before the
show<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:22.239> mean<00:02:22.390> he<00:02:22.510> can't<00:02:22.780> he's<00:02:23.019> not<00:02:23.230> going<00:02:23.410> to

be<00:02:23.560> able<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.800> guard<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.100> foreign<00:02:24.489> at<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.000> next

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
be able to guard a foreign at the next

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.699 
be able to guard a foreign at the next
level<00:02:25.360> yeah<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.019> that's<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:26.410> thing<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.680> always

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
level yeah and that's one thing I always

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.949 
level yeah and that's one thing I always
look<00:02:27.130> at<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.640> defend<00:02:27.910> that<00:02:28.030> position<00:02:28.180> but

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
look at can you defend that position but

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.390 
look at can you defend that position but
i<00:02:29.019> think<00:02:29.290> his<00:02:29.470> talents<00:02:30.040> are<00:02:30.130> going<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.310> be

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
i think his talents are going to be

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.250 
i think his talents are going to be
better<00:02:30.579> suited<00:02:30.850> at<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.150> small<00:02:31.390> forward<00:02:31.420> which

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
better suited at the small forward which

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.630 
better suited at the small forward which
also<00:02:32.470> means<00:02:32.620> he's<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.310> develop

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
also means he's going to have to develop

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.090 
also means he's going to have to develop
more<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:34.420> perimeter-oriented<00:02:35.290> game<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.980> so

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
more of a perimeter-oriented game and so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.410 
more of a perimeter-oriented game and so
I<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.459> don't<00:02:36.760> know<00:02:36.850> how<00:02:37.030> that's<00:02:37.239> going<00:02:37.360> to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
I I don't know how that's going to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.819 
I I don't know how that's going to
project<00:02:37.600> our<00:02:37.930> long-term<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> lot<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.709> it's

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
project our long-term a lot of it's

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.830 
project our long-term a lot of it's
going<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.040> depend<00:02:39.160> mad<00:02:39.820> also<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.329> the<00:02:40.480> system

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
going to depend mad also on the system

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.840 
going to depend mad also on the system
he<00:02:40.930> goes<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.620> personnel<00:02:42.340> he's<00:02:42.519> going<00:02:42.760> to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
he goes to the personnel he's going to

he goes to the personnel he's going to
be<00:02:42.940> playing<00:02:43.209> with<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.690> style<00:02:43.989> they<00:02:44.290> want<00:02:44.530> to

play so there's a lot that goes into it
in<00:02:47.049> determining<00:02:47.739> whether<00:02:47.829> or<00:02:47.950> not<00:02:48.040> Derek

many dynamic players and I think Kyrie

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.610 
many dynamic players and I think Kyrie
Irving<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.640> type<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.150> player<00:03:19.750> that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
Irving is the type of player that

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.490 
Irving is the type of player that
game<00:03:21.190> projects<00:03:21.640> nicely<00:03:22.209> at<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.870> next<00:03:23.140> level<00:03:23.319> I

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
game projects nicely at the next level I

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.440 
game projects nicely at the next level I
think<00:03:23.530> he<00:03:23.799> shoots<00:03:24.099> it<00:03:24.220> extremely<00:03:24.580> well<00:03:24.700> free

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
think he shoots it extremely well free

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.300 
think he shoots it extremely well free
throws<00:03:25.720> he's<00:03:26.290> also<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.650> lot<00:03:26.860> bigger<00:03:27.129> than

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
throws he's also a lot bigger than

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.559 
throws he's also a lot bigger than
people<00:03:27.670> give<00:03:27.790> him<00:03:27.879> credit<00:03:27.940> for<00:03:28.360> and

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
people give him credit for and

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.570 
people give him credit for and
athletically<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.560> think<00:03:29.890> he's<00:03:30.010> more<00:03:30.190> gifted

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
athletically I think he's more gifted

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.339 
athletically I think he's more gifted
than<00:03:30.640> people<00:03:31.030> think<00:03:31.239> here<00:03:31.659> again<00:03:31.780> are<00:03:32.080> David

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.390 
he's quite got all that in his game
apparently<00:05:35.300> he<00:05:35.389> does<00:05:35.599> yeah<00:05:35.900> but<00:05:36.830> but<00:05:37.250> I<00:05:37.280> do

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
apparently he does yeah but but I do

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.070 
apparently he does yeah but but I do
think<00:05:37.699> that<00:05:37.849> there's<00:05:38.419> potential<00:05:38.900> there<00:05:38.930> for

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
think that there's potential there for

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.260 
think that there's potential there for
him<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.470> become<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:40.039> guy<00:05:40.520> that<00:05:40.550> could<00:05:40.909> be<00:05:41.090> in

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
him to become a guy that could be in

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.870 
him to become a guy that could be in
your<00:05:41.330> rotation<00:05:42.199> and<00:05:42.440> in<00:05:42.590> via<00:05:42.800> gadgets<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.520> think

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
your rotation and in via gadgets I think

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.820 
your rotation and in via gadgets I think
serviceable<00:05:44.599> because<00:05:45.169> this<00:05:45.319> is<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.470> draft

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
serviceable because this is a draft

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.050 
serviceable because this is a draft
where<00:05:45.979> you're<00:05:46.099> not<00:05:46.250> necessarily<00:05:46.610> looking<00:05:46.909> at

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
where you're not necessarily looking at

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.820 
where you're not necessarily looking at
superstar<00:05:47.630> Talent<00:05:47.840> but<00:05:48.380> you're<00:05:48.530> looking<00:05:48.740> at

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
superstar Talent but you're looking at

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.260 
superstar Talent but you're looking at
guys<00:05:48.949> that<00:05:49.009> can<00:05:49.340> be<00:05:49.490> in<00:05:49.610> your<00:05:49.729> rotation<00:05:50.150> and

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
guys that can be in your rotation and

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.520 
guys that can be in your rotation and
remember<00:05:50.570> he's<00:05:50.690> coming<00:05:50.960> off<00:05:51.050> a<00:05:51.080> season<00:05:51.289> in

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
remember he's coming off a season in

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.290 
remember he's coming off a season in
which<00:05:51.590> he<00:05:51.740> did<00:05:51.919> not<00:05:52.039> play<00:05:52.280> at<00:05:52.490> all<00:05:52.610> at<00:05:52.820> Kentucky

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
which he did not play at all at Kentucky

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.140 
which he did not play at all at Kentucky
because<00:05:53.599> of<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.870> ineligibility<00:05:54.880> NCAA<00:05:55.880> ruled

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
because of the ineligibility NCAA ruled

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.909 
because of the ineligibility NCAA ruled
he<00:05:56.300> had<00:05:56.419> taken<00:05:56.599> money<00:05:56.960> enough<00:05:57.349> money<00:05:57.560> from<00:05:57.710> his

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
he had taken money enough money from his

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.499 
he had taken money enough money from his
Turkish<00:05:58.340> pro<00:05:58.610> club<00:05:58.849> which<00:05:59.060> makes<00:05:59.300> sense

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
Turkish pro club which makes sense

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.719 
Turkish pro club which makes sense
they're<00:05:59.719> a<00:05:59.750> pro<00:05:59.960> club<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:01.070> could<00:06:01.310> not<00:06:01.460> play

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
they're a pro club and could not play

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.969 
they're a pro club and could not play
there<00:06:01.909> so<00:06:02.060> he's<00:06:02.180> had<00:06:02.300> a<00:06:02.330> long<00:06:02.630> layoff<00:06:03.110> you<00:06:03.770> saw

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
there so he's had a long layoff you saw

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.129 
there so he's had a long layoff you saw
David<00:06:04.340> Aldridge's<00:06:04.820> list<00:06:05.120> on<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.599> top<00:06:05.840> five

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
agree with me here because it's a point

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.920 
agree with me here because it's a point
guard<00:06:16.580> that's<00:06:16.909> got<00:06:17.120> to<00:06:17.300> be<00:06:17.419> there<00:06:17.630> Kemba

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
guard that's got to be there Kemba

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.540 
guard that's got to be there Kemba
Walker<00:06:17.960> yeah<00:06:18.740> I<00:06:18.770> don't<00:06:19.159> think<00:06:19.310> there's<00:06:19.430> any

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
Walker yeah I don't think there's any

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.790 
Walker yeah I don't think there's any
way<00:06:19.580> I<00:06:19.699> look<00:06:19.880> I'm<00:06:20.180> a<00:06:20.210> huge<00:06:20.719> quiet<00:06:21.139> Leonard<00:06:21.560> fan

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
way I look I'm a huge quiet Leonard fan

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.980 
way I look I'm a huge quiet Leonard fan
but<00:06:22.520> I<00:06:22.550> don't<00:06:22.789> necessarily<00:06:23.330> look<00:06:23.569> at<00:06:23.719> him<00:06:23.870> as

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
but I don't necessarily look at him as

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.350 
but I don't necessarily look at him as
being<00:06:24.139> a<00:06:24.409> top<00:06:24.800> five<00:06:25.130> talent<00:06:25.669> I<00:06:25.819> think<00:06:26.060> Kemba

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
being a top five talent I think Kemba

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.540 
being a top five talent I think Kemba
Walker<00:06:26.389> is<00:06:26.900> a<00:06:26.930> guy<00:06:27.259> of<00:06:27.680> all<00:06:28.009> these<00:06:28.280> players

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
Walker is a guy of all these players

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.920 
Walker is a guy of all these players
that<00:06:28.729> we're<00:06:28.880> talking<00:06:29.030> about<00:06:29.330> i<00:06:29.360> think<00:06:29.690> maybe

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
that we're talking about i think maybe

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.200 
that we're talking about i think maybe
ready<00:06:30.409> to<00:06:30.889> have<00:06:31.069> the<00:06:31.190> biggest<00:06:31.340> impact<00:06:31.699> from

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
ready to have the biggest impact from

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.550 
ready to have the biggest impact from
day<00:06:32.449> one<00:06:32.780> you<00:06:33.020> know<00:06:33.139> the<00:06:33.259> other<00:06:33.409> advantage

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
day one you know the other advantage

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.490

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
he's got he's also an upperclassman

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.409 
he's got he's also an upperclassman
