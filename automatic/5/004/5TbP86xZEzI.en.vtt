00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
their wet vacuum system we're also gonna

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.700 
their wet vacuum system we're also gonna
combine<00:00:17.510> the<00:00:18.510> Aqua<00:00:18.779> max<00:00:18.990> product<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:19.590> their

combine the Aqua max product with their
wet<00:00:19.859> vac

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.380 

well<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.430> we're<00:00:26.580> showing<00:00:26.730> today<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.119> we're

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
well what we're showing today is we're

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.320 
well what we're showing today is we're
showing<00:00:27.539> how<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.400> recycle<00:00:29.400> slurry<00:00:30.090> when

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
showing how to recycle slurry when

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.040 
showing how to recycle slurry when
you're<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.540> job<00:00:30.930> site<00:00:31.340> using<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> W<00:00:33.360> 2000

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you're on a job site using the W 2000

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.890 
you're on a job site using the W 2000
from<00:00:34.230> air<00:00:34.440> mater<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.489> aqua<00:00:36.030> max<00:00:36.270> from<00:00:36.600> gel

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
from air mater and the aqua max from gel

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.369 
from air mater and the aqua max from gel
max<00:00:37.220> so<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.460> simple<00:00:38.790> process<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.200> as

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
max so the simple process is is that as

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.110 
max so the simple process is is that as
the<00:00:40.559> slurry<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> ground<00:00:41.519> we're<00:00:42.000> going

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the slurry is on the ground we're going

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:52.460 
the slurry is on the ground we're going
to<00:00:42.210> collect<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.019> with<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> vacuum<00:00:43.739> system

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.220 

and<00:00:52.560> as<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.340> gel<00:00:53.610> max<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.150> making<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:54.840> product

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and as the gel max is making the product

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
and as the gel max is making the product
settle<00:00:55.650> we're<00:00:55.980> pulling<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.580> cleaner<00:00:56.820> water

off<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:57.690> top<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:59.190> basically<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.970> solid

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
off the top you basically have a solid

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.690 
off the top you basically have a solid
and<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.750> our<00:01:00.870> product<00:01:01.290> wraps<00:01:02.040> itself<00:01:02.490> around

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
and in our product wraps itself around

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.660 
and in our product wraps itself around
the<00:01:03.390> concrete<00:01:04.020> solid<00:01:04.230> and<00:01:04.620> makes<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.400> larger

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the concrete solid and makes it larger

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.840 
the concrete solid and makes it larger
and<00:01:06.120> heavier<00:01:06.300> so<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> sinks<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.440> bottom

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
and heavier so it sinks to the bottom

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.300 
and heavier so it sinks to the bottom
