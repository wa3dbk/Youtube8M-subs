for me because he just kind of flew
right<00:02:19.650> over<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:20.010> battlefield<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.239> makes

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
right over the battlefield and it makes

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.160 
right over the battlefield and it makes
it<00:02:21.570> very<00:02:21.690> easy<00:02:21.959> for<00:02:22.140> me<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.709> pick<00:02:22.920> them<00:02:23.040> off<00:02:24.170> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it very easy for me to pick them off a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.140 
it very easy for me to pick them off a
little<00:02:25.530> little<00:02:26.160> detective<00:02:26.730> i<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.120> use

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
little little detective i like to use

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.360 
little little detective i like to use
when<00:02:27.870> i'm<00:02:27.989> fighting<00:02:28.380> against<00:02:28.590> other<00:02:28.860> choppers

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
when i'm fighting against other choppers

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.610 
when i'm fighting against other choppers
if<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.150> get<00:02:30.300> close<00:02:30.540> enough<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.080> them<00:02:31.200> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
if you get close enough to them it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770 
if you get close enough to them it
doesn't<00:02:32.400> matter<00:02:32.489> how<00:02:32.730> fast<00:02:33.090> or<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.570> they<00:02:33.660> have

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
doesn't matter how fast or if they have

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.530 
doesn't matter how fast or if they have
flares<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:34.200> not<00:02:34.380> they<00:02:35.160> can't<00:02:35.640> really<00:02:35.970> react

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
flares or not they can't really react

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.270 
flares or not they can't really react
fast<00:02:36.840> enough<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.610> flare<00:02:38.610> way<00:02:38.850> your<00:02:39.060> missiles

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
fast enough to flare way your missiles

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.650 
fast enough to flare way your missiles
so<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.400> you've<00:02:41.489> got<00:02:41.519> balls<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:42.030> steel<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.540> can

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
so if you've got balls of steel you can

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.420 
so if you've got balls of steel you can
land<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:43.080> chopper<00:02:43.500> or<00:02:43.620> these<00:02:43.860> hover<00:02:44.190> right

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.039 
chopper the best idea is to fire one
missile<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.880> he<00:04:17.970> wastes<00:04:18.299> as<00:04:18.389> flares<00:04:18.750> and

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
missile so that he wastes as flares and

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.420 
missile so that he wastes as flares and
then<00:04:19.260> by<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.410> time<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.889> get<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.130> use<00:04:20.400> your

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
then by the time you get to use your

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.540 
then by the time you get to use your
second<00:04:21.260> volley<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.410> missiles<00:04:22.560> your<00:04:23.190> first

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
second volley of missiles your first

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.430 
second volley of missiles your first
missile<00:04:24.240> will<00:04:24.330> have<00:04:24.630> reloaded<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.320> have

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
missile will have reloaded so you have

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:34.930 
missile will have reloaded so you have
two<00:04:25.680> missiles<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.400> shoot<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.729> guy

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
he's firing a way off over the side and

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.290 
he's firing a way off over the side and
you<00:05:00.380> might<00:05:00.530> think<00:05:00.710> oh<00:05:00.950> no<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.310> need<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.460> turn

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
you might think oh no you need to turn

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.180 
you might think oh no you need to turn
the<00:05:02.390> chopper<00:05:02.720> so<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:02.930> can<00:05:03.080> see<00:05:03.230> better<00:05:03.380> but<00:05:04.100> if

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
the chopper so you can see better but if

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.860 
the chopper so you can see better but if
we<00:05:04.220> actually<00:05:04.370> look<00:05:04.610> at<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.880> little<00:05:05.240> box<00:05:05.540> with

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
we actually look at the little box with

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.570 
we actually look at the little box with
a<00:05:05.900> square<00:05:06.200> inside<00:05:06.530> if<00:05:06.650> it's<00:05:06.800> moving<00:05:06.950> around<00:05:07.220> he

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
a square inside if it's moving around he

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.430 
a square inside if it's moving around he
was<00:05:07.730> he<00:05:08.060> actually<00:05:08.240> had<00:05:08.540> a<00:05:08.570> perfectly<00:05:09.080> clear

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
was he actually had a perfectly clear

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.420 
was he actually had a perfectly clear
shot<00:05:09.740> what<00:05:10.190> he<00:05:10.250> was<00:05:10.370> trying<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.550> shoot<00:05:10.700> at

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.120 

so<00:05:18.030> this<00:05:18.150> next<00:05:18.300> clip<00:05:18.540> is<00:05:18.600> just<00:05:18.900> about<00:05:19.440> knowing

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
so this next clip is just about knowing

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.220 
so this next clip is just about knowing
your<00:05:20.340> chopper<00:05:20.850> your<00:05:21.240> chopper<00:05:21.630> can<00:05:21.870> take<00:05:22.020> quite

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
your chopper your chopper can take quite

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.140 
your chopper your chopper can take quite
a<00:05:22.350> bit<00:05:22.470> of<00:05:22.530> damage<00:05:22.620> before<00:05:23.610> word<00:05:24.000> actually

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
a bit of damage before word actually

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.880 
a bit of damage before word actually
crashes<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.110> this<00:05:25.290> is<00:05:25.410> just<00:05:25.500> sort<00:05:25.710> of<00:05:25.800> a

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
crashes and this is just sort of a

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.100 
crashes and this is just sort of a
non-league<00:05:26.220> plate<00:05:26.520> but<00:05:26.730> if<00:05:27.060> you<00:05:27.450> land<00:05:27.840> your

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
non-league plate but if you land your

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.530 
non-league plate but if you land your
chopper<00:05:28.590> right<00:05:29.580> on<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.760> skin<00:05:29.970> can<00:05:30.180> see<00:05:30.360> here<00:05:30.510> I

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
chopper right on the skin can see here I

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.090 
chopper right on the skin can see here I
get<00:05:30.810> unlucky<00:05:31.080> in<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.410> chopper<00:05:31.680> rolls<00:05:31.920> over

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
get unlucky in the chopper rolls over

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.250 
get unlucky in the chopper rolls over
and<00:05:32.280> killed<00:05:32.550> me<00:05:32.700> but<00:05:33.420> if<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.750> land<00:05:34.140> your

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
and killed me but if you land your

and killed me but if you land your
chopper<00:05:34.620> flat<00:05:34.950> on<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.220> skids<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.820> actually

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
chopper flat on the skids it actually

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.420 
chopper flat on the skids it actually
won't<00:05:36.480> take<00:05:36.780> any<00:05:36.960> damages<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.590> skids<00:05:37.890> aren't

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
won't take any damages the skids aren't

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.190 
won't take any damages the skids aren't
part<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.060> your<00:05:39.240> vehicle<00:05:39.660> so<00:05:39.870> they<00:05:40.020> don't

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
part of your vehicle so they don't

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.720 
part of your vehicle so they don't
really<00:05:40.290> they<00:05:40.650> don't<00:05:40.680> take<00:05:40.980> damage<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.550> if<00:05:41.640> you

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
really they don't take damage and if you

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.860 
really they don't take damage and if you
land<00:05:42.510> an<00:05:42.840> odd<00:05:43.470> angle<00:05:43.880> you're<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:45.450> roll

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
land an odd angle you're and you roll

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.570 
land an odd angle you're and you roll
forward<00:05:46.320> you'll<00:05:46.500> actually<00:05:46.650> hit<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.370> notes

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
forward you'll actually hit the notes

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.010 
forward you'll actually hit the notes
onto<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.030> ground<00:05:48.240> and<00:05:48.390> take<00:05:48.510> damage<00:05:49.700> if<00:05:50.700> you

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
onto the ground and take damage if you

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.480 
onto the ground and take damage if you
like<00:05:52.020> in<00:05:52.170> this<00:05:52.320> in<00:05:52.530> this<00:05:52.710> earlier<00:05:53.250> in<00:05:53.400> this

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
like in this in this earlier in this

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.910 
like in this in this earlier in this
video<00:05:53.610> i<00:05:53.870> use<00:05:54.870> my<00:05:55.050> flavors<00:05:55.470> on<00:05:55.590> the<00:05:55.680> first

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
video i use my flavors on the first

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.800 
video i use my flavors on the first
missiles<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:56.760> i<00:05:57.060> knew<00:05:57.270> i<00:05:57.300> was<00:05:57.510> going<00:05:57.600> to<00:05:57.660> be

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810

missiles and i knew i was going to be
hit<00:05:57.990> by<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:58.230> second<00:05:58.740> set<00:05:58.920> of<00:05:59.010> myself<00:05:59.310> so<00:06:00.210> i

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
hit by the second set of myself so i

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.970 
hit by the second set of myself so i
flew<00:06:00.600> up<00:06:00.750> in<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:00.900> air<00:06:00.960> because<00:06:01.260> you<00:06:01.830> don't

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
flew up in the air because you don't

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.440 
flew up in the air because you don't
want<00:06:02.100> to<00:06:02.160> get<00:06:02.280> hit<00:06:02.490> by<00:06:02.730> a<00:06:02.760> missile<00:06:02.970> and<00:06:03.330> then

want to get hit by a missile and then

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.880 
want to get hit by a missile and then
knocked<00:06:03.720> a<00:06:03.870> little<00:06:04.050> to<00:06:04.140> the<00:06:04.200> side<00:06:04.410> right<00:06:04.740> as

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
knocked a little to the side right as

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.110 
knocked a little to the side right as
you're<00:06:04.980> going<00:06:05.130> between<00:06:05.280> trees<00:06:05.700> or<00:06:05.820> something

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
you're going between trees or something

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.000 
you're going between trees or something
or<00:06:06.240> really<00:06:06.540> close<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.780> the<00:06:06.840> ground<00:06:06.960> you<00:06:07.860> want

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
or really close to the ground you want

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.650 
or really close to the ground you want
to<00:06:08.070> try<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:08.220> stay<00:06:08.490> away<00:06:08.760> from<00:06:08.790> objects<00:06:09.450> if<00:06:09.570> you

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
to try to stay away from objects if you

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.150 
to try to stay away from objects if you
know<00:06:09.810> you're<00:06:09.930> going<00:06:09.960> to<00:06:10.110> get<00:06:10.200> hit<00:06:10.440> soon<00:06:10.710> fly<00:06:11.010> up

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
know you're going to get hit soon fly up

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.850 
know you're going to get hit soon fly up
a<00:06:11.250> little<00:06:11.460> bit

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.950 

and<00:06:18.860> so<00:06:19.100> before<00:06:19.250> you<00:06:19.550> to<00:06:19.790> learn<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.419> tones<00:06:20.660> the

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
and so before you to learn the tones the

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.890 
and so before you to learn the tones the
difference<00:06:21.380> between<00:06:21.500> the<00:06:21.710> tones<00:06:21.980> the<00:06:22.660> BBB<00:06:23.660> is

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
difference between the tones the BBB is

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.850 
difference between the tones the BBB is
blocking<00:06:24.889> and<00:06:25.100> then<00:06:25.280> the<00:06:25.520> constant<00:06:26.210> tone<00:06:26.860> like

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
blocking and then the constant tone like

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.760 
blocking and then the constant tone like
their<00:06:28.100> means<00:06:29.000> that<00:06:29.180> somebody<00:06:29.510> has<00:06:30.320> an<00:06:30.500> actual

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
their means that somebody has an actual

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.159 
their means that somebody has an actual
log<00:06:30.980> of<00:06:31.190> you<00:06:31.310> need<00:06:32.060> to<00:06:32.150> be<00:06:32.240> careful<00:06:32.660> there's

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
log of you need to be careful there's

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.040 
log of you need to be careful there's
people<00:06:34.040> would<00:06:34.160> like<00:06:34.310> to<00:06:34.520> leave<00:06:35.300> a<00:06:35.330> lock<00:06:35.660> on<00:06:35.870> on

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
people would like to leave a lock on on

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.930 
people would like to leave a lock on on

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
lock on it sounds pretty much the same

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.420 
lock on it sounds pretty much the same
as<00:06:56.690> your<00:06:57.169> chopper<00:06:57.590> being<00:06:57.770> locked<00:06:57.979> so<00:06:58.190> you<00:06:58.280> need

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
as your chopper being locked so you need

to<00:06:58.610> kind<00:06:58.790> of<00:06:58.880> get<00:06:59.000> used<00:06:59.060> to<00:06:59.360> the<00:06:59.450> differences

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
to kind of get used to the differences

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.930 
to kind of get used to the differences
in<00:07:00.050> the<00:07:00.139> sounds<00:07:03.430> another<00:07:04.430> thing<00:07:04.610> to<00:07:04.639> be<00:07:04.850> aware

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
in the sounds another thing to be aware

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.420 
in the sounds another thing to be aware
of<00:07:05.150> is<00:07:05.570> that<00:07:05.630> the<00:07:06.380> tail<00:07:06.710> on<00:07:06.740> the<00:07:06.889> chopper<00:07:07.310> is

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430 
of is that the tail on the chopper is

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.480 
of is that the tail on the chopper is
actually<00:07:07.729> very<00:07:07.760> long<00:07:08.830> it<00:07:09.830> seems<00:07:10.160> like<00:07:10.280> a<00:07:10.310> lot

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490 
actually very long it seems like a lot

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.580 
actually very long it seems like a lot
of<00:07:10.520> people<00:07:10.610> even<00:07:11.000> myself<00:07:11.380> crashing<00:07:12.380> a<00:07:12.410> lot

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
of people even myself crashing a lot

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
how long the tail is or how high it

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.740 
how long the tail is or how high it
sticks<00:07:16.250> up<00:07:16.430> when<00:07:17.210> you're<00:07:17.330> tilting<00:07:17.690> the

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
to fly like save trying to fly under the

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.640 
to fly like save trying to fly under the
signs<00:07:22.190> like<00:07:22.520> road<00:07:22.729> signs<00:07:23.020> your<00:07:24.020> tail<00:07:24.620> is

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 
actually a lot higher than the cockpit

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.969 
actually a lot higher than the cockpit
so<00:07:26.960> it'll<00:07:27.140> actually<00:07:27.229> smack<00:07:27.710> things

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:27.979 
so it'll actually smack things

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:29.860 
so it'll actually smack things
