00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
going to hell so what if they're

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.649 
going to hell so what if they're
hypothetically<00:01:26.130> let's<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.549> say<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.540> was

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
hypothetically let's just say there was

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
hypothetically let's just say there was
a<00:01:27.689> device<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.200> existed<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.520> could<00:01:29.670> put

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
a device that existed that you could put

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.020 
a device that existed that you could put
over<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.689> arm<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.770> over<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> other<00:01:32.670> arm

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
over one arm and then over the other arm

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.450 
over one arm and then over the other arm
and<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.450> stretched<00:01:33.840> across<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.500> chest<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and it stretched across your chest and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.190 
and it stretched across your chest and
it<00:01:35.640> could<00:01:35.759> give<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.210> about<00:01:36.479> ten<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.079> fifteen

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it could give you about ten to fifteen

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440 
it could give you about ten to fifteen
percent<00:01:37.799> more<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> bench<00:01:38.490> press<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.299> you're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
percent more on a bench press but you're

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
percent more on a bench press but you're
still<00:01:39.659> able<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> keep<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.170> raw<00:01:40.530> group<00:01:40.829> would

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
still able to keep your raw group would

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.980 
still able to keep your raw group would
something<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.610> beneficial<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
something like that be beneficial it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.039 
something like that be beneficial it
would<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.350> very<00:01:43.770> benefit<00:01:44.670> oh<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
would be very benefit oh there we go and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.420 
would be very benefit oh there we go and
we're<00:01:46.200> gonna<00:01:46.590> try<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> learn<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.250> your<00:01:47.280> own
