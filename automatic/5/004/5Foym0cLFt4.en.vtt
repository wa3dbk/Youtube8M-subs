00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.270
 week five days then in others 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.410

 onion is good 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.910
 then they are very good because they are 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.370
 very brittle but personally not 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.370
 I can taste vegetable flavors 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.850
 I do not know whether to be happy or not 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.820
 because I don't like vegetables 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:45.430

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.590

 maybe I'll let you know 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.770
 but so really I am very heart then 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.710
 another snack that we find inside is the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:02.530
 malbo therefore also to vegetables 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.050
 the vegetables then inside we find these 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.850

 taste is not written but then the 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.120
 we will try screws then taste inside 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.750
 we find the question activates me a lot 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:27.130
 because it says that they are fate 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.400
 of wafers with a soft texture to another 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:37.900
 then it's enough in question is a lot 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:40.180
 normal is very good they are simply 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.840
 baked from chocolate binds 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.940
 the other is endless they are called bull 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:53.800
 bon bon bon are very very tasty 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.970
 then to the 55 very good barley buoys 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:02.410
 inside we also find this porting 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.820
 chocolate becomes one is like it 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.100
 calls a candy cane of 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.130
 plastic in which I launch there are these 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.440
 balls that should 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.540
 maybe I'll put these chocolate 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.810
 on some dessert but will not try it today 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.420
 inside there is also this then another 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.310
 wafer with the cream inside though this 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.790
 time I think there is precisely chocolate 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.890
 White 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.660
 no times we also find a snack 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.540
 oil and I really don't see this 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.920
 time to try it vices writing granoche 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.300
 chocolate bar has been practically 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.240
 you know this has n't even been released in 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.660
 japan are the name February therefore 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.010
 let's try it against it again 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.840
 maybe then the snack broke 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.640
 favor of coconut looks like biscuit 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.920
 of gold has crumbled with a grain 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.920
 Right sarra and it remains sluggish 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.480
 I feel the coconut I do n't want to say one 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.400
 bullshit though I feel the coconut is 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.750
 very good we look for what it means 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.750
 granola then no less free 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.500
 the entire debtor, however, is now called o 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:14.600
 I don't know granola, but it's very good 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.450
 then 5 5 then we are not finished 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.920
 here we find inside every lollipop that 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.930
 I believe it is the breed because it is precisely 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.030
 eyebrows the morning of the spear 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.830
 perhaps inspired by a drink that was a lot 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.230
 popular in the fifties in 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.690
 japan then we find something inside 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:34.280
 much is not seen and then it is everything 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.100
 popular in japan this is written 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.370
 which probably the most popular now 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.430
 this snack and that should be 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.430
 just chocolate so let's talk about it 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.530
 ok let's taste it 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.930
 very good and very good this snack I 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.590
 remember the bull biscuits I do not know if I 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.630
 know 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.600
 but I think it's chocolate outside 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.100
 milk inside chocolate type biscuits 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.940
 dark chocolate and then there are 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.940
 just the cookies 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.860
 this was really the same 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.880
 I tell you what it's called black 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:21.170
 thunder is really good yummy me 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.810
 We loved it so at this 5 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.260
 more because it is really very good then 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:31.250
 we will decide to pick up what I believe they are 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.730
 of the fate of life plus chips 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.500
 bicorna are of magic then the first 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.540
 if these are good, I will try them in a 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.060
 next video and stars and then inside 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.270
 we find for my happiness or one 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.770
 then chocolate bar weapons 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.000
 it should be milk chocolate 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.620
 because described I play it good or not 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.810
 they activate chocolate that was n't there 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.690
 the friend and the fight and the same brand 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.850
 of koalas no but who the same of 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.370
 you know are those koala cookies 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.290
 like an easy everyone and pretty and all 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.670
 different with chocolate inside 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.550
 of the same brand of 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.970
 this in a hurry then we find the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.620
 so what a nice price of the big 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.230
 they are of the same brand from the few 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.650
 I believe at least the few pandas 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.350
 the last snack and I'm very curious 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.930
 because today I tried 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:26.680
 le chaco balls askar have it here 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:30.160
 should be orange wells 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:42.720
 banana with mango to our la 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:48.210
 I fly fishing to find them I did it 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:51.160
 marina only orange type castle 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.560
 then the bad thing is that 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.080
 since they are all the same, you don't understand 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.700
 what a premier server taste but I have 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.820
 definitely got the banana because it is 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.970
 strong and then the first is the 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.220
 to fishing because of fishing snacks 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.050
 I don't like Japanese 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.120
 But I prefer those caramel 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.390
 almost chocolate obviously then a 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.700
 coco bonds is obviously a taste 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:19.030
 staff 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:21.190
 3 yes maybe in the programs at least another 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:25.300
 chance however I do not love the fruits are dc 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:27.340
 type pineapple mango or peach orange 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.680
 with white chocolate because 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.230
 white chocolate cover 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.780
 I don't know the contrast too weird though 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.250
 I would like to give him a second chance 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.220
 it's nothing girls video girl 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:42.790
 Taste review of these boxes says 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.860

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.780

 ca and many details and not where 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:55.860
