eliminate one of the bombs so one of the
best<00:01:32.700> ways<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> eliminate<00:01:33.450> bombs<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.860> using

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
best ways to eliminate bombs is using

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.630 
best ways to eliminate bombs is using
your<00:01:36.060> kill<00:01:36.420> squad<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.130> if<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.400> possible

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
your kill squad and if that's possible

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.390 
your kill squad and if that's possible
killing<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> Queen<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> eliminate<00:01:40.799> double

killing the Queen and eliminate double
giant<00:01:41.549> bombs<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:42.180> single<00:01:43.049> bombs<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.829> really

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
giant bombs or single bombs it really

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.330 
giant bombs or single bombs it really
helps<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.720> hog<00:01:45.960> attack<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.890> base<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.310> a

so<00:02:13.230> let's<00:02:14.230> think<00:02:14.500> how<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.160> wanna<00:02:15.490> pass<00:02:15.730> you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
so let's think how you wanna pass you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.650 
so let's think how you wanna pass you
wanna<00:02:16.240> pass<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.960> way<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.830> can<00:02:18.070> heal

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
wanna pass in a way that you can heal

wanna pass in a way that you can heal
the<00:02:19.660> best<00:02:19.930> way<00:02:20.290> possible<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.190> notice<00:02:21.790> that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the best way possible so notice that

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.700 
the best way possible so notice that
those<00:02:22.210> two<00:02:22.420> wasters<00:02:22.780> are<00:02:23.020> pretty<00:02:23.320> close<00:02:23.560> to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
those two wasters are pretty close to

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.300 
those two wasters are pretty close to
each<00:02:23.800> other<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.550> can<00:02:24.940> drop<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.450> heal<00:02:25.810> spell

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310

each other so you can drop a heal spell
right<00:02:27.310> here<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.270> will<00:02:28.480> cover<00:02:28.780> for<00:02:29.320> both<00:02:29.350> of

right here and it will cover for both of

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.740 
right here and it will cover for both of
the<00:02:31.210> waste<00:02:32.080> hours<00:02:32.700> let's<00:02:33.700> delete<00:02:34.060> everything

going to be used to get rid of those

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.810 
going to be used to get rid of those
Tesla's<00:02:58.510> no<00:02:58.720> need<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.140> use<00:02:59.290> any<00:02:59.370> hugs<00:03:00.370> on<00:03:00.640> them

then all the way through the base this

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.620 
then all the way through the base this
way<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.019> in<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.760> attack<00:03:36.970> itself<00:03:37.300> you<00:03:37.510> will

start the hog attack notice that they're

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.620 
start the hog attack notice that they're
going<00:05:38.099> pretty<00:05:39.099> much<00:05:39.250> in<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:39.760> path<00:05:40.000> that<00:05:40.270> he

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
going pretty much in the path that he

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.040 
going pretty much in the path that he
wanted<00:05:40.960> them<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:41.260> go<00:05:42.150> some<00:05:43.150> are<00:05:43.300> splitting<00:05:43.840> to

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
wanted them to go some are splitting to

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.159 
wanted them to go some are splitting to
the<00:05:44.200> defenses<00:05:44.710> but<00:05:45.330> that<00:05:46.330> was<00:05:46.510> the<00:05:46.660> main<00:05:46.840> plan

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
the defenses but that was the main plan

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.710 
the defenses but that was the main plan
so<00:05:47.530> first<00:05:48.190> heal<00:05:48.430> spell<00:05:48.700> was<00:05:49.000> used<00:05:49.180> between<00:05:49.450> the

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
so first heal spell was used between the

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.060 
so first heal spell was used between the
West<00:05:50.020> hours<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:52.260> they<00:05:53.260> are<00:05:53.320> both<00:05:53.500> heal<00:05:53.830> and

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
West hours and they are both heal and

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.700 
West hours and they are both heal and
now<00:05:54.280> the<00:05:54.340> second<00:05:54.880> Hill<00:05:55.090> covers<00:05:55.930> should<00:05:56.500> cover

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
now the second Hill covers should cover

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.310 
now the second Hill covers should cover
a<00:05:56.860> bit<00:05:57.070> more<00:05:57.099> I<00:05:57.400> think<00:05:57.760> maybe<00:05:58.539> a<00:05:58.660> bit<00:05:58.870> more<00:05:59.139> to

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
a bit more I think maybe a bit more to

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.890 
a bit more I think maybe a bit more to
the<00:05:59.349> left<00:05:59.470> would<00:05:59.950> cover<00:06:00.190> a<00:06:00.310> bit<00:06:00.520> better

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
the left would cover a bit better

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.990 
the left would cover a bit better
because<00:06:01.900> those<00:06:02.500> hogs<00:06:02.770> are<00:06:03.039> getting<00:06:03.669> injured

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
because those hogs are getting injured

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.560 
because those hogs are getting injured
and<00:06:04.240> are<00:06:05.039> not<00:06:06.039> healed<00:06:06.310> by<00:06:06.550> by<00:06:06.880> that<00:06:07.090> heal<00:06:07.300> spell

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
and are not healed by by that heal spell

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.600 
and are not healed by by that heal spell
but<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:09.580> third<00:06:09.880> heal<00:06:10.210> spell<00:06:11.160> gets<00:06:12.160> them<00:06:12.430> all

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
but the third heal spell gets them all

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.540 
but the third heal spell gets them all
and<00:06:12.849> this<00:06:13.479> way<00:06:13.720> it<00:06:14.229> gets<00:06:14.440> the<00:06:14.740> easy<00:06:14.919> three-star

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
and this way it gets the easy three-star

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.670 
and this way it gets the easy three-star
on<00:06:15.970> this<00:06:16.210> base<00:06:16.419> so<00:06:16.690> again<00:06:17.110> it's<00:06:17.470> a

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
on this base so again it's a

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.500 
on this base so again it's a
modification<00:06:18.070> of<00:06:18.490> a<00:06:18.639> known<00:06:18.849> base<00:06:19.120> called

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
modification of a known base called

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.210 
modification of a known base called
split<00:06:19.960> walls<00:06:20.200> it's<00:06:20.440> gonna<00:06:20.590> be<00:06:20.770> added<00:06:21.039> as<00:06:21.190> well
