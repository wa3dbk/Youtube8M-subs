00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:20.820
 new in the allgÃ¤u music garage channel 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.619
 Let's cool over the sugar for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.289
 we make some videos tutorial videos 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 Wait a bit 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.740
 product related what do it has what 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.040
 I have been working for it for a while now 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.370
 at the beginning of the year with a Siberian 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.010
 company together the really cool effect 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.890
 panels makes krems turns divorce 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.210
 Siberia is a relatively cold one 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.040
 little more time to think and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.870
 tinker and they have pretty good 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.460
 put things and is what one stop 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.690
 I just imagine electronics 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.690
 Japanese girl was 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.940
 next time someone does not 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.510
 true what did 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.430
 explain a little bit what is intuitive 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.050
 just not unlike rent boost 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.620
 So were the frequencies rent 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.990
 Puffed and then with the foot 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:16.280
 pedal partie would be driven back and forth 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.810
 Effect on the whole is that I am 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.760
 the whole can articulate the principle 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.080
 my language also everything with mouth 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.479
 can do that in principle on the 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:31.070
 a reasonably transposed guitar 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:32.240
 Sounds like painting like this 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.880
 frequency behind 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.670
 Europe then I can now when now 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.170
 this my game and my foot a 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.160
 bit chronist i can do the whole thing 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.160
 humanize wonderfully of all language 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.160
 so and now to the electronics japanese girl 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.349
 was and why is basically like mine 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 Absolute domain though free there 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.180
 First of all, there are several advantages 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.209
 small people was so great madness 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.230
 so much space on the panel board and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.130
 pretty tricky small shot aimed 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.450
 but just as well as everyone else 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.470
 optionally as the question I was 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.780
 need not be as large 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.600
 Nobody has what I think is pretty cool 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.810
 is three modes she has where the little one 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.330
 switch on it and I would say modes 1 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.660
 It can be said is typical at baby was 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.330
 So it knew where the two had what 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.380
 I think that's pretty cool 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.950
 deep dead frequency, yes, only this was it 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.950
 fall will fall 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.060
 an effect in itself so i can do it as 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.500
 effect so alone but can hear 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.459
 normal to the years normal 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.459
 used as a weapon 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.620
 So a touch shock effect with 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.290
 I'm totally cool in that and what also 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.510
 very handy it has two leds 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.240
 show the function on the left and right 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.830
 because live often has to go fast because 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.090
 Do not care if it's true if I am 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.450
 Visually displaying is just a lot 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.120
 coal all that the thing can have 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.650
 recorded in a small box champ 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.000
 could listen to link to the company 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.290
 the other products were infected more 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.670
 what this all in the program we have 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.610
 So I will be cool then 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.690
 displayed here 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.690
 here or here or here 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.070
 more 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.970
 alone 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.139
 I hope you as jellyfish 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.210
 We have been in things lately 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.639
 So do not just post 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.520
 say as product specific or if it is 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:20.200
 So I do the tutorials 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.080
 happy when he looks in often times 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:27.750
 and more in the future on mustique 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.750
 garage channel or on music garage
