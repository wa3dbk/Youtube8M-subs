00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.820
 well then the two people and welcome to 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.880
 my bring this now servers of 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.730
 Minecraft 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.390
 for 1.8 hunger games and things 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.380
 several 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.420
 the first is 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.570
 to each key this is a small server 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.000
 there are 5 500 people I do not know if I go 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.790
 starting but the truth is that I like 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.770
 the pile as they see here they have 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.099
 we can go directly to the games 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.099
 of hunger 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.070
 pressing on the beacon or on the beacon 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.420
 whatever you want to call it, call it here 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.890
 they call hey 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.480
 and here we are here we enter a novi 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.790
 where there are few people the truth 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.500
 and what I would touch is just go to 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.280
 Asia 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.329
 so the iron golem is hitting and 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.089
 search for 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.390
 look for one where there are people and any 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.390
 thing 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.910
 and this is all through the game of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.910
 hungry 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.600
 and has other other game modes 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.600
 Like all 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 we could go to anyone but hey it 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.590
 what basically for what to you 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.990
 for the hunger games that battle 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.180
 a lot in finding some servers and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.360
 these are something and this is one of them 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.360
 that is tiny but I do not know how I like it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.159
 in total good then let's move on to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.550
 following 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.890
 and we're leaving now 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.020
 well this is the second what I'm going 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.720
 to show today this is called 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.940
 craft adventure and also has then 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.570
 several various game modes like 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.670
 is the pressure and the creative pvp not sky 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.430
 wars this 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.580
 and here we have survival game hunger 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.210
 games' so the fund does not know what it is 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.509
 that 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.530
 and several things but if we apply click 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.250
 right in 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.770
 in the compass is 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.750
 send directly to the servers and 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.940
 we can see everything we have 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.490
 as you can see is a server 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.400
 premium and new premium is here have 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.580
 a premium mode 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.920
 versus not premium and good the typical does not 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.819
 faction sky block 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.890
 survival this creative prison but what 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.060
 what matters is here is the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.060
 the hunger games' 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.379
 we should go directly here 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.750
 they give us a buff or jump I'm a woman 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.750
 because the power that I do not know but good 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.130
 we will go directly here and here 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.130
 we would have these servers 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.090
 as you can observe 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.900
 and then we would enter any 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.900
 true 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.510
 I do not know and here come directly and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.510
 would start in the game 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.300
 like the one that sends us to a lobby 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.190
 and then we can vote for someone in this 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.780
 there is no one in this program 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.210
 stuck to one that was been why 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.900
 why am I because I am is and so I go by 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.550
 life and well this is this this is 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.620
 the lobby adventure create all of them 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.670
 ways this is showing up on the ip 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.440
 out there on the screen 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.440
 and if you do not have it too 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.170
 in the description 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.850
 If you want to copy and paste, this is 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.400
 this is the second 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.960
 the second what I'm going to show the day 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.960

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.560
 and well let's show the next one and 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.689
 So far, good people, those were 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.629
 the servers of the hunger games 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:02.420
 of not premium this I will leave this 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:07.940
 this last server that is warcraft 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:14.739
 which was not there but not always 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.739
 play there are several game modes more game 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.540
 there are some some more 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.840
 this 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.550
 well there we have a voice of hunger this 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.409
 house sky wars 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.639
 same are you 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.639
 because he will go there 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.050
 and several more things and if they want 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.510
 try it you can be very good 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.150
 the game modes here 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.840
 but this is not either that in the 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.840
 1.8 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.830
 there in an invisible but good guy 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.320
 we are like this is 1 point there are many 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.510
 this non-premium followers of the del 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.760
 hungry so good these are those of 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.620
 that at the moment I liked them 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.990
 that I have tried are to be servers 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.910
 little ones this one 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:18.070
 where there are 250 people or 260 more out there 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.450
 this 300 are not many but but the 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.780
 point is that there are nine points that in 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.570
 this alone and what is for now 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:30.060
 and if they want, they left all that 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.060
 We are calm 3 and until next time
