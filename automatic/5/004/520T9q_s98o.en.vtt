Jack's and ports even though the bottom
is<00:01:14.430> exposed<00:01:15.060> yes<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:15.990> say<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.470> it's

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
is exposed yes you can say that it's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.530 
is exposed yes you can say that it's
less<00:01:16.799> protective<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.240> argue<00:01:18.330> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
less protective but I would argue that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
less protective but I would argue that
it's<00:01:19.020> designed<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> cover<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> most

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it's designed to cover you for the most

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's designed to cover you for the most
part<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.630> corners<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.650> folded

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
part the corners are actually folded

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.039 
part the corners are actually folded
over<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> comes<00:01:24.810> over<00:01:24.960> on

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
over here you can see it comes over on

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.859 
over here you can see it comes over on
the<00:01:25.259> bottom<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.970> prevent<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.420> bottom<00:01:27.659> from

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the bottom to prevent the bottom from

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.960 
the bottom to prevent the bottom from
contacting<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.530> flat<00:01:28.710> surface<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.340> whenever<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
contacting a flat surface so whenever it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
contacting a flat surface so whenever it
hits<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.210> flat<00:01:30.390> surface<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.619> bottom<00:01:31.950> never

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
hits a flat surface the bottom never

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.300 
hits a flat surface the bottom never
actually<00:01:32.900> touches<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> surface<00:01:34.470> because

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
actually touches the surface because

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.130 
actually touches the surface because
these<00:01:35.549> corners<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.119> curved<00:01:36.360> over<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:37.110> of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
these corners are curved over because of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.810 
these corners are curved over because of
that<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.130> extra<00:01:38.369> room<00:01:38.790> for

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that you have all this extra room for

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.999 
that you have all this extra room for
the<00:01:39.360> ports<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> speaker<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.560> lightning

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the ports the speaker the lightning

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
the ports the speaker the lightning
cable<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> headphone<00:01:41.850> jack<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
cable and the headphone jack and the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.469 
cable and the headphone jack and the
extra<00:01:42.899> space<00:01:43.170> around<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.619> headphone<00:01:44.450> jack<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
extra space around the headphone jack to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.020 
extra space around the headphone jack to
allow<00:01:45.869> any<00:01:46.140> size<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.920> headphone<00:01:47.790> plug

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
allow any size of headphone plug

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
allow any size of headphone plug
basically<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.200> those<00:01:49.320> big

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
basically so if you have those big

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.280 
basically so if you have those big
studio<00:01:50.460> ones<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.180> fit<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.170> just

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
studio ones that fit or if you have just

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560 
studio ones that fit or if you have just
small<00:01:52.560> ear<00:01:52.740> plugs<00:01:53.040> that'll<00:01:53.850> fit<00:01:54.000> perfectly<00:01:54.390> as

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
small ear plugs that'll fit perfectly as

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.050 
small ear plugs that'll fit perfectly as
well<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.549> case<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
well the way I see it this case is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.090 
well the way I see it this case is
actually<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.659> meant<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.140> provide<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.469> basic

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
actually is meant to provide a basic

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
actually is meant to provide a basic
level<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.670> protection<00:01:59.880> from<00:02:00.210> everyday<00:02:00.570> use

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
level of protection from everyday use

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.740 
level of protection from everyday use

sending it on the table or pulling it in

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.660 
sending it on the table or pulling it in

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and of course that's just essentially

unfortunately<00:02:23.450> unlike<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.660> silicone<00:02:25.080> case

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
unfortunately unlike the silicone case

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.920 
unfortunately unlike the silicone case
it<00:02:26.430> doesn't<00:02:26.730> add<00:02:26.880> much<00:02:26.910> grip<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.600> iPhone

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
it doesn't add much grip to the iPhone

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.300 
it doesn't add much grip to the iPhone
which<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.290> something<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:28.710> liked<00:02:29.190> about

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
which is something I really liked about

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.680 
which is something I really liked about
the<00:02:29.520> silicone<00:02:29.880> case<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.210> wouldn't<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.480> afraid

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
the silicone case you wouldn't be afraid

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.180 
the silicone case you wouldn't be afraid
dropping<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.230> because<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.650> silicone<00:02:32.010> really

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
dropping it because the silicone really

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.820 
dropping it because the silicone really
stuck<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.520> your<00:02:32.640> hand<00:02:33.290> for<00:02:34.290> me<00:02:34.380> my<00:02:34.590> hands<00:02:34.740> are

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
stuck to your hand for me my hands are

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.470 
stuck to your hand for me my hands are
usually<00:02:35.070> really<00:02:35.340> dry<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.690> dry<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:38.480> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
usually really dry so dry and the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.230 
usually really dry so dry and the
leather<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.960> really<00:02:40.110> slippery<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.160> sleek<00:02:41.460> it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
leather is really slippery and sleek it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.400 
leather is really slippery and sleek it
doesn't<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:42.780> help<00:02:43.080> grip<00:02:43.800> why's<00:02:44.040> so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
doesn't really help grip why's so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.840 
doesn't really help grip why's so
because<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.560> leather<00:02:46.740> isn't<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.250> very<00:02:47.520> thick

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
because this leather isn't a very thick

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.880 
because this leather isn't a very thick
type<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.240> leather<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.570> seems<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.020> be<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.380> very

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
type of leather it seems to be a very

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070 
type of leather it seems to be a very
thin<00:02:50.459> layer<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.090> actually<00:02:51.209> seems

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
thin layer that you can actually seems

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.390 
thin layer that you can actually seems
like<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.260> actually<00:02:52.530> peel<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:52.920> off

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
like you actually peel this off

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.360 
like you actually peel this off
of<00:02:54.090> course<00:02:54.330> it's<00:02:54.540> it's<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.930> sturdy<00:02:55.230> case<00:02:55.560> but

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
of course it's it's a sturdy case but

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.680 
of course it's it's a sturdy case but
I'm<00:02:56.459> constantly<00:02:56.880> afraid<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.270> actually

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
I'm constantly afraid of actually

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.720 
I'm constantly afraid of actually
severely<00:02:58.230> scratching<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.920> leather<00:02:59.100> so<00:02:59.430> I'm

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
severely scratching the leather so I'm

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.240 
severely scratching the leather so I'm
more<00:02:59.880> careful<00:03:00.300> than<00:03:00.450> usual<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.680> handling<00:03:02.190> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
more careful than usual and handling a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.550 
more careful than usual and handling a
case<00:03:02.459> scratches<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.600> leather<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.170> meant<00:03:04.440> to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
case scratches on leather is meant to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.949 
case scratches on leather is meant to
give<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.890> very<00:03:05.040> unique<00:03:05.190> look<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.720> just

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
give it a very unique look but it's just

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.600 
give it a very unique look but it's just
hard<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.320> look<00:03:07.500> at<00:03:07.680> sometimes<00:03:08.010> especially

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
hard to look at sometimes especially

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.640 
hard to look at sometimes especially
when<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:08.940> paid<00:03:09.180> over<00:03:09.450> $50<00:03:09.990> for<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> case<00:03:10.380> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
when you paid over $50 for a case and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.140 
when you paid over $50 for a case and
you're<00:03:10.770> getting<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.130> scratches<00:03:11.490> it

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
you're getting all these scratches it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.360

just<00:03:12.330> doesn't<00:03:12.570> look<00:03:12.720> good<00:03:13.070> especially<00:03:14.070> with

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
just doesn't look good especially with

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.620 
just doesn't look good especially with

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the leather they use here it's very
