time<00:03:07.250> playing<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.430> thing<00:03:08.569> attends<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.690> take

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
time playing this thing attends to take

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.449 
time playing this thing attends to take
a<00:03:09.900> sneaky<00:03:10.290> afternoon<00:03:10.709> off<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:10.920> play<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
a sneaky afternoon off and play in the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.880 
a sneaky afternoon off and play in the
evenings<00:03:11.849> so<00:03:12.510> what<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.260> thought<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.470> instead<00:03:13.830> of

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
evenings so what I thought is instead of

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.860 
evenings so what I thought is instead of
wasting<00:03:14.549> all<00:03:14.849> that<00:03:14.940> time<00:03:15.090> away<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> might<00:03:15.780> as

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
wasting all that time away I might as

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.680 
wasting all that time away I might as
well<00:03:15.900> be<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> bit<00:03:16.410> productive<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
well be a bit productive and so the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.039 
well be a bit productive and so the
recording<00:03:19.200> software<00:03:19.400> like<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.579> Jiki<00:03:21.450> 360

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049
