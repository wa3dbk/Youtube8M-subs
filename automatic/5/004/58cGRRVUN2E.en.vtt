00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.280
 hello i am prototype 1 consider me 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.280
 your orders 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.070
 come on 57 but 45 plus 117 231 is more 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.189
 in dollars 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.640
 then you will be converted there 113,82 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:33.140
 Complain now that I put was 67 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.579
 more 45 + putz 552 664 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.680
 You do not want me to do the subtraction. 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.309
 division multiplication or percentage not 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.589
 need to know what works then by 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.359
 that the tests with the tests 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.829
 these tests are not tests and 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.870
 new releases is helping us make a 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.160
 launch incidentally as a laboratory 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.059
 for us to stop using one 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.940
 apartment 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.609
 the problem of your apartment I live 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.679
 in it and what are my other functions 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:02.899
 Only this but I say I can do it 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.580
 much more to blame for this cult here 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.870
 perfectionist with anything but the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.190
 place of work is but I had to 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.350
 cut costs or set up a system 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.060
 digestive in it I not only have the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.880
 digestive system I also have 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.170
 emotions at this moment I feel very 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.850
 short of my potential 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.360
 which causes me considerable emptiness 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.010
 can I ask why the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.390
 budget is for things that people 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.250
 need to build a robot 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.650
 indistinguishable from a human project 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.010
 adam is the name missing you off doing 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.870
 think the first is from the bible dvds 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.650
 but I'm a robot distinguished from a being 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.560
 human 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.810
 or if it was not for your voice and these 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.860
 head movements as far as the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.330
 documentation you are prototype of 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.980
 special calculator for fast 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.750
 stipulating the budget in order to 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.740
 meet estimated time for the project 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.780
 I still love I see the evolution 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.480
 of machines valdecir kemer counts on 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.560
 256 votes in favor and closed the drying 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.440
 laboratory 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.090
 I think he died the total 256 again 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.860
 the suitcase with the calculator prototype and 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.550
 would be required to deactivate it 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.550
 brothers 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.580
 android there is a prototype of calculator 6 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.070
 or be obliged to deactivate it to have to see 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.890
 Your calculator's prototype is not 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:29.830
 to predict suicidal tendencies to come 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:33.190
 But then I had to kill humans to kill. 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.530
 The Lord's hands my contract does not 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.330
 deactivating the report only the threat 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.160
 deactivation Protogenes 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.440
 however Jorge predicts that the deactivation of 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.570
 I totti only the signature of the sim one 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.180
 duty and step the form there does not have 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.690
 that ask takes at the request of the department 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.430
 Look at a window and if I play in the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.540
 design does not provide for the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.400
 musculature needed for the jump 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.280
 look what a surprise 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:08.950
 this is highly irregular is more mine 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:19.239
 design does not provide the law provides this and 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:35.770
 This does not come only, you suck 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:38.040
 July remains in favor of the proposal 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.040
 the value
