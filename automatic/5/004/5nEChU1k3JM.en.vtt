hi<00:00:08.880> everyone<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.320> something<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.349> people<00:00:10.950> are

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
hi everyone so something that people are

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.950 
hi everyone so something that people are
always<00:00:11.460> really<00:00:11.790> interested<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.570> it's<00:00:12.870> an

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
always really interested in and it's an

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.799 
always really interested in and it's an
area<00:00:13.259> where<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.710> myself<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.670> level<00:00:15.150> criticism

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
area where I myself have level criticism

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.990 
area where I myself have level criticism
at<00:00:15.990> companies<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.800> past<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
at companies in the past for but that is

at companies in the past for but that is
heat<00:00:18.750> build-up<00:00:19.410> now<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.340> might<00:00:20.580> remember

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
heat build-up now you might remember

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.300 
heat build-up now you might remember
when<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.480> galaxy<00:00:21.990> s4<00:00:22.289> was<00:00:22.439> released<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.920> was

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
when the galaxy s4 was released I was

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.150 
when the galaxy s4 was released I was
very<00:00:23.910> negative<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:25.080> Samsung<00:00:25.619> delivered

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
very negative on what Samsung delivered

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.679 
very negative on what Samsung delivered

longer than maybe 10 to 15 minutes at

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
time the device became far too hot to

time the device became far too hot to
operate<00:00:43.559> normally<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.510> put<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> case<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.020> it

operate normally if you put a case on it
quite<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> bit<00:00:46.770> better<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> course<00:00:47.430> then

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
quite a bit better but of course then

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.250 
quite a bit better but of course then
you're<00:00:47.700> building<00:00:48.030> something<00:00:48.270> more<00:00:48.660> internal

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you're building something more internal

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.690 
you're building something more internal
heat<00:00:49.410> which<00:00:49.620> could<00:00:49.890> reduce<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> life

gaming<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.430> obviously<00:00:53.670> something<00:00:53.879> we're<00:00:54.149> very

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

keen on here and I know so many people
are<00:00:56.940> when<00:00:57.300> they<00:00:57.480> buy<00:00:57.629> Android<00:00:58.020> devices<00:00:58.289> you

three<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.159> four<00:01:17.189> days<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.090> found<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.570> common

three or four days we found a common

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
thing this device doesn't get overly hot

thing this device doesn't get overly hot
in<00:01:22.680> fact<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.220> would<00:01:23.369> say<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.759> has<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
in fact I would say this has some of the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.820 
in fact I would say this has some of the
best<00:01:24.420> thermal<00:01:24.990> properties<00:01:25.380> I've<00:01:25.619> actually

best thermal properties I've actually

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
best thermal properties I've actually
seen<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.729> smartphone<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> last<00:01:27.570> year

seen from a smartphone in the last year

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.740 
seen from a smartphone in the last year
it's<00:01:28.530> very<00:01:28.860> much<00:01:29.070> comparable<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> HTC<00:01:30.509> one

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it's very much comparable to the HTC one

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.899 
it's very much comparable to the HTC one
before<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> although<00:01:31.740> actually<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> found<00:01:32.759> the

before it although actually I found the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
before it although actually I found the
heat<00:01:33.180> dissipation<00:01:33.450> seems<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.530> better

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
heat dissipation seems to be better

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
considerably better than the Galaxy s4

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.420 
considerably better than the Galaxy s4
the<00:01:48.720> galaxy<00:01:49.020> s4<00:01:49.259> primary<00:01:49.710> problem<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the galaxy s4 primary problem was the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.960 
the galaxy s4 primary problem was the
GPU<00:01:50.850> CPU<00:01:51.030> package<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.560> Wi-Fi<00:01:53.130> radio<00:01:53.340> they

GPU CPU package and the Wi-Fi radio they

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
GPU CPU package and the Wi-Fi radio they
appeared<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.540> practically<00:01:55.320> either<00:01:55.590> next

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
appeared to be practically either next

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.499 
appeared to be practically either next

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
same chip now the problem there was if

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
same chip now the problem there was if
you<00:01:59.159> were<00:01:59.219> running<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.549> Wi-Fi<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.180> running

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you were running the Wi-Fi and running

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
you were running the Wi-Fi and running
3d<00:02:01.170> games<00:02:01.439> simultaneously<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.549> was

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
3d games simultaneously and it was

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760 
3d games simultaneously and it was
really<00:02:02.939> cranking<00:02:03.270> through<00:02:03.479> then<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.590> would

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
really cranking through then you would

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.289 
really cranking through then you would
get<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> massive<00:02:05.369> amount<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.790> heat<00:02:05.969> build<00:02:06.180> up

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
get a massive amount of heat build up

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
get a massive amount of heat build up
very<00:02:06.570> very<00:02:06.630> quickly<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:08.069> point<00:02:08.310> where

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
very very quickly to the point where

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.430 
very very quickly to the point where
frankly<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.030> was<00:02:09.149> uncomfortable<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
frankly it was uncomfortable with the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.130 
frankly it was uncomfortable with the
HTC<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.489> found

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
HTC one we found

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.160 
HTC one we found
heat<00:02:12.260> buildup<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:12.860> well<00:02:13.490> quite<00:02:14.170> excellent

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
heat buildup is well quite excellent

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.260 
heat buildup is well quite excellent
really<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.650> by<00:02:15.950> accident<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.490> mean<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.970> doesn't

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
really and by accident I mean it doesn't

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.780 
really and by accident I mean it doesn't
gain<00:02:17.600> incredible<00:02:18.500> hot<00:02:18.740> spots<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.250> one<00:02:19.280> corner

gain incredible hot spots in one corner
the<00:02:20.240> heat<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.720> much<00:02:21.290> more<00:02:21.470> evenly<00:02:21.860> distributed

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the heat is much more evenly distributed

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.340 
the heat is much more evenly distributed
down<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.060> casing<00:02:23.450> now<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.750> lot<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.110> comes

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
down the casing now a lot of this comes

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.420 
down the casing now a lot of this comes
from<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.620> fact<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:24.860> we've<00:02:25.040> obviously<00:02:25.190> got

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
from the fact that we've obviously got

this aluminium case it's acting like a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.170 
this aluminium case it's acting like a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.270 
heat sink in its own right and it may
very<00:02:29.209> well<00:02:29.450> be<00:02:29.570> we<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.200> copper<00:02:30.500> layer<00:02:30.860> of

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
very well be we have a copper layer of

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.890 
very well be we have a copper layer of
some<00:02:31.550> sort<00:02:31.730> or<00:02:31.820> another<00:02:31.850> metal<00:02:32.540> layer<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.870> here

some sort or another metal layer in here

some sort or another metal layer in here
which<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.320> acting<00:02:33.740> as<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:34.100> heat<00:02:34.340> spreader

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
which is acting as a heat spreader

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.910 
which is acting as a heat spreader
inside<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.510> case<00:02:35.690> as<00:02:35.870> well<00:02:36.020> again<00:02:36.590> what<00:02:36.770> this

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
inside the case as well again what this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.350 
inside the case as well again what this
is<00:02:37.040> doing<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:37.580> moving<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.090> heat<00:02:38.209> from

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
is doing is it's moving the heat from

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.449 
is doing is it's moving the heat from
away<00:02:38.660> from<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.230> CPU<00:02:39.560> GPU<00:02:39.709> package<00:02:40.310> and

helping to spread it down the case it

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.440 
helping to spread it down the case it
does<00:02:42.680> mean<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:43.069> get<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> sort<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.760> hot<00:02:44.030> spot

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
does mean you get a sort of hot spot

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.729 
does mean you get a sort of hot spot
around<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.170> area

thermal properties mean that those

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.330 
thermal properties mean that those
higher<00:03:20.930> clock<00:03:21.170> speeds<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:21.590> obviously<00:03:21.950> using

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
higher clock speeds it's obviously using

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.250 
higher clock speeds it's obviously using
a<00:03:22.400> lot<00:03:22.610> more<00:03:22.640> heat<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.209> generally<00:03:23.780> also<00:03:23.900> using

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
a lot more heat you generally also using

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.860 
a lot more heat you generally also using

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
a lot more power battery power so there

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.720 
a lot more power battery power so there
has<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.079> be<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.380> kind<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.860> trade-off<00:03:28.100> here<00:03:28.400> the

has to be a kind of trade-off here the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.610 
has to be a kind of trade-off here the
trade-off<00:03:29.120> also<00:03:29.360> has<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.630> be<00:03:29.690> about<00:03:29.930> heat<00:03:30.410> and

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
trade-off also has to be about heat and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.289 
trade-off also has to be about heat and
