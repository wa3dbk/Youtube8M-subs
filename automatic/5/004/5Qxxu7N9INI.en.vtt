00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
motherboard i decided get outside

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
motherboard i decided get outside
because<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.180> laptop<00:02:03.659> over<00:02:03.899> there<00:02:04.079> that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
because of my laptop over there that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.830 
because of my laptop over there that
really<00:02:04.890> expensive<00:02:05.219> one<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.060> msi

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
really expensive one they have is msi

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
really expensive one they have is msi
and<00:02:07.020> i<00:02:07.049> really<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.710> i<00:02:07.740> figured<00:02:08.039> i<00:02:08.250> like

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and i really like it so i figured i like

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.740 
and i really like it so i figured i like
their<00:02:08.759> mother<00:02:08.879> board<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.179> which<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.450> far<00:02:09.479> it's

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
their mother board to which so far it's

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.180 
their mother board to which so far it's
pretty<00:02:09.840> great<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.289> then<00:02:10.649> right<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.099> have

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
pretty great and then right here we have

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
pretty great and then right here we have
the<00:02:11.340> titan<00:02:11.760> x<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.360> kind<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.510> hard<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.690> point

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the titan x it's kind of hard to point

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.700 
the titan x it's kind of hard to point
to<00:02:13.020> things<00:02:13.170> point

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
to things point

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.780 
to things point

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
things through the camera thing wears

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.930 
things through the camera thing wears

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
tight next right there along with a g9

and there's a one terabyte hard drive

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.650 
and there's a one terabyte hard drive
right<00:02:26.400> here<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.880> don't<00:02:27.120> think<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.270> can<00:02:27.420> see<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
right here I don't think I can see it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.780 
right here I don't think I can see it
was<00:02:27.780> right<00:02:27.960> there<00:02:28.110> along<00:02:28.320> with<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:29.070> 480

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
was right there along with a 480

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.120 
was right there along with a 480
gigabyte<00:02:30.150> SSD<00:02:30.480> over<00:02:31.170> there<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.710> i<00:02:31.800> think

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
gigabyte SSD over there and i think

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.490 
gigabyte SSD over there and i think
that's<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.840> most<00:02:33.990> important

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
that's it that's like the most important

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.590 
that's it that's like the most important
things<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:35.190> that's<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.850> whole<00:02:36.060> setup<00:02:36.330> right

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
things so that's the whole setup right

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.930 
things so that's the whole setup right
there<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.370> i<00:02:38.370> guess<00:02:38.520> i'll<00:02:38.670> show<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.850> guys

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
there and i guess i'll show you guys

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.820 
there and i guess i'll show you guys
