reasons glass unlike ceramic or plastic

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.110 
reasons glass unlike ceramic or plastic
ceramic<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:30.060> good<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:31.110> if<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.890> glaze<00:02:32.400> chips

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
ceramic is good but if the glaze chips

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.420 
ceramic is good but if the glaze chips
then<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.350> can<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.680> problems<00:02:35.010> with
