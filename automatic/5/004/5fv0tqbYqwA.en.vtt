reach the back of the headlight bulbs
the<00:01:16.650> easiest<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.150> from<00:01:18.479> underneath

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the easiest is to go up from underneath

the front of the fairing to make access

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
the front of the fairing to make access
easier<00:01:22.770> I'm<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.790> remove<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.390> four

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
easier I'm going to remove the four

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
easier I'm going to remove the four
eight<00:01:24.960> millimeter<00:01:25.470> bolts<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.250> hold<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
let it rest on top of the front tire

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.580 
let it rest on top of the front tire
just<00:01:39.690> enough<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.289> out<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.679> way

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.650
