it's<00:00:52.260> mostly<00:00:52.620> depth<00:00:53.010> concerns<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.730> certain

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it's mostly depth concerns at certain

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.640 
it's mostly depth concerns at certain
positions<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.690> along<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.050> offensive<00:00:55.290> line

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and at defensive end I feel like they

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.210 
and at defensive end I feel like they
need<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> find<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> tackle<00:00:58.470> so<00:00:58.589> Whitworth<00:00:58.920> can
