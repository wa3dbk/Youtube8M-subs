00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:08.400
 ambiance 'yes that second half and and the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.179
 first half which is twelve minutes 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.519
 how do you explain how nicely the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.890
 first year start phase of competitions 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.890
 roda jc continuously behind your defense 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.779
 let's pass by 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.670
 what do i look like that bank to to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.900
 no 12 liter model second 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.690
 I actually think the van start 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.620
 have taken the initiative and 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.620
 have defended fruit 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.400
 actually with a lot of lessons 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.210
 played Maya - quite rightly you say the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.220
 first 15 minutes twelve minutes 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.840
 aboard a park awful 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.160
 played through and that's because we 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.510
 not good cover that we didn't 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 completely right 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.989
 therefore little doubts have roda 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.650
 he has there 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.030
 fantastic benefited from it and that is 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.780
 very annoying because there is so I can 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 it will be you in two minutes 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.150
 game road has another side we 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.860
 to be 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.330
 we are constantly on the lookout 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.400
 go to the goal 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.710
 that has resulted in untold 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.510
 many chances, I think, in the first half 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.640
 composition then I put you on the bar 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.900
 I'm going to give you little chance to rest that that 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.600
 another two may already be justified 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.690
 but very briefly silent juice 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.880
 well i don't think we do 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.250
 have created many opportunities 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.310
 I think it's not just in between 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.650
 the ten and fifteen chance goal attempts 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.760
 but that man is an earring and then turn 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.630
 you leave him alone with two 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.120
 nevertheless yes we have some attention to it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.090
 the defending part 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.580
 also especially said yes the player 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.680
 good is to continue like this and that is possible 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.900
 this match also with its 2 min 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.140
 and then it was about nation to the four 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.140
 two 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.710
 of course fantastic that it is live there 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.490
 by making goals that there goes those balls 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.040
 there in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.710
 really a compliment from the team with with 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.090
 the doors of the lessons and the and the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.420
 lion heart of the way with which we 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.939
 played him after the 424 then again the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.880
 decrease pressure then you come here unnecessarily 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.019
 under pressure and ultimately only 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.970
 one via goals enough 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.560
 yes then your machine will also come to her 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.640
 bit away happy away with that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.590
 rebuild 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.660
 because was really he came on them hand 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.430
 and well i like it i like it 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.019
 not conscious and narrow so guess it 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.730
 right the referee deciding 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.200
 Referee as when you are such 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.060
 contest 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.190
 yes it is hectic and nijmegen this this 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.989
 must in yes especially today also after such 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.060
 distance really good because I could 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.239
 proposals also at rest 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.940
 yes really cooked just didn't look at her 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:43.560
 well know this has a whole one 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.030
 important competition was for us and us 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.769
 3 points would therefore be the proper 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.239
 this match you good so last three 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.489
 matches at home then the two of 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.340
 so we know the audience behind it 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.750
 that they are capable of much, then 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.209
 very quickly disappear chargeable then is 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.709
 really disappointing 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.040
 nevertheless, it has continued to go on 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.480
 and hearing it is a good win 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.940
 I think a justified victory I think 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.290
 also a victory why 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.849
 be extremely happy with it 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.200
 than ordinary for that was not very happy 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.510
 you walking with year anyway 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.610
 the dressing room frustrates going all too 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.870
 you win indeed 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.180
 I can't disappoint myself 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.980
 well imagine on one hand because 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.720
 you want to 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.890
 you would naturally like to field them 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.530
 and they are learning talent day 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.810
 on the other hand it is also it 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.890
 team interest 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.390
 He was at the last inserted 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.239
 of course also a bit 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.220
 what the some time to stretch but good he 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.200
 is young and this is what the term says 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.290
 settings and sales well put together 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.569
 so that will be that in the course of evening 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.610
