child can get 16 of those that's quite a
lot<00:02:00.210> that's<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.540> few<00:02:00.780> million<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.740> there<00:02:01.890> are

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
lot that's a few million then there are

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.740 
lot that's a few million then there are
some<00:02:02.189> red<00:02:02.430> boots<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> vehicle<00:02:03.450> obviously

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
some red boots and the vehicle obviously

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
some red boots and the vehicle obviously
we<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.799> currently<00:02:05.009> they<00:02:05.430> have

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
we can get I think currently they have

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.380 
we can get I think currently they have
no<00:02:05.820> use

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
no use

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.889 
no use
but<00:02:06.869> once<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> whole<00:02:08.250> city<00:02:08.580> opens<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.690> all

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.690 
but once the whole city opens like all
of<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.410> think<00:02:10.830> there's<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.430> some

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
of it I think there's going to have some

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.650 
of it I think there's going to have some
pretty<00:02:11.879> good<00:02:12.060> use

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660

so<00:02:45.430> actually<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.060> went<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.870> forums<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.349> I

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
so actually I went on the forums and I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.640 
so actually I went on the forums and I
did<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:48.040> these<00:02:48.610> implants<00:02:49.209> are<00:02:49.450> very<00:02:49.690> dead

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
did that these implants are very dead

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.319 
did that these implants are very dead
and<00:02:51.010> that's<00:02:51.220> pretty<00:02:51.489> much<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:52.000> only<00:02:52.150> reason

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
and that's pretty much the only reason

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.630 
and that's pretty much the only reason
why<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:53.019> are<00:02:53.079> going<00:02:53.319> up<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.829> price<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.400> much

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
why they are going up in price so much

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.440 
why they are going up in price so much
because<00:02:55.510> some<00:02:56.019> guys<00:02:56.260> spend<00:02:56.680> 20<00:02:57.130> hours<00:02:57.450> 15

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
because some guys spend 20 hours 15

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.750 
because some guys spend 20 hours 15
hours<00:02:58.900> without<00:02:59.200> seeing<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.860> crystal<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.489> plane

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760
