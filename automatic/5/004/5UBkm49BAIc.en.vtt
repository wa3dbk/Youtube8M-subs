MPV in India

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.179 
MPV in India
so<00:00:20.029> in<00:00:20.330> essence<00:00:20.750> as<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.140> name<00:00:21.290> suggests<00:00:21.500> the

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
so in essence as the name suggests the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.880 
so in essence as the name suggests the
go+<00:00:22.550> is<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.060> go<00:00:23.240> hatch<00:00:23.540> plus<00:00:24.020> with<00:00:24.320> some<00:00:24.560> added

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
go+ is the go hatch plus with some added

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.310 
go+ is the go hatch plus with some added
space<00:00:25.190> and<00:00:25.490> we<00:00:26.270> might<00:00:26.510> say<00:00:26.780> with<00:00:27.020> added

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
space and we might say with added

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.920 
space and we might say with added
desirability<00:00:27.860> how<00:00:28.520> is<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:28.910> well<00:00:29.330> our<00:00:29.570> video

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
desirability how is that well our video

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.270 
desirability how is that well our video
explains<00:00:30.500> it<00:00:30.650> all<00:00:31.180> as<00:00:32.379> you<00:00:33.379> might<00:00:33.739> guess<00:00:34.010> the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
explains it all as you might guess the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.280 
explains it all as you might guess the
go+<00:00:34.699> is<00:00:35.000> basically<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.660> stretched<00:00:35.960> version

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
go+ is basically the stretched version

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.590 
go+ is basically the stretched version
of<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.830> hatchback<00:00:37.010> which<00:00:37.820> means<00:00:38.059> it<00:00:38.300> shares

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
of the hatchback which means it shares

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.270 
of the hatchback which means it shares
all<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.020> front-end<00:00:39.440> design<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.129> hatch

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
all the front-end design of the hatch

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.120 
all the front-end design of the hatch
and<00:00:40.550> that<00:00:41.239> is<00:00:41.390> no<00:00:41.540> bad<00:00:41.810> thing<00:00:41.840> as<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:42.829> go<00:00:42.980> is

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
and that is no bad thing as the go is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.560 
and that is no bad thing as the go is
quite<00:00:43.399> a<00:00:43.430> pleasant<00:00:43.670> looking<00:00:44.120> car<00:00:44.329> in<00:00:44.450> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
quite a pleasant looking car in the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.780 
quite a pleasant looking car in the
first<00:00:44.780> place<00:00:45.020> it<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:45.980> only<00:00:46.130> then<00:00:46.340> moved<00:00:46.670> to

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
first place it is only then moved to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.580 
first place it is only then moved to
this<00:00:46.880> side<00:00:47.149> that<00:00:47.450> you<00:00:47.570> notice<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.200> increased

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
this side that you notice the increased

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.620 
this side that you notice the increased
length<00:00:48.890> which<00:00:49.579> we<00:00:49.850> must<00:00:50.059> say<00:00:50.270> has<00:00:50.480> been

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
length which we must say has been

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.200 
length which we must say has been
cleverly<00:00:51.110> designed<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.370> go+<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:53.059> now

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
cleverly designed and the go+ is now

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.720 
cleverly designed and the go+ is now
just<00:00:53.600> under<00:00:53.989> 4<00:00:54.170> metres<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:55.250> also<00:00:55.370> see<00:00:55.700> that

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
just under 4 metres you also see that

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.850 
just under 4 metres you also see that
the<00:00:56.030> MPV<00:00:56.450> style<00:00:56.780> has<00:00:56.989> been<00:00:57.140> neatly<00:00:57.380> integrated

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
the MPV style has been neatly integrated

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.580 
the MPV style has been neatly integrated
to<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:58.430> design<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.090> it<00:00:59.660> does<00:00:59.870> not<00:01:00.050> look<00:01:00.320> like

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
to the design and it does not look like

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.220 
to the design and it does not look like
an<00:01:00.950> afterthought<00:01:01.399> we<00:01:02.120> only<00:01:02.360> wish<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:03.020> had

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
an afterthought we only wish it had

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.880 
an afterthought we only wish it had
bigger<00:01:03.500> wheels<00:01:03.710> though<00:01:05.350> inside<00:01:06.350> despite<00:01:06.680> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
bigger wheels though inside despite the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.859 
bigger wheels though inside despite the
fact<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.430> wheelbase<00:01:07.789> is<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.149> same<00:01:08.390> it

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
fact that the wheelbase is the same it

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.990 
fact that the wheelbase is the same it
feels<00:01:09.170> more<00:01:09.470> Airy<00:01:09.800> when<00:01:10.250> compared<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.789> the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
feels more Airy when compared to the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.630 
feels more Airy when compared to the
hatch<00:01:11.180> things<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.350> dash<00:01:12.619> design<00:01:12.950> stay<00:01:13.490> the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
hatch things that a dash design stay the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.910 
hatch things that a dash design stay the
same<00:01:13.850> which<00:01:14.600> means<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:15.140> continues<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.830> have

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
same which means it continues to have

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.620 
same which means it continues to have
some<00:01:16.100> of<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.220> unique<00:01:16.549> design<00:01:16.729> details<00:01:17.299> taken

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
some of the unique design details taken

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.620 
some of the unique design details taken
from<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.990> go<00:01:18.140> hatch<00:01:18.670> second<00:01:19.670> row<00:01:19.850> seems<00:01:20.360> more

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
from the go hatch second row seems more

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.350 
from the go hatch second row seems more
spacious<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.380> there<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:21.950> more<00:01:22.159> Headroom<00:01:22.670> but

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
spacious and there is more Headroom but

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.210 
spacious and there is more Headroom but
there<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:23.869> also<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.229> talking<00:01:24.560> point<00:01:24.830> which<00:01:25.040> is

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
there is also the talking point which is

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.580 
there is also the talking point which is
the<00:01:25.369> third<00:01:25.610> row<00:01:25.850> however<00:01:26.840> let<00:01:27.170> me<00:01:27.200> tell<00:01:27.500> you

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
the third row however let me tell you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.500 
the third row however let me tell you
third<00:01:28.130> row<00:01:28.280> will<00:01:28.490> not<00:01:28.640> be<00:01:28.760> offering<00:01:29.030> much<00:01:29.270> in

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
third row will not be offering much in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.780 
third row will not be offering much in
terms<00:01:29.689> of<00:01:29.960> legroom<00:01:30.320> or<00:01:30.500> head<00:01:30.860> room<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.670> is

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
terms of legroom or head room and it is

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.910 
terms of legroom or head room and it is
to<00:01:31.909> be<00:01:31.970> best<00:01:32.240> used<00:01:32.540> for<00:01:32.810> short<00:01:33.110> journeys<00:01:33.320> only

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
and that too for children but we think

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.770 
and that too for children but we think
