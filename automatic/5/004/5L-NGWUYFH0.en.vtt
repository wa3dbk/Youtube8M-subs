time<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> release<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> be<00:01:09.170> simple<00:01:10.170> ones<00:01:10.350> now

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
time a release to be simple ones now

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
time a release to be simple ones now
let's<00:01:11.250> say<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.460> ordered<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.939> bee<00:01:12.090> house<00:01:12.330> with

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
let's say you ordered a bee house with

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
let's say you ordered a bee house with
the<00:01:12.750> reeds<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> bundle<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.549> reeds

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the reeds or just the bundle of reeds

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
the reeds or just the bundle of reeds
this<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:14.970> work<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.240> great<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> do

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
this will work out great so what you do

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.410 
this will work out great so what you do
is<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.400> take<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> bee<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
is you take the bee and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.320 
is you take the bee and
zoom<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:19.990> here<00:01:20.290> for<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.939> it's<00:01:22.270> pretty

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
zoom in here for you and it's pretty

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.260 
zoom in here for you and it's pretty
obvious<00:01:22.600> on<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.320> B<00:01:23.860> itself<00:01:24.580> if<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:24.909> look<00:01:25.030> at

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
obvious on the B itself if you look at

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.570 
obvious on the B itself if you look at
one<00:01:25.509> in<00:01:25.720> it'll<00:01:26.020> have<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.200> nipple<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.430> other

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
one in it'll have a nipple and the other

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.780 
one in it'll have a nipple and the other
end<00:01:27.820> will<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:28.119> be<00:01:28.270> round<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.520> want<00:01:30.700> to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
end will just be round what you want to

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.789 
end will just be round what you want to
do<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:31.210> look<00:01:31.360> at<00:01:31.450> that<00:01:31.600> nipple<00:01:31.780> that's<00:01:32.380> the

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
do is look at that nipple that's the

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.679 
do is look at that nipple that's the
head<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.310> B<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:33.850> that's<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.509> direction

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
head of the B and that's the direction

about an inch or two with a pencil or
something<00:01:48.670> small<00:01:49.119> that<00:01:49.299> won't<00:01:49.450> hurt<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:49.810> B

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
something small that won't hurt the B

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.669 
something small that won't hurt the B
and<00:01:50.229> just<00:01:50.530> push<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.770> back<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.220> there<00:01:51.460> now<00:01:52.679> once

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
and just push it back in there now once

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.719 
and just push it back in there now once
you've<00:01:53.860> done<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.069> something<00:01:54.610> really

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
you've done that something really

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.880 
you've done that something really
critical<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.390> do<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.140> don't<00:01:56.350> want<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.710> mix

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
critical to do is you don't want to mix

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.440 
critical to do is you don't want to mix
your<00:01:57.100> mouths<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.670> your<00:01:57.789> females<00:01:58.210> together

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
your mouths and your females together

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.320 
your mouths and your females together
the<00:01:59.200> reason<00:01:59.560> why<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.220> in<00:02:00.399> nature<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:01.119> bees

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
the reason why is and in nature the bees

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330 
the reason why is and in nature the bees
when<00:02:01.509> they<00:02:01.630> use<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.990> reeds<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.830> bee<00:02:03.009> will<00:02:03.190> lay

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
when they use the reeds the bee will lay

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.100 
when they use the reeds the bee will lay
the<00:02:03.789> females<00:02:04.179> at<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.420> back<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.899> male's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
the females at the back and the male's

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.600 
the females at the back and the male's
of<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.350> front<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.709> reason<00:02:05.950> why<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
of the front the reason why is the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.729 
of the front the reason why is the
metals<00:02:06.940> will<00:02:07.030> come<00:02:07.209> out<00:02:07.360> first<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.110> then<00:02:08.170> the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
metals will come out first and then the

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.590 
metals will come out first and then the
females<00:02:09.100> will<00:02:09.220> come<00:02:09.369> out<00:02:09.519> later<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.360> if<00:02:10.479> you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
females will come out later so if you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.090 
females will come out later so if you
were<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.780> mix<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.530> put<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.769> males<00:02:11.950> in

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
were to mix that up and put the males in

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.590 
were to mix that up and put the males in
the<00:02:12.220> back<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.700> females<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.299> front

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
the back and the females in the front

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.270 
the back and the females in the front
when<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> male's<00:02:14.410> come<00:02:14.680> out<00:02:14.830> what<00:02:15.010> they'll<00:02:15.160> do

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
when the male's come out what they'll do

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.949 
when the male's come out what they'll do
is<00:02:15.340> they'll<00:02:15.580> eat<00:02:15.760> their<00:02:15.940> way<00:02:16.060> out<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.480> they'll

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
is they'll eat their way out and they'll

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.690 
is they'll eat their way out and they'll
eat<00:02:17.230> through<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> females<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.190> kill<00:02:18.489> them

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
eat through the females that kill them

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.509 
eat through the females that kill them
on<00:02:18.790> their<00:02:18.940> way<00:02:19.090> out<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.709> was<00:02:20.890> destroy<00:02:21.340> all

make<00:03:53.420> sure<00:03:53.600> it's<00:03:53.750> laying<00:03:53.930> flat<00:03:54.290> like<00:03:54.590> this

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
make sure it's laying flat like this

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.950 
make sure it's laying flat like this
don't<00:03:55.430> stand<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:56.000> straight<00:03:56.330> up<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.630> down<00:03:56.690> like

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
don't stand it straight up and down like

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.630 
don't stand it straight up and down like
this<00:03:57.230> we've<00:03:57.770> had<00:03:57.890> people<00:03:58.040> do<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.550> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
this we've had people do this in the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.130 
this we've had people do this in the
past<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.000> what<00:03:59.090> happens<00:03:59.450> is<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.690> bees<00:03:59.900> will

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
past so what happens is the bees will

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.870 
past so what happens is the bees will
emerge<00:04:00.410> down<00:04:00.710> here<00:04:00.920> at<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.040> bottom<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.790> the

emerge down here at the bottom and the
kind<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.150> walk<00:04:02.390> around<00:04:02.540> here<00:04:02.870> at<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:02.990> bottom

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
kind of walk around here at the bottom

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.720 
kind of walk around here at the bottom
and<00:04:03.410> they'll<00:04:03.530> never<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:04.220> able<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.400> get<00:04:04.610> to

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
and they'll never be able to get to

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.910 
and they'll never be able to get to
where<00:04:04.820> they<00:04:04.940> can<00:04:05.090> fly<00:04:05.360> solo<00:04:06.050> number<00:04:06.290> fly<00:04:06.710> up

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
where they can fly solo number fly up

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.380 
where they can fly solo number fly up
out<00:04:07.070> of<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.250> hole<00:04:07.460> and<00:04:07.490> they'll<00:04:07.760> just<00:04:07.910> die<00:04:08.150> at

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
out of a hole and they'll just die at

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.270 
out of a hole and they'll just die at
the<00:04:08.450> bottom<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.050> wasted<00:04:09.410> your<00:04:09.440> bees<00:04:09.710> so

just kind of put them flat like this on
like<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.500> bee<00:04:12.740> house<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.580> can<00:04:13.760> hook<00:04:13.910> them<00:04:14.030> up

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
like a bee house you can hook them up

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.730 
like a bee house you can hook them up
someplace<00:04:14.660> where<00:04:15.080> they<00:04:15.170> won't<00:04:15.350> get<00:04:15.410> too<00:04:15.620> much

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
someplace where they won't get too much

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.190 
someplace where they won't get too much
Raiders<00:04:16.070> like<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.459> like<00:04:17.030> this<00:04:17.299> put<00:04:18.020> two

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
Raiders like that like this put two

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.870 
Raiders like that like this put two
holes<00:04:18.350> on<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.680> side<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:19.160> just<00:04:19.220> kind<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.520> screw
