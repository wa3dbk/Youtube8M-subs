00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
a open G tuning this would be the a bar

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:36.870 
a open G tuning this would be the a bar
there<00:01:28.650> bc<00:01:31.440> defn<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.070> forth<00:01:35.550> when<00:01:36.550> you<00:01:36.670> tune

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
there bc defn and so forth when you tune

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.930 
there bc defn and so forth when you tune
it<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.090> open<00:01:37.360> G<00:01:37.870> it's<00:01:38.230> like<00:01:39.070> you're<00:01:39.250> tuning<00:01:39.760> it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
it to open G it's like you're tuning it

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.180 
it to open G it's like you're tuning it
how<00:01:40.600> your<00:01:40.840> guitar<00:01:41.320> would<00:01:41.470> sound<00:01:41.740> if<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:41.979> were

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
how your guitar would sound if you were

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.240 
how your guitar would sound if you were
ringing<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.729> G<00:01:42.970> chord<00:01:43.240> so<00:01:44.170> for<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.590> E<00:01:44.620> string

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
ringing the G chord so for the E string

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.640 
ringing the G chord so for the E string
you<00:01:46.060> go<00:01:46.360> e<00:01:46.750> F<00:01:47.530> F<00:01:47.979> sharp<00:01:48.400> G<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.720> tune<00:01:50.050> that<00:01:50.320> e

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
you go e F F sharp G you tune that e

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.380 
you go e F F sharp G you tune that e
string<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.370> G<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.740> next<00:01:54.280> string<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.760> string

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
string to G the next string the a string

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.730 
string to G the next string the a string
would<00:01:55.990> be<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.560> full<00:01:57.220> step<00:01:57.580> which<00:01:58.420> would<00:01:58.630> be<00:01:58.780> B<00:01:59.049> so

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
would be a full step which would be B so

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.930 
would be a full step which would be B so
you<00:01:59.830> tune<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.520> second<00:02:01.330> string<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.780> be<00:02:02.940> the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
you tune the second string to be the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.810 
you tune the second string to be the
third<00:02:04.180> string<00:02:04.600> is<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.960> regular<00:02:05.200> d<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:06.490> fourth

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
third string is the regular d the fourth

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.449 
third string is the regular d the fourth
is<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.150> regular<00:02:07.330> g<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.890> fifth<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
is the regular g the fifth is the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.960 
is the regular g the fifth is the
regular<00:02:09.789> be<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.810> then<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:12.220> E<00:02:12.250> string<00:02:12.790> again

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
regular be and then the E string again

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.280 
regular be and then the E string again
gets<00:02:13.629> tuned<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.560> G<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.420> what's<00:02:16.900> known<00:02:17.110> as

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
gets tuned to G this is what's known as

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.929 
gets tuned to G this is what's known as
open<00:02:17.769> G<00:02:17.950> tuning<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.239> if<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.450> strike<00:02:19.900> a

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
open G tuning so that if you strike a

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.250 
open G tuning so that if you strike a
bar

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.399 

a<00:02:26.830> C<00:02:27.830> bar<00:02:28.099> for<00:02:28.939> instance<00:02:29.360> i<00:02:29.569> would<00:02:30.019> have<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.170> seat

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
a C bar for instance i would have a seat

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:39.270 
a C bar for instance i would have a seat
cord<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.370> i<00:02:34.400> want<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.730> play<00:02:34.939> on<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.269> see<00:02:35.540> that

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.619 

rings<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.430> C<00:02:40.610> chord<00:02:42.879> just<00:02:43.879> by<00:02:44.000> holding<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.390> bar

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
rings a C chord just by holding that bar

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.089 
rings a C chord just by holding that bar
across<00:02:44.870> there<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.349> can<00:02:45.440> play<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.860> notes

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
across there so I can play the notes

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:54.009 
across there so I can play the notes
that<00:02:46.370> are<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.670> sea<00:02:52.629> just<00:02:53.629> by<00:02:53.750> staying

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
that are in the sea just by staying

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.960 
that are in the sea just by staying
around<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.709> bar<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.310> moving<00:02:55.939> forward

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
around that bar and moving forward

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:07.450 
around that bar and moving forward
towards<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:58.239> or<00:02:59.349> from<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:00.590> away

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.850 

Oh

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.730 

then<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.610> would<00:03:11.850> move<00:03:12.030> say<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.420> an<00:03:12.660> F<00:03:12.840> F<00:03:13.470> this

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
then I would move say to an F F this

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:27.120 
then I would move say to an F F this
down<00:03:13.950> here<00:03:14.400> from<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.330> sea<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:20.040> between<00:03:20.460> sick

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130
