they're from kelp which is from the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.540 
they're from kelp which is from the
ocean<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.320> they're<00:00:28.470> from<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> sea<00:00:28.949> vegetable

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
sodium alginate in there to preserve

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.779
