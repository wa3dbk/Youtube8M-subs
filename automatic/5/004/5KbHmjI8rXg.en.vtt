00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.850 

here's<00:01:07.119> my<00:01:07.270> four<00:01:07.570> principles<00:01:08.170> I<00:01:08.259> have<00:01:08.590> four

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
here's my four principles I have four

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.429 
here's my four principles I have four
principles<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.430> how<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.610> shoot<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.000> ball<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
principles on how to shoot the ball a

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.380 
principles on how to shoot the ball a
lot<00:01:12.039> of<00:01:12.189> people<00:01:12.460> teach<00:01:12.700> these<00:01:12.939> but<00:01:13.180> there's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
lot of people teach these but there's

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.350 
lot of people teach these but there's
one<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.380> want<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.770> teach<00:01:15.549> that's<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.000> little

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
one that I want to teach that's a little

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.600 
one that I want to teach that's a little
bit<00:01:16.479> different<00:01:16.930> anyway<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.860> first<00:01:18.130> principle

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
bit different anyway the first principle

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.060 
bit different anyway the first principle
is<00:01:18.990> keep<00:01:19.990> your<00:01:20.020> eye<00:01:20.200> on<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.469> front<00:01:20.799> of<00:01:20.829> the<00:01:20.920> rim

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
is keep your eye on the front of the rim

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.609 
is keep your eye on the front of the rim
you<00:01:21.820> must<00:01:22.119> keep<00:01:22.329> your<00:01:22.479> eye<00:01:22.539> on<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.810> front<00:01:23.110> like

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
you must keep your eye on the front like
