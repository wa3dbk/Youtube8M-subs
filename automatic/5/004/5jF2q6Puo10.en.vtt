turn it on I'm going to have to assist

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.860 
turn it on I'm going to have to assist
this<00:02:22.209> but<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.750> watch<00:02:23.079> what<00:02:23.379> happens<00:02:24.870> it

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
this but if you watch what happens it

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.479 
this but if you watch what happens it
activates<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.680> tonearm

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
activates the tonearm

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.240 
activates the tonearm
and<00:02:28.060> then<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.110> pulley<00:02:30.120> comes<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:32.250> there

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and then this pulley comes in and there

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.380 
and then this pulley comes in and there
it<00:02:33.400> goes<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.629> lifts<00:02:35.109> up<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.439> plays<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
it goes it it lifts up and plays the
