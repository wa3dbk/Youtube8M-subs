normally don't run a second theory i
just<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.100> find<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.729> need<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.210> i

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
just don't really find a need for it i

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.820 
just don't really find a need for it i
know<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.689> guys<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.409> guys<00:01:13.590> don't

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.609 
me personally I'm not a secondary guy I
think<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.759> changed<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.240> class<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.080> it's

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
think I changed this class so that it's

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
think I changed this class so that it's
actually<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> need<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.850> stunned<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
actually a need and a stunned but you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.289 
actually a need and a stunned but you
could<00:01:21.750> also<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.290> something<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.430> primary

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.310 
could also do something like a primary
gunfighter<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.380> third<00:01:25.890> attachment<00:01:27.320> for

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.530 
found with this game as time has gone is
that<00:01:55.020> ghosts<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.579> isn't<00:01:57.210> essential

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that ghosts really like isn't essential

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.080 
that ghosts really like isn't essential
at<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.079> point<00:01:58.350> um<00:01:58.619> at<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> beginning<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
at this point um at the beginning of the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.340 
at this point um at the beginning of the
game<00:02:00.240> when<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.140> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
game when you had that you know that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.719 
game when you had that you know that
massive<00:02:01.799> UAV<00:02:02.369> spam<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.270> was<00:02:04.170> almost<00:02:05.070> necessary

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
massive UAV spam it was almost necessary

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.800 
massive UAV spam it was almost necessary
to<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.540> ghosts<00:02:06.960> whereas<00:02:07.920> now<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.629> really<00:02:09.629> like

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
to have ghosts whereas now I really like

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 
to have ghosts whereas now I really like
the<00:02:09.959> benefits<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> hardline<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the benefits of hardline it's it's a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.290 
the benefits of hardline it's it's a
really<00:02:12.420> good<00:02:12.720> perk

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
really good perk

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.490 
really good perk
especially<00:02:13.840> when<00:02:13.960> you're<00:02:14.110> running<00:02:14.320> these

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500

high killstreaks flak jacket is also

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.850 
high killstreaks flak jacket is also
nice<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.600> big<00:02:19.960> map<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.800> don't

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
nice but on a big map like this I don't

because<00:03:32.100> you're<00:03:33.100> Nate<00:03:33.430> your<00:03:33.730> aim<00:03:33.910> can<00:03:34.180> never

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
because you're Nate your aim can never

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.780 
because you're Nate your aim can never
be<00:03:34.630> good<00:03:34.840> enough<00:03:34.900> right<00:03:35.739> if<00:03:35.950> there's<00:03:36.430> always

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
be good enough right if there's always

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.220 
be good enough right if there's always
going<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.970> be<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.600> time<00:03:37.900> when<00:03:38.110> you're

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
going to be that that time when you're

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.720 
going to be that that time when you're
just<00:03:38.350> like<00:03:38.440> oh<00:03:38.590> wow<00:03:38.830> that<00:03:39.040> was<00:03:39.130> really<00:03:39.250> bad<00:03:39.520> aim

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
just like oh wow that was really bad aim

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.140 
just like oh wow that was really bad aim
right<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:41.130> there<00:03:42.130> are<00:03:42.310> three<00:03:42.610> things<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:43.000> I

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
right so there are three things that I

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.070 
right so there are three things that I
have<00:03:43.390> found<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:45.209> really<00:03:46.209> helped<00:03:46.540> me<00:03:46.840> improve

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
have found that really helped me improve

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.740 
have found that really helped me improve
my<00:03:47.380> aim<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.190> first<00:03:48.459> one<00:03:48.700> being<00:03:48.940> playing<00:03:49.600> the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
my aim the first one being playing the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.500 
my aim the first one being playing the
game<00:03:49.780> right<00:03:50.010> playing<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.160> game<00:03:51.190> as<00:03:51.640> much<00:03:52.239> as

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
game right playing the game as much as

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.590 
game right playing the game as much as
you<00:03:52.750> get<00:03:52.959> right<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:54.310> best<00:03:54.580> way<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:54.970> get<00:03:55.390> good

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
you get right the best way to get good

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.720 
you get right the best way to get good
as<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.780> game<00:03:55.989> at<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.410> game<00:03:56.620> right<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:57.340> improve

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
as a game at the game right and improve

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.920 
as a game at the game right and improve
your<00:03:57.910> aim<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.959> play<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.470> lot<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:00.930> not

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
your aim is to play it a lot and not

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.290 
your aim is to play it a lot and not
necessarily<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.590> lot<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.220> lot<00:04:03.400> because<00:04:03.850> once<00:04:04.120> you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
necessarily a lot a lot because once you

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.570 
necessarily a lot a lot because once you
start<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.810> get<00:04:04.959> better<00:04:05.110> at<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.410> your<00:04:06.370> aim<00:04:06.550> is

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
start to get better at it your aim is

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.220 
start to get better at it your aim is
always<00:04:06.850> going<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.150> be<00:04:07.209> there<00:04:07.540> right<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.080> may

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
always going to be there right you may

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.990 
always going to be there right you may
be<00:04:08.290> cold<00:04:08.620> when<00:04:08.830> you<00:04:08.860> start<00:04:09.220> off<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:09.670> once<00:04:09.880> you

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
be cold when you start off but once you

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.430 
be cold when you start off but once you
get<00:04:10.150> warmed<00:04:10.450> up<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.600> aim<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.080> always<00:04:11.230> going

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
get warmed up that aim is always going

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.090 
get warmed up that aim is always going
to<00:04:11.530> come<00:04:11.650> back<00:04:11.890> to<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.190> but<00:04:13.290> what<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.320> found<00:04:14.709> was

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
to come back to you but what I found was

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.190 
to come back to you but what I found was
that<00:04:15.160> playing<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:16.030> game<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.600> fairly

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
that playing the game a fairly

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.590 
that playing the game a fairly
considerable<00:04:17.769> amount<00:04:18.040> was<00:04:18.280> was<00:04:18.669> probably<00:04:19.209> the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
considerable amount was was probably the

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.719 
considerable amount was was probably the
best<00:04:19.900> way<00:04:20.169> experience<00:04:20.980> is<00:04:21.160> always<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.580> way<00:04:21.700> to

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
best way experience is always the way to

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.920 
best way experience is always the way to
go<00:04:21.850> practice<00:04:22.240> makes<00:04:22.690> perfect<00:04:22.960> right<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:24.930> that

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
go practice makes perfect right so that

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.120 
go practice makes perfect right so that
was<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.200> was<00:04:26.560> prob

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
was that was prob

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.910 
was that was prob
my<00:04:27.550> number<00:04:27.850> one<00:04:27.880> thing<00:04:28.330> my<00:04:29.050> second<00:04:29.500> thing<00:04:29.680> is

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
my number one thing my second thing is

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.630 
my number one thing my second thing is
knowing<00:04:30.790> your<00:04:30.970> sensitivity<00:04:31.930> now<00:04:32.740> sensitivity

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
knowing your sensitivity now sensitivity

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.890 
knowing your sensitivity now sensitivity
is<00:04:33.760> something<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.180> know<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.360> see<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.660> lot<00:04:34.870> of

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
is something you know you see a lot of

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.690 
is something you know you see a lot of
people<00:04:35.140> ask<00:04:35.380> you<00:04:35.650> know<00:04:35.710> what<00:04:35.950> sensitivity<00:04:36.550> to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
people ask you know what sensitivity to

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.430 
people ask you know what sensitivity to
use<00:04:36.880> blah<00:04:37.150> blah<00:04:37.270> blah<00:04:37.300> blah<00:04:37.450> blah<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.020> what<00:04:38.410> I

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
use blah blah blah blah blah and what I

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.980 
use blah blah blah blah blah and what I
can<00:04:38.710> say<00:04:38.920> to<00:04:38.950> that<00:04:39.160> is<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.820> no<00:04:40.390> sensitivity

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
can say to that is that no sensitivity

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.310 
can say to that is that no sensitivity
is<00:04:41.410> like<00:04:42.070> perfect<00:04:42.730> so<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:43.420> I<00:04:43.450> play<00:04:43.780> on<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:43.990> 12

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
is like perfect so so I play on a 12

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.740 
is like perfect so so I play on a 12
sensitivity<00:04:44.980> right<00:04:45.250> but<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.000> can't<00:04:46.120> tell<00:04:46.570> you

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
sensitivity right but I can't tell you

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.390 
sensitivity right but I can't tell you
that<00:04:46.780> if<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.110> slap<00:04:47.380> on<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.590> 12<00:04:47.860> sensitivity

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
that if you slap on a 12 sensitivity

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.640 
that if you slap on a 12 sensitivity
your<00:04:48.520> aim<00:04:48.640> is<00:04:48.670> going<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:48.940> be<00:04:49.030> great<00:04:49.650> because

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
your aim is going to be great because

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.010 
your aim is going to be great because
that's<00:04:51.220> just<00:04:51.340> not<00:04:51.550> how<00:04:51.700> it<00:04:51.850> works<00:04:52.060> sensitivity

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
that's just not how it works sensitivity

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.930 
that's just not how it works sensitivity
is<00:04:53.140> all<00:04:53.350> preference<00:04:53.890> I<00:04:54.040> know<00:04:54.100> sarcasm<00:04:54.460> plays

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
is all preference I know sarcasm plays

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.300 
is all preference I know sarcasm plays
on<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.150> low<00:04:55.360> one<00:04:55.540> I<00:04:55.780> no<00:04:55.870> Luca<00:04:56.590> place<00:04:56.800> on<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.010> fairly

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
on a low one I no Luca place on a fairly

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.270 
on a low one I no Luca place on a fairly
the<00:04:57.970> like<00:04:58.900> moderate<00:04:59.380> one<00:04:59.560> I<00:04:59.590> think<00:04:59.770> kill<00:05:00.100> show

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
the like moderate one I think kill show

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.610 
the like moderate one I think kill show
plays<00:05:00.520> on<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.700> fairly<00:05:00.940> low<00:05:01.180> 12<00:05:01.390> Blackie<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:02.470> I

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
plays on a fairly low 12 Blackie and I

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.680 
plays on a fairly low 12 Blackie and I
both<00:05:02.830> play<00:05:03.160> on<00:05:03.280> fairly<00:05:03.520> high<00:05:03.790> sensitivity<00:05:04.360> so

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
both play on fairly high sensitivity so

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.000 
both play on fairly high sensitivity so
it's<00:05:04.840> all<00:05:04.990> preference<00:05:05.290> we're<00:05:05.620> all<00:05:05.680> great

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
it's all preference we're all great

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.860 
it's all preference we're all great
bladers<00:05:06.490> but<00:05:07.060> we<00:05:07.150> all<00:05:07.270> play<00:05:07.450> on<00:05:07.570> different

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
bladers but we all play on different

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.010 
bladers but we all play on different
sensitivities<00:05:08.470> so<00:05:08.710> there's<00:05:09.490> this<00:05:09.810> kind<00:05:10.810> of

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
sensitivities so there's this kind of

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.320 
sensitivities so there's this kind of
you<00:05:12.010> got<00:05:12.160> to<00:05:12.250> feel<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.490> out<00:05:12.700> right<00:05:12.910> you<00:05:13.120> got<00:05:13.240> to

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
you got to feel it out right you got to

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.790 
you got to feel it out right you got to
try<00:05:13.540> different<00:05:13.600> sensitivities<00:05:14.500> you<00:05:14.590> got<00:05:14.710> to

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
try different sensitivities you got to

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.010 
try different sensitivities you got to
see<00:05:15.010> what<00:05:15.220> feels<00:05:15.490> right<00:05:15.760> to<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.450> once<00:05:16.870> you

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
see what feels right to you and once you

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.170 
see what feels right to you and once you
find<00:05:17.470> that<00:05:17.680> right<00:05:18.070> sensitivity<00:05:18.820> you're<00:05:19.060> going

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
find that right sensitivity you're going

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.310 
find that right sensitivity you're going
to<00:05:19.240> know<00:05:19.480> because<00:05:19.840> you're<00:05:20.110> going<00:05:20.200> to<00:05:20.260> be

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
to know because you're going to be

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.440 
to know because you're going to be
snapping<00:05:20.800> on<00:05:20.920> guys<00:05:21.160> and<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.940> it's<00:05:22.150> going<00:05:22.390> to

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
snapping on guys and and it's going to

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.560 
snapping on guys and and it's going to
feel<00:05:22.840> right<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:24.400> took<00:05:24.640> me<00:05:24.850> a<00:05:24.880> while<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.150> kind<00:05:25.450> of

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
feel right it took me a while to kind of

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.390 
feel right it took me a while to kind of
narrow<00:05:25.750> mind<00:05:26.050> down<00:05:26.230> i<00:05:26.260> know<00:05:26.410> i<00:05:26.530> played<00:05:26.890> on<00:05:27.100> i

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
narrow mind down i know i played on i

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.630 
narrow mind down i know i played on i
played<00:05:28.000> on<00:05:28.180> obviously<00:05:29.110> two<00:05:29.830> or<00:05:30.010> three<00:05:30.040> and

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
played on obviously two or three and

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.670 
played on obviously two or three and
call<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.450> duty<00:05:31.630> four<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.170> then<00:05:32.290> once<00:05:32.500> I<00:05:32.560> got

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
call of duty four and then once I got

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.020 
call of duty four and then once I got
the<00:05:32.800> modern<00:05:33.040> warfare<00:05:33.100> two<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.520> started

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
the modern warfare two I started

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.310 
the modern warfare two I started
experimenting<00:05:34.360> a<00:05:34.780> little<00:05:34.870> bit<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.200> I<00:05:35.290> I

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
experimenting a little bit and I I

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.650 
experimenting a little bit and I I
eventually<00:05:35.830> started<00:05:36.040> playing<00:05:36.520> on<00:05:36.610> 10<00:05:36.940> which

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
eventually started playing on 10 which

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.350 
eventually started playing on 10 which
is<00:05:37.690> absolutely<00:05:38.200> insane<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:39.180> think<00:05:40.180> that's

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
is absolutely insane and I think that's

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.680 
is absolutely insane and I think that's
actually<00:05:40.540> what<00:05:40.840> Blackie<00:05:41.110> plays<00:05:41.440> on<00:05:42.030> but<00:05:43.030> um<00:05:43.330> I

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
actually what Blackie plays on but um I

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.150 
actually what Blackie plays on but um I
kind<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.200> bumped<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.560> down<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.770> little<00:05:44.950> bit

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
kind of bumped it down a little bit

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.830 
kind of bumped it down a little bit
because<00:05:45.370> I<00:05:45.550> found<00:05:45.970> that<00:05:46.090> my<00:05:46.150> aim<00:05:46.390> was<00:05:46.420> getting

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
because I found that my aim was getting

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.960 
because I found that my aim was getting
a<00:05:46.870> little<00:05:47.020> sloppy<00:05:47.350> and<00:05:47.800> I<00:05:47.890> played<00:05:48.160> on<00:05:48.340> seven<00:05:48.850> in

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
a little sloppy and I played on seven in

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.210 
a little sloppy and I played on seven in
modern<00:05:49.270> warfare<00:05:49.300> 3<00:05:49.600> and<00:05:49.990> now<00:05:50.080> i<00:05:50.110> play<00:05:50.440> on<00:05:50.470> 12<00:05:50.950> in

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
modern warfare 3 and now i play on 12 in

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.070 
modern warfare 3 and now i play on 12 in
this<00:05:51.340> game<00:05:51.550> which<00:05:51.790> is<00:05:51.820> like<00:05:52.480> seven<00:05:52.870> and<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.050> half

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
this game which is like seven and a half

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.310 
this game which is like seven and a half
almost<00:05:53.500> eight<00:05:53.950> so<00:05:54.400> that's<00:05:55.390> what<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:55.660> found<00:05:56.020> with

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
almost eight so that's what I found with

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.700 
almost eight so that's what I found with
sensitivity<00:05:56.890> what<00:05:57.340> works<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.700> best<00:05:58.710> the

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
sensitivity what works the best the

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.880 
sensitivity what works the best the
third<00:06:00.010> thing<00:06:00.040> what<00:06:00.670> was<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:00.970> third<00:06:01.150> thing<00:06:01.890> the

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
third thing what was the third thing the

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.160 
third thing what was the third thing the
third<00:06:03.160> thing<00:06:03.190> is<00:06:03.670> going<00:06:04.360> for<00:06:04.570> headshots<00:06:04.750> and

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
third thing is going for headshots and

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.680 
third thing is going for headshots and
this<00:06:05.650> may<00:06:06.010> this<00:06:06.820> is<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.060> little<00:06:07.360> different

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
this may this is a little different

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.840 
this may this is a little different
because<00:06:07.810> it's<00:06:08.380> something<00:06:08.800> that<00:06:09.250> is<00:06:09.460> more<00:06:09.670> of<00:06:09.760> a

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
because it's something that is more of a

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.370 
because it's something that is more of a
practice<00:06:10.390> kind<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.140> thing<00:06:11.700> especially<00:06:12.700> in

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
practice kind of thing especially in

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.020 
practice kind of thing especially in
what<00:06:14.380> I<00:06:14.590> did<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:15.070> cod4<00:06:15.550> what<00:06:15.760> my<00:06:15.910> experience

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
what I did and cod4 what my experience

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.410 
what I did and cod4 what my experience
was<00:06:16.510> was<00:06:17.200> I<00:06:17.350> wanted<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:17.860> get<00:06:18.010> all<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.550> there<00:06:19.060> I

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
was was I wanted to get all the there I

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.780 
was was I wanted to get all the there I
wanted<00:06:19.690> to<00:06:19.840> get<00:06:20.020> all<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:20.890> red<00:06:21.070> tiger<00:06:21.550> camo

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
wanted to get all the the red tiger camo

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.480 
wanted to get all the the red tiger camo
so<00:06:22.150> I<00:06:22.180> could<00:06:22.390> get<00:06:22.510> the<00:06:22.660> gold<00:06:22.980> ak-47<00:06:23.980> and<00:06:24.070> cod4

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
so I could get the gold ak-47 and cod4

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.480 
so I could get the gold ak-47 and cod4
and<00:06:24.730> what<00:06:25.330> I<00:06:25.360> found<00:06:25.780> was<00:06:26.050> that<00:06:26.340> using<00:06:27.340> all

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
and what I found was that using all

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.280 
and what I found was that using all
those<00:06:27.670> different<00:06:27.970> weapons<00:06:28.510> and<00:06:28.720> having<00:06:29.170> to

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
those different weapons and having to

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.690 
those different weapons and having to
get<00:06:29.440> headshots<00:06:29.680> with<00:06:30.130> all<00:06:30.310> those<00:06:30.460> different

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
get headshots with all those different

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.510 
get headshots with all those different
weapons<00:06:31.180> really<00:06:31.930> made<00:06:32.170> me<00:06:32.380> focus<00:06:32.740> on<00:06:33.130> where<00:06:33.490> I

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
weapons really made me focus on where I

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.969 
weapons really made me focus on where I
was<00:06:33.850> aiming<00:06:34.060> and<00:06:34.300> how<00:06:34.510> I<00:06:34.540> was<00:06:34.960> aiming<00:06:35.320> and<00:06:35.440> it

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
was aiming and how I was aiming and it

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.590 
was aiming and how I was aiming and it
was<00:06:36.190> one<00:06:36.490> of<00:06:36.520> those<00:06:36.700> things<00:06:36.970> that<00:06:37.150> that

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
was one of those things that that

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.959 
was one of those things that that
combined<00:06:38.140> with<00:06:38.229> experience<00:06:39.040> was<00:06:39.370> was<00:06:39.790> a

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
combined with experience was was a

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:42.329 
combined with experience was was a
most<00:06:40.149> like<00:06:40.360> me<00:06:40.809> practicing<00:06:41.649> my<00:06:41.829> aim<00:06:42.039> and

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:42.339 
most like me practicing my aim and

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.809 
most like me practicing my aim and
trying<00:06:42.759> to<00:06:42.879> make<00:06:43.029> my<00:06:43.209> aim<00:06:43.360> better<00:06:43.799> now<00:06:44.799> I<00:06:45.219> can't

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819 
trying to make my aim better now I can't

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:47.009 
trying to make my aim better now I can't
say<00:06:46.059> that<00:06:46.089> all<00:06:46.360> these<00:06:46.509> things<00:06:46.569> are<00:06:46.839> going<00:06:46.959> to
