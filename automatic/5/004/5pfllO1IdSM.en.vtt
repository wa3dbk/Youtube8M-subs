00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
talk about call of duty but there's

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080

cap<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.480> that's<00:00:54.600> pretty<00:00:54.719> much<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> only

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
cap and that's pretty much the only

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.340 
cap and that's pretty much the only
reason<00:00:55.710> why<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.250> were<00:00:56.489> able<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.660> win<00:00:58.050> because

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
reason why we were able to win because

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
reason why we were able to win because
what<00:00:58.710> they<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.460> how<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
what they would do see how we have a and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
what they would do see how we have a and
B<00:01:00.510> they're<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.620> go<00:01:01.739> straight<00:01:02.039> for

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
B they're not going to go straight for

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.000 
B they're not going to go straight for
be<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:03.120> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.719> blinking<00:01:04.320> first

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
be you're going to see a blinking first

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.820 
be you're going to see a blinking first
and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.970> when<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> cap<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.810> oh<00:01:07.170> they're

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and then when the cap a oh they're

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800 
and then when the cap a oh they're
capping<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> moment<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.570> when

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
capping be at the moment but what when

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.950 
capping be at the moment but what when
they<00:01:10.049> cap<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.820> we're<00:01:12.240> focusing<00:01:12.840> on

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
they cap a there and we're focusing on

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899 
they cap a there and we're focusing on
see<00:01:13.200> they're<00:01:13.439> gonna<00:01:13.619> cap<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.760> was

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
see they're gonna cap be and that was

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
see they're gonna cap be and that was
the<00:01:15.000> real<00:01:15.180> strategy<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.380> did<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the real strategy but when they did that

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.700 
the real strategy but when they did that
they<00:01:16.860> decided<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.030> cap<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.630> also<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> have

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
they decided to cap see also and have

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
they decided to cap see also and have
all<00:01:19.890> three<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> flags<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.850> that's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
all three of the flags and that's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
all three of the flags and that's
basically<00:01:21.540> why<00:01:22.020> they<00:01:22.229> lost<00:01:22.439> because<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.340> were

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
basically why they lost because we were

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.850 
basically why they lost because we were
able<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.939> organize<00:01:24.479> our<00:01:24.659> team<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> spawn<00:01:25.590> all

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
able to organize our team and spawn all

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.359 
able to organize our team and spawn all
all<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.549> different<00:01:26.759> areas<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.479> no<00:01:27.750> real<00:01:28.369> main

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
all in different areas of a no real main

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.120 
all in different areas of a no real main
point<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.509> could<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.710> could<00:01:31.920> keep

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
point that we could like they could keep

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.700 
point that we could like they could keep
us<00:01:32.310> at<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> how<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.869> ended<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.500> when

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
us at and that is how we ended up when

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
us at and that is how we ended up when
we<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:34.950> stand<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.790> did<00:01:35.939> not<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
we will stand I really did not want to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.749 
we will stand I really did not want to
spoil<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.619> want<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.729> one

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
