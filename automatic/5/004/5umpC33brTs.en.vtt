00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.660
 I 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.930
 no 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.930
 ap 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.469
 and he knows everyone knows we 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.600
 think for the lidho on call of duty 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.710
 world at war for a little return to 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.899
 sources so for those who have not 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.850
 still noticed i day on the map mc 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.440
 inc is one of my best maps finally 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.120
 one of my favorite maps on this game 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.789
 there and I play a team death match 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.680
 and I play at the bps h 41 which is also 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.449
 one of my favorites on this game 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.729
 well, besides the snipers 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.710
 are still nice to play 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.719
 not that today sand is going 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.309
 to tackle a little question of the stockings that 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.289
 and for whatever I use wrongly it 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.659
 been neglected by the community so 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.369
 despite that call of duty world at war is 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.840
 a very good game but he still 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.850
 been abandoned by the community as 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.789
 you know it all you do not play anymore 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.140
 you do not play it almost despite 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.090
 that I am here I propose you a 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.729
 very good video about world at war who 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.190
 here is a very good 1.25 gameplay of 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.709
 ratios m finally moves for those who 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.110
 do not know how to love it is in 7500 points 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.429
 so 75 that he's down I made a third 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.780
 as soon as it is even them it's all 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.700
 equally impressive and it's also a 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.399
 very good gameplay that I propose to you 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.590
 so i this video there i'm going to send it 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.269
 to correct cossette and that would be 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.470
 really very nice of them if mu 

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:44.629
 full anyway though i have because 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.190
 that I would like to be seen on a more 

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:47.899
 big each biker codes this even though 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.369
 coach and here it is still a 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.349
 very good thing that no time we can 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.569
 to be a lot of times and it's really going 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.310
 help improve my community and 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.140
 I still hope that's gone on the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.459
 qg code string which is also a very 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.849
 great string criteria a very good 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.619
 as well 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.660
 and I think that might make 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.310
 pleasure to a lot of subscribers who on the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.019
 chain qg code to see world at war 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.610
 it's nice to see a good 

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:09.039
 little homecoming on a very good 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.150
 game that is world at war 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.980
 not that I will return immediately to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.510
 my question of bins and why that 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.200
 I was world at war he was abandoned 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.480
 by the community 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.800
 so I want to explain of course that 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.690
 it's a video debate so I'll 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.069
 invite to leave your opinion in space 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.440
 comments there is there is also a 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.430
 little blue thumbs so this little debate you 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.370

 sure that diet and next video so 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.519
 if you have a different opinion than my 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.440
 thesis that I'm going depends on this little 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.060
 body and areeba do not hesitate to do it 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.370
 finally reach to send your 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.380
 idea in the comment space so for 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.670
 me as duty world at war and it was 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.860
 neglected by the committee because 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.290
 it came out after 4.4 eco4 as you 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.760
 know all it was developed by 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.620
 infinity ward excuse me I come small 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.959
 troquet kolkata been developed by 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.520
 infinity ward while call of duty rating 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.770
 duty world at war it was developed by 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.290
 division and infinity ward 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.700
 which totally changes because the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.010
 guys who are used to seeing a coach 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.870
 which is developed by infinity ward which 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.120
 also as you all know 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.489
 different graphics wharves world at war 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.310
 well it will change little he prefers everything from 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.340
 even stay on kto code if there is a 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.930
 another hypothesis which is that kokate the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.040
 hollow of the ticket so if then sorry 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.400
 it's not a hot and it's safe and 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.019
 certain 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.910
 it's the call of duty that launched the 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.519
 call of duty series so it's a little 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.130
 the pinnacle of call of duty league code cat 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.140
 it's one of the best that came out after 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.489
 back to paris or on the way to 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.290
 Paris My name is more finally than three 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.250
 it was something like that 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.840
 think of you telling me in the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.519
 comments if I'm wrong or not he 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.230
 there is one specify which was co 3 because 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.430
 that I have not played and I know he 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.319
 there are quite a few of you who have played 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.540
 four years old here are former gamers of 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.709
 duty and I think that's why 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.560
 this video will certainly make you 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.900
 pleasure to see world at war 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.730
 code name cat came out after return 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.530
 to Paris and the gamer here we are 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.320
 used to a very good ticket club 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.299
 moderator 1 of code 4 he was expecting 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.820
 to have one simona by two except that there 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.350
 have been attacked exit meanwhile they 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.000
 so are they so have not done the 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.079
 transition code cat world at war but 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.510
 they directly made the tradition 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.109
 cat code and mona flagship of what they have 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.940
 so allowed 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.579
 that's what allowed ward to be wrong 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.739
 not to be noticed see by the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.270
 community and there was also no 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.010
 many videos on youtube on world 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.570
 at war and that's why for you 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.970
 all know a screen you tube hours are 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.200
 a bit like guides and finally if those 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.240
 who have or will advertise for 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.280
 eyes in quotation marks paris offers a 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.810
 video on a game and that's how you 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.970
 are a lot to see the video you 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.830
 will want to test this game and 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.970
 you will simply migrate to 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.820
 this game the child if I can afford 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.190
 to say that term you have everything 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.419
 simply ali on that I played it and he 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.550
 is also the word of mouth that makes 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.289
 that a game can make itself known to the 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.270
 overnight as you know 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.070
 alone 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.740
 the flapi bird game that was a bit slow 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.030
 that's the way I do it 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.380
 drift a little bit from my subject i 'm going 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.440
 go back directly to world at war 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.060
 so as I dedicate I'm recapping 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.210
 and summarize all that I said no 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.710
 world at war has not been neglected 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.840
 earlier by the community because he 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.370
 was released after code 4 which was the case 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.320
 from the cicc launched the series and people 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.340
 were expecting to mate by 2 by this code 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.030
 code for those who do not know these 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.190
 monarchs at 1 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.770
 and if the first flagship model there has been 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.000
 three words of a child and he expected 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.850
 at mont orford and so they did not do 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.930
 Transition rating 4 me tonight dates 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.460
 they made the transition directly 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.230
 of code 4 monard by 2 which is also a 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.570
 very good game here is my art fair 2 it's 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.670
 a game that I really enjoy 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.900
 so I think it's been that way 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.940
 of view there is also because the 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.020
 graphics totally change papin to 4 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.060
 as you know all the graphics 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.740
 are totally different but it remains 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.900
 still nice to watch and 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.090
 I still enjoy this game that 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.980
 is a very good call of duty after all 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.990
 so I think I finished my little 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.640
 debate I invite you to debate in 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.840
 the comments space at the passage and 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.520
 apologize for all the times that i have 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.310
 said here is a little bit of a problem 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.840
 my part and I'll hold I'll stick to the 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.520
 correct in the next video 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.890
 on this I invite you to drop a little 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.480
