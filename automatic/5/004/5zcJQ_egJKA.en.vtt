00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.270
good morning everyone today we see the
preparation of a potato rosti

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.600
recipe very quick and easy as
ingredients we need potatoes of

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.060
herbs that can be sage
rosemary, thyme, as in this case a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.380
seasoning that can be butter or oil
virgin olive oil and salt

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.680
We are beginning the preparation for peeling potatoes that we previously washed

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.220
the risciacquiamo well, avoiding to keep them in the bathroom to avoid wasting too much starch

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.340
then the grattugiamo a grater
large holes in order to obtain the banner

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.140
thin

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.220
add salt

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.010
mix

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.720
the strizziamo so as to eliminate the excess vegetation water

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.580
at this point we aromatizziamo potatoes with thyme, the spezzettiamo

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.030
We also venerate the butter and stir to mix well

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.610
at this point we move on to cooking so
We anoint a pan with

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.340
a little olive oil

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.010
and let it warm up, pour potatoes
in the pan

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.290
and we level well trying to give a round shape as regular as possible

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.770
cooking should be done gently, so that potatoes can be cooked

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.039
uniformly

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.719
After about 4-5 minutes of cooking the places it will be very crisp, so we can

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:26.460
we can turn this operation
with a plate

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700
add a little olive oil

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.450
and continuous firing up to get
the same gilding check cooking

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.460
It is once the rosti is nicely browned
Also on the other side we can

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.890
serve and decorate with a sprig of thyme
we leave the table

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.400
The rosti is a typical dish from Switzerland, what is proposed and the version

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.900
basis but it can also be enriched with
bacon with onion and other ingredients

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.729
usually it is used as
Contour also you can try it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.200
in individual portions from a greeting
Sonia and I wait for the next video
