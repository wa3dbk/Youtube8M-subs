00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.050
 well this in my advances is already the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.060
 hungry here in 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.500
 I have all the cables passed to you 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.500
 arcigay current 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.280
 they are from the thrillers 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.180
 media left media 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.180
 currents 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.110
 well, a battery that I'm going to start with 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.110
 the battery 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.280
 to be able to play music as you can see 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.840
 we have the one that has been proposed and the 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:39.000
 amplifier group because it is the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.000
 twitters are going to put old 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.050
 I have endured a work already that I 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.270
 I have set all the problems 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.579
 and know that everyone has to 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.840
 backwards we fan to which I then 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.329
 sell some more than when the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.219
 they run 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.219
 this entrepreneur 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.960
 which is 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:16.170
 and will learn 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:20.820
 let's continue can see we have the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.430
 work up to do with the design 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.940
 is connected I already learned here is 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.940
 starting 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.250
 auto connect the power cables 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.190
 doblecero spoke with the cables 40 is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.850
 the moderator fans which 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.380
 Well, working on that 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.010
 here we have the cables of the two 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.080
 coils 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.490
 only until there will be two for 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.090
 work now 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.859
 good gentlemen 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.399
 there are the double zero cables 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.399
 placed in the blocks of the low 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.050
 very good this trip 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.700
 the good product not exactly 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.880
 finished because all the cables are 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.260
 say I have the old rock cables and 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.270
 I love change like these boxes 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.400
 face hate blue are black so that everything 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.980
 It agrees to cellars but if it is going to be 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 much later on by release is a 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.270
 big expense with this amplifier 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.270
 cables look expensive 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.959
 while he 's playing I think I'm going to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.190
 ride a little while 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.519
 while mother everything is going to be double 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.519
 zero 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.700
 in the real voltage can not miss 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.720
 I plan to change the drawer because 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.720
 Well, give it a little caladita 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.950
 it sounds very loud and everything but not 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.680
 He defined that one more drawer is needed 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.069
 special speaker for everyone 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.900
 they bring or like the epicenter because 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.750
 is the wiring all its learned all 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.909
 I just need to order the ar follows 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:12.130
 to run what has been 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.780
 for that I like currents 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.500
 and has to change this mind the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.560
 groups 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.780
 Oddly enough 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.480
 a pair of access 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.480
 about 300 60 with 6 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.900
 on issues 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.180
 of a road and 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.180
 and not
