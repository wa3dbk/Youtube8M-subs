00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.020
 this room everyone knows noon 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.810
 I'm coming to you with a new video 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.790
 locks on the practical side pretty fast so 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.740
 to discuss with you the refinement 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.730
 blocks you turn when it comes 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.860
 the refinement of the votes received 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.900
 level of temples outlines of hair 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 et cetera since I know it's 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 something that is extremely common 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.420
 and that we find very often in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.760
 especially at home girls to have 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.619
 since very often what makes there 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.769
 to the refinement of the laws that it's because 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.810
 that we cover too often say by 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.660
 example in root recovery 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.610
 we put a tension on the hair that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 fact that eventually he tends to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.809
 get out of the follicle to tear off for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.820
 mathieu moment and it's not good of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.620
 everything so when for example we do 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.079
 times of racing it is necessary that she 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.079
 be done on a regular basis 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.239
 but not too frequently either 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.710
 if it's the twists even if it's there 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.410
 that they would otherwise be made tweete 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.230
 dubai world is in practice and when 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.699
 it's latchine with the hook 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.949
 really have to be careful 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.660
 sometimes we tend to want this 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.500
 be really well done for it to be 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.720
 pretty etc 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.820
 but at the same time a voltage voltage 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 before tropez had on the hair but it 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 can promote bath because the word 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 tearing of the hair at the level of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.280
 temples especially that the weather makes it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.720
 part of the most fragile places in 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.479
 scalp level 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.799
 what can also cause 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.600
 the refinement of the locks is also the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.520
 type of product used since 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.150
 sometimes doing too well you can 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 use products that are likely to 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.400
 generally of everything the ports 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.780
 actually at level 2 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.210
 our hair on the scalp 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.220
 really smother the follicle what it 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.320
 will already have the game goes much less 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.660
 to push well and also it will promote 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.990
 the appearance of residues and so it's 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.370
 really limited everything about the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.750
 pushes so you really have to do 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.580
 attention as well product that we 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.010
 also use having a good 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.690
 routine a good interview especially in 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.930
 terms of shampoo and that's all that 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.330
 be done regularly also other 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.520
 something that can cause the refinement of 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.580
 locks this is of course stress 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.920
 since if we lose hair it can 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.570
 be also caused by stress and he 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.870
 you really have to pay attention to all that 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.459
 so the best way to deal with 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.860
 stress and already rare are 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.970
 identified which can cause stress 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.760
 try to gm the solution at best ok at 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.310
 also sure we can do for 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.370
 manage all of that you also have to make sure 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.770
 the food we have awakened to eat 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.270
 in a balanced way to take all 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.400
 the vitamins it takes every 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.060
 nutrients it takes to promote 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.070
 a good inch of the hair too what we 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.970
 can do in a practical way this is 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.070
 massage at the time level 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.110
 massage to allow the 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.000
 good circulation of blood in the leather 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.700
 hairy which can also activate the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.160
 cover then if also read the oil from the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.190
 carapatte that is well known for 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.500
 help him when it comes to the shoot of 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.330
 hair still not sparingly 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.519
 use too much but use the oil of 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.170
 because on legs it's really good 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:15.470
 rosemary oil also title i the 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.390
 tea tree the arm and and do not hesitate above all 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.570
 do not do your research 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.820
 but in any case know that there is 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.590
 the practical question there is the question 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.959
 nutrients but there is also the 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.310
 question of stress so from then on you 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.959
 see all this I'm sure there will be 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.850
 no problem I also wanted to 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.000
 to share with you a link that their 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.060
 savior published regarding the figure 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.260
 locks also 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.900
 I think that if you need 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.230
 other advice or to see another 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.630
 or to have forgiveness in our information 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.670
 ideas on pale their savior the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.800
 link is under the video 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.090
 ok good the failure of all sweet until the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.890
 next video I make some standards 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.440
 group kiss or also to Argonne 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.440
 is still totally empty 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.440
 bye
