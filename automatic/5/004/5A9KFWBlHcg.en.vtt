00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.430
 the home director this year I would like to show you a guy is for 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.180
 Page 2 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.470
 around it and EPUB Elste 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.470
 So a little harder silicone 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.369
 sometimes the connections to the pub 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.630
 when sees here 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
 easily accessible »the switch here 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.839
 according to the paved ones are good backs 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.989
 Comrade perfectly cut out a bit too big though 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.520
 Porec still works 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.150
 the microphone was worse because of it too and cut with Knut's place 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.760
 Kopper entrance 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.590
 cut out there I have problems with larger connections, however 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.570
 do not fit in there 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.090
 then we do not have something 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.890
 or what I had not seen CAS before 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.710
 To have a chat so included slots at the European Championships 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.800
 at the DLG 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.020
 in a helicopter flight over loudspeakers 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.370
 around the Kitzbüheler the speakers not as through one did not destroy 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.280
 can 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.200
 van Veen 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 but connection also accessible without problems 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.360
 the screen, of course, too 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.140
 how you might see it here 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.260
 a small gap 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
 and the iPad found no worries lay table 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.370
 June appeared 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 and do not be afraid that the actual blatant gang come 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.780
 the same is the same 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.930
 such a state ever used 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.690
 you seemed like fresh Rome and were afraid that Grasser would come 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
 In any case, surf the Internet 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.770
 and see everything without problems 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.039
 I find the pattern 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.300
 this is not my taste 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 but actually looks pretty chic 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 this point 0 1 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.830
 that at the same time for the balls for just under 15 euros 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.839
 from Hong Kong 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.379
 auctioned 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.659
 or bought 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.659
 if so far relatively satisfied with it 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.079
 because she asks questions about the comments I am happy to answer 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.539
 There was another track around me 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.539
 this is a smart driver compatible 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 It's free for this with Clara's Smart Car 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.979
 synonymous GPU so a little harder plastic 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:47.180
 if we like about it we like to see station comments 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.239
 then I have to make an effort though nobody has to worry about it any more 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.419
 who can regrow "Take on Me" we want to see 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.769
 as well as chancellors comment 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.039
 It is compatible with the smart driver as you can see Pastor Smile 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.039
 Suter does not go over it 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.429
 whatever happens if you 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.469
 Picture before you have it on 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.959
 on the edges that she is born too, it has also the bickering down 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 made 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.809
 otherwise agree for the price of ten euros 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.339
 a jockey 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.009
 Buttons sensible 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.259
 clever 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.259
 made as you may see it 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.079
 how embarrassing 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.180
 the money would probably come out for Voss it produced 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.849
 does not fit all that 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.879
 You really did not want anything like the big step here 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.349
 and whoever is left 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.519
 good Kleists 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.519
 I did not have much to say against but not everyone 4 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.509
 as such password protection needs 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.399
 for scratches or light bumps 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:03.869
 that's okay 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.139
 otherwise I would be easy 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.139
 Taking bags or the smart cover is usually enough 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:15.149
 The first sunny times have been there for such a Caceres ICC on the go 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.729
 it's easy to like people
