00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 We friends come to the boys 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.770
 Monday the week has begun and that 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.930
 are now the fresh ones under 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 another city ​​is five why 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 was rescued the beard and rescued 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.990
 hattrick now has a blatant 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.990
 age rating gets that's the same 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 I 've already thought of you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.269
 pronounced within a video and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.669
 Although we were asked because what 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.840
 our personally favorite game would be 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.430
 or when we develop a game 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.280
 What could that be, what would we do then? 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 develop and I have often 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.370
 or for a long time the thought i 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.559
 I think I would prefer or me 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 would develop a gta or a game 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.370
 in the direction is yes an open world title 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.930
 just by doing everything 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 that means we have our own apartment 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.180
 a private house or a family one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.320
 girlfriend a wife or a boyfriend ever 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.730
 after that maybe you are too 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 You can do everything what you can 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.640
 if you want for example for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.870
 wants to go soccer 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.579
 So his favorite club 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 to cheer then you just drive with 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.460
 the car to the stadium and then looks 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.560
 his favorite club 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.950
 and I think that would be absolute 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.830
 revolution of a mmo rpg and exactly 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.810
 at such a game is currently working 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.939
 Developer is well in the entertainment of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 I do not know it but what 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.600
 I have seen her so far 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.220
 really super interesting and interesting 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.900
 if that works, that could work 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.939
 really the whole genre just new 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.640
 revive and that currently work 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.500
 as I said on a mmo rpg with 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.950
 unlimited freedom so one big 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.600
 Created online plays in the modern 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.420
 world in our world today 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 settled and you can actually 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.509
 According to the developer everything is done 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.220
 can be anything you want to 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.680
 Example Citizen Cop Criminal 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 or get doctor i just imagine 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.939
 so before I'm suddenly one 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.369
 professional cleaning power and writing 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.960
 then the floor in his office I imagine 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.240
 That's really very special to me 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 interesting before there are dozens 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.369
 Epic jobs and you can do around the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.189
 Do any activities and watch 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.780
 it is slightly too good to be true 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.649
 to be 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.490
 The whole thing is to be financed 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.160
 a biscuit 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.630
 company and you want one in total 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.190
 Reach 150,000 Canadian dollars 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.960
 so that you can really enjoy it 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.360
 Currently , you get funded 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.770
 about 58,000 Canadian dollars to the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.720
 whole is still running for 16 days 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.030
 By the way , there would be no abo model 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.410
 and no pay makes tour in the the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.390
 Developer in any case already very much 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.650
 sympathetic by the way, see in the background 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.900
 you have a little excerpt 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.060
 the ten minutes the traders are you 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.230
 then ever a first or several 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.790
 insights into the game 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.200
 and now the question to you is what 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.120
 your opinion what do you think you can 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.870
 something ever realize and would 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.340
 you play such a game too 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.100
 how do i get the transition from now 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.540
 identity to hamilton basically not 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.740
 I basically had it there now 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.660
 since not already done that means that 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.740
 we just go to the news and me 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.810
 they are always very 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.370
 interesting the news to android because of 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.780
 title easy it is not like that now 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.580
 meant and will already be many 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.720
 There are still discussions, however 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.820
 really interesting new ones 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.350
 Messages to that and now has 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.510
 hat trick of American 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.540
 entertainment software rating board short 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.370
 srb an age rating namely the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.320
 get the highest possible calls that 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.210
 el sol her stop only for adult 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.190
 So only from 18 years 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.630
 and you only get that when 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.570
 it in the particular game then very much 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.240
 many sex scenes or yes a lot of bare skin 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.920
 Of course I have it now 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.720
 not there is no market for it very much 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.410
 That's why you have to deal with a lot of violence 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.150
 developers a bit too 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.160
 wonder why you ever got this 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.530
 has received awards 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.630
 because that's the second title 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.580
 the snb this classification 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.290
 ever got so far 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.820
 that's why you see the whole thing rather than 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.370
 Achievement but okay the developer 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.380
 is a little strange anyway 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.040
 yes of course the disadvantage now is that 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.500
 nintendo sony and microsoft have said 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.000
 such games with such a classification 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.600
 Do not even come to us with that 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.060
 system 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.740
 that is when the developers of 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.180
 hattrick does not defuse the title 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.260
 then he does not even come to the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.390
 consoles I do not even think so 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.640
 Bad your opinion 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.230
 why was the pc version actually 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.730
 moved by gta 5 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.590
 rockstar games the developer and 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.900
 publisher would lie in that one 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.340
 still various test and optimization phase 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.870
 should carry with it the title as the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.519
 own claims and of course 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.160
 the demands of the community 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.660
 According to users can loudly persuades 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.700
 which now has its own theory 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.950
 However, it has been established 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.720
 another reason and that's what you wanted 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.690
 necessarily that the title in the next 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.350
 So in the financial year 2015, this will appear 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.330
 financial year 2014 ends on 21 march 2015 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.490
 and gta 5 is well known 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.500
 for the pc on 24 march 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.010
 so that's gta 5 so the 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.440
 pc version in the financial year 2015 and to 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.230
 Reminder the ps3 and the xbox 360 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.970
 version are indeed on 13 September 2013 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.680
 appeared line also in one 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.990
 own year in the last year is then 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.430
 the xbox won and the ps4 version 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.860
 appeared and are also in the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.510
 a few years, that is, in each one 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.370
 year, there are good sales and happy 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.020
 of course, the shareholders because you 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.690
 just very good every year 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.310
 Turnover has currently located 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.830
 Although beds are being built in development 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.660
 However , you should probably only 2016 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.479
 appear and how it is with a red dead 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.370
 redemption 2 looks like nobody knows that 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.750
 can currently only speculated about it 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.060
 become 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.800
 Once again the world is in ruins 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.450
 a large part of the world population has 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.360
