out<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.600> case<00:00:54.899> itself<00:00:55.410> or<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> back

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
out now the case itself or the back

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340 
out now the case itself or the back
shell<00:00:56.340> i<00:00:56.370> should<00:00:56.730> say<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.180> super<00:00:58.109> lightweight

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
shell i should say is super lightweight

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.470 
shell i should say is super lightweight
it<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.190> also<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.899> thin<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.210> millimeters<00:01:03.210> or

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
it is also very thin the millimeters or

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.719 
it is also very thin the millimeters or
the<00:01:03.660> measurements<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.650> come<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.400> one

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the measurements on it come in at one

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.450 
the measurements on it come in at one
point<00:01:06.030> five<00:01:06.390> millimeter<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.310> going

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
point five millimeter so this is going

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.350 
point five millimeter so this is going
to<00:01:08.520> keep<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.570> form<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.830> weight<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.880> shape

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
to keep the form or the weight and shape

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.420 
to keep the form or the weight and shape
of<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.659> mini<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.470> well<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.070> saw<00:01:14.280> me

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
only place you can attach it so let's go

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.350 
only place you can attach it so let's go
ahead<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.700> take<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.879> look<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.300> let's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
ahead and take a look at this let's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.720 
ahead and take a look at this let's
start<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> bottom<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.220> your

there's no degradation and sound there's

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.940 
there's no degradation and sound there's
your<00:02:20.030> lightning<00:02:20.269> port<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.769> going<00:02:21.890> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
your lightning port and it's going to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.800 
your lightning port and it's going to
work<00:02:22.220> pretty<00:02:22.519> much<00:02:22.640> with<00:02:23.060> anything<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.599> has

slippery<00:03:44.419> adds<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.620> little<00:03:45.829> bit<00:03:45.980> of<00:03:46.129> stick<00:03:46.609> to

slippery adds a little bit of stick to

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.479 
slippery adds a little bit of stick to
it<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.419> keeps<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:48.290> design<00:03:48.620> really<00:03:49.190> well<00:03:49.370> and

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
it so keeps the design really well and

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.860 
it so keeps the design really well and
of<00:03:49.609> course<00:03:49.819> this<00:03:50.000> works<00:03:50.239> with<00:03:50.389> your<00:03:50.540> Smart

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
Cover so you can actually fold up smart

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.599 
Cover so you can actually fold up smart
cover<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.329> use<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.169> in<00:03:54.290> your<00:03:54.349> stand<00:03:54.829> mode<00:03:55.129> just

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609

like<00:03:55.819> that<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.269> of<00:03:56.510> course<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.840> can<00:03:57.019> use<00:03:57.139> it

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
like that and of course you can use it

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.990 
like that and of course you can use it
in<00:03:57.379> your<00:03:57.410> other<00:03:57.650> stand<00:03:57.980> mode<00:03:58.190> just<00:03:58.609> like<00:03:58.819> that
