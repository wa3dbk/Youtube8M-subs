00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
correct diagonal the little rhyme to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480 
correct diagonal the little rhyme to
remember<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.199> rise<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.830> fall<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.340> the

remember is you rise and fall with the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.240 
remember is you rise and fall with the
leg<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> wall<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.960> outside<00:00:31.500> fronts<00:00:31.949> going

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
leg on the wall so outside fronts going

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.069 
leg on the wall so outside fronts going
forward<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> writer<00:00:33.000> should<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.329> rising<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
forward the writer should be rising and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
forward the writer should be rising and
posting<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> horse<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.399> English<00:00:36.270> being

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
posting with the horse in English being

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.290 
posting with the horse in English being
on<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> correct<00:00:37.170> diagonal<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.280> much<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:39.000> as

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
on the correct diagonal is as much as as

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.240 
on the correct diagonal is as much as as
important<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:40.050> being<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> correct<00:00:40.980> lead

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
important as being on the correct lead

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.100 
important as being on the correct lead
because<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.300> balanced<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
because you are balanced with the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.779 
because you are balanced with the
movement<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.800> horse<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.370> you're<00:00:44.579> going

through a curve or going through a
circle<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.539> go<00:00:48.629> ahead<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
circle right now you can go ahead and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.670 
circle right now you can go ahead and
open<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.320> your<00:00:49.500> eyes<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.989> go<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.469> your

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
open up your eyes and go up in your

two-point position okay

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
two-point position okay
two-point<00:00:55.590> position<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.280> sort<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.270> just

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
two-point position is sort of like just

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.200 
two-point position is sort of like just

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
post is where we will have you stand 4 5

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.060 
post is where we will have you stand 4 5
strides<00:01:50.460> pose<00:01:51.299> 4<00:01:51.600> 5<00:01:51.810> strides<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:52.770> sit

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
strides pose 4 5 strides and then sit

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.399 
strides pose 4 5 strides and then sit
for<00:01:53.310> 5<00:01:53.520> strides<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:55.020> ahead<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.350> do

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
for 5 strides so if you go ahead and do

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.399 
for 5 strides so if you go ahead and do
that<00:01:55.439> we're<00:01:56.040> gonna<00:01:56.100> stand<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.880> 5<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.570> try<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
that we're gonna stand for 5 and try to

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.039 
that we're gonna stand for 5 and try to
feel<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> motion<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.670> horse<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:00.869> as

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
feel the motion of that horse so then as

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.709 
feel the motion of that horse so then as
the<00:02:01.350> outside<00:02:01.890> front<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.549> inside<00:02:02.909> hein<00:02:03.509> are

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the outside front and inside hein are

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.289 
the outside front and inside hein are
moving<00:02:03.990> forward<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.829> come<00:02:05.070> down<00:02:05.280> right<00:02:05.700> into

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
moving forward you come down right into

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.990 
moving forward you come down right into
the<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.530> correct<00:02:07.950> diagonal<00:02:08.489> with<00:02:08.610> your<00:02:08.789> horse

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the the correct diagonal with your horse

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.180 
the the correct diagonal with your horse
and<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.050> how<00:02:10.200> she's<00:02:10.500> balanced<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and you can see how she's balanced and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.940 
and you can see how she's balanced and
she's<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> correct<00:02:11.910> diagonal

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
she's on the correct diagonal

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.250 
she's on the correct diagonal
as<00:02:13.950> she<00:02:14.820> was<00:02:14.970> rising<00:02:15.500> with<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.680> outside<00:02:17.160> leg

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
as she was rising with that outside leg

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.990 
as she was rising with that outside leg
if<00:02:19.260> you're<00:02:19.800> on<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> incorrect<00:02:20.430> diagonal

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
if you're on the incorrect diagonal

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.360 
if you're on the incorrect diagonal
you'll<00:02:21.180> feel<00:02:21.510> your<00:02:21.690> body<00:02:21.870> twist<00:02:22.290> more<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.890> you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
you'll feel your body twist more and you

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.060 
you'll feel your body twist more and you
will<00:02:23.490> not<00:02:23.610> be<00:02:23.820> in<00:02:23.910> balance<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:24.480> horse

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
will not be in balance with your horse

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.070 
will not be in balance with your horse
also<00:02:26.070> our<00:02:26.220> English<00:02:26.610> trot<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.240> more<00:02:27.600> forward

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
also our English trot is a more forward

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.430 
also our English trot is a more forward
moving<00:02:28.410> trot<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.760> very<00:02:30.180> slow<00:02:30.540> western<00:02:31.140> trot

moving trot and a very slow western trot

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.050 
moving trot and a very slow western trot
really<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:32.070> be<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.550> challenge<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
really can be more of a challenge to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.720 
really can be more of a challenge to
post<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.050> as<00:02:34.200> she<00:02:34.410> moves<00:02:34.620> him<00:02:34.800> into<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> little

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
post so as she moves him into a little

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.820 
post so as she moves him into a little
bit<00:02:35.850> brisker<00:02:36.270> pace<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:37.020> actually<00:02:37.590> gets<00:02:37.740> to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
bit brisker pace that actually gets to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.610 
bit brisker pace that actually gets to
be<00:02:37.980> easier<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.880> post<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.450> than<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.020> trot<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.500> is

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
be easier to post at than a trot that is

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.610 
be easier to post at than a trot that is
