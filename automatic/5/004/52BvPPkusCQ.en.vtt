tape<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.520> off<00:00:59.410> is<00:01:00.460> use<00:01:01.460> pencil<00:01:02.379> pencil<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:03.710> much

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
tape it off is use pencil pencil is much

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.870 
tape it off is use pencil pencil is much
easier<00:01:04.430> take<00:01:05.059> your<00:01:05.239> stencil<00:01:06.009> that<00:01:07.009> you<00:01:07.640> took

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
easier take your stencil that you took

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.710 
easier take your stencil that you took
from<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.240> other<00:01:08.420> side<00:01:09.220> flip<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.460> over<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.270> get

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
from the other side flip it over and get

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.310 
from the other side flip it over and get
started<00:01:11.960> here

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
started here

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.969 
started here
yeah<00:01:12.920> just<00:01:13.760> draw<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.030> light<00:01:14.270> at<00:01:14.799> right<00:01:15.799> there

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
yeah just draw a light at right there

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.730 
yeah just draw a light at right there
and<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:17.150> used<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.630> pencil<00:01:17.930> because<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:18.650> just

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740

mistake I'm going to use my dremel tool
here<00:01:26.170> with<00:01:27.170> an<00:01:27.290> engraving<00:01:27.590> bit<00:01:27.890> I'm<00:01:28.130> gonna<00:01:28.310> go

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
here with an engraving bit I'm gonna go

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.940 
here with an engraving bit I'm gonna go
right<00:01:28.549> over<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.880> tape<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.740> make<00:01:30.740> sure

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
right over the tape and make sure

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.969 
right over the tape and make sure
because<00:01:31.729> of<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.060> it's<00:01:32.360> it's<00:01:32.689> plastic<00:01:33.170> that

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
because of this it's it's plastic that

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.460 
because of this it's it's plastic that
plastic<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:35.180> little<00:01:35.420> fur<00:01:35.630> off<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:36.049> plastic

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
plastic that little fur off that plastic

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.340 
plastic that little fur off that plastic
now<00:01:37.100> waste<00:01:37.400> is<00:01:37.729> all<00:01:38.329> going<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.570> fall<00:01:38.780> down<00:01:38.810> onto

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
now waste is all going to fall down onto

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.520 
now waste is all going to fall down onto
your<00:01:39.380> tire<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.520> on<00:01:40.790> your<00:01:40.939> tailpipe<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.689> big

gonna happen you have plastic stuck to

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.090 
gonna happen you have plastic stuck to
your<00:01:46.880> tailpipe<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:47.479> mask<00:01:48.290> off<00:01:48.530> your<00:01:48.740> work<00:01:48.890> you

your tailpipe so mask off your work you
know<00:01:49.220> work<00:01:49.430> clean<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.409> your<00:01:51.409> cleanups<00:01:51.740> a

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
know work clean and your cleanups a

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.120 
know work clean and your cleanups a
little<00:01:51.950> faster<00:01:52.390> anyhow<00:01:53.500> here<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.619> is<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.920> little

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
little faster anyhow here it is a little

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.429 
little faster anyhow here it is a little
engraving<00:01:55.549> bit<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:55.970> then<00:01:56.600> later<00:01:56.990> on<00:01:57.079> I<00:01:57.200> move

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
engraving bit and then later on I move

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.149 
engraving bit and then later on I move
up<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.740> other<00:01:58.130> parts<00:01:58.490> other<00:01:59.619> other<00:02:00.619> tools<00:02:00.890> I

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
up to other parts other other tools I

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.770 
up to other parts other other tools I
use<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:02.049> also<00:02:03.049> use<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.320> cutting<00:02:03.619> wheel<00:02:03.710> or

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
use a I also use a cutting wheel or

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.300 
use a I also use a cutting wheel or
let's<00:02:05.780> see<00:02:05.990> here<00:02:08.500> there's<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.619> jumbles<00:02:10.009> cutting

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
let's see here there's a jumbles cutting

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.210 
let's see here there's a jumbles cutting
wheel<00:02:10.459> well<00:02:11.239> I'll<00:02:11.329> use<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:11.660> cutting<00:02:12.019> bit

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
wheel well I'll use this cutting bit

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.710 
wheel well I'll use this cutting bit
let's<00:02:13.220> kind<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.489> like<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> drill<00:02:13.940> bit<00:02:14.150> for

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
let's kind of like a drill bit for

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.830 
let's kind of like a drill bit for
rotary<00:02:15.020> tools

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.450 

this<00:02:18.840> one<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:21.260> kind<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.380> what<00:02:22.590> what

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
this one here kind of like what what

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.400 
this one here kind of like what what
they<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.700> on<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.820> Rotozip<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.690> then<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.200> use<00:02:25.380> a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
they have on a Rotozip and then I use a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.860 
they have on a Rotozip and then I use a
different<00:02:25.770> standing<00:02:26.280> tools<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.720> here

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
different standing tools this one here

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
the place at the tape because when you

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.750 
the place at the tape because when you
get<00:03:21.689> go<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.109> start<00:03:22.379> cutting<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.799> sanding<00:03:23.010> with

the<00:03:23.849> tape<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> way<00:03:24.329> it's<00:03:25.200> too<00:03:25.349> much<00:03:25.469> of<00:03:25.590> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the tape in the way it's too much of a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:36.250 
the tape in the way it's too much of a
mess<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:26.489> here<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:26.730> go<00:03:26.849> let's<00:03:26.999> take<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.180> look

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.280 

you

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.290 

like<00:03:44.290> there<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.190> rough<00:03:45.370> cut<00:03:45.640> right

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
like there it is the rough cut right

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.850 
like there it is the rough cut right
here<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:47.680> see<00:03:47.950> not<00:03:48.730> too<00:03:49.000> pretty<00:03:49.860> doesn't

and then we'll finish that up with a

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.990 
and then we'll finish that up with a
file<00:04:03.090> maybe<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.209> flat<00:04:04.989> metal<00:04:05.380> file<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:09.730> is
