00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.720
 friends on youtube and followed oil paintings that 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.430
 I bring them as in formatting the 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.960
 knicks and languages 410 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.939
 and good 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.839
 but what they have to do in my case 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.839
 would be to turn off your cell phone 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.500
 once turned off what they would have to 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.680
 to do is press the off button and 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.970
 ignition lock and at the same time 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.970
 both volume 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 is to show these two options 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.990
 if you select with the volume dates 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.760
 in this case they give you the volume above 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.760
 where it says recovery mode 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.260
 Once inside, this menu will appear 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.260
 of options 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.520
 you will have to give me where it says 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.530
 factor and reset 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.080
 and to select it they will have to 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.640
 press the d button 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.640
 to select applications 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.430
 now here the second minor and only you 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.270
 have to give that if you erase all the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.270
 user data 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.689
 and without thinking to erase everything 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.060
 and I was ready as I had already done 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.430
 he deserves not even 100 if they want him 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.840
 you restart you have to give in 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.840

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.859

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.400

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.400

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.010
