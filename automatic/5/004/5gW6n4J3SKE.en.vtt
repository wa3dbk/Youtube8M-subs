had a super spirit bomb as his ultimate
attack<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.320> made<00:00:58.469> me<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.949> wonder<00:00:59.760> how

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
attack which made me think I wonder how

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.490 
attack which made me think I wonder how
these<00:01:00.210> attacks<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.899> been<00:01:01.020> selected

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
these attacks are going been selected

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.139 
these attacks are going been selected
and<00:01:01.590> never<00:01:01.770> realized<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.579> might<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and never realized they might do the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.670 
and never realized they might do the
same<00:01:03.180> thing<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.690> raging<00:01:04.080> blasted<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
same thing that raging blasted in the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.899 
same thing that raging blasted in the
past<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> never<00:01:05.339> play<00:01:05.489> raging<00:01:05.820> blast

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
past so if you never play raging blast

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the banner came out I noticed the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.840 
the banner came out I noticed the
scatter<00:01:37.530> pajita<00:01:37.890> had<00:01:38.009> final<00:01:38.310> flash<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.759> that

scatter pajita had final flash and that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.609 
scatter pajita had final flash and that
was<00:01:38.939> kind<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> confusing<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.780> assumed<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
was kind of confusing I assumed that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.990 
was kind of confusing I assumed that
they<00:01:40.770> did<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.610> wanted<00:01:41.850> him

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
they did that is because they wanted him

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520 
they did that is because they wanted him
to<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.240> cool<00:01:42.479> attack<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.170> maybe<00:01:43.470> we

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to have a cool attack and maybe we

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.319 
to have a cool attack and maybe we
didn't<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.070> him<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.310> Galaga<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:45.119> some

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
didn't want him to have Galaga for some

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.539 
didn't want him to have Galaga for some
reason<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.780> don't<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.310> say<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
reason I don't know I just know say the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.190 
reason I don't know I just know say the
final<00:01:47.820> flash<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.270> they<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.540> did<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.840> fit

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
final flash and they just did not fit

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.840 
final flash and they just did not fit
but<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.770> realized<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.759> they

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
but then I realized I think what they

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.310 
but then I realized I think what they
going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> when<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.140> game
