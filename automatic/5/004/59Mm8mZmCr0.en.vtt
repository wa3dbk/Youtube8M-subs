00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 racing is in the process of making a 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.370
 way to the final stages 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.049
 but in front of the Ile-de-France 8th 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.210
 ranking stood a hurdle of 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.320
 size verne cotterets the clermontois 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.910
 were there to forget their disappointment 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
 in perpignan a fortnight ago 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.199
 but the cold the rain are right the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.820
 quality of play early in the game the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.070
 teams do to talk to them their scorer 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:27.650
 a penalty for brock james and the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.650
 jaunards 2 for wisniewski and racing 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.840
 6 3 for the Parisians the break in 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.820
 second period james will equalize but 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.030
 at the hour of play it misses the opportunity to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.649
 give the advantage to the Clermont 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.840
 private of nine international against 5 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.090
 for racing clermont undergoes in the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520
 game and is penalized again to two 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.469
 kicks of perfect kicks from 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.700
 Jonathan Wisniewski and the Paris Region 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.860
 won a fourth victory 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.379
 consecutive league 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.530
 final score 12 to 6 the asm must as for 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 she'll settle for the defensive bonus 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.890
 we are very satisfied today 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.710
 it was one of the hardest matches of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.299
 this series we knew that clermont came 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 with ambitions not known one is 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.950
 very satisfied there was commitment 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 courage I think it's 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 thanks to that we have been able to win 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.299
 today and of course that we 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.720
 comforts our goals and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.850
 I hope that we will react 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.740
 in any case we are far from having arrived and 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.510
 you do not have to see this and get 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.090
 get back to work and still a lot 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.619
 a lot to fix but 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.000
 here we take we take a processor 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.140
 but we we suggest uci I 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.630
 think there was a way to take them 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.280
 we will have had a defense match during 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.289
 of this evening a very nice match 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.850
 all the same between racing and clermont 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.530
 it's true thomas that the defenses have 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.159
 took over the attacks during 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.780
 of this meeting 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.979
 yes but that said it allowed anyway 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.170
 to both teams to develop a lot 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.670
 even if in the end actually 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.219
 they never managed to do 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.140
 skip the defensive lock of 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.000
 Clermont and uprooting that have been 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.530
 very skilled very disciplined in this 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.640
 gambling sector which makes it the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.610
 see in pictures we saw some actions 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.079
 long with a multiplication of times 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.179
 of play but each time the same 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.259
 finding the defenses are not 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.509
 let go 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.560
 we went to the scorer to do 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.989
 the difference in this part 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.000
 exactly in these cases when the 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.530
 defenses do not give up well we do 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.700
 trust striker with brock james du 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.220
 side of clermont who hands the two 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.780
 teams tied 6 everywhere and then in 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.269
 end of meeting jonathan life to what 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.519
 it will pass in the end four penalties 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.360
 including this one that will allow racing 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.470
 to win 12 to 6 12 to 6 in favor of 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.560
 racing is the fourth victory 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.299
 straight for racing leads face 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.829
 clermont who takes a bonus point 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.569
 defensive a racing team who 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.220
 now appears as a client 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.730
 very serious for the qualification for 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.519
 the final stages 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.410
 yes it's just they're trying to 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.000
 build two by overcoming a 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.430
 team as clearly to assert 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.170
 ultimately their ambition is to 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.489
 recover a trust capital that they 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.590
 had a little lost at the beginning of the season 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.900
 it's racing now 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.579
 with a lot of ambition towards 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.810
 dams of this championship the racing which 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.220
 is at the next day will play 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.790
 once again at home this will be 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.790
 in front of bayonne
