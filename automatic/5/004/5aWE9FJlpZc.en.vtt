00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.599
 Presentation of my car system vehicles 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.700
 Here you can see my eight vehicles 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.420
 start with my first vehicle and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.359
 Although the bus was right on the bus, it was mine 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.840
 first vehicle and was in a faller 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.570
 start pack and great to start 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.080
 suitable with him I have some things 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.369
 tested and today he does not see anymore 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.850
 so beautiful it was mine 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.910
 first vehicle that has become real 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 Great made you can see he is still driving 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 and recently got new batteries 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.950
 The bus is on a paper road 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.950
 and I used the magnetic tape 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.410
 this is my wood truck he was mine 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.900
 second vehicle and also with him 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.810
 I ever changed the batteries and 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.580
 Although replaced by larger bus batteries 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.580
 This is what you see in this picture 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.380
 I changed the batteries with him there 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.810
 he only drove very slowly now 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.330
 he drives slower than my bus because of that 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.210
 he has no trailer hintendran since 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.640
 This is also very difficult but he drives 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.500
 again a little faster and his 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.500
 performance has also increased a bit 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.049
 my next vehicle is this 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.869
 fire truck Unfortunately, it has no front 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.620
 basket more there I put it somewhere 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:17.110
 lost it has a battery and two 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.360
 flashing lights on the roof unfortunately drives 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.760
 is pretty slow as we see and 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.489
 the flashing lights do not stop 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.400
 I've already tried a lot with it 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.050
 my fire truck drives faster 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.050
 but I did not make it 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.110
 this is my little van too 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.770
 I already have a new battery with him 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.560
 installed 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.220
 The battery was changed since I was 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.230
 vehicle to another charger what 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.960
 not by the pastor has joined 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.730
 and unfortunately the battery is broken 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.130
 My transporter has also left 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.130
 pretty slow but that was already 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.390
 always enough for a small car 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.390
 to look that up 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.769
 so this is my first self built one 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.299
 case ak system car it is a truck of 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.159
 the company herpa with the name sachs fans 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.700
 and here I always see one 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:14.090
 gear motor installed 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.680
 He does not drive very fast 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.310
 but well what do I want there now 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.430
 make the engine is built in and for 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.590
 my first vehicle bothers me that 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.660
 not at all he also runs something 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.210
 not round on the front axle but oh well 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.960
 as I said for my first vehicle 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.960
 completely okay 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.960
 Here you can see a second one 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:06.360
 homemade case ak system vehicle 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.960
 again from herpa with the name 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.380
 transport and service and here you see 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:19.229
 the axle suspension is made of plastic 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.300
 he does quite well and drives himself 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.259
 I have about four and a half for the conversion 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.259
 needed hours 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:01.689
 so now we come to something special 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:04.990
 namely my articulated bus here you can see 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:08.339
 also the built-in battery in the front part 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:12.309
 of the vehicle and the engine behind 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:14.949
 The articulated bus is the driving model 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:18.689
 fair at the rear axle like we are here 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:23.289
 A good 10 is the axle suspension 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:25.409
 He is also doing really good brass driving 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.839
 I did not think so 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:31.749
 only through very narrow radii comes 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:34.659
 not so good because the joint is not yet 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:37.569
 Optimized is still a bit stiff 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:43.439
 but I still work for it 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:43.439
 I needed about 13 hours of conversion 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.710
 Now we come to my last 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.020
 again a truck from the truck 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:04.740
 brand herper are particularly suitable 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:08.730
 good for the conversion with him is the 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.520
 special feature that he has the batteries in the back 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:14.610
 Trailer in there just because in front 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.690
 already the engine is and just no 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:23.580
 place was more and I have with him the 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:25.830
 original fax holder used as this 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.940
 just a lot faster than one out 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.800
 to build brass 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:39.180
 and you have the right distance 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:40.800
 from the snail to the dentist this was 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.920
 my last vehicle 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.300
 I hope my very first video has 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.760
 you like it 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.510
 Of course there would be many more 

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.930
 consequences 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:55.050
 also from my system because I'm building grad 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.540
 I'll be a city soon 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.460
 make a video if it is yours 

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.680
 but has fallen a thumb 

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.250
 highly subscribes me see you in the 

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.250
 next video
