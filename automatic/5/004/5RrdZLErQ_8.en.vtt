00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
seriously it was dangerous because I it

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.410 
seriously it was dangerous because I it
felt<00:01:43.710> completely<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> kickstand<00:01:45.240> was

felt completely like the kickstand was

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.820 
felt completely like the kickstand was
out<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.900> I<00:01:46.200> guess<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> wasn't<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.960> there

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
out but I guess it wasn't and so there

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.700 
out but I guess it wasn't and so there
