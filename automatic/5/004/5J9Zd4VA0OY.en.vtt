like<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> submarine<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.790> light<00:02:03.030> at

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
like with the submarine it's light at

the top dark at the bottom and very easy

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.350 
the top dark at the bottom and very easy
to<00:02:05.670> understand

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
to understand

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.570

in<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:07.020> case<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.439> purposely<00:02:07.950> wanted<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> light

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
in this case I purposely wanted to light

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.600 
in this case I purposely wanted to light
the<00:02:08.700> whole<00:02:08.879> thing<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.929> sloppily<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.220> badly

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the whole thing not sloppily or badly

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.140

a<00:02:13.180> better<00:02:13.450> word<00:02:13.689> fully<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.980> want<00:02:15.849> people<00:02:16.120> to

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
a better word fully I want people to

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.720 
a better word fully I want people to
look<00:02:16.390> at<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.599> shot<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.110> not<00:02:17.730> absolutely

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
look at the shot and not absolutely

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.420 
look at the shot and not absolutely
positively<00:02:19.450> understand<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.980> fraction

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
positively understand in just a fraction

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.030 
positively understand in just a fraction
of<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.610> second<00:02:21.970> what's<00:02:22.540> happening<00:02:23.140> even<00:02:23.890> that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
of a second what's happening even that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.490 
of a second what's happening even that
we're<00:02:24.189> actually<00:02:24.310> looking<00:02:24.640> at<00:02:24.939> a<00:02:24.970> car<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.569> think

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
we're actually looking at a car I think

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.229 
we're actually looking at a car I think
maybe<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.980> Americans<00:02:27.519> it's<00:02:27.760> easy<00:02:28.060> to

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
maybe for Americans it's easy to

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.910 
maybe for Americans it's easy to
understand<00:02:28.689> that<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.200> indeed<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.590> car

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
understand that this is indeed a car

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.220 
understand that this is indeed a car

and<00:03:19.449> interestingly<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:21.040> shot<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.400> saw

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
and interestingly the shot you just saw

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.789 
and interestingly the shot you just saw
is<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.419> same<00:03:22.629> as<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:22.930> shot<00:03:23.230> which<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
is the same as this shot which is the

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.110 
is the same as this shot which is the
basic<00:03:24.129> photograph<00:03:24.549> before<00:03:24.879> we<00:03:24.940> start

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
basic photograph before we start

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.849 
basic photograph before we start
lighting<00:03:25.329> there's<00:03:26.109> no<00:03:26.319> difference<00:03:26.680> between

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
lighting there's no difference between

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.240 
lighting there's no difference between
this<00:03:27.099> shot<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:29.019> shot<00:03:29.379> except<00:03:30.040> for<00:03:30.190> the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
this shot and this shot except for the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.710 
this shot and this shot except for the
lighting<00:03:30.549> itself<00:03:30.819> I<00:03:31.060> think<00:03:31.150> it's<00:03:31.480> just

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
lighting itself I think it's just

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.559 
lighting itself I think it's just
mind-blowing<00:03:32.169> ly<00:03:32.530> interesting<00:03:33.299> when<00:03:34.299> we<00:03:34.419> look

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
mind-blowing ly interesting when we look

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.000 
mind-blowing ly interesting when we look
at<00:03:34.659> some<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:34.989> close-ups<00:03:35.470> it's<00:03:35.680> great<00:03:35.859> to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
at some of the close-ups it's great to

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.710 
at some of the close-ups it's great to
