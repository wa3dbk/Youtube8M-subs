we<00:05:20.729> go<00:05:20.880> back<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:26.280> seems<00:05:26.550> like<00:05:26.669> apple<00:05:27.270> doesn't

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
we go back it seems like apple doesn't

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.600 
we go back it seems like apple doesn't
have<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.020> rear<00:05:28.260> ender<00:05:28.740> when<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.160> go<00:05:29.340> back<00:05:29.550> a

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
have the rear ender when you go back a

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.000 
have the rear ender when you go back a
page<00:05:29.930> let's<00:05:30.930> see<00:05:31.080> here<00:05:31.229> you<00:05:31.410> can<00:05:31.470> see<00:05:31.740> you<00:05:31.860> can

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010

quickly<00:05:32.220> go<00:05:32.490> back<00:05:32.700> a<00:05:32.729> page<00:05:32.910> here<00:05:34.340> see<00:05:35.340> here<00:05:35.729> I

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.600 

mean<00:05:39.479> you<00:05:39.630> kind<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:39.900> like<00:05:40.050> cash<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:41.160> website

something because you can use go back
like<00:05:43.860> this<00:05:44.099> and<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:45.120> definitely<00:05:45.419> believe<00:05:45.840> that

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
like this and I definitely believe that

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.070 
like this and I definitely believe that
that's<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.530> very<00:05:47.010> useful<00:05:47.160> feature<00:05:48.050> which<00:05:49.050> is

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
that's a very useful feature which is

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.440 
that's a very useful feature which is
pretty<00:05:49.349> cool<00:05:49.680> also<00:05:50.190> that<00:05:50.639> you<00:05:50.789> can<00:05:50.910> swipe<00:05:51.090> from

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
pretty cool also that you can swipe from

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.730 
pretty cool also that you can swipe from
the<00:05:51.510> side<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:53.450> mean<00:05:54.450> it's<00:05:54.750> it's<00:05:55.200> kind<00:05:55.590> of<00:05:55.620> like

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
the side I mean it's it's kind of like

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.330 
the side I mean it's it's kind of like
extremely<00:05:56.250> useful<00:05:56.990> of<00:05:57.990> course<00:05:58.590> both<00:05:59.010> browsers

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
extremely useful of course both browsers

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.800 
extremely useful of course both browsers
also<00:06:00.180> have<00:06:00.900> other<00:06:01.110> features<00:06:01.680> and<00:06:02.090> which<00:06:03.090> you

to go in a private mode and see here if

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.890 
to go in a private mode and see here if
we<00:06:10.199> do<00:06:10.349> it<00:06:10.470> on<00:06:10.590> both

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.749 

what<00:06:15.900> this<00:06:16.050> will<00:06:16.499> happen<00:06:16.740> is<00:06:17.129> that<00:06:17.370> you<00:06:17.610> can

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
see the browser goes dark on both

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.399 
see the browser goes dark on both
devices<00:06:19.650> and<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:21.150> can<00:06:21.360> go<00:06:21.539> search<00:06:21.990> for<00:06:22.020> porn

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
devices and you can go search for porn

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.839

or<00:06:22.530> something<00:06:22.620> and<00:06:23.069> it<00:06:23.159> won't<00:06:23.340> save<00:06:23.610> in<00:06:23.759> the

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
or something and it won't save in the

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.830 
or something and it won't save in the
history<00:06:24.300> which<00:06:25.199> is<00:06:25.289> kind<00:06:25.529> of<00:06:25.560> nice<00:06:25.680> and<00:06:26.840> then

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
history which is kind of nice and then

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:39.019 
history which is kind of nice and then
