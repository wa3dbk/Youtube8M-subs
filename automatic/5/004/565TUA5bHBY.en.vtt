formula they have a few screenshots and
a<00:00:17.260> trailer<00:00:17.529> have<00:00:17.740> been<00:00:17.980> released<00:00:18.279> so<00:00:18.849> there

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
a trailer have been released so there

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.370 
a trailer have been released so there
are<00:00:19.119> some<00:00:19.269> links<00:00:19.509> to<00:00:19.689> these<00:00:19.929> in<00:00:20.169> the

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
are some links to these in the

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.519 
are some links to these in the
description<00:00:21.009> so<00:00:21.640> what<00:00:22.480> we<00:00:22.569> can<00:00:22.720> expect<00:00:22.900> well

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
description so what we can expect well

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.710 
description so what we can expect well
we<00:00:23.619> can<00:00:23.769> expect<00:00:24.189> see<00:00:24.489> greater<00:00:24.849> player<00:00:25.210> impact

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
we can expect see greater player impact

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.630 
we can expect see greater player impact
so<00:00:25.960> basically<00:00:26.380> port<00:00:26.739> that<00:00:26.919> means<00:00:27.159> you'll<00:00:27.429> see

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
so basically port that means you'll see

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.759 
so basically port that means you'll see
players<00:00:27.909> diving<00:00:28.509> over<00:00:28.749> outstretched<00:00:29.229> legs<00:00:29.529> in

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
players diving over outstretched legs in

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.429 
players diving over outstretched legs in
a<00:00:30.159> much<00:00:30.310> more<00:00:30.339> dramatic<00:00:31.029> fashion<00:00:31.439> also

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
a much more dramatic fashion also

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.560 
a much more dramatic fashion also
greater<00:00:32.770> tackling<00:00:33.280> diversity<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.120> impact

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
greater tackling diversity and impact

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.510 
greater tackling diversity and impact
means<00:00:35.140> often<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:35.680> won't<00:00:35.920> make<00:00:36.130> the<00:00:36.280> same

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
means often you won't make the same

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.270 
means often you won't make the same
tackle<00:00:37.030> on<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.180> player<00:00:37.510> twice<00:00:37.950> players<00:00:38.950> also

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
tackle on a player twice players also

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.310 
tackle on a player twice players also
get<00:00:39.670> injured<00:00:40.030> according<00:00:40.270> to<00:00:40.510> how<00:00:40.630> much<00:00:40.780> forces

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
get injured according to how much forces

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.530 
get injured according to how much forces
exerted<00:00:41.680> in<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.280> tackle<00:00:42.520> and<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.210> new<00:00:43.360> engine

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
exerted in the tackle and the new engine

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.810 
exerted in the tackle and the new engine
takes<00:00:44.050> into<00:00:44.500> account<00:00:44.530> awkward<00:00:45.280> force<00:00:45.550> and

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
takes into account awkward force and

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.880 
takes into account awkward force and
over<00:00:46.120> stretching<00:00:46.420> yourself<00:00:46.600> as<00:00:46.990> another<00:00:47.680> way

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
over stretching yourself as another way

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.760 
over stretching yourself as another way
of<00:00:47.920> injuring<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:49.390> basically<00:00:50.110> you<00:00:50.230> can<00:00:50.350> have<00:00:50.560> a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
of injuring so basically you can have a

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.640 
of injuring so basically you can have a
much<00:00:51.490> greater<00:00:51.820> chance<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.360> having<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.810> injury

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
much greater chance of having a injury

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.370 
much greater chance of having a injury
crisis<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:55.150> typical<00:00:55.600> features<00:00:55.960> of<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.200> game

will remain the same career mode just

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.140 
will remain the same career mode just
been<00:00:58.450> one<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.780> them<00:00:59.020> so<00:01:00.000> improvements<00:01:01.000> in

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
been one of them so improvements in

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.000 
been one of them so improvements in
player<00:01:01.420> intelligence<00:01:02.050> mean<00:01:02.500> that<00:01:02.710> players

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
player intelligence mean that players

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.920 
player intelligence mean that players
such<00:01:03.280> as<00:01:03.310> Peter<00:01:03.670> Crouch<00:01:04.000> will<00:01:04.269> now<00:01:04.390> be<00:01:04.540> in<00:01:04.720> the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
such as Peter Crouch will now be in the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.200 
such as Peter Crouch will now be in the
box<00:01:05.110> ahead<00:01:05.409> in<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.619> balls<00:01:05.860> whereas<00:01:06.729> in<00:01:06.880> fifa

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
box ahead in the balls whereas in fifa

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.870 
box ahead in the balls whereas in fifa
10<00:01:07.450> he<00:01:07.990> might<00:01:08.140> have<00:01:08.259> been<00:01:08.409> on<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.679> wing

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
10 he might have been on the wing

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.919 
10 he might have been on the wing
crossing<00:01:09.880> them<00:01:09.999> into<00:01:10.329> someone<00:01:10.569> like<00:01:10.659> Germaine

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
crossing them into someone like Germaine

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.300 
crossing them into someone like Germaine
to<00:01:11.109> vote<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.649> just<00:01:11.829> doesn't<00:01:12.159> make<00:01:12.249> sense

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
to vote and it just doesn't make sense

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.550 
to vote and it just doesn't make sense
so<00:01:12.759> greater<00:01:13.329> player<00:01:13.689> intelligence<00:01:14.350> means

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
so greater player intelligence means

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.499 
so greater player intelligence means
he'll<00:01:14.890> now<00:01:15.100> be<00:01:15.159> inside<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.850> box<00:01:16.030> ahead<00:01:16.299> in<00:01:16.420> the

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
he'll now be inside the box ahead in the

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.109 
he'll now be inside the box ahead in the
balls<00:01:16.719> because<00:01:17.289> it<00:01:17.350> makes<00:01:17.380> more<00:01:17.770> sense<00:01:18.119> ml

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119
