to phone her up every day but it was

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.979 
to phone her up every day but it was
nothing<00:03:11.349> sexual<00:03:11.830> there<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.849> would<00:03:13.629> be<00:03:13.780> wrong

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
nothing sexual there this would be wrong

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.110 
I think he chose not to discuss sleeping
with<00:03:24.620> men<00:03:24.890> because<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.370> was<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.640> seventies

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120
