one but anyway there's my tractor and
you<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> said<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.740> city<00:01:35.100> boy<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.899 
grew up in the city and I have no idea
about<00:01:37.770> farming<00:01:39.860> but<00:01:40.860> anyway<00:01:41.250> I'll<00:01:41.549> show<00:01:41.579> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909

about farming but anyway I'll show you
the<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:43.320> fields<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.250> we'll<00:01:44.970> start<00:01:45.270> bush

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the the fields and we'll start bush

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.010 
the the fields and we'll start bush
hogging

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.710 

all<00:01:50.020> right<00:01:50.230> so<00:01:50.500> here<00:01:50.650> we<00:01:50.680> are<00:01:50.800> people<00:01:51.690> done<00:01:52.690> a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
all right so here we are people done a

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.920 
all right so here we are people done a
little<00:01:52.960> bit<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.970> first<00:01:55.270> back<00:01:55.570> field

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
little bit this is the first back field

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.680 
little bit this is the first back field
that<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:57.550> then<00:01:57.910> you<00:01:58.090> see<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.420> tree

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
that I have and then you see that tree

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.110 
that I have and then you see that tree
line<00:01:58.870> separates<00:01:59.620> it<00:01:59.860> over<00:02:00.400> in<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.640> corner<00:02:00.700> I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
line separates it over in that corner I

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.969 
line separates it over in that corner I
can<00:02:01.270> go<00:02:01.540> through<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.050> I<00:02:02.080> got<00:02:02.229> another<00:02:02.620> field

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
can go through and I got another field

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.500 
can go through and I got another field
so<00:02:03.370> open<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.270> eventually<00:02:05.340> separate<00:02:06.340> them<00:02:06.550> use

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
so open and eventually separate them use

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.440 
so open and eventually separate them use
one<00:02:07.869> for<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.470> know<00:02:08.619> grazing<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.850> then<00:02:10.030> plant

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
one for you know grazing and then plant

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:26.010 
one for you know grazing and then plant
and<00:02:11.290> kind<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.680> alternated<00:02:12.959> here<00:02:13.959> we<00:02:14.050> go

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.670 

you

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:55.730 

you

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.020 

all<00:02:56.740> right<00:02:56.890> if<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.250> don't<00:02:57.400> know<00:02:57.520> if<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.670> can<00:02:57.760> see

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
all right if I don't know if you can see

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.000 
all right if I don't know if you can see
but<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.570> right<00:02:58.930> there<00:02:58.990> is<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.470> back<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.890> my

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
but that right there is the back of my

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.970 
but that right there is the back of my
bond<00:03:00.430> like<00:03:01.210> I<00:03:01.330> said<00:03:01.570> once<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.470> get<00:03:02.650> all<00:03:02.800> that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
bond like I said once I get all that

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.660 
bond like I said once I get all that
clean<00:03:03.310> now<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:04.150> could<00:03:04.270> be<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> back<00:03:04.840> barnyard

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
clean now that could be a back barnyard

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.030 
clean now that could be a back barnyard
