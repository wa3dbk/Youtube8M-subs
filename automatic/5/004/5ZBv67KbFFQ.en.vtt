guitar amplifier has 260 watt amplifiers

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.390 
guitar amplifier has 260 watt amplifiers
and<00:00:21.210> two<00:00:21.720> 12-inch<00:00:22.260> speakers<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.890> it's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and two 12-inch speakers and it's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.009 
and two 12-inch speakers and it's
completely<00:00:23.820> solid<00:00:24.029> state<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> happens<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
completely solid state and it happens to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.450 
completely solid state and it happens to
be<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> cleanest<00:00:25.769> amps<00:00:26.070> money<00:00:26.250> can

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
be one of the cleanest amps money can

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
be one of the cleanest amps money can
buy<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> start<00:00:27.960> over<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.410> on

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
buy so we're going to start over here on

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.589 
buy so we're going to start over here on
the<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.429> channel<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:29.970> which<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the the first channel one which is a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.600 
the the first channel one which is a
completely<00:00:31.199> clean<00:00:31.529> channel<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.430> has<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
completely clean channel just has a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450 
completely clean channel just has a
three<00:00:32.850> band<00:00:33.059> parametric<00:00:33.630> EQ<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.460> volume

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
three band parametric EQ and a volume

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
three band parametric EQ and a volume
and<00:00:35.640> an<00:00:36.000> input<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> bright<00:00:36.570> switch<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.020> right

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and an input in a bright switch so right

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.930 
and an input in a bright switch so right
now<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> flatten<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:38.790> guitar

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
now I'm going to flatten out my guitar

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.860 
now I'm going to flatten out my guitar
and<00:00:39.379> look<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> neck<00:00:41.010> pickup<00:00:44.660> it's<00:00:45.660> only

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and look at the neck pickup it's only

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
and look at the neck pickup it's only
turned<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:47.010> tiny<00:00:47.190> bit<00:00:47.399> maybe

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
turned up like a little tiny bit maybe

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
turned up like a little tiny bit maybe
on<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.059> or<00:00:48.180> two<00:00:50.120> it's<00:00:51.120> still<00:00:51.329> very<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:51.750> very

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
on one or two it's still very very very

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.510 
on one or two it's still very very very
loud<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.739> cutting<00:00:53.010> through<00:00:53.100> quite<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
loud and it's cutting through quite a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.060 
loud and it's cutting through quite a
bit<00:00:56.719> so<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> does<00:00:58.050> sing<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.739> clean

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
bit so it does sing it's very clean

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.040 
bit so it does sing it's very clean
you're<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> notice<00:00:59.820> nuances<00:01:00.780> about

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you're going to notice nuances about

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
you're going to notice nuances about
your<00:01:01.199> guitar<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> play<00:01:01.949> through<00:01:02.160> an<00:01:02.219> amp

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
your guitar when you play through an amp

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
your guitar when you play through an amp
like<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> probably<00:01:03.180> may<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.960> not

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like this that you probably may have not

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.410 
like this that you probably may have not
noticed<00:01:04.350> before<00:01:05.000> because<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.180> incredibly

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
noticed before because it's incredibly

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.179 
noticed before because it's incredibly
clean<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.010> EQ<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.670> incredibly<00:01:09.150> flat<00:01:10.189> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
clean and the EQ is incredibly flat you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.859 
clean and the EQ is incredibly flat you
can<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.729> really<00:01:11.939> interesting<00:01:12.060> sounds

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can get some really interesting sounds

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.060 
can get some really interesting sounds
out<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.170> amp<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> really

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
out of this amp and it really

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.070 
out of this amp and it really
accentuates<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:15.000> effects<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.540> well<00:01:15.750> because

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
accentuates your effects as well because

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.710 
accentuates your effects as well because
you<00:01:16.229> start<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> notice<00:01:16.710> things<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.720> some

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you start to notice things that are some

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270 
you start to notice things that are some
because<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.470> clean<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.920> flat<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
because it's so clean and so flat you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.469 
because it's so clean and so flat you
notice<00:01:20.610> things<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:21.030> effects<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> may

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
notice things about your effects you may

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.649 
notice things about your effects you may
have<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.689> noticed<00:01:21.900> before<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> let's<00:01:24.479> see

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
have not noticed before so let's see

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.400 
have not noticed before so let's see
what<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.900> bright<00:01:25.140> sounds<00:01:25.409> like

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
what this bright sounds like

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.720 
what this bright sounds like
[Music]

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
[Music]

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.920 
[Music]
so<00:01:32.730> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.910> hear<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> got<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> lot<00:01:33.660> brighter

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
so you can hear it got a lot brighter

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.060 
so you can hear it got a lot brighter
actually<00:01:34.410> that's<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> makes<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.040> very

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
actually that's it makes a very

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.050 
actually that's it makes a very
significant<00:01:35.790> difference

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.030 

but<00:01:41.840> let's<00:01:42.020> move<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.560> interesting

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
but let's move on to the interesting

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.289 
but let's move on to the interesting
side<00:01:43.159> of<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.399> amp<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:43.640> that's<00:01:43.820> channel<00:01:44.180> 2

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
side of the amp and that's channel 2

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.319 
side of the amp and that's channel 2
here<00:01:45.220> notice<00:01:46.220> each<00:01:46.430> channel<00:01:46.820> does<00:01:46.970> have<00:01:47.149> two

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
here notice each channel does have two

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.149 
here notice each channel does have two
inputs<00:01:47.689> high<00:01:47.960> impedance<00:01:48.229> low<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:48.799> impedance

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
inputs high impedance low and impedance

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.190 
inputs high impedance low and impedance
input<00:01:49.369> now<00:01:50.149> channel<00:01:50.509> 2<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:50.780> lot<00:01:51.020> different

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
input now channel 2 is a lot different

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.260 
input now channel 2 is a lot different
than<00:01:51.439> channel<00:01:51.829> 1<00:01:51.979> we<00:01:52.789> have<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:52.970> lot<00:01:53.240> more

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
than channel 1 we have a lot more

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.850 
than channel 1 we have a lot more
options<00:01:53.630> over<00:01:53.990> here<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.259> let's<00:01:54.439> take<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.649> look

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
options over here so let's take a look

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.039 
options over here so let's take a look
we<00:01:55.009> have<00:01:55.039> our<00:01:55.189> volume<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:56.299> still<00:01:56.600> have<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.840> 3

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
we have our volume we still have the 3

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.080 
we have our volume we still have the 3
band<00:01:57.259> parametric<00:01:57.860> EQ<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.850> we<00:01:58.970> have<00:01:59.060> a

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
band parametric EQ and we have a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.690 
band parametric EQ and we have a
distortion<00:01:59.780> which<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.920> have<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.310> admit<00:02:01.490> I'm<00:02:01.610> not

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
distortion which I have to admit I'm not

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.840 
distortion which I have to admit I'm not
the<00:02:01.759> biggest<00:02:02.060> fan<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.270> but<00:02:03.229> uh<00:02:03.259> well<00:02:04.250> heck<00:02:04.579> I'll

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
the biggest fan of but uh well heck I'll

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.130 
the biggest fan of but uh well heck I'll
let<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.210> decide<00:02:05.479> let's<00:02:05.750> take<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:05.960> little

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
let you decide let's take a little

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.710 
let you decide let's take a little
listen<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:11.090> don't<00:02:11.420> think<00:02:11.599> it's

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
listen to it I just don't think it's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
listen to it I just don't think it's
very<00:02:11.900> convincing

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
very convincing

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.059 
very convincing

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.380 
[Music]
to<00:02:18.069> me<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.340> kind<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:18.670> sounds<00:02:18.879> like<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.030> practice

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
to me it kind of sounds like a practice

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.630 
to me it kind of sounds like a practice
amp<00:02:19.599> or<00:02:19.690> something<00:02:19.930> like<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.250> not<00:02:21.519> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
amp or something like that so not the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.890 
amp or something like that so not the
biggest<00:02:21.879> fan<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.209> distortion<00:02:22.450> but<00:02:22.780> then

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
biggest fan of the distortion but then

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.809 
biggest fan of the distortion but then
again<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.680> amp<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.069> designed<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.580> clean

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
again this amp was designed for a clean

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.600 
again this amp was designed for a clean
tone<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.739> distortion<00:02:26.739> wasn't<00:02:27.040> exactly<00:02:27.310> what

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
tone so distortion wasn't exactly what

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.220 
tone so distortion wasn't exactly what
they<00:02:27.700> were<00:02:27.790> going<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.810> something<00:02:29.170> else

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
they were going for now something else

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.080 
they were going for now something else
that<00:02:29.470> channel<00:02:29.739> two<00:02:29.830> has<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.190> reverb<00:02:30.550> let's

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that channel two has is reverb let's

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:43.680 
that channel two has is reverb let's
take<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.269> listen<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.420> pretty<00:02:43.599> I

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
take a listen to that so it's a pretty I

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.210 
take a listen to that so it's a pretty I
like<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.410> sound<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.830> river<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:45.099> it's

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
like the the sound of the river if it's

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.520 
like the the sound of the river if it's
a<00:02:45.280> very<00:02:45.430> in-depth<00:02:46.390> sounding<00:02:47.019> reverb

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
a very in-depth sounding reverb

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:57.420 
a very in-depth sounding reverb
I<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.019> reverb<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> good<00:02:56.650> tone<00:02:56.829> now

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
I like that reverb it's a good tone now

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.160 
I like that reverb it's a good tone now
if<00:02:57.519> we<00:02:57.640> move<00:02:57.790> further<00:02:58.150> on<00:02:58.480> over<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.019> right

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
if we move further on over to the right

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.920 
if we move further on over to the right
you<00:02:59.860> see<00:02:59.890> we<00:03:00.160> have<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.610> three<00:03:01.239> knobs<00:03:01.420> here<00:03:01.569> speed

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
you see we have a three knobs here speed

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.259 
you see we have a three knobs here speed
depth<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:03.250> over<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:03.790> we<00:03:04.030> have<00:03:04.150> a

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
depth and then over here we have a

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.300 
depth and then over here we have a
little<00:03:04.510> selector<00:03:04.930> knob<00:03:05.079> which<00:03:05.829> we<00:03:05.980> can<00:03:06.130> choose

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
little selector knob which we can choose

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.300 
little selector knob which we can choose
from<00:03:06.459> chorus<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.620> one<00:03:08.829> of<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
from chorus this is one of the the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.740 
from chorus this is one of the the
reasons<00:03:09.730> why<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:09.970> amp<00:03:10.180> became<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.569> popular

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
reasons why this amp became so popular

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
reasons why this amp became so popular
is<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.260> chorus<00:03:11.560> sound

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.900 

I<00:03:20.860> have<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.010> admit<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.340> think<00:03:22.550> it's<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.730> little

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
I have to admit I think it's a little

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.420 
I have to admit I think it's a little
cheesy<00:03:23.090> personally<00:03:23.570> but<00:03:24.050> uh<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.710> know<00:03:24.800> you

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
cheesy personally but uh you know you

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.970 
cheesy personally but uh you know you
have<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> lot<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.290> options<00:03:27.290> as<00:03:27.650> far<00:03:27.680> as<00:03:27.890> how

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
have a lot of options as far as how

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.200 
have a lot of options as far as how
in-depth<00:03:28.460> you<00:03:28.580> want<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.820> make<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.060> if<00:03:29.180> you

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
in-depth you want to make it if you

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.120 
in-depth you want to make it if you
crank<00:03:29.780> these<00:03:30.050> these<00:03:30.440> settings<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.980> gets

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
crank these these settings it gets

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:44.380 
crank these these settings it gets
really<00:03:31.340> wacky<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:43.790> actually<00:03:44.060> sounds<00:03:44.270> a<00:03:44.300> little

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
really wacky it actually sounds a little

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.370 
really wacky it actually sounds a little
bit<00:03:44.570> better<00:03:44.720> than<00:03:44.930> what<00:03:45.020> we<00:03:45.110> had<00:03:45.230> gone<00:03:45.410> before

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
bit better than what we had gone before

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.200 
bit better than what we had gone before
but<00:03:48.380> again<00:03:48.470> kind<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.100> cheesy<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.610> result

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
but again kind of a cheesy and result

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.960 
but again kind of a cheesy and result
now<00:03:50.600> if<00:03:50.690> we<00:03:50.810> move<00:03:51.020> over<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.500> vibrato

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
now if we move over to the vibrato

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.270 
now if we move over to the vibrato
section<00:03:53.290> like<00:03:54.290> Robyn<00:03:54.650> pointed<00:03:54.920> out<00:03:55.040> we<00:03:55.130> got

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
section like Robyn pointed out we got

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.350 
section like Robyn pointed out we got
the<00:03:55.490> instant<00:03:56.120> Africa<00:03:56.600> tone<00:03:56.780> here<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:02.150> course

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
the instant Africa tone here of course

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
the instant Africa tone here of course
they<00:04:02.480> would<00:04:02.630> be<00:04:02.660> playing<00:04:02.960> more<00:04:03.110> something

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
they would be playing more something

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.920 
they would be playing more something
more<00:04:03.650> like<00:04:03.800> this<00:04:07.270> you<00:04:08.270> can<00:04:08.420> hear<00:04:08.570> it's<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.720> very

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
more like this you can hear it's a very

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.680 
more like this you can hear it's a very
kind<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.260> funky<00:04:09.560> tone<00:04:09.890> now<00:04:10.540> again<00:04:11.540> this

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
kind of funky tone now again this

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.480 
kind of funky tone now again this
channel<00:04:12.110> also<00:04:12.380> has<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.590> bright<00:04:12.890> switch<00:04:13.160> as<00:04:13.430> well

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
channel also has a bright switch as well

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.140 
channel also has a bright switch as well
and<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:15.470> other<00:04:15.830> great<00:04:16.430> great<00:04:16.730> feature<00:04:16.940> about

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
and the other great great feature about

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.210 
and the other great great feature about
this<00:04:17.299> channel<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.020> has<00:04:18.200> an<00:04:18.830> effects<00:04:19.130> loop

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
this channel is it has an effects loop

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.910 
this channel is it has an effects loop
and<00:04:19.520> more<00:04:19.910> particularly<00:04:20.420> a<00:04:20.690> stereo<00:04:21.440> return

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
and more particularly a stereo return

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.040 
and more particularly a stereo return
which<00:04:22.760> is<00:04:22.790> really<00:04:23.390> cool<00:04:23.570> if<00:04:23.720> you're<00:04:23.870> using

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
which is really cool if you're using

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.620 
which is really cool if you're using
stereo<00:04:24.530> effects<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.730> could<00:04:25.970> run<00:04:26.450> your

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
stereo effects so you could run your

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.510 
stereo effects so you could run your
effects<00:04:26.870> loop<00:04:27.050> like<00:04:27.230> a<00:04:27.260> normal<00:04:27.620> amp<00:04:27.800> but<00:04:28.340> then

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
effects loop like a normal amp but then

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.610 
effects loop like a normal amp but then
take<00:04:28.970> your<00:04:29.180> stereo<00:04:29.510> out<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:29.900> your<00:04:30.020> effects<00:04:30.320> and

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
take your stereo out of your effects and

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.440

around on a gig me personally I like
smaller<00:04:51.980> amps<00:04:52.250> but<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:53.030> tone<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:53.420> get<00:04:53.570> with

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
smaller amps but the tone you get with
