and dave was wondering because the there
is<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.250> upgrade<00:00:41.690> kit<00:00:42.690> which<00:00:43.050> gives<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
is an upgrade kit which gives you a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.049 
is an upgrade kit which gives you a
mounting<00:00:44.850> bracket<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.300> extended<00:00:46.289> legs<00:00:47.059> but

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
mounting bracket and extended legs but

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.549 
mounting bracket and extended legs but
that's<00:00:48.239> apparent<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.780> backorder<00:00:49.079> everywhere

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that's apparent on backorder everywhere

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.110 
that's apparent on backorder everywhere
so<00:00:49.920> he's<00:00:50.129> kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.430> asked<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> there<00:00:50.969> any

so he's kind of asked is there any
reason<00:00:51.570> why<00:00:52.079> can't<00:00:52.710> take<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> dremel<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
reason why can't take a dremel to it and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.910 
reason why can't take a dremel to it and
I<00:00:54.090> can't<00:00:54.600> think<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.379> anyone<00:00:55.680> doesn't

there but for Dave you want to know some

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.600 
there but for Dave you want to know some
measurements<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.820> using<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.540> rather

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
measurements so using this rather

measurements so using this rather
industrial<00:01:17.750> measuring<00:01:18.750> device<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
industrial measuring device because I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
industrial measuring device because I
have<00:01:19.890> no<00:01:20.220> idea<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:20.759> my<00:01:20.880> finer<00:01:21.180> measuring

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
have no idea when my finer measuring

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.200 
have no idea when my finer measuring
equipments<00:01:22.049> gone<00:01:22.549> might<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.670> even<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:24.060> any

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
equipments gone might not even have any

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.260 
equipments gone might not even have any
to<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.390> honest<00:01:24.600> let's<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.590> measure<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
to be honest let's just measure the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
to be honest let's just measure the
maximum<00:01:27.270> width<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.170> opening<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
maximum width of this opening for you so

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
maximum width of this opening for you so
the<00:01:29.430> maximum<00:01:29.909> width<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:33.530> 10<00:01:34.530> 22<00:01:35.280> mil<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the maximum width is 10 22 mil so it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.020 
the maximum width is 10 22 mil so it's
22<00:01:37.140> millimeters<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:39.720> extends<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.729> other

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
22 millimeters and it extends the other

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:52.039 
22 millimeters and it extends the other
way<00:01:43.490> by<00:01:46.729> I'm<00:01:47.729> gonna<00:01:48.060> lean<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:51.049> so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
way by I'm gonna lean in do this here so

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.380 
way by I'm gonna lean in do this here so
X<00:01:54.229> 1025<00:01:56.210> yep

25<00:01:57.869> at<00:01:58.110> its<00:01:58.259> widest<00:01:58.619> point<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
25 at its widest point you can see the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.209 
25 at its widest point you can see the
shape<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.939> crammed<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.649> if<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.770> tilt<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
shape it's crammed over if I tilt this

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.859 
shape it's crammed over if I tilt this
way<00:02:03.049> there<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> profile

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
way there we go you can see the profile

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.229 
way there we go you can see the profile
the<00:02:06.869> shape<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:09.319> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
the shape there and the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.179 
the shape there and the
top<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.329> gimbal<00:02:13.750> though<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.909> it's<00:02:15.909> just<00:02:16.209> a

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
top of the gimbal though is it's just a

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:25.740 
top of the gimbal though is it's just a
cylinder<00:02:20.400> when<00:02:21.400> that's<00:02:21.610> mounted<00:02:22.000> up<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:25.420> that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
cylinder when that's mounted up see that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.080 
cylinder when that's mounted up see that
all<00:02:26.530> fit<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.040> there<00:02:27.629> on<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:29.319> bracket<00:02:30.069> and<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
all fit in there on the bracket and the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.309 
all fit in there on the bracket and the
bracket<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:36.599> that's<00:02:37.599> just<00:02:37.689> fitted<00:02:38.140> like

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
bracket is just that's just fitted like

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.000 
bracket is just that's just fitted like
when<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.340> go<00:02:39.519> right<00:02:39.760> around<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:41.590> they<00:02:41.739> did<00:02:41.859> like

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
when I go right around if they did like

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.470 
when I go right around if they did like
that<00:02:43.889> so<00:02:44.889> it<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.579> circular<00:02:45.819> hole<00:02:46.180> and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
that so it is just a circular hole and

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.910
