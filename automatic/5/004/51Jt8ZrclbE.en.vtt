00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.150 
going to be the side of an ATC card so
what<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.430> thought<00:02:23.730> I'd<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:25.230> draw<00:02:25.830> this

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
what I thought I'd do is just draw this

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.220 
what I thought I'd do is just draw this
out<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.940> can<00:02:27.150> kind<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.810> where<00:02:28.050> all

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
out so you can kind of see where all

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.410 
out so you can kind of see where all
your<00:02:28.410> ATC<00:02:29.040> cards<00:02:29.370> are<00:02:29.490> gonna<00:02:29.640> come<00:02:29.910> from<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
your ATC cards are gonna come from and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.490 
your ATC cards are gonna come from and
the<00:02:30.990> first<00:02:31.260> thing<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.710> would<00:02:31.770> do<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:33.150> after<00:02:34.140> I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the first thing I would do is after I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.760 
the first thing I would do is after I
get<00:02:34.590> my<00:02:34.890> score<00:02:35.340> lines<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:36.050> then<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.410> would<00:02:37.560> go

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
get my score lines on then I would go

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.440 
get my score lines on then I would go
ahead<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.100> cut<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.430> my<00:02:38.640> cutter<00:02:41.300> I'm<00:02:42.300> gonna

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
ahead and cut with my cutter I'm gonna

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:53.660 
ahead and cut with my cutter I'm gonna
use<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.750> pencil<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.230> draw<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.770> out<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:52.670> pinch

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
use a pencil to draw this out and pinch

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.230 
use a pencil to draw this out and pinch
mark<00:02:57.350> I'm<00:02:58.350> basically<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:59.010> tracing<00:02:59.760> over<00:02:59.880> my

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
mark I'm basically just tracing over my

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.560 
mark I'm basically just tracing over my
score<00:03:00.630> lines<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.730> it'll<00:03:03.120> show<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.570> more<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.110> hope

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.690 

and<00:03:10.460> this<00:03:11.460> is<00:03:11.640> in<00:03:11.820> preparation<00:03:12.240> for<00:03:13.700> Michelle

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
and this is in preparation for Michelle

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.980 
and this is in preparation for Michelle
had<00:03:15.060> asked<00:03:15.540> me<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:16.830> do<00:03:17.040> an<00:03:17.160> 80<00:03:17.460> seat<00:03:18.000> class<00:03:18.360> so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
had asked me to do an 80 seat class so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.450 
had asked me to do an 80 seat class so
I'm<00:03:19.650> thinking<00:03:20.040> about<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.630> it's<00:03:21.630> just<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.460> have

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
I'm thinking about it it's just I have

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.980 
I'm thinking about it it's just I have
to<00:03:23.490> try<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:26.150> edit<00:03:27.800> because<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.490> can<00:03:30.480> really<00:03:30.750> get

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
to try to edit because I can really get

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.370 
to try to edit because I can really get
carried<00:03:31.380> away<00:03:31.440> with<00:03:31.710> ATC<00:03:32.340> cards<00:03:33.020> so<00:03:34.020> I'm<00:03:34.140> gonna

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
carried away with ATC cards so I'm gonna

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.300 
carried away with ATC cards so I'm gonna
try<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.710> come<00:03:34.950> up<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.310> basic<00:03:36.800> class<00:03:37.800> there

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
try to come up with a basic class there

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.160 
try to come up with a basic class there
you<00:03:38.460> go<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:39.000> you're<00:03:39.210> cutting<00:03:39.450> lines<00:03:39.750> and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
you go that you're cutting lines and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.490 
you go that you're cutting lines and
then<00:03:40.350> if<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.650> remember<00:03:41.340> your<00:03:42.120> ATC<00:03:42.870> cards<00:03:43.260> are

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
then if you remember your ATC cards are

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.130 
then if you remember your ATC cards are
two<00:03:43.740> and<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.950> half<00:03:44.960> by<00:03:45.960> three<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.500> half<00:03:46.710> so

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
two and a half by three and a half so

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.020 
two and a half by three and a half so
what<00:03:49.140> you're<00:03:49.290> gonna<00:03:49.440> do<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:50.190> you're<00:03:50.850> going<00:03:50.970> to

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
what you're gonna do is you're going to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:03.819 
what you're gonna do is you're going to
come<00:03:51.330> down<00:03:54.140> in<00:03:55.140> your<00:03:55.620> seven<00:03:56.010> by<00:03:56.190> five<00:03:56.430> boxes

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.949 

you're<00:04:04.829> going<00:04:05.189> to<00:04:05.340> be<00:04:05.519> able<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.760> get<00:04:06.060> four<00:04:06.329> ATC

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
you're going to be able to get four ATC

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:14.059 
you're going to be able to get four ATC
cards<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:08.359> four<00:04:09.359> times<00:04:09.659> four<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.730> 16<00:04:11.760> yay<00:04:13.069> so

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
cards and four times four is 16 yay so

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.990 
cards and four times four is 16 yay so
now<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.760> get<00:04:14.939> 16<00:04:15.659> ATC<00:04:16.470> cards<00:04:16.949> from<00:04:17.759> one

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
now we can get 16 ATC cards from one

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.990 
now we can get 16 ATC cards from one
