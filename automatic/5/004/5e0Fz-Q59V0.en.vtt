00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
and i love that i think that's why they

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.100 
and i love that i think that's why they
chose<00:01:58.189> us<00:01:58.640> i<00:01:58.939> think<00:01:58.970> we<00:01:59.270> had<00:01:59.299> great<00:01:59.869> chemistry

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
chose us i think we had great chemistry

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.530 
chose us i think we had great chemistry
and<00:02:00.439> i<00:02:00.530> think<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.860> fact<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.219> we<00:02:02.119> all<00:02:02.149> are

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
and i think the fact that we all are

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.840 
and i think the fact that we all are
very<00:02:02.570> opinionated<00:02:03.259> we<00:02:04.189> have<00:02:04.340> very<00:02:04.520> strong

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
very opinionated we have very strong

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.030 
very opinionated we have very strong
opinions<00:02:04.909> on<00:02:05.390> things<00:02:05.600> but<00:02:05.930> we<00:02:06.560> respect<00:02:06.710> one

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
opinions on things but we respect one

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.169 
opinions on things but we respect one
another<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.520> i<00:02:07.549> think<00:02:07.790> that's<00:02:07.909> really

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
another and i think that's really

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.300 
another and i think that's really
important<00:02:08.509> as<00:02:08.600> well<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:09.380> we<00:02:09.679> agree<00:02:10.070> to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
important as well that we agree to

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.339 
important as well that we agree to
disagree<00:02:10.610> like<00:02:11.329> I<00:02:11.510> know<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:12.050> one's<00:02:12.260> gonna

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
disagree like I know this one's gonna

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.780 
disagree like I know this one's gonna
have<00:02:12.530> some<00:02:12.680> crazy<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.129> say<00:02:13.280> about<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.550> but

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
have some crazy to say about that but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.309 
have some crazy to say about that but
that's<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:14.060> what<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:14.270> think<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.870> it's

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
that's not what I think and it's

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.720 
that's not what I think and it's
interesting<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.890> makes<00:02:16.069> for<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.280> great<00:02:16.430> show

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
interesting it makes for a great show

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.290 
interesting it makes for a great show
that<00:02:16.879> we<00:02:16.970> don't

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
everybody and I think that's really

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.100 
everybody and I think that's really
important<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.780> when<00:02:44.960> you're<00:02:45.080> watching

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
important is that when you're watching

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.480 
important is that when you're watching
the<00:02:45.560> show<00:02:45.740> it's<00:02:45.920> like<00:02:46.040> your<00:02:46.190> group<00:02:46.340> of

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
the show it's like your group of

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.860 
the show it's like your group of
girlfriends<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:47.060> think<00:02:47.270> one<00:02:47.420> we<00:02:47.600> really

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
girlfriends I think one we really

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.560 
girlfriends I think one we really
reflect<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.350> diversity<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:49.150> America<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:50.480> a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
reflect the diversity of America it's a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.450 
reflect the diversity of America it's a
multicultural<00:02:51.050> panel<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:52.100> think<00:02:52.310> that's

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
multicultural panel and I think that's

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.240 
multicultural panel and I think that's
real<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.240> really<00:02:53.740> exactly<00:02:54.740> what<00:02:54.980> real

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
real and it really exactly what real

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.710 
real and it really exactly what real
friends<00:02:55.700> look<00:02:55.850> like<00:02:55.880> we're<00:02:56.240> not<00:02:56.330> all<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.570> same

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
friends look like we're not all the same

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.050 
friends look like we're not all the same
race<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.500> think<00:02:57.710> that<00:02:57.800> that's<00:02:57.830> great<00:02:58.280> along

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
race and I think that that's great along

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.460 
race and I think that that's great along
with<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.240> is<00:02:59.450> when<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.690> have<00:02:59.780> real<00:03:00.080> friends

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
with that is when you have real friends

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.170 
with that is when you have real friends
real<00:03:00.500> girlfriends<00:03:01.070> together<00:03:01.370> everyone<00:03:02.030> is

real girlfriends together everyone is
different<00:03:02.420> but<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.720> think<00:03:02.780> people<00:03:03.050> watching

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
different but I think people watching

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.930 
different but I think people watching
this<00:03:03.590> show<00:03:03.740> can<00:03:03.890> say<00:03:04.010> okay<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.340> relate<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.820> that
