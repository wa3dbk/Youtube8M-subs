00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello girls how are you I hope you are 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.960
 having an excellent day in the video of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.500
 today I am going to share my 5 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.440
 favorite bronzers this video was the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.990
 special something difficult to do because no 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.940
 I could decide for nothing more 5 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.510
 bronzers since as you will know 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.130
 the bronzers the lipsticks and that the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.320
 rumors are 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.420
 I believe that three of the products of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.340
 makeup that I like the most and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.590
 I have several so it has 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.840
 cost the work but I decided on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.480
 all for those that I use with more 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.670
 frequency and those that if not 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.190
 they were living in my collection of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.040
 makeup I would definitely buy them 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.770
 so I hope this video is for you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.840
 useful and if you want to know what are my 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.149
 favorite bronzers stay to see the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.850
 video I'll start with the bronzer 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.520
 What else do I use of all these 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
 I will present and from the mark to face 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.140
 they're called action colette soler this 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.350
 sprayer I love it because in addition to that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.460
 it smells delicious chocolate the tone that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 has it going 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 well my skin is not too orange or 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.159
 reddish so I 'll be super natural and I 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.830
 I use it more than to contour to 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.040
 Give a touch of warmth to my face and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.020
 that looks very natural and I use it more 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.360
 in the months when it does like 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.060
 colder and I'm not naturally so 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.790
 tanned on the days when 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.509
 my skin is paler as in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.470
 winter and in spring and good me 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.060
 fascinates and for the other months as 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.590
 ending summer spring and a 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 little bit of autumn that I am more 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.300
 tanned I use the others that I'm going 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.610
 to present next the following 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.250
 bronzer is of the brand 'q' atriz and is 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.289
 the luminar without bronzer I think it's from 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.780
 the few bronzers that I have with 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.229
 satin finish and the truth is that I 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.500
 fascinates very much I use it 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.240
 a lot in what would be summer because 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.759
 I like to have this finish as a 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.810
 balloon on the skin and it is also a product 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.259
 Well how could you say multipurpose and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.750
 what 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.230
 It serves as a sunscreen but at the same time 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.980
 give that touch as if you had exposed 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.200
 illuminator but the brillitos are not so 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.849
 big or so notorious or you do not have 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.519
 here as if you had frost 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.459
 come on then that's what I like him 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.530
 It gives a super healthy touch to the skin and 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.870
 besides, the tone he has is not 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.780
 too reddish what makes it look 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.819
 even more natural and many times I already 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.400
 I do not even have to use a blush 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.700
 I simply apply it as if it were 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.370
 highlighter bronzer and blush at the same time and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.069
 it looks beautiful so for the girls that 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.709
 love them be finished glow as more 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.470
 bright on the skin and that look 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.530
 pronounced at the same time this bronzer is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.420
 great and the next bronzer too 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.819
 It's one of my spoiled ones 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.030
 seen using it on many of my videos is 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.010
 the hoola bronzer of benefit and this has 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.139
 a color that I like to call him 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.760
 a coffee with milk is not too much 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.430
 yellowish but not too 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.340
 orange I like to use it 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.620
 to make contour to my face when 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.750
 my skin is not too pronounced 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.719
 so I recommend it a lot to the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.239
 girls who have fair skin half 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.340
 since it will serve them very well for 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.280
 profile the face and make it look super 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.439
 natural in the dust has a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.900
 very finely creamy consistency and 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.450
 easy to blur so that's why 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.400
 is that it is one of my favorites and the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.829
 true that is one of the products or of 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.900
 the suntan lotion that ends 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.879
 I would probably buy it again 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.209
 another bronzer that I too 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:55.319
 love to outline my face is this 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.840
 of mac is called harmony and in fact I think 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.700
 that is not a bronzer is a blush but 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.189
 I use it as a product for 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.200
 outline since the color you have is 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.620
 like a coffee with a sub tone 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.349
 slightly cold which makes perfect 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.290
 to outline and shape my 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.419
 face especially when I'm over 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.340
 tanned in the months when my skin 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.440
 has an even darker tone than 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.680
 it's now when I use it I love it 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.370
 gives a shape a very parent contour to 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.470
 very natural face if it looks marked but 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.270
 it does not stop looking natural and that's what I 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.400
 love this bronzer and good blush 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.560
 besides that it also has a formula 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.230
 which is very easy to work on the skin 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.420
 and it lasts for many hours put so 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.600
 I recommend them a lot especially for 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.330
 the girls who have medium skins 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.940
 clear to a little bit more tan 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.130
 to go super super well another suntan lotion 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.530
 I also wanted to recommend them and 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.540
 especially thinking about those girls 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.450
 who follow me and who are skin is 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.750
 even darker but that nevertheless 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.750
 he wants to outline his face is this one 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.980
 get off mom is bronzer is from the 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.530
 bound mark and has a tone like me 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.470
 I would say it's almost a coffee I see it 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.500
 practically coffee but it's not for nothing 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.530
 reddish is a colder tone and it looks 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.490
 precious in the skins that are more 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.470
 brunettes 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.500
 I would not recommend it so much for 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.890
 and the whole face but at certain points 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.640
 like under the cheekbone here around 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.620
 forehead 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.020
 if you want to also outline your nose 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.970
 It's perfect as I told you for the 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.970
 girls with a much more skin tone 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.460
 tanned or darker naturally it 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.100
 you will see them well very nice besides 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.620
 which is an economic product lasts 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.380
 a lot of time and pigment super so 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.030
 that yes be careful when applying it have 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.100
 a light hand because if you are not going to 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.260
 remain as well marked 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.150
 then all very little product and 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.000
 blur it well and they will see that the 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.340
 result is beautiful and good girls 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.440
