00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.190
 I greet my dear friends and immediately 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.170
 I can congratulate you more precisely those 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.859
 people who were waiting for us to update there 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.410
 Pentland 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.740
 finally a miracle happened patch under 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.529
 number 15 4 was released today 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.250
 September 18, I was able to update and now 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.650
 I taste what 's changed by 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.539
 In fact, the changes did not happen very much 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 a lot of things have been added to begin with 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.670
 hefty dinosaur brt zaur hope 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.369
 correctly said he moves very 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.770
 popova us but I sometimes pass the village 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.960
 through the small hills of earth that is he 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.809
 very raw at the moment but his 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.989
 taught the ability to stomp and throw away you 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.210
 so be careful also 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 added the ability to kill gallimim and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 stigimoloch with one arrow released from 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.050
 luka really seems to me not to eat 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.070
 well then how much easier now 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 kill and it becomes more casual 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.660
 Well, a couple of little things in this patch type 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.879
 small meat add less satiety 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.880
 the experience we get from hunting for various 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.260
 game and food depending on type 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 creatures will be issued defined 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 amount of experience the following about 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.630
 experience usually accumulate in itself at 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.610
 as you go through the caves hunt for so 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.549
 further and this thing now 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.979
 canceled in general update there are those 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.900
 seems to have been revived but now i'm 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.479
 I will express my opinion so 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.240
 hold on we all know that neither is developed 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.430
 the damn thing didn't do well or did the truth about 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.619
 this we can not know anything at all 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.630
 I recently read an article in which 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.000
 it is said that steam removed the opportunity 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 Shopping stampin hood right there 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.100
 developers have smelled something wrong that freebies 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.259
 will not flow to the loot becomes and they 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.930
 dramatically released an update that in 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.790
 principle, little has changed but of course 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.899
 healthy dinosaur is cool but it 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.820
 most likely sbu 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.640
 it was the development that they did 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.149
 already quite a long time and showed in 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.820
 trailer 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.770
 in general, we hope and believe that our 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.780
 friends who created this creature will 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.820
 continue to delight us with updates 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.810
 but I still will not rejoice 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.720
 ahead of time 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.610
 I'll wait for the next panchami everyone thanks
