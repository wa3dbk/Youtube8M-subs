it<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:33.630> funny<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:33.989> possible<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.530> they<00:00:34.620> wouldn't

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
it as funny as possible so they wouldn't

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.150 
it as funny as possible so they wouldn't
take<00:00:34.920> themselves<00:00:35.130> too<00:00:35.340> seriously<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:37.160> think

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
take themselves too seriously I think

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.750 
take themselves too seriously I think
the<00:00:38.309> worst<00:00:39.440> situation<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.670> get

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the worst situation was you get you get

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.040 
the worst situation was you get you get
a<00:00:41.820> mom<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.559> you'd<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.649> doing<00:00:43.770> their<00:00:43.980> kid<00:00:44.219> a

a mom and you'd be doing their kid a

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.139 
a mom and you'd be doing their kid a
really<00:00:46.050> big<00:00:46.200> nose<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.710> I'd<00:00:47.550> say<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.789> doesn't
