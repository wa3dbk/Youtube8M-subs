00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.180
 why I say it in this tone of voice 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.340
 so sure masculine decided well why 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 there is something to say about this game 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.150
 talk there is to discuss with you is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.699

 sure that it will also affect you if not 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.660

 next gen in quotation marks as we say it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.680
 development of microsoft and sony consoles 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.840
 ie ps 4x juan cole big problem that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.239
 most of the titles they have 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.789
 debuted on these new genes 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.469
 generations started on the same dates 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.270
 of publication also on the old ones 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.820
 the doubt arose at all of us 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.140
 but how did they finish the consoles from 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.140
 just three months and these already have 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 finished three versions for the pc game 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 current gen oakland john if you prefer e 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.670
 next gen console 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 there is an inexorable substance stuff of the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.659
 moral of the story all the games of 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.210
 shit we caught them last year 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.860
 but that is not an insult well I know 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 very well that you have played the various 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 infamous dark souls and so on 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.930
 saved too many games but I want 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.729
 say feel like 3 but my voice 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.009
 this year we lost ourselves in nothing 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.540
 cosmic because a lot of came out 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.670
 half in half tolÃ¨ for graphics 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.470
 that you do n't do me halfway through the content 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.299
 pull out if shortened and wall pad 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.430
 stop because poor people will be there in 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.130
 graves that all of me will be sending 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.590
 possible accidents but in fact and that 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.299
 that happened this year without going 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.610
 really too long for that 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.070
 could any of you have started 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.119
 to drain right in the meanders of the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.460
 brain 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.360
 I want to talk about why this year 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.520
 it will be a good year 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.740
 in theory 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.439
 to be a gamer, well 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.869
 done in the kids genes start quests 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.929
 year without apostrophe voluntarily 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.360
 just like that simply because 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.220
 various software houses houses publishers 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.170
 above them have consequently had 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.560
 more time to think about games 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.170
 attention did not say do I said 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.239
 already think about all the games that will come out 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.120
 this year they gave me the idea of 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.319
 be the fruit of an idea a little more 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.299
 complex and then maybe I could 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.739
 make mistakes and the cadets will come back to me 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.569
 all back from you that 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.510
 you had a good start this year thanks 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.000
 to the iphone video and then you are 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.390
 deeply disappointed and scratched wounds 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.099
 in the soul well because I am so convinced 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.720
 precisely for this question of time is 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.660
 for this reason we find ourselves in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.329
 talk about goal handsome busted king of gods 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.970
 award- winning gamescom prizes 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.590
 best of games with award winner 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.720
 best game on microsoft console 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.610
 winner of the best game award 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.769
 action winner of the best prize 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.160
 PC game winner of the prize 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:07.040
 best online multiplayer game 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.569
 obviously we know that all these 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.910
 reviews these awards 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.639
 let's say at least guys I don't know if 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.470
 come out of a jury of corrupt of 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.239
 junkies 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.920
 a polling jury but I think it is 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.459
 this is the case of a real one 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.920
 jury 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.660
 nardo purposes from that of mixed persons 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.440
 in the environment between journalists and 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.500
 developers that I have different if you want the 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.930
 word in English that actually have a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.730
 little participated in the gamescom deserves them 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.950
 these awards but I am not the one to establish it 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.680
 because I haven't tried enough games 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.470
 to tell you with certainty if these brief 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.269
 they are deserved but at least I want to say 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.910
 these awards have popped up and then 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.750
 this is why today I am talking about this 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.510
 title this title which is a 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.950
 the asymmetric multiplayer game 4 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.220
 against 1 fps where you can make oils anders 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.860
 the hunters or the monster are there 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.050
 first of all four classes of hunters 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.270
 which is the assault the trap for the doctor 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.970
 and the support of each of course 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.440
 these classes split into two on the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.240
 classic are simply two 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.920
 characters with the same function 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.330
 the assault as in all video games 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.180
 what will have to rest a little more 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.810
 I'll give you the example aid between the two 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.090
 assault is equipped with a weapon that is 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.880
 called flamethrower and the secondary 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.770
 minigun and the grenade is called a grenade 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.500
 toxic therefore we basically have 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.430
 really the tamarri has made from game and 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.770
 as well as the taste for the assault 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.710
 all other classes actually have two 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.410
 on classes so we will have two jump 23 for 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.210
 two doctors two supports then makes eight 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.790
 characters in everything they do 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.610
 definitely basic a good one 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.530
 there are customization possibilities 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.440
 even the monsters have been for now 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.220
 presented two these two monsters are the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.370
 kraken most tamarro name did not exist e 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.229
 the golia taxi existed a more tamarro in 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.750
 effects these are the monsters presented 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.610
 for now it is the purpose of the monster e 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.790
 evolve during the match for 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.280
 become substantially invincible in 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.290
 practice each of the two eats a 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.720
 something particular evolves 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.400
 during the game and it becomes more and more 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.290
 difficult for hunters to kill 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.090
 obviously hunters what they have from 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.010
 them since they do not evolve 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.930
 well the under them have that 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.180
 they can team up together because 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.250
 they are four against one and it is not little 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.930
 obviously the problems of this game 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.940
 they will mainly be balancing 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.790
 but being born as an asymmetrical me 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.100
 I think those who are able to balance 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.780
 it is the scale at least not have it 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.910
 bought there that they love took one 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.260
 penal of people who are capable 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:52.110
 in short, I simply trust this 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.880
 aspect of the game was born this way and I think 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.600
 that somehow they will succeed in 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.830
 balance it 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.020
 obviously the sound parts where you are 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.410
 will easily win or lose but this 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.260
 It happens 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.330
 the plastic bottle has moved 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.310
 you know the plastic fa claque i have 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.140
 shit on me anyway I think that 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.910
 they will be able to balance the graphics 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.430
 as you have seen in this video it has not 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.980
 truly nothing to envy of others 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.960
 games you've seen here at gamescom and 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.690
 not just at least a graphic that there is 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.300
 presented and I would say that the idea also 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.370
 innovative what is the key to this 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.200
 game will be fun only for those like 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.180
 me ago the youtube was therefore will make videos 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.120
 in 4 against 1 where he will kill himself 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.980
 to laughs or it will be fun even for 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.640
 the public I suppose there will be the voip 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.530
 and therefore the expectations for this game 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.480
 may be positive for the moment 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.190
 obviously to avoid the packages were 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.020
 past and I think publishers 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.880
 this year we have taken into account that there 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.440
 will be half of the pre-orders because the 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.750
 last year people really thrown away 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.970
 away the money for some games and therefore 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.700
 my dispassionate advice as at al 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.130
 usually and I'm sorry if anyone up there 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.590
 in the Olympics of video games it is offended 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.750
 but do not pre-order the games 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.000
 watch 12 videos resist it one day 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.490
 buy and download it at night 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.330
 obviously regularly from the various shops 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.160
 online 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.310
 Now go buy where the hell 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.750
 you want this is my advice for 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.390
 now I close the video by just saying that 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.030
 a lot of expectation about this game 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.560
 and that I am almost certain that it will take us 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.470
 a lot of videos will be enough to find others 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.210
 four crazy friends like me and I think that 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.520
 I'll be able to make you do just a few 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.040
 laughter let me know below what it is 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.710
 think of the comments if the video is there 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.660
 liked leave a like and I repeat 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:37.310
 as usual with my comment and 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.310
 vote if you want to sign up
