00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 yourself today online store foot years in 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.640
 This video review will introduce you to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.130
 amino acids from the company site aig 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.809
 nutrition company website aig nutrition 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.540
 principle already widely known in the market 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.980
 sports nutrition is famous for the fact that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.360
 makes and quality nasty 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.260
 supplements at affordable prices 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.990
 so look beautiful bright so here 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.880
 big can big pack 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.340
 There are 1000 amino acids inside 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.619
 capsules 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.900
 I want to say that it is in principle very 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 enough for amino acids 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.579
 of course on the market and the bigger ones 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.020
 suckers here it is above average what 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.969
 waiting for us inside we'll try now with 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 you understand means like I said 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.670
 1000 capsules with the size of one serving 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 makes 2 capsules 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.090
 there is such a magic number 500 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 portions should be enough for enough 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.320
 a long time basically i think and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
 what awaits us for serving we now you 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.460
 voiced in the composition is presented in English 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.020
 language on the packaging in Russian will be able to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.239
 always finally he us on site 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.080
 I will voice you the main components 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.760
 mean here wide on acid 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.250
 the composition I will not fully list 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.260
 its basic amino acids only on wine 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 it means that it is very important for us 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.689
 Arginine means 33 milligrams per serving 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.460
 alanine 57 milligrams further 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.159
 glutamic acid 199 milligram 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.920
 you can download glutamine, in principle, well 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.810
 so maybe speak wrong but 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.119
 nevertheless it is principle on the internet 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.479
 equated to the bottom it means 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.829
 Isolation beyond 60 mg price 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.400
 155 milligrams tires one hundred eleven 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.020
 milligram 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.840
 and tryptophan is very important for us 25 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.470
 milligram and roller 65 milligram 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.630
 total and sound 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.150
 his facts and please be attentive and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.380
 amino acid fighter total 200 80 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.900
 milligrams per serving and the rest 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.410
 amino acids 545 milligrams well, that is 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.110
 together we get rounded off about 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.390
 under the blowing 900 by 1000 milligrams per one 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.360
 portion it is in principle not 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.400
 we can say that it is not a magic number 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.320
 There are indicators of others about the viewer 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.060
 much more but it's such a good one 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.000
 average principle among the world 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.060
 Amino Acids Means at Affordable Price 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.140
 by the way here is an inexpensive trick 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.790
 if you divide the cost of packing by 500 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.510
 also if a recommendation on 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.310
 application 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.110
 Means pro viewer says that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.620
 it is necessary to take days from 1 to 3 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.420
 portions 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.260
 so my recommendations will be a little bit 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.180
 be different i would recommend taking 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.890
 2-6 servings if you're drying this principle 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.380
 can take 6 servings a day 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.910
 believe me there will be no harm from it 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.010
 save save and dry 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.800
 muscle mass do not give your muscles 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.600
 collapse means the same people who 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.100
 just wanted to try amino acids 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.239
 and start with two servings well let's say 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.820
 you can immediately after sleep the second portion 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:06.360
 here it is recommended right after 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.980
 workouts can be taken 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.870
 principle the second portion is not immediately after 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.790
 workout and he can say for 10 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.580
 minutes to finish everything here 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.480
 individually look at yourself 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.959
 means the composition of these amino acids 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.130
 contained 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.290
 milk protein, or that you are a regular 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.350
 protein will be happy filtered form for 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.200
 account for which the selected amino acids 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.310
 at 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.170
 the so -called 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.450
 like amino acids which are better 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.060
 disobey that is so written off there 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.910
 development of cytic amino acid company 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.280
 with better learning which will 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.100
 your body is called more 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.460
 it is instantly written that 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.440
 let's say 35 percent better 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.300
 digest than usually I do not know how it is 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.790
 actually research we don't 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.850
 conducted at the door with a specialist in this 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.260
 question means these amino acids 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.000
 you can always purchase at 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.650
 online store longstanding affordable 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.790
 prices come to us the buyer does not 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.070
 leave your reviews 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.070
 share your recommendations thanks
