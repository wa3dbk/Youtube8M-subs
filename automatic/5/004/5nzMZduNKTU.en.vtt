00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
thought I mean they're not to be extreme

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.870 
thought I mean they're not to be extreme
but<00:00:47.600> they're<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.560> know<00:00:48.710> definitely<00:00:49.040> there<00:00:49.610> um

but they're you know definitely there um

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.470 
but they're you know definitely there um
so<00:00:50.630> I<00:00:50.690> thought<00:00:50.810> I'd<00:00:50.960> give<00:00:51.110> it<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.260> try<00:00:51.470> and<00:00:52.480> it

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
so I thought I'd give it a try and it
says<00:00:53.840> to<00:00:54.350> use<00:00:54.560> you<00:00:55.010> apply<00:00:55.550> delicately<00:00:56.150> um<00:00:56.500> that

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
says to use you apply delicately um that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.400

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
I thought I'd just do a quick little

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.540 
I thought I'd just do a quick little
overview<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.680> blip<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.220> because<00:02:34.430> I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
overview and a blip on it because I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.310 
overview and a blip on it because I
hadn't<00:02:34.850> heard<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.180> before<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:35.960> again<00:02:36.140> it's

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
hadn't heard of it before so again it's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.460 
hadn't heard of it before so again it's
