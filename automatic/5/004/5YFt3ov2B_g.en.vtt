00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
and pulling through both of those flips

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.780 
and pulling through both of those flips
it<00:03:40.280> has<00:03:40.459> created<00:03:40.700> another<00:03:41.030> single<00:03:41.660> crochet

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790

two stitches we have completed our next
single<00:04:06.410> crochet<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.980> we<00:04:07.130> want<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.580> do<00:04:07.790> this

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
single crochet and we want to do this

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:19.940 
single crochet and we want to do this
all<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.510> way<00:04:08.830> across

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.530 

this<00:04:20.950> project<00:04:21.459> is<00:04:21.580> perfect<00:04:22.060> for<00:04:22.210> beginners

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
this project is perfect for beginners

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.410 
this project is perfect for beginners
because<00:04:23.470> we<00:04:23.980> only<00:04:24.250> use<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.790> single<00:04:25.180> crochet

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
because we only use the single crochet

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:32.750 
because we only use the single crochet
as<00:04:25.810> our<00:04:26.410> stitch<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:28.500> also<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:30.370> chain<00:04:30.700> stitch

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
as our stitch and also the chain stitch

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.430 
as our stitch and also the chain stitch
and<00:04:33.760> these<00:04:34.120> are<00:04:34.300> normally<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.750> first<00:04:35.170> two

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
and these are normally the first two

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.680 
and these are normally the first two
stitches<00:04:35.740> that<00:04:36.550> we<00:04:36.760> get<00:04:36.940> taught<00:04:37.270> when<00:04:37.570> we

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
stitches that we get taught when we

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.930 
stitches that we get taught when we
learn<00:04:37.900> how<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.140> crochet<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.160> just<00:04:42.550> repeat

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
learn how to crochet so you just repeat

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.090 
learn how to crochet so you just repeat
this<00:04:43.180> all<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.690> way<00:04:43.720> across<00:04:43.930> until<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.860> come

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
this all the way across until you come

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.730 
this all the way across until you come
to<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.460> end<00:04:45.670> of<00:04:45.910> your<00:04:45.970> team<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:47.320> we<00:04:47.410> want<00:04:47.620> to

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
make sure we go into the last chain with

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:01.110 
make sure we go into the last chain with
a<00:04:52.330> single<00:04:52.840> crochet<00:04:56.790> and<00:04:58.800> now<00:04:59.800> we<00:05:00.550> now<00:05:00.730> have<00:05:00.760> our

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
a single crochet and now we now have our

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.730 
a single crochet and now we now have our
bracelet<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:01.840> it<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:02.050> going<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.350> start<00:05:02.620> to

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
bracelet and it is going to start to

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.620 
bracelet and it is going to start to
curl<00:05:03.100> just<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.580> little<00:05:03.820> bit<00:05:04.000> see<00:05:04.300> how<00:05:04.450> that's

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
curl just a little bit see how that's

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.080 
curl just a little bit see how that's
something<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:04.990> call<00:05:05.200> around<00:05:05.640> that<00:05:06.640> is<00:05:06.820> quite

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
something to call around that is quite

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.970 
something to call around that is quite
normal<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.050> doesn't<00:05:08.350> matter<00:05:08.500> because<00:05:08.770> it

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
normal and it doesn't matter because it

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.460 
normal and it doesn't matter because it
won't<00:05:09.190> curl<00:05:09.430> once<00:05:09.670> it's<00:05:09.850> on<00:05:10.000> our<00:05:10.120> wrists<00:05:10.470> now

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
to finish off we are just going to do a

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.220 
to finish off we are just going to do a
chain<00:05:15.220> so<00:05:15.520> we're<00:05:15.670> going<00:05:15.850> to<00:05:16.150> wrap<00:05:16.780> our<00:05:16.930> yarn

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230
