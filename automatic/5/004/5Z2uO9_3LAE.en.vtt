00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 greetings to all and well received today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.899
 we will have a mat with us from the trost 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.420
 Extra large format and a mouse really 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:22.410
 very special well what special 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:23.580
 we will see it after the initials for many of 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 you who follow us from home 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.810
 the trust mark is linked to a series 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 of low-priced products that yes 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.009
 now find in all stores and stores 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.450
 supermarkets in italy but this time 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 the company seems to have pressed 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.380
 on the accelerator to try to provide 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.989
 a series of products this time of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.600
 gaming quality so definitely a bit 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.100
 higher and we don't even have any 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.289
 reason to believe otherwise 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.000
 especially given that trust is a big one 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.629
 company that available large 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.199
 resources 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.300
 the trust gxt 166 occurs in one 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.460
 classic cardboard packaging from 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.809
 very accurate aesthetics 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 the most interesting aspects on which 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.210
 let's go further we are beyond 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.019
 obviously to the programmable keys 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.360
 laterally we have already anticipated 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.210
 first is that we're going to see better in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.240
 course of the video are the presence of a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.479
 laser type sensor and the presence of 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.439
 a weight regulation system from 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.009
 alive gxt 166 is a mouse of size 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.259
 rather contained by a lot of ergonomics 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.350
 palm this obviously to allow 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.939
 quick use of the side buttons 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.890
 made available the used material 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.409
 is the classic plastic with a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.850
 soft touch coating is on the side 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.220
 right than on the left side while there 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.430
 a normal painting almost 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.899
 metallic on the back of the mouse 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.790
 as we have said the keys put at 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.750
 available are 18 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.619
 many of them on the back side 2 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.719
 one mouse on the left side and three 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.030
 classic cable and very high quality 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:09.360
 with a corded finish it is a terminal 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.050
 gold plated is a core of wounds 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.739
 for the reduction of the disturbances and the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.900
 here we have the packaging with ours 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.190
 drum of countries that we will go to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.569
 resume more forward when 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.379
 we will explain the regulation system 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.379
 of weight 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.739
 then we move to the lower area 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.080
 del 166 where we find the pensar fair la 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.370
 whose configuration is rather standard 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.579
 it is rather good quality we find the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.510
 sensor slightly off axis on 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:48.299
 left is in position a little more 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.599
 advanced is the drum cover on 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.160
 which we will house the weights we have seen 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.810
 before 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.410
 so let's set aside a little 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.450
 packs and let's see more from 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.150
 near the regulation system of the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.129
 weight first we go to extract 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.230
 from our packaging the number of 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:11.489
 countries that we are interested in installing on 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.069
 our mouse nor we will pull 2 â€‹â€‹right 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.720
 for a demonstration to access the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.419
 compartment that houses the weight drum will be 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.440
 enough to apply a reinforcing law 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:29.730
 rotating to remove the cover 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:36.900
 in this way after that we take i 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:42.590
 weights and one at a time we insert them into the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:46.859
 slots available this way 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.989
 to reinsert the cover will be 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.799
 just apply a rotation in the 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:56.430
 the opposite direction came then the 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.269
 moment of the gxt 207 the formed mat 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.120
 Oversized 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.269
 more precisely of dimensions 395 per 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.239
 315 that trust advised us in 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.150
 pairing with his mmo mouse yes 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.590
 at first sight it would be a classic 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.359
 fabric mat but that really 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.669
 it hides a very solution 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.229
 Interesting 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.239
 going to see more closely in fact 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.829
 we find out that the edges have been 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.109
 reinforced to prevent it 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.550
 fraying that one of the first causes 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.120
 of the first tura 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.280
 playing a gaming mat beyond 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.280
 to this solution very much indeed 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.259
 interesting very appreciated 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.960
 there are two classic aspects 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.629
 important of a fabric mat 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.900
 or a high-friction surface 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:45.360
 which allows high precision is one 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.250
 non-slip base that allows you to hold 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.669
 the mat still firm on his 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.520
 desk and this is about i 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.650
 our two new trust products that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.960
 we hope they turn out to be so quality 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.370
 how interesting they were 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.680
 so don't forget to follow the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.810
 our review where obviously and how 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.360
 our habit we will descend even more 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.580
 in particular the detail in play and 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.560
 of the real behavior of this 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.870
 therefore, there is nothing left of it 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.030
 thank trust and send you back to 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.530
 next appointment where we will talk about 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.530
 integrated liquid kits
