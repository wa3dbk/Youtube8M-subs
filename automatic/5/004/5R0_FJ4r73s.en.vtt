a lot of you guys saw but this here

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.880 
a lot of you guys saw but this here
isn't<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.510> mock-up<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.410> an<00:00:25.529> actual

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
isn't a mock-up this is an actual

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.500 
isn't a mock-up this is an actual
straight<00:00:26.490> off<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> assembly<00:00:26.970> line

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
straight off the assembly line

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.019 
straight off the assembly line
iPhone<00:00:27.900> 6<00:00:28.230> part<00:00:28.560> from<00:00:28.890> Apple<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
iPhone 6 part from Apple and it's the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
iPhone 6 part from Apple and it's the
entire<00:00:30.320> 4.7<00:00:31.320> inch<00:00:31.439> front<00:00:31.769> panel<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.130> glass

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
entire 4.7 inch front panel of glass

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370 
entire 4.7 inch front panel of glass
including<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.030> sheet<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.510> sapphire<00:00:33.930> crystals

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
including a sheet of sapphire crystals

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.799 
including a sheet of sapphire crystals
so<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.579> important<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.690> its

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so this is important because of its

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
so this is important because of its
existence<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> basically<00:00:37.920> confirm<00:00:38.670> that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
existence we can basically confirm that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540 
existence we can basically confirm that
yeah<00:00:39.210> there<00:00:39.420> will<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:40.050> iPhone<00:00:40.440> 6<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
yeah there will be an iPhone 6 with a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.119 
yeah there will be an iPhone 6 with a
4.7<00:00:42.210> inch<00:00:42.360> display<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
4.7 inch display and we now know that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
4.7 inch display and we now know that
this<00:00:44.219> 4.7<00:00:44.850> inch<00:00:44.940> model<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.629> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this 4.7 inch model will have this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.750 
this 4.7 inch model will have this
sapphire<00:00:46.350> display<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.309> Gorilla<00:00:47.579> Glass

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
sapphire display not just Gorilla Glass

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
sapphire display not just Gorilla Glass
so<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.930> some<00:00:49.050> speculation<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> only

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so there was some speculation that only

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.209 
so there was some speculation that only
a<00:00:50.520> larger<00:00:51.149> 5.5<00:00:51.930> inch<00:00:52.170> iPhone<00:00:52.410> would<00:00:52.920> get<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
a larger 5.5 inch iPhone would get the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.950 
a larger 5.5 inch iPhone would get the
sapphire<00:00:53.610> display<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.930> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
sapphire display but now we know that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560 
sapphire display but now we know that
rumors<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.590> true<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.360> great

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
rumors not true so what is so great

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
rumors not true so what is so great
about<00:00:57.600> sapphire<00:00:58.440> crystal<00:00:58.859> well<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
about sapphire crystal well it has a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
about sapphire crystal well it has a
number<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.640> advantages<00:00:59.789> over<00:01:00.329> Gorilla<00:01:00.899> Glass

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
number of advantages over Gorilla Glass

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
number of advantages over Gorilla Glass
which<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.710> said<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> front<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
which like I said is on the front of the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090 
which like I said is on the front of the
iPhone<00:01:03.270> 5s<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.530> main<00:01:04.710> things<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
iPhone 5s but the two main things you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.770 
iPhone 5s but the two main things you
need<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.430> are<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.180> number<00:01:06.570> one

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
need to know are that number one

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.750 
need to know are that number one
sapphire<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.619> an<00:01:07.830> extremely<00:01:08.340> high<00:01:08.700> quality

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
sapphire is an extremely high quality

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.020 
sapphire is an extremely high quality
material<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.930> number<00:01:10.560> two<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.580> really

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
material and number two it is really

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
material and number two it is really
durable<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> say<00:01:13.049> high<00:01:13.260> quality<00:01:13.619> material

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
durable now I say high quality material

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
durable now I say high quality material
because<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.400> thing<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.780> paper-thin<00:01:15.780> like

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because this thing is paper-thin like

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.890 
because this thing is paper-thin like
literally<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.580> same<00:01:17.820> thickness<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> sheet

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
literally the same thickness as a sheet

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.990 
literally the same thickness as a sheet
of<00:01:18.990> paper<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.070> perfectly<00:01:20.549> see-through

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
of paper and it's perfectly see-through

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
of paper and it's perfectly see-through
I<00:01:21.150> would<00:01:21.299> say<00:01:21.530> 0%<00:01:22.530> opacity<00:01:22.590> Apple<00:01:23.340> already

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
I would say 0% opacity Apple already

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.999 
I would say 0% opacity Apple already
actually<00:01:23.909> uses<00:01:24.479> sapphire<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> iPhone<00:01:25.590> 5s

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
actually uses sapphire in the iPhone 5s

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.550 
actually uses sapphire in the iPhone 5s
on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.790> camera<00:01:27.299> lens<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> home<00:01:28.229> button

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
on the camera lens and the home button

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
on the camera lens and the home button
for<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.890> reason<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> camera<00:01:29.820> lens<00:01:29.970> needs

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
for this reason so the camera lens needs

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120 
for this reason so the camera lens needs
to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.509> super<00:01:30.990> high<00:01:31.110> quality<00:01:31.140> material<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
to be super high quality material and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
to be super high quality material and
very<00:01:32.189> durable<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.030> crystal<00:01:33.810> clear<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> take

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
very durable and crystal clear to take

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
very durable and crystal clear to take
those<00:01:34.530> great<00:01:34.770> shots<00:01:35.040> through<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
those great shots through it and the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640 
those great shots through it and the
home<00:01:36.150> button<00:01:36.180> also<00:01:36.689> needs<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.170> crystal

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
home button also needs to be crystal

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.450 
home button also needs to be crystal
clear<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.040> able<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> read<00:01:38.430> your

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
clear to be able to read your

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.069 
clear to be able to read your
fingerprint<00:01:38.970> through<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> glass<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.810> again

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
fingerprint through the glass so again

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.469 
fingerprint through the glass so again
it's<00:01:40.619> sapphire<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.030> would<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
it's sapphire so that would be the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's sapphire so that would be the
number<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.869> thing<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.110> noticed<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.590> messing

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
number one thing I noticed just messing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.410 
number one thing I noticed just messing
around<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.340> panel<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.880> holding<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
around with this panel and holding it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.600 
around with this panel and holding it
looking<00:01:46.350> through<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.680> putting<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> over<00:01:47.490> my

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
looking through it putting it over my

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.219 
looking through it putting it over my
eye<00:01:47.670> basically<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.509> notice<00:01:48.810> how<00:01:48.930> little

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
eye basically you notice how little

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
eye basically you notice how little
distortion<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.520> how<00:01:51.000> exact<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
distortion there is and how exact the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.600 
distortion there is and how exact the
cover<00:01:51.990> stay<00:01:52.380> there's<00:01:52.619> absolutely<00:01:53.070> no<00:01:53.310> color

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
cover stay there's absolutely no color

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
glass now another thing I noticed while

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.149 
glass now another thing I noticed while
cleaning<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> microfiber<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.409> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
cleaning it with a microfiber is this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.880 
cleaning it with a microfiber is this
particular<00:01:59.670> panel<00:01:59.909> seems<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.869> ok<00:02:01.590> with

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
gorilla glass panel but assuming this is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.470 
gorilla glass panel but assuming this is
sapphire<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.879> really<00:02:12.060> curious<00:02:12.239> about

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
sapphire I got really curious about

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.350 
sapphire I got really curious about
exactly

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
exactly

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.410 
exactly
how<00:02:13.810> durable<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.700> broke<00:02:16.060> out<00:02:16.270> a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
how durable this is so I broke out a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.870 
how durable this is so I broke out a
knife<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.350> broke<00:02:17.590> out<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.890> keys<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.730> did

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
knife and I broke out the keys and I did

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.220 
knife and I broke out the keys and I did
some<00:02:19.030> scratching<00:02:19.480> or<00:02:19.630> at<00:02:19.810> least<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.020> thought<00:02:20.170> I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
some scratching or at least I thought I

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.810 
some scratching or at least I thought I
was<00:02:20.410> doing<00:02:20.590> some<00:02:20.740> scratching<00:02:21.160> basically<00:02:21.790> I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
was doing some scratching basically I

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.700 
was doing some scratching basically I
took<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.150> knife<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.900> Sapphire<00:02:23.290> pretty

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
took the knife to the Sapphire pretty

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.100 
took the knife to the Sapphire pretty
hard<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.220> applied<00:02:24.520> some<00:02:24.550> deep<00:02:25.000> pressure<00:02:25.330> really

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
hard I applied some deep pressure really

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.310 
hard I applied some deep pressure really
pushed<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.590> down<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.400> got<00:02:27.550> nothing<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.630> then

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
pushed it down and I got nothing so then

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.140 
pushed it down and I got nothing so then
I<00:02:29.350> moved<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.430> did<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.610> with<00:02:30.700> my<00:02:30.850> keys

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
I moved on and I did it with my keys

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.060 
I moved on and I did it with my keys
again<00:02:31.990> this<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.380> way<00:02:32.590> beyond<00:02:32.830> what<00:02:32.860> you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
again this is way beyond what you

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.590 
again this is way beyond what you
normally<00:02:33.280> do<00:02:33.610> with<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.820> phone<00:02:34.000> but<00:02:34.240> I<00:02:34.270> press

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
normally do with the phone but I press

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.750 
normally do with the phone but I press
down<00:02:34.660> really<00:02:34.870> hard<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.130> way<00:02:36.280> past<00:02:36.460> any

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
down really hard this is way past any

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.740 
down really hard this is way past any
pressure<00:02:37.030> that's<00:02:37.240> going<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.630> your

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
pressure that's going to be in your

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.330 
pressure that's going to be in your
pocket<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.200> scraped<00:02:38.590> them<00:02:38.770> drag<00:02:39.070> them<00:02:39.280> across

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
pocket I scraped them drag them across

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.630 
pocket I scraped them drag them across
the<00:02:39.700> panel<00:02:39.940> apply<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> lot<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.290> pressure<00:02:41.640> still

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
the panel apply a lot of pressure still

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.440 
the panel apply a lot of pressure still
nothing

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
nothing

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.630 
nothing
and<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.900> went<00:02:44.020> on<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.470> basically<00:02:45.040> stab<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
and then I went on to basically stab the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.460 
and then I went on to basically stab the
thing<00:02:45.850> pretty<00:02:46.209> hard<00:02:46.300> right<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.230> middle

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
thing pretty hard right in the middle

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.190 
thing pretty hard right in the middle
and<00:02:47.740> drag<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.060> point<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> knife<00:02:49.959> around

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
and drag the point of the knife around

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.900 
and drag the point of the knife around
the<00:02:50.470> surface<00:02:50.860> with<00:02:51.070> some<00:02:51.310> serious<00:02:51.700> pressure

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
the surface with some serious pressure

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.670 
the surface with some serious pressure
again<00:02:52.480> well<00:02:52.780> beyond<00:02:53.140> stuff<00:02:53.380> you're<00:02:53.530> ever

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
again well beyond stuff you're ever

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.580 
again well beyond stuff you're ever
going<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:54.070> with<00:02:54.220> your<00:02:54.370> phone<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.840> got<00:02:56.200> no

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
going to do with your phone and I got no

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.199 
going to do with your phone and I got no
results<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.220> clearly<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.790> don't<00:02:58.000> need<00:02:58.180> a

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
results so clearly you don't need a

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.449 
results so clearly you don't need a
screen<00:02:58.510> protector<00:02:58.630> here<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.380> lastly<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.130> tried

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
screen protector here and lastly I tried

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.890 
screen protector here and lastly I tried
to<00:03:00.610> bend<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:01.000> first

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
to bend it first

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.900 
to bend it first
like<00:03:02.110> seriously<00:03:02.560> bend<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.100> at<00:03:03.430> first<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.760> was

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
like seriously bend it so at first I was

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.520 
like seriously bend it so at first I was
kind<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.209> tentative<00:03:04.510> because<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.260> thought

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
kind of tentative because I thought

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.199 
kind of tentative because I thought
maybe<00:03:05.770> there<00:03:06.010> was<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.310> chance<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.790> might<00:03:07.000> break

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
maybe there was a chance I might break

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.770 
maybe there was a chance I might break
it

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.080 
it
maybe<00:03:08.230> shatter<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.830> but<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.070> slowly<00:03:09.459> realized

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
maybe shatter it but I slowly realized

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.810 
maybe shatter it but I slowly realized
there<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:10.900> absolutely<00:03:11.650> no<00:03:11.890> way<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.370> can<00:03:12.640> break
