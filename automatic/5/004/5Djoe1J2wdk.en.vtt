the trample steam as close as you can to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.960 
the trample steam as close as you can to
how<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.649> now<00:01:05.009> once<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.399> have<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> set<00:01:05.940> up

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
how I do now once you have it set up

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.180 
how I do now once you have it set up
simply<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.960> run<00:01:07.200> back<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.649> steps<00:01:08.009> and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
simply just run back up the steps and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.800 
simply just run back up the steps and
then<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:08.670> slowly<00:01:09.060> walk<00:01:09.420> into<00:01:09.690> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
then from there slowly walk into the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.109 
then from there slowly walk into the
trample<00:01:10.200> steam<00:01:10.289> I<00:01:10.619> find<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.069> easiest<00:01:11.429> to<00:01:11.610> line

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
trample steam I find it easiest to line

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
trample steam I find it easiest to line
myself<00:01:12.300> up<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.960> line<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> doorway

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and then once it flings you you then

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.450 
and then once it flings you you then
want<00:01:15.569> to<00:01:15.690> hold<00:01:15.869> square<00:01:16.259> or<00:01:16.500> X<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.979> pick<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.340> up
