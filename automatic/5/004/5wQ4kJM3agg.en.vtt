Sony<00:00:17.940> lens<00:00:18.210> nomenclature<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.529> mouthful

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
Sony lens nomenclature is a mouthful

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.060 
Sony lens nomenclature is a mouthful
that's<00:00:20.820> basically<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.420> Sony<00:00:21.660> 50<00:00:22.199> mil<00:00:22.439> amount

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's basically the Sony 50 mil amount

a<00:00:26.730> phony<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.210> much<00:00:27.810> more<00:00:27.990> sensible<00:00:28.470> choice

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
a phony is much more sensible choice

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.620 
a phony is much more sensible choice
than<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> SEL<00:00:29.580> 55<00:00:30.179> f-18<00:00:31.050> Z<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.189> that's<00:00:32.369> the

than the SEL 55 f-18 Z so that's the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.850 
than the SEL 55 f-18 Z so that's the
Zeiss<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.870> believe<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.410> hop<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
Zeiss I believe it is the hop of the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.600 
Zeiss I believe it is the hop of the
