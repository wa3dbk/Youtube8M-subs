here<00:02:18.560> recommends<00:02:18.980> not<00:02:19.310> using<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:20.000> just

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
here recommends not using it a just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.090 
here recommends not using it a just
because<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.050> not<00:02:21.170> tested<00:02:21.560> for<00:02:21.710> long<00:02:21.860> term

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
because it's not tested for long term

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.280 
because it's not tested for long term
and<00:02:22.370> B<00:02:22.850> it's<00:02:23.150> way<00:02:23.510> easier<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.990> put<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> little

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and B it's way easier to put a little

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.900 
and B it's way easier to put a little
more<00:02:24.470> metal<00:02:24.800> rescue<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.430> case<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.820> get

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
more metal rescue in in case you get

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.550 
more metal rescue in in case you get
some<00:02:26.060> more<00:02:26.150> us<00:02:26.300> back<00:02:26.510> then<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.470> go

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
some more us back then it is to go

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.050 
some more us back then it is to go
through<00:02:27.590> actual<00:02:28.070> F<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:28.640> sealant

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
through actual F to get all that sealant

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.000 
through actual F to get all that sealant
outside<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.630> tank<00:02:29.780> way<00:02:30.350> easier<00:02:30.770> just<00:02:30.920> to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
outside of the tank way easier just to

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.010 
outside of the tank way easier just to
dump<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.520> forget<00:02:31.760> about<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.870> more

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
dump it in and forget about it for more

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.270
