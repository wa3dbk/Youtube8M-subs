what<00:01:54.759> are<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.390> additional<00:01:55.539> benefits<00:01:56.079> because

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
what are the additional benefits because

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.600 
what are the additional benefits because
not<00:01:56.409> everyone<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.950> public<00:01:57.250> speaker<00:01:57.579> on

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
their feet for 36 hours because

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.350 
their feet for 36 hours because
obviously<00:01:59.439> shift<00:01:59.860> workers<00:02:00.429> and<00:02:00.610> others<00:02:00.850> but

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
obviously shift workers and others but

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.240

people in the in the general population
would<00:02:08.170> benefit<00:02:09.069> from<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.399> spiky<00:02:09.759> ball<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.179> we

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
would benefit from the spiky ball so we

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.870 
would benefit from the spiky ball so we
have<00:02:10.860> people<00:02:11.860> from<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.190> general<00:02:12.519> population

work yeah so so one of the one of the

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.640 
work yeah so so one of the one of the
benefits<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> spy<00:02:42.670> ball<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.650> by

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
benefits of the spy ball is it by

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.520 
benefits of the spy ball is it by
releasing<00:02:44.980> your<00:02:45.340> fate<00:02:45.900> you're<00:02:46.900> helping<00:02:47.170> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
releasing your fate you're helping the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.680 
releasing your fate you're helping the
all<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> muscles<00:02:48.760> around<00:02:48.880> your<00:02:49.120> pelvis<00:02:49.599> and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
all the muscles around your pelvis and

all the muscles around your pelvis and
so<00:02:49.989> if<00:02:50.260> you're<00:02:50.650> improving<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.220> flexibility

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
so if you're improving the flexibility

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.099 
so if you're improving the flexibility
which<00:02:52.030> helps<00:02:52.299> all<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.510> muscles<00:02:52.840> around<00:02:52.870> your

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
which helps all the muscles around your

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.250 
which helps all the muscles around your
pelvis<00:02:53.590> switch<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.579> correctly<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.600> because

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
pelvis switch on correctly so because

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.710 
pelvis switch on correctly so because
we're<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.530> our<00:02:56.620> feet<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.450> lessening<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.569> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
we're on our feet in lessening of the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.140 
we're on our feet in lessening of the
feet<00:02:58.959> allows<00:02:59.319> all<00:02:59.530> those<00:02:59.650> muscles<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.370> do<00:03:00.910> it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
feet allows all those muscles to do it

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.300 
feet allows all those muscles to do it
incorrectly<00:03:01.269> around<00:03:01.930> your<00:03:02.049> pelvis<00:03:02.380> which<00:03:03.160> is

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
incorrectly around your pelvis which is

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.789 
incorrectly around your pelvis which is
a<00:03:03.340> big<00:03:03.579> proponent<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.540> improving<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.260> link<00:03:05.650> back

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
a big proponent to improving a link back

a big proponent to improving a link back
or<00:03:06.010> reducing<00:03:06.579> my<00:03:06.700> backpack<00:03:07.470> that's

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
or reducing my backpack that's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.710 
or reducing my backpack that's
incredible<00:03:08.950> how<00:03:09.880> long<00:03:10.180> does<00:03:10.389> this<00:03:10.510> actually

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
incredible how long does this actually

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.750 
incredible how long does this actually
last<00:03:11.170> like<00:03:11.470> if<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.709> use<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.160> for<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.400> regular

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
last like if you use it for a regular

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.670 
last like if you use it for a regular
use<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.269> this<00:03:13.600> something<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:13.959> will<00:03:14.230> break<00:03:14.440> in

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
use is this something that will break in

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.970 
use is this something that will break in
a<00:03:14.769> week<00:03:14.950> or<00:03:15.130> two<00:03:15.310> or<00:03:15.519> along<00:03:15.850> with<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.120> lives<00:03:16.299> not

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
a week or two or along with it lives not

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.620 
a week or two or along with it lives not
the<00:03:17.980> average<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.850> average<00:03:18.880> juicer<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.540> will

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
the average the average juicer that will

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.740 
the average the average juicer that will
who<00:03:20.810> last<00:03:21.050> four<00:03:21.320> outlets<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.770> two<00:03:21.980> years

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
who last four outlets of two years

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.850 
who last four outlets of two years
depending<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:23.990> the<00:03:24.140> obvious<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.620> amount

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
depending on the obvious of the amount

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.770 
depending on the obvious of the amount
of<00:03:24.980> time<00:03:25.130> they<00:03:25.400> use<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.610> but<00:03:25.970> around<00:03:26.300> two<00:03:26.600> years

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
of time they use it but around two years

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.870 
of time they use it but around two years
okay<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.620> what<00:03:27.920> does<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.190> go<00:03:28.370> for<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.760> is

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
okay and what does this go for it is

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.490 
okay and what does this go for it is
something<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:29.210> under<00:03:29.480> thirty<00:03:29.690> dollars<00:03:30.050> yeah

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
something like under thirty dollars yeah

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.390 
something like under thirty dollars yeah
it's<00:03:30.860> item<00:03:31.280> dulles<00:03:31.610> okay<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.380> $18<00:03:33.380> use<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:34.250> for

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
it's item dulles okay so $18 use it for
