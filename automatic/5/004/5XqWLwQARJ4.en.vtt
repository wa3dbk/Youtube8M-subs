00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.520
 and good kids like you are here 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.250
 We need the good minecraft today 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.090
 I bring two tricks are worth how to go 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.730
 faster and as there is a way 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.390
 very slow tiresome question of the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.160
 time is good, the quick way is this 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.640
 it seems the form the way 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.559
 stable are two tricks that I have in the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.559
 Mariana people know but there are some who 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.670
 there are no courses on the web good to see 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.649
 first I will explain how it is done 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.490
 is to put the blocks these up here 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.090
 ok so you can 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.090
 skip 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.630
 a row of ice and tricked by 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.100
 over it's worth or I 'm not here what's 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.130
 so that I do not go around the bars 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.870
 the trick is worth you open it you put yourself in the middle 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:10.360
 there is land and zooming and there goes 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.720
 fast is a distance or you can not 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.460
 do it you can run more more it depends 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.240
 how do you do it, I did not run and run 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.610
 even more so fast here but wow 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.610
 in a very simple way we go again 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.880
 today you have to run pretty good 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.070
 slow way to see how everyone knows 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.640
 souza when the slowest increases are worth 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.430
 the would be normal 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.900
 but 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.900
 to go even slower 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.430
 when it is doing good today it 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 is doing to have one more way 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.700
 slow look 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.149
 it is super slow bars very tired of 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.520
 this and the way to do this is to put 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.729
 ice down here 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.250
 Okay, you put the ice layer down and 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.170
 then on top jerusun and you go but 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.590
 super lenses that is something good you and everything 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:17.730
 he looks at it is that until going there it would take 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:22.049
 thousand years and this is the down there is nothing 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.780
 normal earth and you go like normal sauce 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.049
 van or are not two tricks will bring more 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.430
