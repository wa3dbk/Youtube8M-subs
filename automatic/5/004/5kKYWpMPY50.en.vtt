00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.740
 Google has Ellison still beats asking a lot of questions 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:21.810
 van Gaal 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 not the music fits in with anything 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.150
 So that's the motto appreciated 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.350
 crop yield 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.300
 for their own safety the sound 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.370
 Blagnac I want that men 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.460
 if it is not 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.620
 because may Allah be too many 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.630
 What do you make of it 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.000
 i wish you a good day, good nerves and brought offenders 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.430
 No 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.310
 Haiti does not apply to his son 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.300
 the rent is definitely not good 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.410
 lay to the end 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.630
 so had to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270
 I've probably seen her before 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.120
 I hardly believe that 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.810
 are alien to her «I can hardly get out of the city or want to give it away 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.510
 well maybe they are heavy 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.500
 well now has 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.760
 here will be interesting 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.790
 I did not have to escape 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
 I would not do that in her place 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.530
 I knew that they would say that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.620
 They say that they are here in Fürth 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.720
 see also report follows 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 or I have to jail her for authority 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 I want a diamond allowed 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.060
 if they say more 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.180
 had taken place earlier 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.290
 the Admira Undertaker 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.700
 I shoot 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.790
 The saying had such a wooden door called Billy the Kid 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.820
 after you give us the diamonds of the world 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.450
 They also did not try to kill my comrade and Chopard 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.120
 grilling 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.120
 nevertheless the most interesting 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.350
 I have to say 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.549
 Freddy Adu 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.580
 Of course, too 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.959
 we should want to tell her 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.389
 with Raúl 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.389
 you would you on 6 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.119
 Google is already talking about the color of an object 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.109
 more 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.099
 but seen that way, the culprit is already established 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.839
 there is what it wants 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.769
 the HSH 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.859
 Glasgow 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.089
 they are 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.519
 I have no time now - hikes 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.619
 before I forget 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.619
 Of course you have to be on the 8th 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.689
 Conversations with the face 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:49.929
 heard 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.459
 is much worse 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.459
 Mixa 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.039
 Wiesbaden dpa 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.349
 but not considering 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.349
 nothing because I put 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.419
 we are now in a host country percent 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.989
 who are so far 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.200
 but in what movie 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.379
 Some movie with pubis and Philipp tilted or something else says 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:19.169
 and that works 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.469
 in a comic has become different to the inauguration and 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.469
 Billy the Kid with you 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.879
 that's still to say for Saturday 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.339
 I work 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.229
 before the second one does 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.599
 I would have these films here now 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.939
 nice cut to process other punishable 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.469
 and I would say he ended widening 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.269
 especially if it's weekend today 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.019
 I also want something from Monday evening 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.049
 and 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.029
 So I say great about it 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.789
 wait, meet 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:00.479
