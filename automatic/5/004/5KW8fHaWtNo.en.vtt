00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
we can teach critical thinking when I

we can teach critical thinking when I
get<00:02:43.820> excited<00:02:43.970> about<00:02:44.360> why<00:02:44.600> Waldorf<00:02:45.050> education

get excited about why Waldorf education

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.810 
get excited about why Waldorf education
is<00:02:45.709> different<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.130> because<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.550> teaches

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
is different is because it teaches

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.370 
is different is because it teaches
emotional<00:02:47.300> intelligence<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.900> has<00:02:48.050> been<00:02:48.260> for

emotional intelligence and has been for

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.199 
emotional intelligence and has been for
100<00:02:48.709> years<00:02:48.860> it's<00:02:49.130> not<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> catch<00:02:49.580> word<00:02:49.820> for<00:02:50.090> us

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
100 years it's not a catch word for us

they go through the curriculum what you
have<00:03:02.000> happened<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.470> get<00:03:03.650> someone<00:03:03.980> who<00:03:04.160> can

them<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.110> really<00:04:09.680> look<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:11.060> these<00:04:11.720> activities

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
them to really look so these activities

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
of engaging in the arts makes them to be

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.670 
of engaging in the arts makes them to be
able<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.850> think<00:04:17.360> and<00:04:17.510> observe<00:04:18.020> and<00:04:18.320> to

to draw will give the students of a much

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.520 
to draw will give the students of a much
stronger<00:04:25.910> ability<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.600> work<00:04:26.810> in<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.050> group<00:04:27.320> and

to communicate ideas to other people the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.340 
to communicate ideas to other people the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
sciences are integrated into the art and

sciences are integrated into the art and
they're<00:04:33.440> integrated<00:04:33.950> into<00:04:33.980> everything<00:04:34.490> that

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
they're integrated into everything that

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.220 
they're integrated into everything that
you're<00:04:34.760> doing<00:04:35.030> throughout<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.420> day<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:35.810> you

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
you're doing throughout the day that you

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.750 
you're doing throughout the day that you
almost<00:04:36.260> don't<00:04:36.740> realize<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.280> you're

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
almost don't realize that you're

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.330 
almost don't realize that you're
acquiring<00:04:38.120> all<00:04:38.720> these<00:04:39.050> skills<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.800> there's<00:04:40.280> a

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
acquiring all these skills and there's a

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.130 
acquiring all these skills and there's a
difference<00:04:40.640> between<00:04:40.790> rote<00:04:41.180> memorization<00:04:41.480> and

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
difference between rote memorization and

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.930 
difference between rote memorization and
really<00:04:42.830> being<00:04:43.070> able<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.430> take<00:04:43.760> information

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
really being able to take information

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.150 
really being able to take information
and<00:04:44.540> look<00:04:44.780> at<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.050> from<00:04:45.170> different<00:04:45.230> sides<00:04:45.530> and

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
and look at it from different sides and

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.150 
and look at it from different sides and
then<00:04:47.000> make<00:04:47.270> new<00:04:48.670> creative<00:04:49.870> hopefully<00:04:50.870> better

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
then make new creative hopefully better

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.470 
then make new creative hopefully better
interpretations<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.400> ways<00:04:52.550> of<00:04:52.730> doing<00:04:52.850> things

interpretations and ways of doing things
I<00:04:53.510> do<00:04:53.660> think<00:04:53.930> Waldorf<00:04:54.230> students<00:04:54.650> are

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
I do think Waldorf students are

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.240 
I do think Waldorf students are
appreciated<00:04:57.110> for<00:04:57.140> being<00:04:57.590> good<00:04:57.830> critical

appreciated for being good critical

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.880 
appreciated for being good critical
thinkers<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:59.330> is<00:04:59.510> where<00:04:59.720> the<00:05:00.410> school<00:05:00.710> is

thinkers and this is where the school is
