00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.220
 from modern science 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.370
 the CD was examined by the Universities Berlin take over so far 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.070
 Champs to yield leap and at the University of Vienna Salzburg 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.619
 there were 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.119
 Reason for the "something pretended" was the animal Holtz on the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.510
 mental performance and on the recovery phase now appeared 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.069
 to get more automatic out of the way 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.679
 it was women and men 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.590
 set in seven wood room has to accomplish my mental accomplishment 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.470
 and there were parameters there first tweet the heart rate like that 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.640
 Heart rate variability 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.980
 because of the recovery phase 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.210
 and it has been shown that the heart rate 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.059
 in the finish Ziemer tore significantly 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.510
 low peasant 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.740
 is the heart rate team 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.820
 Korinek data Ziemer 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.990
 low heart rate confirms us in life 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.550
 if you take pc games like the turtle or the heart rate of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.980
 35 to 50 and loads up to over a hundred years 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.730
 this is a graphic example of how the heart rate has to lead me 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.920
 Cheap affects the low heart rate 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.810
 The first boundaries variability the Kita St before the next tests were in 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.960
 tent 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.070
 that the recovery phase 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.950
 was much better when the autonomic nervous system is 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.520
 Nervous system water stress reacts very strongly to certain palpitations 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.970
 refreshed top model 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.890
 dpa 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 this heart rate variability must be high 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.220
 the Chinese usually cares automatically when the heart needs it 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.000
 like a woodpecker 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.230
 then he will not live much longer 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.190
 this regularity 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.499
 Hotmail's ten models investigations still in 2004 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.060
 at the CWT market 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.630
 Vodafone combination with the CD and has seen there that too 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.910
 Variability of the heart rate 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.540
 was for us 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.090
 in the first process in general and especially for our vegetative 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.720
 nervous system 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.210
 there were still investigations to be made with the ten balls 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.529
 Yes 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:14.109
 Regarding bacterial colonization there still various slaughterings 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.139
 situated with stone pine spruce wood in budget Tools account was 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.799
 sensationally indicative wood 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.669
 The strain of colibacilli were chosen in comparison to Nolan 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.369
 Data with Weaver 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.979
 up to 80 percent 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.989
 also students teachers and lesbians Salzburg made ounces 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.799
 Porsche was noted by the two and that is the very interesting one is said 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.399
 we live in everyday practice 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:46.689
 is the influence of ornamental wooder vestibule air and room temperature and up 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.779
 What does this mean in practical praxis is the song 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.369
 know that for you 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:56.349
 Vitus had always been very bitterly paralyzed in hot days for me 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.119
 The impact for tilt concerns Forster 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:03.129
 Asthma table illness concerns must be cardiovascular disease concerns 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.370
 and the WebDAV loveliness that I'm sensitive cold on the plan "white 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.389
 Ring Â»Air pressure and on the humidity is infecting wood 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:10.990
 Ziemer 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.170
 much lower 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.369
 mostly take 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.749
 Korinek shares off 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:21.040
 as a side effect 40 percent is now revealed that social behavior 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.359
 to force him to distance us 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.159
 has changed 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.059
 which may be a conclusion that suggests that in earlier 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.189
 Times the inns very frequent pull along wood paneling 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.389
 was lined 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.859
 among themselves - to take ZSC League
