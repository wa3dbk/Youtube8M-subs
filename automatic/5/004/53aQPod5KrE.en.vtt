okay and you talked about vertical
sidewall<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.460> gonna<00:00:50.640> give<00:00:50.969> them<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.300> I'm

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
sidewall that's gonna give them what I'm

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.090 
sidewall that's gonna give them what I'm
standing<00:00:51.870> graph<00:00:52.260> I'm<00:00:52.410> guessing<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> fight

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
standing graph I'm guessing in the fight

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
standing graph I'm guessing in the fight
exactly<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.840> know<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.590> these<00:00:55.710> kids<00:00:55.980> are

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
exactly you know when these kids are

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
exactly you know when these kids are
transitioning<00:00:57.090> through<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> pipe<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> up

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
transitioning through the pipe and up

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.740 
transitioning through the pipe and up
the<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> wall<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.850> really<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> hold

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the up the wall they really want to hold

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.510 
the up the wall they really want to hold
that<00:01:00.930> edge<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.530> much<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.859> possible<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.460> as

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
that edge as much as possible to get as

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.820 
that edge as much as possible to get as
much<00:01:02.789> speed<00:01:03.030> yeah<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.260> we're<00:01:04.470> gonna<00:01:04.530> offer

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
much speed yeah so we're gonna offer

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.130 
much speed yeah so we're gonna offer
them<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.790> vertical<00:01:06.210> sidewall<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.810> help<00:01:06.990> them

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
them that vertical sidewall to help them

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.350 
them that vertical sidewall to help them
do<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> okay<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> guys<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> are

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
do that okay and for the guys that are

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.090 
do that okay and for the guys that are
doing<00:01:09.600> slopes<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.080> we've<00:01:10.380> got<00:01:10.530> edgy<00:01:10.770> armor

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
doing slopes that we've got edgy armor

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.789 
doing slopes that we've got edgy armor
right<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.909> edge<00:01:12.090> armor<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:13.290> cool<00:01:13.530> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
right so edge armor is really cool it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.580 
right so edge armor is really cool it's
a<00:01:13.979> tough<00:01:14.760> filament<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:15.540> woven<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
a tough filament that's woven back and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.789 
a tough filament that's woven back and
forth<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> then<00:01:17.580> tied<00:01:18.210> around<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.869> edge<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
forth and then tied around the edge and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
forth and then tied around the edge and
so<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.400> does<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> acts<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
so what that does is it acts like a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.590 
so what that does is it acts like a
corset<00:01:22.080> holds<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.009> middle<00:01:23.759> third<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> ski

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
corset holds the middle third of the ski

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.649 
corset holds the middle third of the ski
together<00:01:25.189> Solomon<00:01:26.189> says<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.670> approximately

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
together Solomon says it's approximately

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.800 
together Solomon says it's approximately
30%<00:01:28.049> more<00:01:28.650> durable<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.759> edge<00:01:30.030> armor<00:01:30.420> versus

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
30% more durable with edge armor versus

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
30% more durable with edge armor versus
a<00:01:30.840> ski<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.380> doesn't<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.860> them<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.310> hitting

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
a ski that doesn't have them so hitting

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
a ski that doesn't have them so hitting
rails<00:01:33.329> boxes<00:01:34.020> constantly<00:01:34.560> you're<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.920> gonna

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
rails boxes constantly you're not gonna

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
rails boxes constantly you're not gonna
have<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> worry<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.670> much<00:01:35.729> about<00:01:35.909> blow<00:01:36.329> edge

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
have to worry as much about blow edge

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
have to worry as much about blow edge
