00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:55.690 

you

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.000 

you

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:09.869 

I

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.330 

so<00:02:10.879> I<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.780> repeat<00:02:12.140> these<00:02:12.349> steps<00:02:12.410> on<00:02:12.920> each

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
so I just repeat these steps on each

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.970 
so I just repeat these steps on each
section<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.940> my<00:02:14.120> hair<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.660> probably<00:02:15.080> do<00:02:15.500> pretty

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
section of my hair I probably do pretty

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.040 
section of my hair I probably do pretty
small<00:02:16.580> sections<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.390> because<00:02:17.629> my<00:02:17.780> hair<00:02:18.019> is

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
small sections just because my hair is

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.800 
small sections just because my hair is
so<00:02:18.440> tangled<00:02:18.769> I'm<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:19.940> easier<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.599> were

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
so tangled I'm in this easier if I were

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:36.370 
so tangled I'm in this easier if I were
come<00:02:21.050> in<00:02:21.230> smaller<00:02:21.620> sections

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:03:00.390 

you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:10.750 

you

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.630 

once<00:03:11.760> I'm<00:03:11.970> done<00:03:12.470> detangling<00:03:13.470> on<00:03:13.650> my<00:03:13.890> dry<00:03:14.220> hair

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.940 
I the next step is to get in the shower
and<00:03:17.040> let<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.280> water<00:03:17.610> also<00:03:18.230> help<00:03:19.230> me<00:03:19.410> detangle
