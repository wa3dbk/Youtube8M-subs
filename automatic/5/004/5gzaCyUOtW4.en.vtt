mean<00:02:46.090> its<00:02:46.390> first<00:02:46.930> form<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.320> goofy<00:02:47.770> enough<00:02:48.010> but

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
mean its first form is goofy enough but

now it throws a second ball into the mix
and<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.850> does<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.270> little<00:02:52.450> more<00:02:52.600> than<00:02:53.020> slowing

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
and it does a little more than slowing

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.160 
and it does a little more than slowing
it<00:02:53.739> down<00:02:54.060> do<00:02:55.060> enough<00:02:55.300> damage<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.900> form

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
it down do enough damage to this form

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.170 
it down do enough damage to this form
and<00:02:56.290> it'll<00:02:56.470> take<00:02:56.650> off<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.100> rocket<00:02:57.370> and

catches<00:05:07.480> itself<00:05:07.960> from<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.260> ceiling<00:05:08.590> and

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
catches itself from the ceiling and

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.020 
catches itself from the ceiling and
rolls<00:05:08.860> all<00:05:09.100> the<00:05:09.220> way<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.550> bottom<00:05:09.850> right

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
rolls all the way to the bottom right

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.880 
rolls all the way to the bottom right
corner<00:05:10.090> at<00:05:10.690> which<00:05:11.050> point<00:05:11.380> it<00:05:11.530> will<00:05:11.620> fire<00:05:11.860> a

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
corner at which point it will fire a

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.520 
corner at which point it will fire a
long<00:05:12.220> laser<00:05:12.580> that<00:05:13.240> ricochets<00:05:13.840> off<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.170> angled

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
long laser that ricochets off the angled

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.100 
long laser that ricochets off the angled
walls<00:05:14.730> pretty<00:05:15.730> simple<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.330> avoid<00:05:16.630> but

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
walls pretty simple to avoid but

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.080 
walls pretty simple to avoid but
sometimes<00:05:17.800> it<00:05:18.040> can<00:05:18.250> trap<00:05:18.640> you

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
sometimes it can trap you

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.780 
sometimes it can trap you
now<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.140> other<00:05:20.530> transition<00:05:21.220> point<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:21.580> where

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
now the other transition point is where

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.490 
now the other transition point is where
we<00:05:21.970> see<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.330> last<00:05:22.570> change<00:05:22.960> to<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.320> boss

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.190 
have come to fruition this gives us four
possible<00:07:29.160> paths<00:07:29.460> which<00:07:29.940> means<00:07:30.240> four<00:07:30.630> possible

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200 
possible paths which means four possible

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.470 
possible paths which means four possible
endings<00:07:31.560> now<00:07:32.220> go<00:07:32.460> ahead<00:07:32.580> and<00:07:32.940> choose<00:07:33.150> your
