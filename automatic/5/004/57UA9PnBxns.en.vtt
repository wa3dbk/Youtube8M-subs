00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
well today we're going to test the speed

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.870 
well today we're going to test the speed
of<00:00:22.419> the<00:00:22.480> vodafone<00:00:23.259> mobile<00:00:23.619> broadband<00:00:24.310> in<00:00:24.550> real

life<00:00:25.119> we're<00:00:25.480> going<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.750> test<00:00:25.960> how<00:00:26.589> fast<00:00:26.949> it<00:00:27.189> is

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:27.219 
life we're going to test how fast it is

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.249 
life we're going to test how fast it is
and<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:28.059> best<00:00:28.179> way<00:00:28.329> that<00:00:28.630> we<00:00:28.689> want<00:00:28.989> to<00:00:29.079> test

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
and the best way that we want to test

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.349 
and the best way that we want to test
this<00:00:29.439> is<00:00:29.739> having<00:00:30.160> a<00:00:30.219> race<00:00:30.460> against<00:00:31.239> the

real car and I'll be quite keen eye can
see<00:00:41.739> how<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.850> virtual<00:00:43.180> car<00:00:43.390> will<00:00:43.600> work

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
see how the virtual car will work

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.250 
see how the virtual car will work
alongside<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.500> race<00:00:44.649> car<00:00:44.949> itself<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.930> car<00:00:47.110> is
