everybody<00:00:22.609> this<00:00:22.849> is<00:00:22.910> Ian<00:00:23.329> I<00:00:23.660> wanted<00:00:24.199> to<00:00:24.289> show

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
everybody this is Ian I wanted to show

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.529 
everybody this is Ian I wanted to show
you<00:00:24.590> how<00:00:25.160> I<00:00:25.189> fixed<00:00:25.759> my<00:00:26.090> roland<00:00:26.779> cy<00:00:27.349> 8

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
you how I fixed my roland cy 8

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:35.369 
you how I fixed my roland cy 8
electronic<00:00:29.539> symbol<00:00:31.119> leave<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.329> there<00:00:34.120> that

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
electronic symbol leave that there that

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.229 
electronic symbol leave that there that
well<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.470> reason<00:00:36.800> I<00:00:37.129> wanted<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.699> fix<00:00:37.879> it<00:00:38.089> is

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
well the reason I wanted to fix it is

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.630 
well the reason I wanted to fix it is
because<00:00:38.629> I<00:00:38.659> had<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.290> limited<00:00:39.980> amount<00:00:40.489> of

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
because I had a limited amount of

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.420 
because I had a limited amount of
sensitivity<00:00:41.980> actually<00:00:42.980> it<00:00:43.070> was<00:00:43.220> very

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
sensitivity actually it was very

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.569 
sensitivity actually it was very
insensitive<00:00:44.269> so<00:00:45.050> let's<00:00:45.379> go<00:00:45.559> ahead<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.159> get<00:00:46.519> to

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
insensitive so let's go ahead and get to

00:00:46.579 --> 00:01:02.710 
insensitive so let's go ahead and get to
work<00:00:59.619> this<00:01:00.619> is<00:01:00.830> what<00:01:00.979> the<00:01:01.159> guts<00:01:01.400> look<00:01:01.640> like<00:01:01.879> and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
work this is what the guts look like and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.109 
work this is what the guts look like and
now<00:01:02.930> I<00:01:02.989> already<00:01:03.290> changed<00:01:03.739> this<00:01:04.220> piezo<00:01:04.909> right

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
now I already changed this piezo right

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.080 
now I already changed this piezo right
here

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
here

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.240 
here
what<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:08.210> also<00:01:08.659> under<00:01:09.500> here<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:11.920> little<00:01:12.920> foam

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
what is also under here is a little foam

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.080 
what is also under here is a little foam
pad<00:01:14.170> now<00:01:15.170> my<00:01:15.350> first<00:01:15.619> attempt<00:01:16.189> I<00:01:16.369> tried<00:01:16.759> to<00:01:16.880> use

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
pad now my first attempt I tried to use

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.980 
pad now my first attempt I tried to use
some<00:01:17.119> hockey<00:01:18.020> stick<00:01:18.500> tape<00:01:19.240> see<00:01:20.240> here<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:20.900> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
some hockey stick tape see here it's a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.600 
some hockey stick tape see here it's a
little<00:01:21.170> too<00:01:21.320> dense<00:01:23.470> that<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:25.010> really<00:01:25.370> messed

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
little too dense that it really messed

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.360 
little too dense that it really messed
up<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:26.000> was<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.180> little<00:01:26.659> bit<00:01:26.810> oversensitive

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
up it was a little bit oversensitive

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.120 
up it was a little bit oversensitive
hitting<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.430> bow<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.770> cymbal<00:01:30.770> would

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
hitting the bow of the cymbal would

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.840 
hitting the bow of the cymbal would
often<00:01:31.730> result<00:01:32.090> in<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:33.130> dome<00:01:34.130> sound<00:01:34.580> and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
often result in a dome sound and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.170 
often result in a dome sound and
adjusting<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:36.530> sensitivity<00:01:37.130> on<00:01:37.280> my<00:01:37.760> roland

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
adjusting the sensitivity on my roland

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.990 
adjusting the sensitivity on my roland
brain<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.750> didn't<00:01:39.140> seem<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.380> work<00:01:39.860> as<00:01:40.400> well<00:01:40.460> as

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
brain it didn't seem to work as well as

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.930 
brain it didn't seem to work as well as
I<00:01:41.600> hope<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.140> wanted<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.560> go<00:01:42.740> with<00:01:43.610> something

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
I hope so I wanted to go with something

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.210 
I hope so I wanted to go with something
more<00:01:44.110> similar<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.290> what<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.470> found<00:01:45.820> inside<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.880> om

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
more similar to what I found inside a om

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.380 
more similar to what I found inside a om
so<00:01:49.220> what<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:49.729> did<00:01:51.790> is<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:53.810> got<00:01:54.190> these<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.970> little

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
so what I did is I got these a little

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.920 
so what I did is I got these a little
scrapbook<00:01:56.900> adhesive<00:01:57.909> foam<00:01:58.909> dots<00:01:59.299> they<00:01:59.690> seem

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
scrapbook adhesive foam dots they seem

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.980 
scrapbook adhesive foam dots they seem
to<00:02:00.080> do<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.260> trick<00:02:00.380> pretty<00:02:00.860> well<00:02:01.070> for<00:02:01.400> me<00:02:01.580> here

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
to do the trick pretty well for me here

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.770 
to do the trick pretty well for me here
you<00:02:02.990> see<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.320> one<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.490> took<00:02:05.090> out<00:02:05.270> here<00:02:05.630> a

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
you see the one that I took out here a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.229 
you see the one that I took out here a
little<00:02:06.409> smaller<00:02:06.680> than<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.979> dime<00:02:07.250> as<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.940> match

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
little smaller than a dime as you match

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.860 
little smaller than a dime as you match
the<00:02:08.629> size<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.500> was<00:02:10.209> under<00:02:11.209> under<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.629> hood

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
the size that was under under the hood

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.740 
the size that was under under the hood
already<00:02:12.970> now<00:02:14.560> I'd<00:02:15.560> also<00:02:16.060> used<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.420> little<00:02:17.629> bit

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
already now I'd also used a little bit

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.759 
already now I'd also used a little bit
of<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:18.019> goo<00:02:18.769> gone<00:02:19.040> after<00:02:20.379> removing<00:02:21.379> the

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
of a goo gone after removing the

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.100 
of a goo gone after removing the
original<00:02:21.920> felt<00:02:22.909> foam<00:02:23.299> pad<00:02:23.810> under<00:02:24.409> the<00:02:24.560> piezo

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
original felt foam pad under the piezo

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.309 
original felt foam pad under the piezo
wash<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.230> off<00:02:27.349> with<00:02:27.500> some<00:02:27.770> rubbing<00:02:28.730> alcohol

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
wash it off with some rubbing alcohol

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.600 
wash it off with some rubbing alcohol
once<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.440> was<00:02:30.530> all<00:02:30.680> dry

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
once it was all dry

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.040 
once it was all dry
I<00:02:31.670> cleaned<00:02:32.390> up<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:33.620> went<00:02:34.610> ahead<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.850> adhere<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
I cleaned up I went ahead and adhere the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.970 
I cleaned up I went ahead and adhere the
foam<00:02:36.530> dot<00:02:37.690> as<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.810> said<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.080> had<00:02:39.440> already<00:02:39.560> done

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
foam dot as I said I had already done

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.950 
foam dot as I said I had already done
the<00:02:40.880> soldering<00:02:41.800> for<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:44.980> 27<00:02:45.980> millimeter

there<00:02:50.840> are<00:02:51.050> also<00:02:51.460> mods<00:02:52.460> if<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.820> do<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:52.970> little

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
there are also mods if you do a little

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.400 
there are also mods if you do a little
extra<00:02:53.510> googling<00:02:54.190> about<00:02:55.190> using<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.610> 35

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
little bit bigger that you may be able

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.510 
little bit bigger that you may be able
to<00:03:01.010> get<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.459> fuller<00:03:01.970> range<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.750> sounds<00:03:03.520> which

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
to get a fuller range of sounds which

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.330 
to get a fuller range of sounds which
which<00:03:04.940> seems<00:03:05.300> ideal<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.930> wish<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.830> had<00:03:06.920> found<00:03:06.950> it

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
which seems ideal I wish I had found it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.729 
which seems ideal I wish I had found it
before<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:07.670> went<00:03:07.880> for<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.180> fix<00:03:08.390> myself<00:03:08.630> but<00:03:09.590> I'm

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
before I went for the fix myself but I'm

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.530 
before I went for the fix myself but I'm
going<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.920> stick<00:03:10.070> with<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.310> 27<00:03:10.730> Miller<00:03:11.060> and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
going to stick with the 27 Miller and

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.500 
going to stick with the 27 Miller and
that's<00:03:12.170> really<00:03:12.590> all<00:03:12.920> there<00:03:13.190> is<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.970> if<00:03:14.360> I

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
that's really all there is to it if I

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.479 
that's really all there is to it if I
didn't<00:03:14.750> mention<00:03:15.020> it<00:03:15.140> before<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:16.100> there<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.459> a

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
didn't mention it before that there is a

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.060 
didn't mention it before that there is a
slight<00:03:17.150> gap<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.110> see<00:03:18.320> where<00:03:18.530> my<00:03:18.650> soldering

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
slight gap and see where my soldering

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.740 
slight gap and see where my soldering
iron<00:03:19.100> it's<00:03:19.489> not<00:03:19.610> hot<00:03:19.820> or<00:03:19.850> anything<00:03:20.360> right<00:03:20.510> now

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
iron it's not hot or anything right now

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.340 
iron it's not hot or anything right now
but<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:21.800> can<00:03:21.950> see<00:03:22.280> where<00:03:22.910> there<00:03:23.690> is<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:24.260> a

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
but you can see where there is just a

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.120 
but you can see where there is just a
little<00:03:24.739> gap<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.180> want<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.860> for<00:03:27.860> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
little gap and you want that for the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.650 
little gap and you want that for the
sensitivity<00:03:28.790> because<00:03:28.970> when<00:03:29.120> you're<00:03:29.239> banging

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
sensitivity because when you're banging

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.000 
sensitivity because when you're banging
on<00:03:29.750> this<00:03:29.989> thing

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
on this thing

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.380 
on this thing
you<00:03:31.340> know<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.580> going<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.760> rattle<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.209> roll

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
you know it's going to rattle and roll

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.449 
you know it's going to rattle and roll
so<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.630> don't<00:03:32.780> want<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.200> hear<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.530> straight<00:03:34.130> to

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
so you don't want to hear it straight to

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.340 
so you don't want to hear it straight to
the<00:03:34.580> plastic<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.480> want<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.959> want<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.200> to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the plastic you want it you want it to

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.830 
the plastic you want it you want it to
let<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:36.620> vibrate<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.580> will<00:03:37.840> transduce

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
let it vibrate so that it will transduce

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.310 
let it vibrate so that it will transduce
the<00:03:38.870> sound<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.850> that's<00:03:41.120> all<00:03:41.510> there<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:42.170> it

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
the sound and that's all there is to it

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.150 
the sound and that's all there is to it
once<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.430> have<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.580> soldered<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.510> attached

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
once you have it soldered and attached

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.390 
once you have it soldered and attached
just<00:03:46.160> hook<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.820> back<00:03:47.000> up<00:03:47.299> and<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:48.530> hope<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.160> fix

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
just hook it back up and I hope this fix

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.959 
just hook it back up and I hope this fix
works<00:03:49.610> for<00:03:49.850> you<00:03:49.940> thanks<00:03:50.480> for<00:03:50.630> watching
