going down the runways

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.120 
going down the runways
yeah<00:02:13.920> rough<00:02:14.730> idea<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.300> said<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.230> also<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
yeah rough idea like I said and also the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.890 
yeah rough idea like I said and also the
people<00:02:17.310> who<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:17.760> complain<00:02:18.150> about<00:02:18.240> poppin

people who like complain about poppin

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.780 
people who like complain about poppin
and<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> new<00:02:19.350> one<00:02:19.500> look<00:02:20.160> Gordon<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.580> left

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and the new one look Gordon the left

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.710 
and the new one look Gordon the left
it's<00:02:21.030> Andreas

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
it's Andreas

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.080 
it's Andreas
it's<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.250> much<00:02:23.400> washed<00:02:23.640> back<00:02:23.790> then<00:02:23.970> you

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it's like so much washed back then you

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.940 
it's like so much washed back then you
really<00:02:24.360> don't<00:02:24.450> realize<00:02:24.630> how<00:02:24.990> far<00:02:25.200> we've<00:02:25.260> come

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
really don't realize how far we've come

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.730 
really don't realize how far we've come
also<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.600> Sanjay's<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.410> came<00:02:28.590> first

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
also the Sanjay's one came first

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.860 
also the Sanjay's one came first
indicating<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.610> shorter<00:02:30.180> runway

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
indicating a shorter runway

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.200 
indicating a shorter runway
this<00:02:31.530> parrot<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.860> think<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.280> GTA<00:02:32.580> 5<00:02:32.790> pitches<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
this parrot I think the GTA 5 pitches a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.720 
this parrot I think the GTA 5 pitches a
lot<00:02:33.330> less<00:02:33.630> floor<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.290> not<00:02:34.410> not<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.950> not<00:02:35.250> enough

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
lot less floor but not not a not enough

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.310 
lot less floor but not not a not enough
to<00:02:35.940> make<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.600> big<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> difference<00:02:36.870> and

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
to make that big a difference and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.010 
to make that big a difference and
eventually<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.310> comes<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.790> second<00:02:39.300> but

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
eventually it comes in second but

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.690 
eventually it comes in second but
realistically<00:02:40.560> since<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.130> came<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.340> second

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
realistically since it came in second

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
realistically since it came in second
that<00:02:41.910> means<00:02:42.000> he's<00:02:42.150> got<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.300> bigger<00:02:42.480> runway

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that means he's got a bigger runway

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.200 
that means he's got a bigger runway
which<00:02:43.380> means<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.650> really<00:02:43.830> came<00:02:43.980> first<00:02:44.220> cuz<00:02:45.090> you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
which means it really came first cuz you

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.750 
which means it really came first cuz you
know<00:02:45.330> Becker<00:02:45.900> was<00:02:46.050> always<00:02:46.290> bear<00:02:46.470> Mauro<00:02:47.430> anyone

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
know Becker was always bear Mauro anyone

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.500 
know Becker was always bear Mauro anyone
says<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.920> next<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.130> are<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.030> tallest

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.920 
says and next we are on to the tallest
building<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.320> Los<00:02:52.590> Santos<00:02:53.360> at<00:02:54.360> least<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.630> think

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930

look<00:03:09.000> at<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.210> from<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.540> probably<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.410> I

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
look at it from a is probably the I

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.700 
look at it from a is probably the I
guess<00:03:11.100> Tara<00:03:12.230> also<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.260> don't<00:03:13.380> know<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.590> it's

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
guess Tara also I don't know if it's

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.740 
guess Tara also I don't know if it's
based<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.190> real<00:03:14.490> life<00:03:14.520> thing<00:03:14.760> I'm<00:03:15.120> assuming

it was overlooking Vespucci beach or
Verona<00:04:38.280> beaches<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:39.060> think<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:39.450> was<00:04:39.540> called

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750

Verona beaches I think it was called
back<00:04:39.930> then<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:41.180> yeah<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.270> does<00:04:42.390> not<00:04:42.480> look<00:04:42.780> that

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
back then and yeah it does not look that

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.680 
back then and yeah it does not look that
different<00:04:43.470> really<00:04:43.740> from<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:45.180> new<00:04:45.330> version

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
different really from the new version

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.600 
different really from the new version
obviously<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.050> new<00:04:46.140> version<00:04:46.440> has<00:04:46.610> updated

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
obviously the new version has updated

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.520 
obviously the new version has updated
textures<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.510> stuff<00:04:48.570> in<00:04:48.810> his<00:04:48.930> overlooking

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
vein with Hills instead this time but it

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.930 
vein with Hills instead this time but it
was<00:04:52.080> quite<00:04:52.890> similar<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.460> be<00:04:53.580> honest

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
was quite similar to be honest

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.930 
was quite similar to be honest
and<00:04:54.560> finally<00:04:55.560> we<00:04:55.650> move<00:04:55.770> on<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:56.040> make<00:04:56.280> chiliad

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
and finally we move on to make chiliad

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.610 
and finally we move on to make chiliad
which<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.510> had<00:04:57.690> actually<00:04:57.870> consoled<00:04:58.260> giving<00:04:58.500> its

which I had actually consoled giving its
own<00:04:58.710> video<00:04:58.920> but<00:04:59.790> I<00:05:00.120> don't<00:05:00.840> why<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.050> decided

longer there and and also we go to the
top<00:05:59.880> of<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.210> mountain<00:06:00.480> both<00:06:01.410> have<00:06:01.620> these<00:06:01.770> like

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
observation decks this island race one

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.280 
observation decks this island race one
also<00:06:05.610> didn't<00:06:05.820> look<00:06:05.880> quite<00:06:06.150> as<00:06:06.270> good<00:06:06.420> had<00:06:07.110> that

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
also didn't look quite as good had that

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.380 
also didn't look quite as good had that
marble<00:06:07.710> with<00:06:07.830> some<00:06:08.040> unintelligible<00:06:08.760> rating

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
marble with some unintelligible rating

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.210 
marble with some unintelligible rating
and<00:06:09.570> an<00:06:09.750> American<00:06:10.050> flag<00:06:10.230> which<00:06:10.440> really<00:06:10.770> didn't

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
and an American flag which really didn't

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.280 
and an American flag which really didn't
wave<00:06:11.540> so<00:06:12.540> it's<00:06:12.690> kind<00:06:12.840> of<00:06:12.870> like<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.110> moon

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
wave so it's kind of like the moon

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.960 
wave so it's kind of like the moon
landing<00:06:13.320> thing<00:06:14.220> where<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:14.460> just<00:06:14.580> doesn't<00:06:14.640> move

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
landing thing where it just doesn't move

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
and onto the new one also looks a little

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.000 
and onto the new one also looks a little
bit<00:06:18.060> better<00:06:18.210> this<00:06:18.540> observation<00:06:19.170> platform<00:06:19.860> is

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
bit better this observation platform is

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.130 
bit better this observation platform is
also<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.460> location<00:06:20.910> of<00:06:21.090> an<00:06:21.270> Easter<00:06:21.690> Egg<00:06:21.840> which
