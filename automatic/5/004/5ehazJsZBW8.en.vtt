 urania astronomy and astronautics newsletter edited by the institute 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:05.980
 national astrophysicist 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.389
 benritrovati from luca nobili and elena lazzaretto 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.170
 pride of the mass successfully launched from what age canaveral cost 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.539
 $ 600 million kepler satellite intends to find out if there are any skins 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.939
 anites of similar size to ours 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.089
 an ambitious goal that can be achieved within 3 years in the 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.300
 which large telescope mounted on board will have to observe more than 100,000 stars 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.089
 of our galaxy in search of every smallest variation of theirs 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:33.160
 brightness 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.940
 the decrease in brightness of a star. be caused by the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.960
 transit of a small object such as a cristal orbiting planet 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.810
 about 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.310
 keeper and is able to capture very small variations compared to 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.100
 those measured so far by his predecessors 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.930
 for this little 10 saturn a stunned star do not fear small 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.050
 size i rochus type ho 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.560
 this however is not enough to trepidate victory that the planet must be 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.610
 find at an adequate distance from its star so that any water on the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.990
 its surface can remain in the liquid state fundamental condition for it 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.710
 development of life forms as we know them 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.450
 the American telescope will tell us at a distance but not if there is water for these 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.710
 indeed, it will take space telescopes to design and launch them 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.740
 will depend on kettler and what he will find in these three years of research 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.710
 fineco giove has a cannibalistic past 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.130
 according to new studies it seems that its four most famous moons are those 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.360
 also observed from Galilean Galileans 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.030
 some survivors boast about it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.670
 there could be as many as 20 other summer swallowed by the giant planet 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
 when solar system is still in the training phase 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.050
 the researchers came to this conclusion after making a number 6 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.400
 computer simulation starting from some training considerations 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.540
 of these natural satellites when solar system was at the dawn of the very 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.330
 material so to speak advanced by the formation of the planets has influenced 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.930
 gravitationally the stability of the orbits of the Jupiter moons by bringing them to 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.189
 fall on the big planet 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:15.089
 this fact could have been repeated for as many as five generations of them up 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:20.420
 to arrive at the current women I ganimede callisto who formed in 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.749
 a more peaceful moment thus being able to survive 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.129
 a piece of space junk the size of 13 centimeters is 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.430
 dangerously approached the international space station by triggering 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.499
 in a state of emergency 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:40.419
 the NASA ordered the crew formed by two men and a woman to go to 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.759
 shelter on board the soyuz shuttle attached to the station 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.090
 at the speed of eight kilometers per second selectivity he had 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.429
 actually hit would compromise the system of 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:55.539
 pressurization and the crew should have evacuated as soon as possible 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.889
 fortunately the impact did not occur the alarm you had entered life 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.269
 on board eh already back to normal 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.859
 and with this it is all from the editorial staff of urania a good continuation 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.520
 urania vivastreet possible next edition 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.540
