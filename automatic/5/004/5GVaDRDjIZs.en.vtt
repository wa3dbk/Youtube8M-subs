container<00:00:57.840> wagons<00:00:58.320> sort<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> thing<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
container wagons sort of thing with a

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.280 
container wagons sort of thing with a
box<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.350> decorated<00:01:02.129> ventilated<00:01:02.730> band
