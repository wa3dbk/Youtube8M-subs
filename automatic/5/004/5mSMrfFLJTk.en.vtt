00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.940 
make sure technically getting off the
blocks<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.990> getting<00:01:43.229> into<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> water<00:01:43.799> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
blocks and getting into the water is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
blocks and getting into the water is
very<00:01:44.189> sound<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.600> letting<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
very sound and then just letting that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.930 
very sound and then just letting that
speed<00:01:46.440> go<00:01:46.770> from<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> very<00:01:47.340> beginning<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
speed go from the very beginning it

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.160 
speed go from the very beginning it
actually<00:01:48.210> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> feels<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:48.810> separate

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
actually kind of feels like you separate

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.300 
actually kind of feels like you separate
me<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:49.950> much<00:01:50.040> time<00:01:50.250> between

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
me because we have so much time between

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.670 
me because we have so much time between
so<00:01:51.180> after<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.540> hundred<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.560> more

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
so after that hundred was a little more

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.469 
so after that hundred was a little more
physically<00:01:53.040> taxing<00:01:53.130> than<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.759> expected<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> be

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
physically taxing than I expected to be

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.560 
physically taxing than I expected to be
