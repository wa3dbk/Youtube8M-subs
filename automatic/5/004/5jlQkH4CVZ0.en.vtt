00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:16.200
 Today is always Ishihara 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 We introduce Plarail 681 express limited thunderbird this time 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.020
 This is also to say that this Thunderbird what 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 I can do consolidation 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:30.570
 I will open it if I want to run it later by linking 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.910
 What was inside was a plastic train card 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.640
 Instructions 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.350
 Between the surroundings 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.149
 And it's a thunderbird 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.149
 Let's take a closer look 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.320
 It's a good parentheses body made of a beautiful song The first is the top car white 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.570
 It is middle car to continue 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.880
 The last is to copulation person 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.880
 I'm the first car and the mask of large rook is the difference between is also cool 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.040
 Year and month part comes out from here 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.520
 yeah 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:44.719
 Then there is a word greeting to everyone than Limited Express Thunderbird 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.870
 Today I am thunder bird 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.010
 is 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.760
 So I 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.820
 Sambar 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.890
 Say boo 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.340
 N We very rude 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:07.409
 Then I would like to put in Tanaka and let it run 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:12.920
 Thunderbirds are designed to contain AA batteries, so this time too 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.920
 I think that want AA batteries regularly use the adapter 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.980
 Speed has been reworded in two stages 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.270
 That 's right because it's a tricky one 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.270
 I will try to run using the m 'engine 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.930
 Hmm 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.219
 Then make a course and run 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.219
 I will go 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.750
 It 's interesting to let us know using this m 'engine 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:09.100
 You can also make a bag and the speed is much faster than when you use a regular lens 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.100
 you know 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.530
 I think this is an adult addict too 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.700
 I next is a little try to run at the maximum speed 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.260
 This is the fastest 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.129
 This Tokoro with the feeling speed 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.550
 This is fun 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.049
 I will try to run at maximum speed in the bag next 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.670
 Next, let's run by connecting with the 23 series Shinkansen 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:07.240
 How was that 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.480
