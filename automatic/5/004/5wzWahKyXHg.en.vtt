nice way to end your session too it's
important<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.300> keep<00:02:27.390> recession<00:02:27.959> short<00:02:28.290> no

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
important to keep recession short no

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.080 
important to keep recession short no
more<00:02:28.770> than<00:02:28.860> five<00:02:29.100> or<00:02:29.130> ten<00:02:29.400> minutes<00:02:29.430> at<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.880> time

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
more than five or ten minutes at a time

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.580 
more than five or ten minutes at a time
so<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.450> doesn't<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> chance<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.320> become

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
so it doesn't have a chance to become

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.860 
so it doesn't have a chance to become
boring<00:02:31.920> for<00:02:32.190> either<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:35.360> now<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.570> loki

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
boring for either of you now that loki

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.690 
boring for either of you now that loki
is<00:02:36.900> starting<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.410> get<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.650> game<00:02:37.860> i'm<00:02:38.430> making

is starting to get the game i'm making
it<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.090> little<00:02:39.270> harder<00:02:39.920> he's<00:02:40.920> paying<00:02:41.220> attention

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
it a little harder he's paying attention

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
it a little harder he's paying attention
to<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> target<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.840> i'm<00:02:42.989> waiting<00:02:43.350> for<00:02:43.560> a

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
to the target but i'm waiting for a

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.180 
to the target but i'm waiting for a
proper<00:02:44.100> nose<00:02:44.340> touch<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:46.590> never<00:02:46.770> want<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> make

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
proper nose touch you never want to make

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.979 
proper nose touch you never want to make
it<00:02:47.340> too<00:02:47.520> hard<00:02:47.760> though<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.780> aren't

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
it too hard though so if you aren't

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.690 
it too hard though so if you aren't
getting<00:02:49.110> success<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.400> should<00:02:50.580> go

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
getting success with this you should go

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
getting success with this you should go
back<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.940> step<00:02:51.120> your<00:02:51.930> subject<00:02:52.470> should<00:02:52.620> always

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
back a step your subject should always

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:07.320 
back a step your subject should always
be<00:02:53.130> confident<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.760> success

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.300 

you'll<00:03:07.960> also<00:03:08.140> notice<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.650> I'm<00:03:08.920> delivering

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
you'll also notice that I'm delivering

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.800 
you'll also notice that I'm delivering
the<00:03:09.490> truth<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.790> little<00:03:09.940> later<00:03:10.270> than<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.600> was

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
the truth a little later than I was

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.930 
the truth a little later than I was
before<00:03:11.010> once<00:03:12.010> your<00:03:12.160> subject<00:03:12.580> starts<00:03:12.820> to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
before once your subject starts to

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.670 
before once your subject starts to
understand<00:03:13.390> what<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.690> cliq<00:03:13.900> means<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.530> can

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
understand what the cliq means you can

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.680 
understand what the cliq means you can
be<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.830> little<00:03:15.040> slower<00:03:15.370> on<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.700> draw<00:03:15.910> that's

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
be a little slower on the draw that's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.720 
be a little slower on the draw that's
what<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.960> click<00:03:17.140> is<00:03:17.170> for<00:03:20.400> that's<00:03:21.400> not<00:03:21.580> what<00:03:21.640> I

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
what the click is for that's not what I

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:53.960 
what the click is for that's not what I
want<00:03:23.100> what<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.190> want

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.460 

it's<00:03:54.970> okay<00:03:55.360> at<00:03:55.510> this<00:03:55.629> point<00:03:55.930> if<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.200> want<00:03:56.379> to

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's okay at this point if you want to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.979 
it's okay at this point if you want to
introduce<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:57.040> verbal<00:03:57.370> command<00:03:57.730> say<00:03:58.599> it<00:03:58.720> just

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
introduce a verbal command say it just

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.240 
introduce a verbal command say it just
before<00:03:59.110> your<00:03:59.379> subject<00:03:59.830> does<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.129> behavior

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
before your subject does the behavior

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.339 
before your subject does the behavior
and<00:04:00.730> eventually<00:04:01.540> he'll<00:04:01.660> start<00:04:01.900> making<00:04:02.200> that

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
and eventually he'll start making that

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.400 
and eventually he'll start making that
