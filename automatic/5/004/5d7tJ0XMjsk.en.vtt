00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.299
 coiled and zechariah butcher obliged to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.790

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:23.670
 of opportunities the sco is the third 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.280
 best team of the championship to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.509
 outside and hears it prove this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 is not quite the case for the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.090
 moment trust is still there 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.549
 for the sco players a defeat on 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.959
