one is completely completely yes okay so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
one is completely completely yes okay so
they've<00:01:11.729> tested<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> another<00:01:13.080> version

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
they've tested this is another version

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.070 
they've tested this is another version
of<00:01:13.560> tested<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.640> military<00:01:15.420> specification

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of tested this to military specification

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.249 
of tested this to military specification
for<00:01:16.350> water<00:01:16.979> down<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.060> 1.5<00:01:18.630> meters<00:01:18.930> drops

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
for water down to have 1.5 meters drops

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.320 
for water down to have 1.5 meters drops
from<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> meter<00:01:19.820> dust<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.150> sort<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
from the meter dust all that sort of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.390 
from the meter dust all that sort of
stuff<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.710> sort<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.890> guaranteed<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
stuff and so it sort of guaranteed to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730 
stuff and so it sort of guaranteed to
that<00:01:23.549> level<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.500> realistically<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.650> can

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that level but realistically it can

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.140 
that level but realistically it can
handle<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.430> particular<00:01:26.790> phone

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
handle a lot more this particular phone

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.399 
handle a lot more this particular phone
here<00:01:27.479> which<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.750> still<00:01:27.930> working<00:01:28.200> completely

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
here which is still working completely

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350
