in finding the tray size you want for a
given<00:00:30.989> case<00:00:31.259> now<00:00:31.950> when<00:00:32.189> we're<00:00:32.340> dealing<00:00:32.430> with

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
given case now when we're dealing with

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250 
given case now when we're dealing with
an<00:00:32.850> upper<00:00:33.120> arch<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.510> want<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> show<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.989> how<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
an upper arch I want to show you how to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.829 
an upper arch I want to show you how to
simplify<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.950> process<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:36.109> adapting<00:00:37.109> a<00:00:37.589> tray

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
simplify the process of adapting a tray

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.180 
simplify the process of adapting a tray
oftentimes<00:00:39.839> trays<00:00:40.469> don't<00:00:40.769> fit<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.160> perfectly

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
oftentimes trays don't fit so perfectly

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.849 
oftentimes trays don't fit so perfectly
so<00:00:41.910> when<00:00:42.089> we<00:00:42.210> look<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.449> their<00:00:42.660> size<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.679> can

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
so when we look at their size and we can

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.009 
so when we look at their size and we can
see<00:00:44.039> through<00:00:44.429> it<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.390> exactly<00:00:45.719> what

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
see through it we can see exactly what

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.840 
see through it we can see exactly what
we<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.469> readapt<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.370> might<00:00:47.609> need<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
we have to readapt we might need to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
we have to readapt we might need to
oftentimes<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.989> widen<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.829> bit

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
oftentimes just widen out a little bit

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.090 
oftentimes just widen out a little bit
on<00:00:50.159> the<00:00:50.249> distal<00:00:50.760> buccal<00:00:51.359> of<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.929> side<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.920> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
on the distal buccal of one side so in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
on the distal buccal of one side so in
order<00:00:53.249> to<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> make<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> simple<00:00:55.170> for

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
order to do that and make it simple for

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.279 
order to do that and make it simple for
us<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.429> go<00:00:56.550> ahead<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:57.179> our<00:00:57.449> butane

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
us we can go ahead and take our butane

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.630 
us we can go ahead and take our butane
torch

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:15.550 

and<00:01:04.590> we<00:01:05.590> can<00:01:05.770> heat<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.070> tray

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.450 

and<00:01:15.680> using<00:01:16.369> a<00:01:16.670> sergeant<00:01:17.240> players<00:01:18.280> take<00:01:19.280> it

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
and using a sergeant players take it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.240 
and using a sergeant players take it
grab<00:01:20.149> it<00:01:20.329> so<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.290> you're<00:01:21.409> leaving<00:01:21.560> some<00:01:21.920> area

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
grab it so that you're leaving some area

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.830 
grab it so that you're leaving some area
warm<00:01:22.820> it<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:23.000> little<00:01:23.149> bit<00:01:23.329> more<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:25.600> just<00:01:26.600> push

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
warm it a little bit more and just push

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.539 
warm it a little bit more and just push
it<00:01:26.869> down<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.530> push<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.039> out<00:01:29.829> down<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.130> out<00:01:31.280> and

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
it down and push it out down and out and

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.399 
it down and push it out down and out and
basically<00:01:32.479> what<00:01:32.750> you've<00:01:32.899> done<00:01:33.049> is<00:01:33.259> you've

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
basically what you've done is you've

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.580 
basically what you've done is you've
literally<00:01:34.179> flattened<00:01:35.179> it<00:01:35.240> out<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.630> widened

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
literally flattened it out and widened

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.880 
literally flattened it out and widened
it<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:38.390> will<00:01:38.509> better<00:01:38.720> fit<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.229> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
it so that it will better fit the the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.910 
it so that it will better fit the the
model<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:41.479> we<00:01:41.539> check<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.990> again<00:01:42.259> we<00:01:42.619> see<00:01:42.829> if

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
model so now we check it again we see if

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.330 
model so now we check it again we see if
that's<00:01:43.130> doing<00:01:43.460> what<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:43.729> want<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.060> do<00:01:45.340> okay

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
that's doing what we want it to do okay

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.919 
that's doing what we want it to do okay
and<00:01:46.579> we<00:01:46.729> were<00:01:46.880> able<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.329> move<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:47.690> out<00:01:47.869> just

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
and we were able to move that out just

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.710 
and we were able to move that out just
enough<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.709> make<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:48.890> work<00:01:49.100> really<00:01:49.429> nicely

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
enough to make that work really nicely

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.930 
enough to make that work really nicely
so<00:01:50.720> now<00:01:50.899> in<00:01:51.080> addition<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:52.490> could<00:01:52.759> go

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
so now in addition to that we could go

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.679 
so now in addition to that we could go
ahead<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.450> customize<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:55.549> palatal<00:01:56.330> area

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
ahead and customize the palatal area

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.169 
ahead and customize the palatal area
against<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.649> opposing<00:01:58.189> now<00:01:58.700> what<00:01:58.909> can<00:01:59.030> be

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
against the opposing now what can be

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.309 
against the opposing now what can be
really<00:01:59.420> good<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.720> if<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.929> take<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.140> little

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
really good is if you take a little

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.100 
really good is if you take a little
Vaseline<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.340> wipe<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.030> into<00:02:02.330> this<00:02:02.450> area<00:02:02.720> then

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
Vaseline and wipe it into this area then

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.380 
Vaseline and wipe it into this area then
your<00:02:03.229> wax<00:02:03.530> won't<00:02:03.860> stick<00:02:04.220> for<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.849> wax<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.270> we

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.600 

the<00:02:32.569> instant<00:02:32.930> hot<00:02:33.140> really<00:02:33.970> helps<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:36.459> warm<00:02:37.459> it

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
the instant hot really helps to warm it

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:51.340 
the instant hot really helps to warm it
up<00:02:37.670> evenly<00:02:41.290> pretty<00:02:42.290> quickly

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.250 

we<00:02:51.860> place<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.430> on<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:53.480> palatal<00:02:53.870> part<00:02:54.080> of

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
we place that on the palatal part of

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.840 
we place that on the palatal part of
them<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.800> tray<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.310> again<00:02:58.520> this<00:02:58.670> is

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
them of the tray and again this is

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.430 
them of the tray and again this is
something<00:02:59.210> that<00:02:59.240> your<00:02:59.480> dental<00:02:59.810> assistant<00:03:00.260> can

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
something that your dental assistant can

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.000 
something that your dental assistant can
have<00:03:00.590> all<00:03:00.800> had<00:03:01.220> ready<00:03:01.550> for<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.000> before

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
have all had ready for you before

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.400 
have all had ready for you before
patient<00:03:04.010> ever<00:03:04.190> came<00:03:04.490> in<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:08.230> what's<00:03:09.230> nice

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
patient ever came in and what's nice

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.650 
patient ever came in and what's nice
with<00:03:09.740> this<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.790> seat<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.570> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
with this is that you seat this to the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.410 
with this is that you seat this to the
level<00:03:11.990> of<00:03:12.170> clearance<00:03:12.740> that<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.160> want<00:03:13.430> for<00:03:14.300> the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
level of clearance that you want for the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.090 
level of clearance that you want for the
teeth<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:14.870> if<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.020> look<00:03:15.230> through<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.560> let's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
teeth so if you look through that let's

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.460 
teeth so if you look through that let's
get<00:03:16.340> up<00:03:16.460> real<00:03:16.640> close<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:17.210> this<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:18.290> can

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
get up real close on this and you can

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.310 
get up real close on this and you can
see<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.710> there's<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.130> nice<00:03:19.340> clearance

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
see that there's a nice clearance

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.580 
see that there's a nice clearance
throughout<00:03:21.700> okay<00:03:22.900> for<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.020> teeth<00:03:24.200> now<00:03:24.440> if

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
throughout okay for the teeth now if

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.080 
throughout okay for the teeth now if
it's<00:03:24.680> not<00:03:24.860> as<00:03:25.010> much<00:03:25.160> clearance<00:03:25.520> as<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.850> want

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
it's not as much clearance as you want

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.590 
it's not as much clearance as you want
then<00:03:26.810> take<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.710> little<00:03:27.950> more<00:03:28.130> wax<00:03:28.460> small<00:03:29.300> amount

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
then take a little more wax small amount

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:38.220 
then take a little more wax small amount
more<00:03:32.560> just<00:03:33.560> add<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:33.800> little<00:03:33.890> bit<00:03:34.160> back<00:03:34.670> on<00:03:34.880> top

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.040 

push<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.440> back<00:03:40.780> onto<00:03:41.780> there<00:03:42.200> again<00:03:44.020> so<00:03:45.020> that

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
push this back onto there again so that

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.260 
push this back onto there again so that
you<00:03:45.260> have<00:03:45.470> whatever<00:03:45.680> thickness<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.430> clearance

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
you have whatever thickness of clearance

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.780 
you have whatever thickness of clearance
that<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:47.540> want<00:03:47.780> all<00:03:47.960> the<00:03:48.080> way<00:03:48.200> around<00:03:48.730> now<00:03:49.730> you

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
that you want all the way around now you

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.610 
that you want all the way around now you
might<00:03:50.060> have<00:03:50.270> excess<00:03:50.750> coming<00:03:51.080> over<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.380> side

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
might have excess coming over the side

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.850 
might have excess coming over the side
so<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.460> where<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:53.510> need<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.870> take<00:03:54.110> your

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
so this is where you need to take your

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.370 
so this is where you need to take your
bard<00:03:55.130> Parker<00:03:55.550> knife<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:57.880> just<00:03:59.020> take<00:04:00.020> away<00:04:00.260> the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
bard Parker knife and just take away the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.640 
bard Parker knife and just take away the
sides<00:04:04.600> that's<00:04:05.600> really<00:04:05.870> all<00:04:06.080> that<00:04:06.110> we<00:04:06.320> need<00:04:06.530> to

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
sides that's really all that we need to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.760 
sides that's really all that we need to
do<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:07.690> if<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.780> decide<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.260> want<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.650> can

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
do and if you decide you want you can

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.480 
do and if you decide you want you can
take<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.950> little<00:04:10.100> bit<00:04:10.250> off<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.460> back<00:04:10.760> as<00:04:10.970> well

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
take a little bit off the back as well

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.060 
take a little bit off the back as well
and<00:04:14.290> sometimes<00:04:15.290> you<00:04:15.410> can<00:04:15.560> take<00:04:15.710> that<00:04:15.890> little

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
and sometimes you can take that little

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.599 
and sometimes you can take that little
bit<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.280> extra<00:04:16.460> wax<00:04:16.910> that<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.270> had<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:18.609> either

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
put it across the front where the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.620 
put it across the front where the
freedom<00:04:22.220> is<00:04:22.370> because<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:22.820> want<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.090> maybe

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.280 
you're taking an impression of the two
front<00:04:25.850> teeth<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:26.210> you<00:04:26.300> want<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:27.110> two

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
you capture everything going up high

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.280 
you capture everything going up high
enough<00:04:31.330> sometimes<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.570> may<00:04:32.720> find<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:33.110> this
