00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
so I've glued it up and I'm going back

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.839 
so I've glued it up and I'm going back
and<00:00:05.790> kind<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.089> like<00:00:06.859> getting<00:00:07.859> those<00:00:08.069> areas

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
and kind of like getting those areas

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.400 
and kind of like getting those areas
that<00:00:11.450> we're<00:00:12.450> gonna<00:00:12.599> show<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.139> real

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
that we're gonna show you this real

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.269 
that we're gonna show you this real
quick<00:00:14.630> see<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.660> got<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.109> all<00:00:16.350> glued<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.220> you

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
quick see I got it all glued up and you

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.640 
quick see I got it all glued up and you
can<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.609> like<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> wetness<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:19.199> where<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
can see like the wetness is where the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.429 
can see like the wetness is where the
glue<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.460> I'm<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.600> back<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> spots

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
glue is and I'm going back to a spots

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.040 
glue is and I'm going back to a spots
that<00:00:22.560> are<00:00:22.680> really<00:00:22.949> dry<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.640> I'm<00:00:24.480> putting<00:00:24.689> glue

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that are really dry and I'm putting glue

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.550 
that are really dry and I'm putting glue
from<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> outside<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:27.109> this<00:00:28.109> stuff<00:00:28.349> dries

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
from the outside and this stuff dries

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.549 
from the outside and this stuff dries
quick<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.579> might<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.910> really

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
quick so this actually might be a really

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.920 
quick so this actually might be a really
really<00:00:34.559> good<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:36.770> good<00:00:37.770> alternative<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
really good a good alternative to the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.910 
really good a good alternative to the
gorilla<00:00:39.930> glue<00:00:41.750> for<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.899> application<00:00:43.140> myself

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
gorilla glue for this application myself

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
gorilla glue for this application myself
as<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.149> put<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.629> bit

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
as you can see I'm just put a little bit

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.600 
as you can see I'm just put a little bit
on<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:46.020> finger<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.680> back<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.370> lot<00:00:47.579> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
on my finger and I'm going back a lot of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.479 
on my finger and I'm going back a lot of
dots<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.090> look<00:00:48.590> like<00:00:49.590> didn't<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.190> really

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
dots that look like didn't get really

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
dots that look like didn't get really
good<00:00:50.640> coverage<00:00:51.500> mostly<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> edges<00:00:57.800> that's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
good coverage mostly on the edges that's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
good coverage mostly on the edges that's
where<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.489> obviously<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.390> edges

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
where you see and obviously the edges

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.299 
where you see and obviously the edges
aren't<00:01:00.809> strong<00:01:01.109> that's<00:01:01.320> first<00:01:01.949> place<00:01:02.160> they're

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
aren't strong that's first place they're

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:16.570 
aren't strong that's first place they're
gonna<00:01:02.370> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> peel<00:01:02.910> from

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.640 

and<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.450> know<00:01:17.540> don't<00:01:17.750> be<00:01:17.840> afraid<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:18.290> lift<00:01:18.500> up

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
and you know don't be afraid to lift up

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.140 
and you know don't be afraid to lift up
the<00:01:18.770> edge<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.190> squirt<00:01:19.430> a<00:01:19.520> little<00:01:19.550> bit<00:01:19.940> on<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
the edge and squirt a little bit on the

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.010 
the edge and squirt a little bit on the
side<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.570> he<00:01:20.660> thinks<00:01:20.840> not<00:01:22.480> not<00:01:23.480> catching

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
side that he thinks not not catching

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.170 
side that he thinks not not catching
really<00:01:24.320> good<00:01:24.560> because<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.460> lot<00:01:25.790> harder<00:01:26.000> to

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
really good because it's a lot harder to

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:34.290 
really good because it's a lot harder to
repair<00:01:26.450> later<00:01:28.210> better<00:01:29.210> off<00:01:29.420> doing<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.810> now

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.330 

yeah<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:36.530> might<00:01:36.680> suggest<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.190> is<00:01:37.250> a

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
yeah and I might suggest this is a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.030 
yeah and I might suggest this is a
really<00:01:37.640> small<00:01:37.880> boat<00:01:38.120> so<00:01:38.450> if<00:01:38.600> you're<00:01:38.780> gonna<00:01:39.040> are

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
really small boat so if you're gonna are

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.150 
really small boat so if you're gonna are
you<00:01:40.100> doing<00:01:40.370> a<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:41.320> real<00:01:42.320> long<00:01:42.830> though<00:01:45.160> probably

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
you doing a a real long though probably

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.440 
you doing a a real long though probably
gonna<00:01:46.370> wanna<00:01:46.610> buy<00:01:46.760> two<00:01:46.820> tubes<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.330> this

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
gonna wanna buy two tubes of this

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.260 
gonna wanna buy two tubes of this
because<00:01:47.660> I<00:01:47.750> went<00:01:47.960> through<00:01:47.990> almost<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.470> whole

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
because I went through almost the whole

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.140 
because I went through almost the whole
whole<00:01:50.270> tube<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:53.570> Sprint's<00:01:54.020> real<00:01:54.200> nice<00:01:55.150> it's

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
whole tube that Sprint's real nice it's

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:05.430 
whole tube that Sprint's real nice it's
still<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:03.290> we're<00:02:03.440> gonna<00:02:03.530> let<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.890> dry<00:02:04.220> and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
still so we're gonna let this dry and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.470 
still so we're gonna let this dry and
we're<00:02:06.440> gonna<00:02:06.560> come<00:02:06.830> back<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.480> probably

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
we're gonna come back to it probably

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.650 
we're gonna come back to it probably
tomorrow<00:02:09.369> start<00:02:10.369> trimming<00:02:11.120> off<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.480> edges

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
tomorrow start trimming off the edges

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.610 
tomorrow start trimming off the edges
and<00:02:15.820> probably<00:02:16.820> made<00:02:17.660> certain<00:02:18.140> with<00:02:18.380> some<00:02:18.530> of

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
and probably made certain with some of

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.170 
and probably made certain with some of
the<00:02:18.680> same<00:02:18.860> name<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:21.610> one<00:02:22.610> thing<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.880> do<00:02:22.940> like

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the same name so one thing I do like

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.670 
the same name so one thing I do like
about<00:02:23.239> this<00:02:23.570> glue<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.170> doesn't<00:02:24.410> you

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
about this glue is that it doesn't you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.350 
about this glue is that it doesn't you
can<00:02:24.709> rip<00:02:25.070> really<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.900> know<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:27.170> kind<00:02:27.380> of

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
can rip really you know it's kind of

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.479 
can rip really you know it's kind of
it's<00:02:29.360> not<00:02:29.450> usually<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.560> put<00:02:30.709> plastic

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
it's not usually I have to put plastic

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.010 
it's not usually I have to put plastic
down<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.910> stuff<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.270> kind<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> protect<00:02:32.840> my

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
down and stuff to kind of protect my

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.050 
down and stuff to kind of protect my
bench<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:36.400> pretty<00:02:37.400> good<00:02:37.610> hopefully

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
bench but this is pretty good hopefully

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.930 
bench but this is pretty good hopefully
it<00:02:38.360> works<00:02:38.540> out<00:02:38.750> good
