00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
she had to been some kind of ghost

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.400 
she had to been some kind of ghost
because<00:04:01.209> she<00:04:01.420> would<00:04:01.570> not<00:04:01.750> ever<00:04:02.140> have<00:04:02.320> been

born<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:02.830> nineteen<00:04:03.130> eighteen<00:04:03.550> if<00:04:03.700> she's<00:04:03.880> just

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
born in nineteen eighteen if she's just

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.850 
born in nineteen eighteen if she's just
a<00:04:04.090> little<00:04:04.180> girl<00:04:04.300> in<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.540> 1940s<00:04:05.140> so<00:04:05.410> next<00:04:05.560> image

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
a little girl in the 1940s so next image

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.380 
a little girl in the 1940s so next image
these<00:04:06.160> next<00:04:06.340> two<00:04:06.550> images<00:04:06.760> go<00:04:06.970> hand<00:04:07.209> in<00:04:07.300> hand

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
these next two images go hand in hand

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.720 
these next two images go hand in hand
the<00:04:07.810> first<00:04:08.020> one<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.530> group<00:04:08.739> 935<00:04:09.100> symbol

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
the first one is the group 935 symbol

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.390 
the first one is the group 935 symbol
which<00:04:10.090> does<00:04:10.360> mean<00:04:10.600> that<00:04:10.630> group<00:04:10.989> 935<00:04:11.350> was<00:04:12.010> well

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
which does mean that group 935 was well

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.220 
which does mean that group 935 was well
established<00:04:12.580> way<00:04:13.450> before<00:04:13.780> World<00:04:13.989> War<00:04:14.050> two

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
established way before World War two

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.650 
established way before World War two
started<00:04:14.620> which<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:14.920> now<00:04:15.160> in<00:04:15.430> 1918<00:04:16.060> during<00:04:16.480> role

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
started which is now in 1918 during role

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.229 
started which is now in 1918 during role
or<00:04:16.780> one<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.530> group<00:04:18.070> 935<00:04:18.340> originated<00:04:19.120> in

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
or one so that group 935 originated in

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.880 
or one so that group 935 originated in
roller<00:04:19.480> one<00:04:19.720> or<00:04:19.900> prior<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.169> that<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.560> they're

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
roller one or prior to that and they're

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.830 
roller one or prior to that and they're
also<00:04:21.070> experimenting<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:21.940> they<00:04:22.510> were<00:04:22.570> way

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
also experimenting and they were way

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.990 
also experimenting and they were way
ahead<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.200> game<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.620> everyone<00:04:24.160> else<00:04:24.310> if

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
ahead of the game of everyone else if

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.820 
ahead of the game of everyone else if
this<00:04:25.150> was<00:04:25.390> actually<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.780> case<00:04:25.990> in<00:04:26.200> 1918<00:04:26.740> and

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
this was actually the case in 1918 and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.469 
this was actually the case in 1918 and
then<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.310> image<00:04:27.580> right<00:04:27.700> here<00:04:27.760> looks<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.360> be

then this image right here looks to be

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.810 
then this image right here looks to be
the<00:04:28.870> prototype<00:04:29.140> or<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:30.040> may<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.310> extractor

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
the prototype or the may the extractor

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.510 
the prototype or the may the extractor
for<00:04:31.000> 115<00:04:31.479> or<00:04:31.810> you<00:04:32.560> know<00:04:32.650> some<00:04:32.860> kind<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.100> easter

for 115 or you know some kind of easter
egg<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:34.030> will<00:04:34.210> be<00:04:34.300> connected<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.930> these

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
egg this will be connected to these

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.719 
egg this will be connected to these

element all I think in the Rock has a

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.120 
element all I think in the Rock has a
you<00:05:07.240> know<00:05:07.330> some<00:05:07.510> kind<00:05:07.660> of<00:05:07.890> some<00:05:08.890> kind<00:05:09.040> of

you know some kind of some kind of

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.790 
you know some kind of some kind of
special<00:05:09.430> significance<00:05:09.880> because<00:05:10.450> it<00:05:11.140> just

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
special significance because it just

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.860 
special significance because it just
shows<00:05:11.890> rock<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.520> I<00:05:13.120> think<00:05:13.510> that's<00:05:13.630> where<00:05:13.750> they

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
shows rock and I think that's where they

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.750 
shows rock and I think that's where they
first<00:05:14.080> got<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.440> 115<00:05:14.590> was<00:05:15.370> from<00:05:15.520> shi<00:05:15.640> no<00:05:15.729> numa

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
first got the 115 was from shi no numa

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.030 
first got the 115 was from shi no numa
and<00:05:16.180> they<00:05:16.600> came<00:05:16.780> here<00:05:17.050> so<00:05:17.410> it<00:05:17.560> must<00:05:17.770> mean<00:05:18.010> that

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
and they came here so it must mean that

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.060 
and they came here so it must mean that
she<00:05:18.520> no<00:05:18.610> numa<00:05:18.850> was<00:05:19.270> way<00:05:19.570> before<00:05:19.800> World<00:05:20.800> War<00:05:20.860> two

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
she no numa was way before World War two

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.590 
she no numa was way before World War two
and<00:05:21.100> then<00:05:21.340> they<00:05:21.430> revisited<00:05:21.940> in<00:05:22.120> World<00:05:22.450> War<00:05:22.510> two

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
and then they revisited in World War two

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.110 
and then they revisited in World War two
this<00:05:23.260> next<00:05:23.500> image<00:05:23.800> i<00:05:23.950> believe<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.490> the<00:05:24.849> device

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
this next image i believe is the device

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.240 
this next image i believe is the device
we<00:05:25.419> see<00:05:25.630> in<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:25.870> our<00:05:26.050> trailers<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.620> it's<00:05:27.039> kind

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
we see in the our trailers of it's kind

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.640 
we see in the our trailers of it's kind
of<00:05:27.340> like<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.520> spinning<00:05:27.880> orb<00:05:28.150> it's<00:05:28.419> kind<00:05:29.260> of<00:05:29.349> a

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
of like a spinning orb it's kind of a

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.930 
of like a spinning orb it's kind of a
purple<00:05:29.830> in<00:05:29.919> color<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.220> looks<00:05:30.490> like<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.729> Tesla

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
purple in color and looks like a Tesla

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.450 
purple in color and looks like a Tesla
coil<00:05:31.210> spinning<00:05:31.660> like<00:05:32.020> electricity<00:05:32.380> I<00:05:32.740> think

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
coil spinning like electricity I think

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.800 
coil spinning like electricity I think
this<00:05:33.580> is<00:05:33.699> what<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:33.970> device<00:05:34.210> is<00:05:34.479> and<00:05:34.660> this<00:05:34.750> is

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
this is what the device is and this is

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.710 
this is what the device is and this is
how<00:05:35.020> we're<00:05:35.169> going<00:05:35.259> to<00:05:35.320> power<00:05:35.530> on<00:05:35.830> that<00:05:36.400> rod<00:05:37.360> or

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
how we're going to power on that rod or

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.969 
how we're going to power on that rod or
that<00:05:37.840> whatever<00:05:38.350> you<00:05:38.410> guys<00:05:38.500> want<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.740> call<00:05:38.860> that

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
that whatever you guys want to call that

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.439 
that whatever you guys want to call that
thing<00:05:39.190> and<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.610> think<00:05:39.880> this<00:05:40.060> thing<00:05:40.270> right<00:05:40.419> here

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
thing and I think this thing right here

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.600 
thing and I think this thing right here
is<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.840> main<00:05:41.350> part<00:05:41.620> of<00:05:41.650> easter<00:05:41.949> egg<00:05:42.039> this<00:05:42.430> will

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
is the main part of easter egg this will

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.580 
is the main part of easter egg this will
be<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:42.759> tower<00:05:42.970> in<00:05:43.419> quotations<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.410> tower

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
be the tower in quotations the tower

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.490 
be the tower in quotations the tower
that<00:05:45.160> will<00:05:45.310> we<00:05:45.550> will<00:05:45.850> need<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.030> power<00:05:46.419> to<00:05:47.380> do

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
that will we will need to power to do

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.800 
that will we will need to power to do
the<00:05:47.590> easter<00:05:47.860> egg<00:05:47.949> and<00:05:48.160> I<00:05:48.880> think<00:05:49.210> I<00:05:49.509> know<00:05:49.570> now
