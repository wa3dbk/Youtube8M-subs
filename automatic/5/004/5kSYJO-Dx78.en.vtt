00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.770
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.080
 vacation so that's it's the end of 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.320
 the summer so I resume my tutorial 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.300
 tips and videos 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.200
 so today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.739
 two windows tips compared to the menu 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.770
 start 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.000
 ie at the taskbar so 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.140
 the first is to open a program 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.870
 on my program I remind you that 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.129
 these tips we go the skin a 2.7 after 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.980
 the other versions of windows vista 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.780
 windows xp it's not too good at last 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.320
 at least for those here you go 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.320
 open for example firefox on click 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.479
 here you have your page laugh fox 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.490
 imagine that you have this site 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.860
 so we know very well that it can be 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.670
 firefox or for example word outlook 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 or not or for example documents 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.080
 because with firefox just make a 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.869
 new tab or new window like 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.840
 this is the thing I'm going to do 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.680
 to learn is to open firefox but 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.360
 a second time 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.310
 we mean that there is a 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.070
 nikon from above so in principle we 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.049
 must click on the icon here we click 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.979
 for example and no ben there actually it's okay 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.210
 you open the window that currently 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.780
 firefox actually but it's still the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.450
 same window 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.590
 so in principle you should do either 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.060
 new window but if it's another 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.700
 program makes you that he drinks in 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.170
 principle and open in a new 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.219
 window where you simply click on 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.130
 mozilla firefox word microsoft word 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:05.060
 so here's to avoid this he 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.539
 there is everything you do 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.880
 you press the shift key or 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.220
 the shift key if you prefer 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.100
 and you hover your mouse over the icon 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.360
 and you click and here we go 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.910
 launch a second firefox 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.460
 here you can see both pages 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.890
 so here it was the first tip 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.319
 then we close every second tip 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.540
 it's opening a program without touching 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.150
 the mouse so I promise you I touch 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.670
 no mouse so that you to 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.370
 ap the mans click on windows on your 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.250
 keyboard and you see you had number 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.480
 here look at you have numbers so 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.580
 here it is 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.810
 the taskbar there is the icon 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.450
 number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and so on 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 so you 're doing windows and with 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.080
 keys but not the numeric keypad 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.209
 not the numeric keypad 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.209
 m you go above the letters you 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.090
 have numbers and you click 1 2 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.780
 3 4 with for example i'm going to open fire 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.970
 once I count 1 2 3 4 5 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.940
 this is the sixth I go to the top 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.329
 letters and I spot natixis and I do 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.950
 windows + 6 and so that's it 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.180
 firefox will open without me 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.220
 touched the mouse so that was it 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.470
 a little trick of sketchup 0 1 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.079
 I hope you enjoyed it there 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.819
 will have others afterwards and if you in 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.299
