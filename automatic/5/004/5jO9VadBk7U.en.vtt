00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:10.160
 this one or if you will now know the most common treadmill tests 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.660
 bush of the market and also the innovations in analysis of movement 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.320
 This test is very simple. 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.710
 you only need a basin with water on a sheet of brown paper the newspaper is enough 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.009
 wet his foot and then venting it 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.539
 compare your car's performance with these three figures 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.300
 luppa 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.880
 if you get almost the entire footprint is because it has annual impact 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.650
 rock and tendencies to be a glider without seeing the heel via macÃªdo pt has 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.830
 to be calm and inclined to climb the table 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.260
 and if you can see the necessity of the landmark, it has to be normal and at first 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.460
 could use any kind of benefit 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.830
 three months is why you step on a scanner here with a camera and a laser 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.600
 in the vein of the soles of your chest 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.880
 this test 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.619
 check the points of greatest pressure because your foot does when standing 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.310
 some tests combine 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.250
 an extranet is a static analysis in a second moving step 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.310
 markers are positioned on one of the legs the person walks barefoot in the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.980
 running machine 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.880
 and a camera films the movements 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.640
 a physiotherapist select with image 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 This is due to the skipping of the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.530
 This evaluation analyzes the pressure points on the sole of the foot during 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.190
 piece 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.390
 this type of test can be static with the day 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.310
 still this afternoon the athlete stands on a platform with sensors 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.440
 is usually done in two steps. 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.289
 in the first the platform is in the middle of a room 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.700
 is the athlete walks barefoot from side to side thinking about this platform 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.770
 in the middle of the way in the second a family with 980 sensors is placed 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.889
 inside sicc shoes 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.319
 the mayor 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.069
 and the athlete walks and then running in September on a screen the professional 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.649
 assess the points of greatest price pressure during the movement 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.649
 all this 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:40.499
 After this clinical examination, the athlete was still in 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:41.129
 September 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.180
 a camera films the movements they are analyzed four blocks by one 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.180
 orthopedist or physiotherapist 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.819
 of these animals and complete the movements of the body made in the laboratory 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.149
 besides the pole the pole also creates both strong dynamic statics and 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.849
 physiotherapist put markers with reflective material 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.249
 in the patient's body it occurs on the treadmill 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.639
 then four infrared cameras 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.249
 faithful not these markers and builds on a three-dimensional skeleton of the 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.239
 patient on a big screen had noticed at the time by the physical therapist 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.879
 have 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.850
 on strike the usp geophysics laboratory 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.040
 led by the physical duarte duarte will count on a technology of 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.810
 the sports hall already has eight super-high-speed cameras, these software 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.829
 analysis will be placed 25 kills on the body of the athlete this 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.819
 images was projected onto a screen in front of you 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.979
 he will be able to see even the nation also illustrative graphics and 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:53.749
 like this 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.700
 correct real-time movements
