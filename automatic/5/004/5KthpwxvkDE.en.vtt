00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:18.990
 classic or let's see how you're at the bank 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.400
 most of all we can't 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.410
 all there only the madonnas the well 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.180
 right place 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 fear all the classic episodes of the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.250
 lord of tolls would also become 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.250
 you 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.589
 beautiful all the guys here also 97 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.269
 of the mines hatches by itself welcome in 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.030
 this new class episode 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.980
 recommended and this today we are here with 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.239
 another assault rifle this time 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.049
 another voice of the seed assault 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.100
 automatic ie the slot 556 556 as 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.899
 favorite 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.030
 start immediately illustrate the wild cards 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.949
 who was using the first era 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.140
 greed specialty one that allows you 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.140
 to have a second kung for yours 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.179
 class and the second wild card instead was 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.310
 track the primary gunslinger there 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:13.069
 It allows you to have an accessory more 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.530
 to your primary weapon or three 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.479
 transfers in total start immediately at 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.800
 just the first layer of accessories 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.229
 was the kick is adjustable that you 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.149
 allows when you turn to move the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.850
 aim faster especially with i 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.470
 assault rifles and really very useful 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.509
 fundamental passing it to the second 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.069
 the fundamental accessory is the 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.069
 fire selector that allows you to 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:36.319
 change focus mode from 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.360
 full auto semiautomatic as auto 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.979
 in the previous episode finally as 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.259
 last accessories I used the viewfinder 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.000
 laser though you can also replace it 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.830
 with silencer for at least one network 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.050
 really very useful because it allows you 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.830
 when dignity aimed for precision 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.929
 greater 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.899
 this is really fundamental for this 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.580
 different voice high and I recommend it 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.830
 instead of the silencer to reducing from 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.179
 take the damage of gods to the weapon 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.310
 bullets distance was 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.810
 lower then I urge you will use 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.979
 precisely the laser sight instead of 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.899
 silencer 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.030
 let's now turn to specialties 1 the first 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.280
 it was anti-splinter that allows you to have 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.319
 greater resistance to explosives 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.090
 enemies like bouncing bats grenades 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.519
 that there are really many and of 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.680
 fundamental importance as a second 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.379
 apparently I used phantom there 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.090
 allows you to be immune to waves 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.930
 enemies only when you are in 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.300
 moving from specialty two 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.099
 the green and jackal that allows you 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.290
 when you kill an enemy he alarms s 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.879
 will release a blue sachet through the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.010
 which you go on you can 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.720
 restore your ammunition is 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.060
 really very useful for this type of 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.260
 weapon because it has a fire rat one 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.269
 time the mind of the selector 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.879
 high enough so it really wastes 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.069
 many shots going from 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.659
 specialty 3 and dexterity that how 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.760
 reiterated earlier and in the old 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.920
 episodes for assault rifles there 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.959
 I consider it fundamental because life there 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.069
 possibility after the race to imitate more 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.780
 quickly and is of vital importance 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.840
 so this guys just the slot 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.540
 556 medieval also asked a friend of mine 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.459
 of psn and so I decided to do 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.129
 this episode the match was 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.409
 played a few days ago during the week 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.209
 end it was a lot really 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.159
 busy because they entered one 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.379
 game just started I was playing or 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.940
 if a modality that I propose a lot on 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.420
 my channel this is the first time over 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.840
 location is really a lot mode 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.620
 beautiful and very funny and I urge you to 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.620
 try 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.120
 now moving on to considerations 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.340
 final on this weapon I think yes 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.900
 really very strong norm especially if 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.129
 use the fire selector that you 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.010
 I consider it to be of vital importance 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.629
 as reiterated above, I urge you 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.459
 use it for what a black that of fire 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.359
 really very high and really worth it 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.829
 punishment 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.389
 try from first without the 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.269
 silencer you will see the damage it has 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.590
 see also from these video clips 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.540
 of those gameplay that it really is 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.910
 a very strong weapon indeed a bond 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.260
 they used my usual tactics 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.810
 which it uses in almost all my 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.730
 gameplay or to run around the perimeter 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.150
 go around the perimeter of the map 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.220
 making sure my enemies don't see me 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.590
 never take this technique behind 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.750
 really very useful against I also had 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.239
 of enemies strong enough indeed in 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.829
 a variety of situations out of a 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.510
 escape apple and I'm not dead 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.400
 fortunately also with that pinch of 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.889
 luck that goes there I illustrate the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.110
 rewards that the first one is using 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.060
 it is of course from the vital disaster that 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.970
 really very useful because it allows you 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.440
 to identify the exact location of the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.120
 enemies every thousandth of a second is 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.430
 really fundamental 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.800
 passing to the second reward are i 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.380
 k9 unit dogs he has always used 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.820
 coupled with the third reward 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.870
 higher than the game or the swarm that 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.909
 I'm really 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.639
 using these enema you can 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.199
 do even a hundred more 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.210
 that if unfortunately in this field it is 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.009
 the game had already started and therefore not 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.930
 I had time to continue with mine 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.800
 kill, however, managed to conclude 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.300
 with a good draco is a good result 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.370
 however the finished gameplay I hope is there 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.430
 liked this other class episodes 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.229
 recommended themes and other comments 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.900
 weapons with which I can make you an episode if 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.189
 you need it 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.039
 one of you never asked the sniper petrÃ² 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.990
 to do it in the future with with a sniper 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.479
 which I think is strong enough 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.650
 usable at least and hopes 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.539
 anyway this gump and you enjoyed it 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.029
 you see the next one a structure 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.029
