Southern California you really lose
track<00:01:43.790> of<00:01:43.940> time<00:01:44.180> because<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:44.900> somewhat<00:01:45.410> of

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
track of time because it is somewhat of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.830 
track of time because it is somewhat of
a<00:01:45.590> seasonless<00:01:46.160> environment<00:01:47.030> where<00:01:47.690> it's

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
a seasonless environment where it's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.870 
a seasonless environment where it's
pretty<00:01:48.020> much<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.500> Sun<00:01:48.740> shines<00:01:49.100> most<00:01:49.460> of<00:01:49.760> the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
pretty much the Sun shines most of the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.910 
pretty much the Sun shines most of the
time<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:50.930> know<00:01:51.110> there's<00:01:51.470> not<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.650> really

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
time so you know there's not a really

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.440 
time so you know there's not a really
tremendous<00:01:52.310> amount<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.790> difference<00:01:53.270> whether

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
tremendous amount of difference whether

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.230 
tremendous amount of difference whether
you<00:01:53.600> go<00:01:53.720> for<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:53.990> drive<00:01:54.020> in<00:01:54.290> February<00:01:55.250> or<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:56.090> go
