00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:04.610
 a pity that this pace is class and meets congratulations but you will be ahead too 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.650
 I have been thinking a couple of times about the film 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.130
 we started statements 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.869
 l first offside in taste 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.410
 and then equal and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.619
 who was a victory after this 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.630
 where is this going 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.130
 pacton sport 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.220
 there is a second one in some countries 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.820
 yes, but still something between a great rescue for you 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.810
 half an hour that is striking who was that kakÃ¡ I think the window thickness here 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.890
 what else of stole in the past two pieces 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.480
 yes that has been thinking about it but good it is nice for the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.930
 you stand in front and trough 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.729
 which is actually remarkable that the same team is coming back 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:40.870
 and also completely different plays what's in the quiet stock market 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.250
 after these are remnants of a couple that actually played some cityscapes 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.010
 not what we were good at in his own country and the two still have that 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.930
 done and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.360
 how much is the team going to win a team 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.940
 surprised you too 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.540
 goal I think that the top engine is very high when it is lifted 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.440
 it is at the same time working hard again, and we want to win that too 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 anyway we are no longer outside 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.710
 Hereby were also not why but you can see that someone or a team 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.950
 so athletes can pick up again 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.360
 yes indeed a succeeded with that ball that where you got it wrong 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.740
 it's a good thing that now we have our country to live 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.550
 was on our side today 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.640
 freire mike to second hand 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.980
 like a happy man 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.040
 the project was after adoboli say what you lean 2 11 on like again 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.940
 not quite 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.240
 no but they have not really been dangerous the stock markets again 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 chances had stable situation sometimes were what that is annoying 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.410
 which I am all well off 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.640
 so we are that where after the two in he made three in the fourth and must 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.770
 to make 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.010
 we do nothing with it 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.600
 the feeling that it is for the summer can be here 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.350
 yes we certainly have that feeling because we are there we know we are playing five 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.740
 we five injured 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.380
 with a day of reflection and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.690
 they have the mission busy with sam 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.930
 we are on track 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.400
 what can be ordered mission is just becoming quite popular 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.000
 for profit but that apparently it is not the glare but then it is 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.140
 wrong
