00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 and and and and qq plus fine 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.949
 Beauty face, you passed the exam. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.050
 among the increases also had a certain 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 until he kind of survived and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.449
 came back a few times from the dead 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.920
 then faced the champion only herd 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.529
 past the French 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.940
 the dollar falls, how do these two 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.469
 confrontations with the body for people like 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.030
 You 'll feel how you felt. 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.829
 while actually just the first 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.739
 doctor know that as soon as I needed 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.300
 everything much more than a thing much more 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.460
 technical and much more aggressive 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.180
 end of normal because he was very 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.980
 then you need to do if it is the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.000
 very strong personality in him to take 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.000
 the comfort zone 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.400
 the promise is very diverse interpreted 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.010
 very little 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.420
 I felt very comfortable net and 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.970
 especially after dinner 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.299
 could take advantage 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.570
 I started well what three or four 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.619
 men and had to make the bid 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.530
 bass but then luck helped too 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.979
 to the beach had an all in there that was 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.820
 to kill he was almost dead and 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:39.780
 that was to kill who was the 4 4 1 3 2 mas 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.560
 then two beliefs that they held and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.270
 ended up winning 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.979
 according to the doctor is a little more 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.940
 complicated because I knew he wanted to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.670
 one player 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.690
 essentially aggressive 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.960
 to free the family is at the end of 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.679
 exercise my team and esthetics at last 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.069
 so thank God everything worked out 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:09.220
 hands to lopes won practically 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.790
 everyone is trying to get on board 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.790
 to fold 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.760
 in the end we ended up giving luck where 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.379
 It was almost 40 more each would 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:30.349
 end up voting with the game in the city 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:32.180
 would it be if he took the trophy out of a hand 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.230
 against the military control of the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.739
 first interesting match is the board is 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.440
 4 5 7 8 and 10 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.420
 It was a game so forward 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.640
 if you remember then all the stars 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.459
 then what was the best situation but recalls 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.410
 that in the book he makes a ball 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:57.880
 which is not very high 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:01.430
 in fact this mother gave her the name 4 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.950
 I do not have position this hand and I think 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.880
 he put it on I got there I let it 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.620
 with ours in the first two inscribed 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.069
 in this blog, right? 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:21.319
 had a flush draw in focus and the second 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:24.130
 was general fines on the river released and 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:28.400
 ever the value I knew not to 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.540
 I was happy, I'm following two 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.540
 stars will I have one 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.330
 reasonably well in hand would know the 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.310
 maximum value there really spoke 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.290
 felipe france died I stop a bluff 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.300
 thankfully he founded for it in 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.600
 door after kissing dead there and stayed 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.790
 well it's made very good because 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.460
 It gets really interesting to me later. 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.180
 ended up coming back from the game he sent to 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.850
 House 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.550
 and then when finally now with the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.720
 strategy how are you going that I 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.180
 I think only export it think 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.390
 it will be good to give 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.480
 looked at some videos were remember 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.700
 He has a lot of video of him. 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.989
 I can flop 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.380
 he is a fantastic player he does not have the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.380
 that talk about him 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.860
 already won everything he had to win 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.340
 money will leave a little bit 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.460
 brazilians nÃ© ii 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.530
 but I have as I watch a lot 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.750
 I watched all episodes of high 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.910
 stakes poker 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.780
 are days selling well saw piles and then 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.540
 I know his standards very well. 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.960
 logical that the player of this level is very 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.940
 Difficult to face but I already have more or 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.770
 one line less an idea of â€‹â€‹how it 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.220
 I think something I had not with the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.320
 two other players have to sit down and 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.570
 play with your hands to catch with the 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.889
 characteristics of the man from the field 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:13.660
 especially this year and the French 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.889
 tired of recession in 2012 so a 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.200
 each one has its own style 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.610
 only the defendant that I know I have a 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.570
 that advantage because he 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:28.130
 I know him well for sure. 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:31.760
 he does not know this is a good side to 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.250
 people are catching you, fair still has 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.820
 sure that it will end professional 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.800
 who is an excellent player though an ace 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:44.720
 neighborhood will seek information that 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.190
 decided to look for today but up 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.229
 It is a pleasure for others to 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.300
 people know the business is to be sure 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.250
 good luck, we're in the crowd hope 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.289
 Tomorrow is a good day for you and for you. 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.500
 every year in Brazil just send one 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:00.020
 kiss for the signed girlfriend charging 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.570
 Amateur and sprain shot there that denies 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.710
 design gui beauty cross twist 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:09.650
 Brazilian with the beautiful bunch facebook 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.900
 are things I kept thinking and 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:20.620
 these days I would be happier if 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.620
 won the bracelet today 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.860
 the player does not want to disappoint anyone 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.540
 cheering for him at last seems to be 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.970
 taking for who was playing that 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.520
 I arrived at 1 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.320
 If you want to see it lose and with the fans 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.730
 Brazilian in June, everyone leaves. 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.250
 doing party 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.730
 we got ahead like this I think 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.380
 It's worth the crowd the personal torch crowd 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.900
 who else fills the bag of his lemons 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.240
 movies have died of envy said zhou 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.400
 time in Brazil is an asshole 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.190
 drawing was on the other doctor there with 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.210
 francisco I faced French is also 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.260
 douchebag 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:03.460
 but whatever saying is not now it is in 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:07.830
 average of 80 Brazilian knows not beat 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:10.870

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.330
