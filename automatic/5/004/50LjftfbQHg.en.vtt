00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
nose but with a clicker it really lets

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.220 
nose but with a clicker it really lets
you<00:02:27.430> pinpoint<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.150> behavior<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.810> it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
you pinpoint the behavior and it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.870 
you pinpoint the behavior and it
improves<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.709> timing<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.489> dog<00:02:30.670> knows

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
improves the timing and the dog knows

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.790 
improves the timing and the dog knows
that<00:02:31.060> he's<00:02:31.180> getting<00:02:31.300> rewarded<00:02:31.900> for<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> right

that he's getting rewarded for the right
behavior<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.820> that's<00:02:33.940> why<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> clicker<00:02:34.390> could

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
behavior so that's why a clicker could

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.840
