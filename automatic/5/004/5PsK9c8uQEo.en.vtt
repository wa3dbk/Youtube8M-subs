exactly<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> best<00:01:15.479> unit<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> game<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
exactly the best unit in the game to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.249 
exactly the best unit in the game to
take<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.100> buildings<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> Nexus<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.049> going

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
take out buildings so the Nexus is going

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.660 
take out buildings so the Nexus is going
to<00:01:19.350> complete<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:19.920> assume<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.430> they're

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
to complete we can assume that they're

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
to complete we can assume that they're
gonna<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.119> probes<00:01:21.360> transferred<00:01:21.900> there

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
gonna be some probes transferred there

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.219 
gonna be some probes transferred there
momentarily<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.900> think<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:24.990> game<00:01:25.170> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
momentarily and I think this game is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.649 
momentarily and I think this game is
even<00:01:25.710> back<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.159> at<00:01:26.400> least<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> degree<00:01:26.759> yeah

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
even back out at least to a degree yeah

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.179 
even back out at least to a degree yeah
you<00:01:27.720> know<00:01:27.900> there's<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> ton<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> high<00:01:28.799> templars

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you know there's a ton of high templars

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.649 
you know there's a ton of high templars

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
out he's also cutting off the location

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.010 
out he's also cutting off the location
to<00:04:32.070> where<00:04:32.160> other<00:04:32.430> factories<00:04:33.060> would<00:04:33.540> reinforce

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
to where other factories would reinforce

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.610 
to where other factories would reinforce
that<00:04:34.470> bottom<00:04:35.070> left<00:04:35.310> base<00:04:35.580> yeah<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:37.260> we<00:04:37.440> see

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
that bottom left base yeah I and we see

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.020 
that bottom left base yeah I and we see
that<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.860> know<00:04:37.950> he's<00:04:38.160> he's<00:04:38.340> clearing<00:04:38.910> out

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
that you know he's he's clearing out

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.490 
that you know he's he's clearing out
spider<00:04:39.360> mines<00:04:39.540> right<00:04:39.720> now<00:04:39.840> which<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.260> good

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
spider mines right now which is a good

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.650 
spider mines right now which is a good
idea<00:04:40.530> because<00:04:40.979> having<00:04:41.880> spider<00:04:42.180> mines<00:04:42.330> on<00:04:42.570> the

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
idea because having spider mines on the

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.300 
idea because having spider mines on the
map<00:04:42.840> even<00:04:43.229> if<00:04:43.350> Protoss<00:04:43.620> is<00:04:43.800> not<00:04:43.979> going<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.190> run

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
map even if Protoss is not going to run

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.520 
map even if Protoss is not going to run
into<00:04:44.430> them<00:04:44.669> gives<00:04:45.210> Terran<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.900> wealth<00:04:46.320> of

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
into them gives Terran a wealth of

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.900 
into them gives Terran a wealth of
information<00:04:46.650> he<00:04:47.190> knows<00:04:47.370> where<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.610> robust

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
information he knows where the robust

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.630 
information he knows where the robust
units<00:04:48.210> are<00:04:48.390> not<00:04:48.750> located<00:04:49.260> right<00:04:49.890> as<00:04:50.130> terran

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
units are not located right as terran

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.909 
units are not located right as terran
always<00:04:50.940> has<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.150> watch<00:04:51.300> his<00:04:51.330> flanks<00:04:51.930> he<00:04:52.410> wants

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
always has to watch his flanks he wants

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.440 
always has to watch his flanks he wants
to<00:04:53.010> know<00:04:53.070> exactly<00:04:53.610> where<00:04:53.850> armies<00:04:54.090> are<00:04:54.270> at<00:04:54.360> all

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
to know exactly where armies are at all

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.750 
to know exactly where armies are at all
times<00:04:54.720> because<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.380> positioning<00:04:56.039> of<00:04:56.160> his

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
times because the positioning of his

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.360 
times because the positioning of his
units<00:04:57.120> together<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.690> just<00:04:58.050> crucial<00:04:58.680> yeah<00:04:59.190> it's

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
units together is just crucial yeah it's

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.130 
units together is just crucial yeah it's
absolutely<00:04:59.940> critical<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.479> here's<00:05:00.960> what<00:05:01.080> I

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
absolutely critical and here's what I

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.450 
absolutely critical and here's what I
think<00:05:01.200> we<00:05:01.410> needed<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.740> see<00:05:01.919> earlier<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.280> don't

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
think we needed to see earlier I don't

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.860 
think we needed to see earlier I don't
know<00:05:02.520> if<00:05:02.610> we<00:05:02.700> just<00:05:02.880> missed<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.240> storm<00:05:03.479> drop<00:05:03.690> or

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
know if we just missed a storm drop or

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.279 
know if we just missed a storm drop or
not<00:05:04.020> but<00:05:04.200> there's<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.410> shuttle<00:05:04.620> moving<00:05:05.010> back<00:05:05.190> um

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
not but there's a shuttle moving back um

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.840 
not but there's a shuttle moving back um
towards<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.440> towards<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.950> Protoss<00:05:08.340> basic

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
towards the towards the Protoss basic

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.070 
towards the towards the Protoss basic
could<00:05:09.000> have<00:05:09.090> had<00:05:09.210> Templars<00:05:09.630> in<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.840> but<00:05:09.960> at

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
could have had Templars in it but at

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.300 
could have had Templars in it but at
least<00:05:10.169> we<00:05:10.350> know<00:05:10.440> he's<00:05:10.590> playing<00:05:10.890> it<00:05:11.010> out<00:05:11.130> right

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
least we know he's playing it out right

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.570 
least we know he's playing it out right
um<00:05:12.350> because<00:05:13.350> that's<00:05:13.680> what<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.950> Protoss<00:05:14.400> needs

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
um because that's what a Protoss needs

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.790 
um because that's what a Protoss needs
to<00:05:14.640> do<00:05:14.729> is<00:05:14.850> just<00:05:14.880> start<00:05:15.210> harassing<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:16.260> SCV

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
to do is just start harassing the SCV

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.270 
to do is just start harassing the SCV

them out and remember in a phase like

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.029 
them out and remember in a phase like
this<00:05:30.479> in<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.690> game<00:05:30.900> it's<00:05:31.200> not<00:05:31.410> like<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:31.830> have

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
this in the game it's not like you have

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.800 
this in the game it's not like you have
a<00:05:32.070> lot<00:05:32.340> of<00:05:32.400> units<00:05:32.820> it's<00:05:33.030> not<00:05:33.210> looking<00:05:33.510> at<00:05:33.630> to

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
a lot of units it's not looking at to

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.260 
a lot of units it's not looking at to
dropship<00:05:34.320> stasis<00:05:34.830> went<00:05:35.250> erin<00:05:35.550> was<00:05:35.610> at<00:05:35.760> 140

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
dropship stasis went erin was at 140

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.240 
dropship stasis went erin was at 140
food<00:05:36.570> and<00:05:36.780> hey<00:05:37.110> maybe<00:05:37.289> Protoss<00:05:37.770> is<00:05:37.919> gonna<00:05:38.070> make

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
food and hey maybe Protoss is gonna make

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.219 
food and hey maybe Protoss is gonna make
a<00:05:38.280> mistake<00:05:38.669> I'm<00:05:39.120> betting<00:05:39.570> these<00:05:39.690> guys<00:05:39.900> have

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
a mistake I'm betting these guys have

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:41.640 
a mistake I'm betting these guys have
maybe<00:05:40.950> even

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
maybe even

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.499 
maybe even
I<00:05:41.710> may<00:05:42.040> be<00:05:42.070> around<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.550> hundred<00:05:42.699> food<00:05:43.090> maybe<00:05:43.360> I

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
I may be around a hundred food maybe I

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.450 
I may be around a hundred food maybe I
