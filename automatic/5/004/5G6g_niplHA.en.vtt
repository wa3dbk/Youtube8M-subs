there's nothing like to special about
the<00:02:47.190> brush<00:02:47.430> or<00:02:47.610> anything<00:02:47.820> like<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.870> it's

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the brush or anything like that but it's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.920 
the brush or anything like that but it's
definitely<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.700> normal<00:02:51.270> brush<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.690> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
definitely like a normal brush but I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.140 
definitely like a normal brush but I
don't<00:02:52.320> know<00:02:52.380> what<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.710> is<00:02:52.830> honestly<00:02:53.490> it's<00:02:53.850> just

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.980 
don't know what it is honestly it's just
a<00:02:54.270> good<00:02:54.510> formula<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.380> guess<00:02:55.470> because<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:57.870> just

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
a good formula I guess because it just

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.480 
a good formula I guess because it just
really<00:02:58.260> works<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:58.560> well<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.070> really

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
really works really well and it's really

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.430 
really works really well and it's really
good<00:02:59.640> volume<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.360> if<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.020> haven't<00:03:01.140> tried<00:03:01.290> this
