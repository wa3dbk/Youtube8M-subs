I<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:48.960> they're<00:01:49.079> stupid<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.530> draft<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
I just think they're stupid the draft to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.889 
I just think they're stupid the draft to
like<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:51.030> could<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.240> dropped<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.600> really

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
like they could have dropped a really

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.870 
like they could have dropped a really
good<00:01:52.020> defenseman<00:01:52.560> Morgan<00:01:52.950> ride<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.790> bit

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880

good defenseman Morgan ride a little bit
Morgan<00:01:54.240> Rielly<00:01:54.390> or<00:01:54.659> Ryan<00:01:54.899> Murray<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.799> they

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
Morgan Rielly or Ryan Murray but they

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.270 
Morgan Rielly or Ryan Murray but they
decided<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.579> go<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.729> Yakupov<00:01:57.270> let's<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.689> here

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.630 
but yeah I think they could have got
some<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.530> good<00:02:07.680> defenseman<00:02:08.220> those<00:02:08.369> two
