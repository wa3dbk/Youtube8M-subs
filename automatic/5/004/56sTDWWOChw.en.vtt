00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you can reconfigure this space anytime

you can reconfigure this space anytime
you<00:01:43.920> want<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
hotel I love it I just like the way the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.429 
hotel I love it I just like the way the
office<00:01:47.670> isn't<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.270> yeah<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.720> moved<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.320> up

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
office isn't here yeah you moved it up

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
office isn't here yeah you moved it up
there<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.460> well<00:01:51.030> but

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
there and that's right well but

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
there and that's right well but
obviously<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> big<00:01:52.320> device<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:52.979> was

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
obviously the big device for that was

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.460 
obviously the big device for that was
figuring<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> way<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> quadrant<00:01:55.259> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
figuring out a way to quadrant that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.980 
figuring out a way to quadrant that
space<00:01:55.799> off<00:01:56.100> from<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.729> space<00:01:56.969> now<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.840> went

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
space off from this space now we went

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.870 
space off from this space now we went
back<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> hotel<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.369> relived<00:01:59.790> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
back to the hotel and I relived that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.510 
back to the hotel and I relived that
whole<00:02:00.210> thing<00:02:00.509> about<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.079> screens<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.280> juice

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
whole thing about the screens so juice

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.130 
whole thing about the screens so juice
but<00:02:02.790> by<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.969> time<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.479> took<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.780> look<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
but by the time we took a look at the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.569 
but by the time we took a look at the
weight<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.590> again<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.549> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
weight of them again and all of that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.999 
weight of them again and all of that
that<00:02:05.969> became<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> much<00:02:06.930> better<00:02:06.960> solution<00:02:07.469> I

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that became a much better solution I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.260 
that became a much better solution I
think<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.459> looks<00:02:08.670> it's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
think it looks it's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.750 
think it looks it's
you<00:02:09.600> know<00:02:09.720> rep<00:02:10.010> replication<00:02:11.010> of<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> guys

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you know rep replication of it you guys

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know rep replication of it you guys
remember<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.450> asymmetrical<00:02:13.200> window<00:02:13.500> that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
remember the asymmetrical window that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.200 
remember the asymmetrical window that
gave<00:02:13.830> off<00:02:14.010> little<00:02:14.460> light<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.820> offered<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
gave off little light and offered a

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.420 
gave off little light and offered a
bird's-eye<00:02:15.690> view<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.440> neighbors<00:02:16.830> well

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
bird's-eye view of the neighbors well

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.470 
bird's-eye view of the neighbors well
it's<00:02:18.000> gone<00:02:18.210> now

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
it's gone now

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.360 
it's gone now
so<00:02:19.320> where's<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.130> window<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:22.140> was<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.860> surprised

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
so where's the window I was so surprised

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.520 
so where's the window I was so surprised
when<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.640> saw<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:24.090> portion<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.170> sort<00:02:25.470> of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
when I saw that portion of it I sort of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.180 
when I saw that portion of it I sort of
miss<00:02:25.740> it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
miss it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.370 
miss it
but<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:27.030> made<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.360> look<00:02:27.450> really<00:02:27.510> nice<00:02:27.870> well

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
but you made it look really nice well

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.200 
but you made it look really nice well
the<00:02:28.470> idea<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.100> we<00:02:29.190> took<00:02:29.370> away<00:02:29.520> from<00:02:29.880> there

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
the idea is what we took away from there

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.260 
the idea is what we took away from there
okay<00:02:31.020> we<00:02:31.410> actually<00:02:31.860> doubled<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.910> entire

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
okay we actually doubled the entire

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.580 
okay we actually doubled the entire
visual<00:02:33.720> effect<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> room<00:02:34.380> with<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
visual effect of the room with the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.380 
visual effect of the room with the
mirrors<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.100> think<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> room<00:02:35.820> looks<00:02:35.970> twice<00:02:36.180> as

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
mirrors I think the room looks twice as

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.090 
mirrors I think the room looks twice as
big<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.260> how<00:02:37.380> do<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.530> think<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.740> track<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
big so how do you think the track the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.280 
big so how do you think the track the
colors<00:02:38.670> translated<00:02:39.300> from<00:02:39.480> shakey<00:02:39.870> here<00:02:40.080> I

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
colors translated from shakey here I

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.410 
colors translated from shakey here I
would<00:02:40.800> say<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.700> could<00:02:41.940> charge<00:02:42.150> money

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
would say that you I could charge money

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.400 
would say that you I could charge money
for<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.690> room<00:02:42.870> uh-huh

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
for a room uh-huh

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.340 
for a room uh-huh
I<00:02:43.830> love<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.880> dark<00:02:45.000> wood<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.810> soft<00:02:46.020> colors

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
I love the dark wood in the soft colors

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.260 
I love the dark wood in the soft colors
well<00:02:46.890> interestingly<00:02:47.280> enough<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:48.060> whole

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
well interestingly enough the whole

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.170 
well interestingly enough the whole
fabric<00:02:48.600> idea<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:50.370> know<00:02:50.460> it's<00:02:50.610> shade<00:02:50.850> we

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
fabric idea you know it's shade we

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.000 
fabric idea you know it's shade we
didn't<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.720> height<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.170> lobby<00:02:52.380> but

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.410 
didn't have the height in the lobby but
we<00:02:53.160> did<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.700> height<00:02:53.910> out<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.330> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
we did have the height out in the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.750 
we did have the height out in the
courtyard<00:02:54.690> yeah<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:56.040> when<00:02:56.190> we<00:02:56.280> walked<00:02:56.490> out<00:02:56.610> in

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
courtyard yeah so when we walked out in

courtyard yeah so when we walked out in
that<00:02:56.850> courtyard<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.510> we<00:02:57.630> saw<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.170> big<00:02:58.470> curtain

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that courtyard and we saw a big curtain

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.560 
that courtyard and we saw a big curtain
the<00:02:59.070> big<00:02:59.310> curtains<00:02:59.760> they<00:02:59.910> are<00:02:59.970> two<00:03:00.180> stories

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
the big curtains they are two stories

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.990 
the big curtains they are two stories
that's<00:03:01.020> basically<00:03:01.470> where<00:03:01.710> this<00:03:01.830> came<00:03:02.670> from

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
that's basically where this came from

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.090 
that's basically where this came from
