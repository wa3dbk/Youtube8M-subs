lot<00:02:05.279> of<00:02:05.399> people<00:02:05.520> don't<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.179> mushrooms<00:02:06.509> so

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
lot of people don't like mushrooms so

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.589 
lot of people don't like mushrooms so
instead<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.580> either<00:02:08.819> take<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.149> paring

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
instead you can either take a paring

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.160 
instead you can either take a paring
knife<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.050> peel<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.920> top<00:02:11.130> layer<00:02:11.190> back<00:02:11.970> or<00:02:12.360> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
knife and peel the top layer back or you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.650 
knife and peel the top layer back or you
can<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:13.470> take<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.620> paper<00:02:13.890> towel<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.670> rag<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
can just take a paper towel or a rag and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.890 
can just take a paper towel or a rag and
just<00:02:15.720> clean<00:02:16.410> off<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.610> surface<00:02:17.910> mud<00:02:18.540> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
just clean off the the surface mud that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.080 
just clean off the the surface mud that
is<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.620> that's<00:02:20.370> how<00:02:20.579> you<00:02:20.640> clean<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
is on it and that's how you clean the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.360 
is on it and that's how you clean the
mushroom<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.959> I've<00:02:22.349> chopped<00:02:22.739> them<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.220> and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
mushroom so I've chopped them all up and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
I'm going to put them in

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.810 
I'm going to put them in

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
going to let these bake down probably

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.660 
going to let these bake down probably
about<00:02:37.110> five<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.680> seven<00:02:37.860> minutes<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.520> then

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
about five to seven minutes and then

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.430 
about five to seven minutes and then
we're<00:02:38.760> going<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.940> add<00:02:39.120> some<00:02:39.420> more<00:02:39.570> stuff<00:02:42.440> all

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
right so see how those mushrooms have

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.590 
right so see how those mushrooms have
broken<00:02:45.600> down<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.080> they<00:02:46.470> they've<00:02:47.430> almost<00:02:48.120> been

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
broken down and they they've almost been

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.220 
broken down and they they've almost been
cut<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.530> half<00:02:50.210> because<00:02:51.210> mushrooms<00:02:51.600> are<00:02:51.720> mostly

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
cut in half because mushrooms are mostly

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.630 
cut in half because mushrooms are mostly

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:16.520 
cups of cashews and then you blend until
smooth

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.039 

that's<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:18.239> check<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.510> out

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
that's it check that out

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.260

there's your cashew cream we're just

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.180 
there's your cashew cream we're just
going<00:04:22.420> to<00:04:22.480> set<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:22.720> aside<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.740> we're<00:04:24.070> going

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
going to set that aside and we're going

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.190 
going to set that aside and we're going
to<00:04:24.220> add<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.090> soup<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.600> finish<00:04:25.930> it<00:04:26.080> off

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
to add it to the soup to finish it off

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.150 
to add it to the soup to finish it off
at<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.530> end<00:04:27.600> it's<00:04:28.600> not<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.200> good<00:04:29.530> the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
at the end it's not so good the

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.550 
at the end it's not so good the
mushrooms<00:04:30.580> are<00:04:30.730> soft<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:31.840> means<00:04:32.410> that

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
up too high with this hot liquid because

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.880 
up too high with this hot liquid because
what<00:04:48.460> happens<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.690> liquid<00:04:50.320> and<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.620> steam

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
what happens is the liquid and the steam

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.040 
what happens is the liquid and the steam
shoots<00:04:51.490> up<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:52.000> sometimes<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.750> goes<00:04:52.870> all<00:04:53.020> over

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
shoots up and sometimes it goes all over

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.690 
shoots up and sometimes it goes all over
the<00:04:53.320> place<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:53.950> get<00:04:54.070> burned<00:04:54.340> just

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
the place and you can get burned just

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.920 
the place and you can get burned just
don't<00:04:54.910> do<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:55.390> if<00:04:55.450> you're<00:04:55.570> going<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.780> use

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
don't do that so if you're going to use

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.250 
don't do that so if you're going to use
a<00:04:55.960> regular<00:04:56.380> blender<00:04:56.620> just<00:04:57.100> put<00:04:57.460> I'd<00:04:57.700> say<00:04:58.480> 1/3

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
a regular blender just put I'd say 1/3

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.040 
a regular blender just put I'd say 1/3
fill<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.190> up<00:05:00.280> about<00:05:00.580> 1/3<00:05:00.730> of<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.120> way<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.540> then

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
fill it up about 1/3 of the way and then

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.650 
fill it up about 1/3 of the way and then
just<00:05:02.320> blend<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.010> in<00:05:03.100> batches<00:05:03.640> but<00:05:04.360> I'm<00:05:04.480> going

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
just blend it in batches but I'm going

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:15.820 
just blend it in batches but I'm going
to<00:05:04.750> blend<00:05:04.960> this<00:05:05.110> this<00:05:05.380> way

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.129 

okay<00:05:16.830> so<00:05:16.889> this<00:05:17.220> is<00:05:17.400> mostly<00:05:17.850> blended<00:05:18.630> up<00:05:18.870> there

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
okay so this is mostly blended up there

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.140 
okay so this is mostly blended up there
might<00:05:19.290> be<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.470> few<00:05:19.919> chunks<00:05:20.370> still<00:05:20.700> left<00:05:20.970> in

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
might be a few chunks still left in

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.510 
might be a few chunks still left in
there<00:05:21.270> but<00:05:21.540> I<00:05:21.780> kind<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.560> like<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:23.070> so<00:05:23.310> I'm

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
there but I kind of like that so I'm

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.460 
there but I kind of like that so I'm
going<00:05:23.730> to<00:05:23.820> leave<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.450> we<00:05:24.900> are<00:05:25.050> on<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.440> our

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
going to leave it so we are on to our

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.030 
going to leave it so we are on to our
last<00:05:26.030> step<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.870> is<00:05:28.139> of<00:05:28.320> course<00:05:28.350> to<00:05:29.010> add

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
last step and that is of course to add

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.970 
last step and that is of course to add
our<00:05:29.400> beautiful<00:05:29.970> cashew<00:05:30.930> cream<00:05:31.290> to<00:05:31.590> make<00:05:31.740> this

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980
