00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
as well as Takoda and we analyzed well

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.940 
as well as Takoda and we analyzed well
who<00:00:15.000> are<00:00:15.090> these<00:00:15.180> people<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.660> are<00:00:15.890> that<00:00:16.890> are

who are these people that are that are

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.650 
who are these people that are that are
that<00:00:17.340> are<00:00:17.400> clicking<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.849> display<00:00:18.180> ads<00:00:18.360> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
that are clicking on display ads and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.490 
that are clicking on display ads and
back<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.410> 07<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.279> found<00:00:20.520> was<00:00:20.849> about

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
back in 07 what we found was about

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
back in 07 what we found was about
one-third<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> Internet<00:00:23.100> audience<00:00:23.420> was

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
one-third of the Internet audience was

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.170 
one-third of the Internet audience was
clicking<00:00:24.690> on<00:00:24.900> ads<00:00:25.279> two<00:00:26.279> years<00:00:26.520> later<00:00:26.789> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
clicking on ads two years later that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.930 
clicking on ads two years later that
number<00:00:27.539> was<00:00:27.720> cut<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.050> half<00:00:28.609> sixteen<00:00:29.609> percent

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
number was cut in half sixteen percent

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.420 
number was cut in half sixteen percent
or<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.180> of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.080> Internet<00:00:31.320> audience<00:00:31.529> clicked

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
or so of the Internet audience clicked

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430 
or so of the Internet audience clicked
on<00:00:32.580> ads<00:00:32.760> so<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:33.750> start<00:00:34.020> thinking<00:00:34.320> about

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
on ads so you now start thinking about

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.560 
on ads so you now start thinking about
the<00:00:34.559> implications<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.269> your<00:00:36.420> ad

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the implications of that and if your ad

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.170 
the implications of that and if your ad
campaign<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.440> would<00:00:37.590> imagine<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.180> met

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
campaign which I would imagine it is met

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.280 
campaign which I would imagine it is met
or<00:00:39.329> i<00:00:39.420> should<00:00:39.510> say<00:00:39.630> many<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.020> your<00:00:40.200> ad

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
or i should say many of your ad

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.080 
or i should say many of your ad
campaigns<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:40.980> optimized<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> click

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
campaigns are optimized to the click

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.720 
campaigns are optimized to the click
you're<00:00:42.989> now<00:00:43.140> targeting<00:00:43.680> sixteen<00:00:44.309> percent<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you're now targeting sixteen percent of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.330 
you're now targeting sixteen percent of
the<00:00:44.790> population<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.530> away<00:00:46.559> you've

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the population so right away you've

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.209 
the population so right away you've
basically<00:00:47.520> taken<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:49.100> eighty-four<00:00:50.100> percent

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
basically taken out eighty-four percent

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
basically taken out eighty-four percent
of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.550> internet<00:00:50.790> population<00:00:51.649> but<00:00:52.649> it's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
of the internet population but it's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
of the internet population but it's
worse<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.670> start<00:00:53.940> looking<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.329> now<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
worse you start looking at now the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
worse you start looking at now the
composition<00:00:55.200> of<00:00:55.290> those<00:00:55.440> people<00:00:55.800> who<00:00:55.920> are

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
composition of those people who are

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
composition of those people who are
clicking<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.700> what<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.030> find<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> eight

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
clicking and what you find is that eight

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.650 
clicking and what you find is that eight
percent<00:00:58.860> these<00:00:59.550> moderate<00:00:59.940> heavy<00:01:00.210> clickers

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
percent these moderate heavy clickers

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.270 
percent these moderate heavy clickers
are<00:01:00.809> driving<00:01:01.320> eighty-five<00:01:01.800> percent<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
are driving eighty-five percent of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680 
are driving eighty-five percent of
clicks<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.070> you're<00:01:05.190> down<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.690> optimizing

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
clicks so now you're down to optimizing

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.330 
clicks so now you're down to optimizing
your<00:01:06.780> campaign<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.530> eight<00:01:07.770> percent<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
your campaign on eight percent of the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.260 
your campaign on eight percent of the
population<00:01:09.649> but<00:01:10.649> it<00:01:10.800> gets<00:01:10.860> worse<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:12.030> start

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
population but it gets worse we start

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.350 
population but it gets worse we start
looking<00:01:12.509> at<00:01:12.630> who<00:01:12.750> those<00:01:12.959> clickers<00:01:13.289> are<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
looking at who those clickers are and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.660 
looking at who those clickers are and
it's<00:01:15.360> by<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:15.840> large<00:01:15.929> skews<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
it's by and large skews to the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's by and large skews to the
lower-income<00:01:18.090> demographic<00:01:18.959> and<00:01:19.610> what<00:01:20.610> we

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
lower-income demographic and what we

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.880 
lower-income demographic and what we
determined<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> found<00:01:21.929> out<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> reason

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
determined and found out was the reason

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
determined and found out was the reason
why<00:01:23.039> they're<00:01:23.250> clicking<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:24.300> actually<00:01:24.599> as<00:01:24.690> an

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
why they're clicking was actually as an

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.120 
why they're clicking was actually as an
extension<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.440> their<00:01:25.590> online<00:01:25.740> entertainment

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
extension of their online entertainment

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.669 
extension of their online entertainment
experience<00:01:26.899> so<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:28.020> ads<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.349> which<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.619> were

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
experience so the ads on which they were

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.309 
experience so the ads on which they were
clicking<00:01:29.160> were<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.459> the<00:01:29.610> ones<00:01:29.819> that<00:01:30.179> I<00:01:30.420> would

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
clicking were not the ones that I would

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.839 
clicking were not the ones that I would
imagine<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.039> majority<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.459> you<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.260 
click-through rate and the bar chart
looks<00:01:45.750> fantastic<00:01:46.670> until<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.819> look<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.060> the

looks fantastic until you look at the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.309 
looks fantastic until you look at the
scale<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.530> y-axis<00:01:50.989> so<00:01:51.989> for<00:01:52.110> those<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.229> you
