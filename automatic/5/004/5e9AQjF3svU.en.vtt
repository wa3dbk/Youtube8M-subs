00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
but yeah if the little fish travel too

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.550 
but yeah if the little fish travel too
far<00:02:18.180> away<00:02:19.610> see<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.079> little<00:02:22.260> fish

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.420 
far away see that if the little fish
travel<00:02:23.280> too<00:02:23.519> far<00:02:23.549> away<00:02:23.940> from<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.570> tank<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
travel too far away from the tank the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.160 
travel too far away from the tank the
mother<00:02:26.730> will<00:02:26.970> actually<00:02:27.390> pick<00:02:27.630> up<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.930> fish

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
mother will actually pick up the fish

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.190 
mother will actually pick up the fish
and<00:02:28.470> spin<00:02:29.340> them<00:02:29.459> back<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.200> designated

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and spin them back to the designated

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.099 
and spin them back to the designated
nest<00:02:31.650> area<00:02:32.630> that's<00:02:33.630> basically<00:02:34.109> why<00:02:34.440> they

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
nest area that's basically why they

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.970 
nest area that's basically why they
build<00:02:37.109> little<00:02:37.890> holes<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:39.329> your<00:02:39.570> fish<00:02:39.810> tank<00:02:40.109> for

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
build little holes in your fish tank for

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.830 
build little holes in your fish tank for
cases<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.609> these<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.120> they<00:02:42.269> could<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.630> spit

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
cases like these so they could just spit

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.900 
cases like these so they could just spit
all<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.230> fish<00:02:43.470> into<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.040> little<00:02:44.340> hole<00:02:44.579> that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
all the fish into the little hole that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.870 
all the fish into the little hole that
they<00:02:45.269> made<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> gravel<00:02:49.579> but<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:50.760> was

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
they made with the gravel but that was

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.009 
they made with the gravel but that was
just<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.120> little<00:02:51.420> update<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.690> I'll<00:02:54.840> update

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
just a little update so I'll update

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.650 
just a little update so I'll update
again<00:02:55.410> later
