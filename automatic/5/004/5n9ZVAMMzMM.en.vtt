00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.330
 hello to all today here is how 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.820
 to make delicious papillotes 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.170
 salmon for this recipe and for 4 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.080
 twists you're going to need to 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.590
 four salmon steaks one shallot 2 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.050
 carrots 1 leek salt pepper 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.660
 tarragon a little bit of butter and 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.890
 two sheets of baking paper 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.050
 to start we will preheat 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.240
 your oven thermostat 7 is 210 had to 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.129
 nothing is easier for carrots 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.360
 will just removed both sides and 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.670
 to make a cut a little bit 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.289
 original we go cutting and economics 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.940
 so you'll see it's going to achieve 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.190
 small tagliatelle that are then sold 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.359
 hit with boiling water 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.890
 we then cut our leek in 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.359
 fine washers watch a leek 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.239
 previously washed otherwise you risk 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.379
 to have a little bit of sand we dive 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.300
 then our vegetables in the water 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.609
 boiling for about 2 to 3 minutes of 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.489
 cooking during this time we will 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.229
 so cut out the shallots 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.479
 so here quite finely because it's okay 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.589
 to be a fairly fast cooking so the 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.059
 blow you really need the pieces 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.620
 can melt and we will be able to 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.180
 make our curl 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.880
 it therefore places a piece of salmon 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.729
 middle on the season lack of salt 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.079
 pepper and a little bit of tarragon 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.390
 we then add a pinch 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.570
 shallots a small piece of butter 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.100
 in the middle and so we will come and place our 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.670
 vegetables over the piece of butter 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.509
 our vegetables previously drain 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.939
 finish the seasoning of your 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.009
 so always with salt from 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.570
 pepper and tarragon and now we 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.950
 will be able to closed it you will see 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.520
 it's very easy a bit like a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.560
 gift package 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.380
 so we spend a first time on 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.899
 and we slide below our pavement 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.990
 salmon the other side we also slide 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.000
 below and then we will fold the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.210
 sides then to pray the sides on 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.509
 flattens we make two triangles and we 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.860
 slips below the other side even 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:00.320
 trick we fold up 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.040
 and below and then we place in 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.410
 a dish with gratin 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.620
 it only remains to bake no4 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.240
 twists ten minutes in the oven your 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.470
 salmon wrappers are now 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.050
 cooked for even more pleasure 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.060
 enjoy them with rice and vegetables 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.300
 in season you will enjoy 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.300
