batteries the h1 uses normal double-a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
batteries the h1 uses normal double-a
batteries<00:00:37.500> which<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.040> good<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.579> can

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
batteries which is good because you can

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.670 
batteries which is good because you can
easily<00:00:39.059> fix<00:00:39.360> them<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> drugstore<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.410> a

convenience store if you're in a pinch
they<00:00:42.780> aren't<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> video<00:00:43.469> camera<00:00:43.739> where

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
they aren't like a video camera where

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.740 
they aren't like a video camera where
they<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.250> some<00:00:44.489> kind<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.760> weird<00:00:45.059> battery<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
they use some kind of weird battery that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.119 
they use some kind of weird battery that
you<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.200> change<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> worry<00:00:46.860> about

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you have to change and worry about

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.090 
you have to change and worry about
losing<00:00:47.660> what<00:00:48.660> isn't<00:00:48.899> good<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.920> these

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
losing what isn't good is that these

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.880 
losing what isn't good is that these
batteries<00:00:50.550> might<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:50.969> last<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.420> very<00:00:51.449> long

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
batteries might not last you very long

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the h1 zoom that is supposed to make the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
the h1 zoom that is supposed to make the
recorder<00:00:57.059> consume<00:00:57.449> less<00:00:57.719> power

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
recorder consume less power

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
firmware update then just don't do it in

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.210

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
low or your audio will be
