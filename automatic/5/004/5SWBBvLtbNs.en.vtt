00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
let's talk about that being in Pocket

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.290 
let's talk about that being in Pocket
Edition<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.559> redstone<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.910> added

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
Edition so redstone was actually added

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.680

in<00:00:36.510> Pocket<00:00:36.899> Edition<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.290> believe<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.790> 0.8.0<00:00:38.790> as

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
in Pocket Edition I believe in 0.8.0 as

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
in Pocket Edition I believe in 0.8.0 as
far<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.170> mine<00:00:40.530> through<00:00:40.860> redstone<00:00:41.309> ore

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
but you're not actually able to make

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.709 
but you're not actually able to make
circuits<00:00:44.040> with<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.579> make<00:00:45.090> things<00:00:45.360> like

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
be implemented for redstone to work but

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.670 
be implemented for redstone to work but
I'm<00:01:04.739> hoping<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.460> first<00:01:05.489> half<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.680> 2015

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
I'm hoping for the first half of 2015

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.340 
I'm hoping for the first half of 2015
and<00:01:08.310> he<00:01:08.700> puts<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.030> smiley<00:01:09.299> face<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and he puts a smiley face so that's that

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
and he puts a smiley face so that's that
means<00:01:10.619> either<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.130> or<00:01:11.189> two<00:01:11.340> things<00:01:11.700> my

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
means either one or two things my

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.750 
means either one or two things my
opinion<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.040> they'll

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
opinion what I think is that they'll

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.719 
opinion what I think is that they'll
probably<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:16.380> redstone<00:01:16.920> working<00:01:17.430> first

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
probably get the redstone working first

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.429 
probably get the redstone working first
I<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.270> they're<00:01:18.509> gonna<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.689> clearing<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.170> bugs

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
I know they're gonna be clearing up bugs

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.649 
I know they're gonna be clearing up bugs
and<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.040> stuff<00:01:20.220> still<00:01:20.549> fixing<00:01:20.909> bugs<00:01:21.090> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and all that stuff still fixing bugs so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.240 
and all that stuff still fixing bugs so
hopefully<00:01:21.930> they'll<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> redstone<00:01:22.920> dust

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
hopefully they'll get the redstone dust

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
hopefully they'll get the redstone dust
and<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.030> stuff<00:01:24.210> working<00:01:24.659> first<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and all that stuff working first and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.620 
and all that stuff working first and
then<00:01:25.860> they'll<00:01:26.130> add<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.549> pistons<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.420> all

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
then they'll add the pistons and all

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.749 
then they'll add the pistons and all
that<00:01:27.869> crazy<00:01:28.140> stuff<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.159> when<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that crazy stuff so when we get that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.850 
that crazy stuff so when we get that
we'll<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.060> able<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.360> use<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.079> won't<00:01:31.650> be

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we'll be able to use it it won't be

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.469 
we'll be able to use it it won't be
backwards<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.119> get<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> mean

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
backwards you get you get what I mean

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
backwards you get you get what I mean
like<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.110> won't<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> Pistons<00:01:35.040> first<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
like we won't get the Pistons first and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.719 
like we won't get the Pistons first and
have<00:01:35.610> nothing<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.460> know

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
have nothing to do with it and you know

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.130 
have nothing to do with it and you know
what<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> mean<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.049> I'm

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
what I mean you can get what I'm

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.620 
what I mean you can get what I'm
explaining<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.790> yeah<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.270> hopefully<00:01:42.390> we

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
explaining here but yeah so hopefully we

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.389 
explaining here but yeah so hopefully we
get<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> redstone<00:01:43.409> first<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.100> course

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
get the redstone first of course

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
get the redstone first of course
hopefully<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.060> he<00:01:45.240> means<00:01:45.509> by<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
hopefully that's what he means by that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.840 
hopefully that's what he means by that
and<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:46.770> later<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.040> we'll<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> pistons

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
and then later on we'll get the pistons

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.609 
and then later on we'll get the pistons
and<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.180> stuff<00:01:48.390> he<00:01:48.509> didn't<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:48.990> make

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and all this stuff he didn't really make

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.469 
and all this stuff he didn't really make
any<00:01:49.680> tweets<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.880> Pistons<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
any tweets out about the Pistons and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.600 
any tweets out about the Pistons and
levers<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.680> crazy<00:01:52.950> stuff<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.490> can

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610

also<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.119> believe<00:01:54.329> make<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.020> accomplices

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
also I believe make you know accomplices

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.190 
also I believe make you know accomplices
clocks<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.219> power<00:01:56.430> rails<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.079> as

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
clocks and power rails for now but as

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.709 
clocks and power rails for now but as
far<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.710> making<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.640> those<00:01:59.880> secret

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
far as like making you know those secret

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.060 
far as like making you know those secret
contraptions<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.409> making<00:02:01.680> circuits<00:02:02.040> like

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
contraptions and making circuits like

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.219 
contraptions and making circuits like
that<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.850> cannot<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.450> yet<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.899> hopefully

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that you cannot do that yet so hopefully

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.170 
that you cannot do that yet so hopefully
