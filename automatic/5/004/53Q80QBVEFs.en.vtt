00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.570 

now<00:00:01.630> we<00:00:01.690> need<00:00:01.990> to<00:00:02.020> calculate<00:00:02.409> the<00:00:02.949> y<00:00:03.190> velocity

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:03.580 
now we need to calculate the y velocity

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.079 
now we need to calculate the y velocity
and<00:00:04.090> X<00:00:04.390> velocity<00:00:04.600> of<00:00:05.140> the<00:00:05.259> bullet<00:00:05.939> so<00:00:06.939> we're

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:07.089 
and X velocity of the bullet so we're

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.230 
and X velocity of the bullet so we're
going<00:00:07.209> to<00:00:07.390> use<00:00:07.540> some<00:00:07.590> trigonometry<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:10.090> get

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
going to use some trigonometry to get

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.960 
going to use some trigonometry to get
the<00:00:10.390> y<00:00:10.570> velocity<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:12.160> need<00:00:12.310> to<00:00:12.430> multiply<00:00:12.580> the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.970 
the y velocity we need to multiply the

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.140 
the y velocity we need to multiply the
speed<00:00:13.480> of<00:00:13.690> good<00:00:13.930> sign<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.460> title<00:00:16.440> y<00:00:17.440> velocity

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
speed of good sign so title y velocity

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:28.270 
speed of good sign so title y velocity
equals<00:00:19.350> math<00:00:20.350> dot<00:00:20.770> sine<00:00:22.560> angle<00:00:24.690> x<00:00:25.690> theme

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
equals math dot sine angle x theme

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.180 
equals math dot sine angle x theme
the<00:00:28.370> X<00:00:28.580> velocity<00:00:28.840> we<00:00:29.840> need<00:00:29.990> to<00:00:30.110> multiply<00:00:30.320> speed

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
the X velocity we need to multiply speed

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.690 
the X velocity we need to multiply speed
with<00:00:31.730> cosine<00:00:32.240> so<00:00:33.230> type<00:00:33.700> X<00:00:34.700> velocity<00:00:35.530> equals

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
with cosine so type X velocity equals

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.870 
with cosine so type X velocity equals
math<00:00:37.700> dot<00:00:38.030> course<00:00:39.430> angle<00:00:40.480> x<00:00:41.480> speed<00:00:42.820> now<00:00:43.820> we

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
math dot course angle x speed now we

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.299 
math dot course angle x speed now we
