though right this is a world to level 3
it's<00:00:32.430> more<00:00:32.640> seen<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> beginning<00:00:34.610> kind<00:00:35.610> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it's more seen at the beginning kind of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's more seen at the beginning kind of
rushing<00:00:36.059> through<00:00:36.090> list<00:00:37.579> let's<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.879> okay<00:00:39.239> slow

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
rushing through list let's see okay slow

rushing through list let's see okay slow
down<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:39.809> now

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
down right now

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.139 
down right now
so<00:00:40.620> once<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> halfway<00:00:41.550> mark<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so once you get to the halfway mark of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.639 
so once you get to the halfway mark of
the<00:00:42.239> level<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.750> kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> progress

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the level you just kind of progress

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.770 
the level you just kind of progress
through<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.160> normal<00:00:44.450> it's<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> very

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
through it like normal it's not a very

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290 
through it like normal it's not a very
long<00:00:45.989> level<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.730> it's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> pretty<00:00:48.030> straight

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
long level and it's a pretty straight

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.360 
long level and it's a pretty straight
run<00:00:48.539> from<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> halfway<00:00:49.079> mark<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> end<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
run from the halfway mark to the end of

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.819 
run from the halfway mark to the end of
the<00:00:50.489> level<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.960> shouldn't<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.500> too<00:00:52.680> many

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the level so you shouldn't have too many

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.740 
the level so you shouldn't have too many
problems<00:00:53.719> getting<00:00:54.719> through<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:56.360> okay<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.570> here

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
problems getting through it okay so here

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.459 
problems getting through it okay so here
we<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.899> at<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> very<00:00:58.410> end<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> basically<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
we are at the very end so basically you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
we are at the very end so basically you
just<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.770> through<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.100> pipe<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.550> anyone<00:01:02.760> who

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
just go through this pipe and anyone who

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.729 
just go through this pipe and anyone who
played<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> original<00:01:03.390> Super<00:01:04.140> Mario<00:01:04.170> Brothers

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
played the original Super Mario Brothers

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100 
played the original Super Mario Brothers
on<00:01:04.890> nes<00:01:05.280> would<00:01:05.640> recognize<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.390> situation

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
on nes would recognize this situation

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.010 
on nes would recognize this situation
and<00:01:07.799> basically<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.610> hop<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.150> bitch

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and basically you just hop on that bitch

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.289 
and basically you just hop on that bitch
if<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> timing<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.909> keep

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
if you have timing right it keep

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
if you have timing right it keep
bouncing<00:01:12.750> into<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.380> 1ups<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.100> keep

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
bouncing into the 1ups will just keep

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.380 
bouncing into the 1ups will just keep
coming<00:01:15.259> now<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> trick<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.649> is<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.850> kill

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
coming now the trick here is if you kill

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.649 
coming now the trick here is if you kill
yourself<00:01:19.280> then<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> redo<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> level

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
yourself then you get to redo the level

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
yourself then you get to redo the level
at<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.500> halfway<00:01:22.680> mark<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.399> beat<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
at the halfway mark if you beat the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.810 
at the halfway mark if you beat the
level<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.149> to<00:01:24.210> start<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.630> over<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> once

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
level you have to start all over so once

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.050 
level you have to start all over so once
you<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.539> 99<00:01:27.960> lives<00:01:28.520> just<00:01:29.520> calling<00:01:29.850> some

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you get up to 99 lives just calling some

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.859 
you get up to 99 lives just calling some
other<00:01:30.210> players<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:32.360> you'll<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.659> halfway

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
other players and you'll be halfway

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.070 
other players and you'll be halfway
through<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.350> level<00:01:34.679> already<00:01:35.659> now<00:01:36.659> I'm<00:01:36.840> doing

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
through the level already now I'm doing

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.830 
through the level already now I'm doing
this<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.590> single-player<00:01:38.390> trying<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> control

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this on single-player trying to control

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.680 
this on single-player trying to control
all<00:01:39.960> three<00:01:40.170> remotes<00:01:40.939> which<00:01:41.939> may<00:01:42.179> actually<00:01:42.420> be

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
all three remotes which may actually be

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.080 
all three remotes which may actually be
easier<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.340> friends<00:01:44.610> are<00:01:44.700> playing<00:01:44.880> with

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
easier if the friends are playing with

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.240 
easier if the friends are playing with
our<00:01:45.119> any<00:01:45.569> good<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.369> basically<00:01:49.250> what

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
our any good at it but basically what

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.800 
our any good at it but basically what
I'm<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.429> to<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> put

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
I'm going to do right here is put

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.880 
I'm going to do right here is put
everyone<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.289> a<00:01:52.350> bubble<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:54.530> then<00:01:55.530> I'll<00:01:55.679> just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
everyone in a bubble and then I'll just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.620 
everyone in a bubble and then I'll just
have<00:01:55.979> more<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.429> run<00:01:56.670> through<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.479> make

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
have more you run through and that make

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.120 
have more you run through and that make
sure<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> don't<00:01:57.959> have<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.289> control<00:01:58.679> them<00:01:58.890> they

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
sure you don't have to control them they
