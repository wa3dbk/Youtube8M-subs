repositionable<00:01:46.560> cartridge<00:01:47.560> in<00:01:47.710> here<00:01:47.829> which

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
repositionable cartridge in here which

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.410 
repositionable cartridge in here which
means<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.310> can<00:01:48.429> just<00:01:48.490> easily<00:01:48.759> lift<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.210> out

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
means I can just easily lift this out

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.789 
means I can just easily lift this out
when<00:01:49.600> I'm<00:01:49.689> done<00:01:49.719> with<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.020> activity<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.649> we

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
when I'm done with this activity and we

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.550 
when I'm done with this activity and we
use<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.070> tray<00:01:51.310> for<00:01:51.520> something<00:01:51.820> else<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.409> for

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
use this tray for something else so for

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.870 
use this tray for something else so for
the<00:01:53.679> sec<00:01:53.859> tivity<00:01:54.130> I'm<00:01:54.310> pretty<00:01:54.549> sure<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.759> can

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
the sec tivity I'm pretty sure you can

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.060 
the sec tivity I'm pretty sure you can
figure<00:01:55.030> out<00:01:55.090> what<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.390> would<00:01:55.509> do<00:01:56.070> children

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
figure out what you would do children

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.880 
figure out what you would do children
don't<00:01:57.219> have<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.429> use<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.700> Tong<00:01:57.999> but<00:01:58.890> another

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
don't have to use a Tong but another

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.279 
don't have to use a Tong but another
chance<00:02:00.579> to<00:02:01.149> devote<00:02:01.390> those<00:02:01.539> fine<00:02:01.749> motor<00:02:01.780> skills

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
chance to devote those fine motor skills

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.590 
chance to devote those fine motor skills
shouldn't<00:02:02.679> be<00:02:02.740> passed<00:02:03.009> up<00:02:03.189> if<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:04.270> would<00:02:04.420> like

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
shouldn't be passed up if you would like

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.260 
shouldn't be passed up if you would like
to<00:02:04.719> use<00:02:04.840> tongs<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:06.549> just<00:02:06.789> simply<00:02:06.880> pick<00:02:07.149> up

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
to use tongs they just simply pick up

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.809 
to use tongs they just simply pick up
their<00:02:07.420> eggs

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
their eggs

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.959 
their eggs
put<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> into<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.200> section<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.579> will<00:02:11.760> match

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
put it into the section that will match

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.270 
put it into the section that will match
the<00:02:12.209> color<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.689> they<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.950> section

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the color that they have in the section

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.910 
the color that they have in the section
so<00:02:14.459> they<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.909> egg<00:02:15.239> orange<00:02:16.170> egg<00:02:16.379> obviously

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so they get egg orange egg obviously

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.330 
so they get egg orange egg obviously
goes<00:02:17.099> into<00:02:17.719> the<00:02:18.719> orange<00:02:19.439> section<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.280> just

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
goes into the orange section and just

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.720 
goes into the orange section and just
throughout<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.819> whole<00:02:21.030> tray<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:22.249> as<00:02:23.249> we<00:02:23.579> did

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
throughout the whole tray and as we did

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.190 
throughout the whole tray and as we did
with<00:02:23.939> our<00:02:24.180> egg<00:02:24.780> transfer<00:02:25.349> yesterday

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
with our egg transfer yesterday

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.170 
with our egg transfer yesterday
once<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.349> tray<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.650> filled<00:02:28.889> up<00:02:29.129> then<00:02:30.030> they

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
once the tray is filled up then they

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.539 
once the tray is filled up then they
would<00:02:30.329> go<00:02:30.599> back<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.139> take<00:02:31.500> their<00:02:31.829> eggs<00:02:32.219> out

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
would go back and take their eggs out

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.490 
would go back and take their eggs out
and<00:02:32.819> put<00:02:32.969> them<00:02:33.060> back<00:02:33.239> into<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.870> bowl<00:02:34.109> so<00:02:34.319> it's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
and put them back into the bowl so it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.280 
and put them back into the bowl so it's
kind<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.859> transfer<00:02:35.340> activity<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:35.819> well<00:02:36.290> but

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
kind of a transfer activity as well but

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.920 
kind of a transfer activity as well but
mainly<00:02:37.919> a<00:02:38.040> color<00:02:38.280> matching<00:02:38.519> activity<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.510> here

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
mainly a color matching activity on here

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.099 
mainly a color matching activity on here
and<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.469> don't<00:02:40.739> I've<00:02:41.010> done<00:02:41.250> um<00:02:41.540> two<00:02:42.540> sets<00:02:42.870> of

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
and you don't I've done um two sets of
