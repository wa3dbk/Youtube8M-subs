the environment and talk about
sustainability<00:01:51.550> then<00:01:52.550> what<00:01:52.760> a<00:01:52.970> bit<00:01:53.300> of

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
sustainability then what a bit of

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.570 
sustainability then what a bit of
product<00:01:53.600> use<00:01:53.990> then<00:01:54.350> nature's<00:01:54.920> product<00:01:55.250> okay

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
product use then nature's product okay

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.250 
product use then nature's product okay
so<00:01:55.640> it's<00:01:55.910> made<00:01:56.060> from<00:01:56.210> flax<00:01:56.510> seed<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.870> readily

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
so it's made from flax seed a readily

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.230 
so it's made from flax seed a readily
available<00:01:57.410> product

changing color it's going to be soaking
up<00:03:16.120> all<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.450> oil<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:20.000> like<00:03:20.090> there<00:03:20.420> which

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
up all this oil just like there which

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.039 
up all this oil just like there which
just<00:03:20.750> do<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.200> front<00:03:21.320> but<00:03:21.590> here<00:03:22.870> look<00:03:23.870> at<00:03:23.959> that
