00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 for me then now 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.160
 very calm very liberated I knew of 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.700
 the news and still 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.530
 a few days ago I was assimilating it 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.500
 little bit 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.370
 but the truth is learned as I have 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.020
 taken I thought it was going to be fine 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.760
 I really thought it would be much more 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.440
 hard 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.000
 of what has been I feel liberated 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:34.560
 I feel calm with more than anything with my 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.090
 life with my career and wanting to 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.280
 finish the season in one season 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 that has been difficult and eager 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.730
 that the race comes on Sunday for 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.830
 be with all my fans with all the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.020
 people who have not left me alone in any 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.910
 moment 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.400
 a team of more 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 it will be difficult because obviously the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.680
 decision arrived very late puts me in a 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.690
 very difficult situation if that decision 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.910
 they would have let you know a few months ago 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.420
 things would be different but it's what 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.060
 what is there and are we focused on finding 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.710
 a good good team to continue with 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.540
 the future in formula one 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.220
 I do not intend to stay in formula one for 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.390
 for staying if there is not a good option 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.710
 that gives me the best for my future 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.650
 I will probably look for other alternatives 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.869
 but the goal today is that they 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.780
 in formula 1 and he is the only one who thinks and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.900
 I'm sure that's going to happen 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.810
 of the world 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.610
 not of course we are Carlos and I 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.610
 looking for the best option for my career 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.110
 There are several options to and then 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.979
 let's hope we can find the best 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.979
 seat on the internet 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.360
 here 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.630
 not because always always what I 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.030
 I received from mclaren and always wanted 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.490
 trust them not always 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.330
 They told me that I was safe 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.549
 to stay I was never told something 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.909
 everything changed in the last 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:11.330
 weeks and I have surprised a little but 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.880
 also so life does not sometimes life 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.340
 puts you on another path that does not 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.840
 like but but happy and I'm 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.020
 sure what is coming is the best for 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.160
 me as I tell you and I repeat it I'm not 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.610
 I'm happy the truth I'm happy 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.330
 to look for another alternative I think that 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.330
 it's the best for my career 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.590
 I 'm not here to talk bad about 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.290
 mclaren and I will not do 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.910
 otherwise I am very grateful to them 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.550
 for the opportunity they gave me to 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.700
 end I am very lucky I drove for a 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.390
 of the most historic teams 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.459
 what's in formula1 probably in the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.239
 worse in the worst possible year of all your 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.280
 story but that's what I had to live and 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.950
 I have learned a lot this season to 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.540
 despite all the bad things I think this 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.940
 will grow a lot with my character 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.239
 and my way of seeing things for the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.239
 future 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.569
 I do not know probably so much pressure that 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.469
 there is in the team 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.469
 I believe that 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.900
 I think that mainly is not 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.550
 there is so much pressure today in the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.640
 team for the results that we have 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.640
 had 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.930
 as always what always said jenson 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.750
 I respect him we are not the best friends 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.150
 but I also admire his career and 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.570
 I wish the best to him and McLaren 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.570
 next year
