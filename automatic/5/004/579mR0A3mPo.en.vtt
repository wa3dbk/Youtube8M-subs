00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.260
 what you have to do is draw 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.260
 a leaf 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.050
 without closing it on this side 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.530
 and so that it is not so that it is not easy 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.530
 fold the eva rubber bit 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.480
 and cut them together 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.890
 this way 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.090
 ah 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.090
 when we put it 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.820
 which is a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.810
 then we take the chupa chups the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.810
 lollipop whatever you have chosen 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.610
 and we see how you see her 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.790
 little leaf to put it in the heart 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.460
 we look where we are going to place it 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.850
 once we have decided, we take the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.850
 glue 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.950
 and we paste it like that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.950
 we have the little leaf 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.420
 I stick it around here so I can later 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.200
 put it to my liking it 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.050
 Well, talking a little something if 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.450
 We stick the lollipop lollipops or what 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.890
 that we are going to put with a glue 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.790
 hot we can undo the plastic 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.300
 then we better not do it with 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.300
 tail 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.770
 we are going to throw the glue 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.860
 directly in the lollipop or in the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.860
 chupa chups and we will place it like this 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.700
 you have to leave it 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.090
 and so 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.230
 and so you should let it dry you know 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.690
 about ten minutes or so 15 according to 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.210
 the glue that you have 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.520
 and we would have done it so this 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.410
 detail for what you can use for san 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.160
 valentine or for communions 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.380
 what you want, it will be good 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.000
 perceived fixed so I do not expect anything 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.540
