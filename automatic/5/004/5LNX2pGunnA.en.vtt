00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
GarageBand feel to it which in my

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.810 
GarageBand feel to it which in my
opinion<00:00:33.079> makes<00:00:33.590> their<00:00:33.890> music<00:00:34.280> even<00:00:34.610> more

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
opinion makes their music even more

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.940 
opinion makes their music even more
appealing<00:00:35.149> also<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.020> white<00:00:36.200> stripe<00:00:36.559> sound<00:00:36.800> is

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
appealing also the white stripe sound is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.709 
appealing also the white stripe sound is
heavily<00:00:37.250> influenced<00:00:37.820> by<00:00:37.910> some<00:00:38.210> older<00:00:38.510> bands
