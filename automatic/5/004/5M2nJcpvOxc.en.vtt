different<00:00:44.789> could<00:00:45.120> actually<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.140> get

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.810 

projectile<00:00:57.969> attacks<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.949> say<00:01:00.610> that

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
projectile attacks and I say that

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.819 
projectile attacks and I say that
working<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:01.600> used<00:01:01.839> to<00:01:01.989> can<00:01:02.140> improve<00:01:02.440> though

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
working and used to can improve though

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.100 
working and used to can improve though
that<00:01:03.219> is<00:01:03.699> that<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.119> make<00:01:04.239> identify<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> little

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
that is that to make identify a little

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.020 
that is that to make identify a little
faster<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:06.009> to<00:01:09.330> take<00:01:10.330> out<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.950> weapons<00:01:12.030> where

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
faster is to take out the weapons where

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.289 
faster is to take out the weapons where

in<00:03:38.150> this<00:03:38.269> game<00:03:38.510> we're<00:03:38.750> gonna<00:03:39.470> say<00:03:39.680> it's<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.040> huge

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
in this game we're gonna say it's a huge

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.399 
in this game we're gonna say it's a huge
issue<00:03:40.489> but<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.849> guess<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.060> can<00:03:41.780> become<00:03:42.109> a<00:03:42.140> deep

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
issue but I guess you can become a deep

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.610 
issue but I guess you can become a deep
tissue<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:43.220> well<00:03:43.909> competitively<00:03:44.629> like<00:03:45.379> when

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
tissue if well competitively like when

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.210 
tissue if well competitively like when
we<00:03:45.709> do<00:03:45.890> stash<00:03:46.159> careful<00:03:46.640> um<00:03:47.829> it<00:03:48.829> should<00:03:48.859> be<00:03:49.189> a

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
we do stash careful um it should be a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.910 
we do stash careful um it should be a
cost<00:03:49.700> of<00:03:50.000> us<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.599> consistent<00:03:50.810> rate<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.439> fire<00:03:51.620> in

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920

like<00:04:08.989> he<00:04:09.230> should<00:04:09.560> be<00:04:09.590> consistent<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.400> that

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
like he should be consistent and that

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.319 
like he should be consistent and that
 at<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:11.689> highest<00:04:11.989> rate<00:04:12.819> but<00:04:13.819> thing<00:04:14.299> is

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
 at the highest rate but thing is

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.089 
 at the highest rate but thing is
you<00:04:14.569> can<00:04:14.720> keep<00:04:14.870> making<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.379> higher<00:04:15.590> if<00:04:15.950> you

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
you can keep making it higher if you

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.159 
you can keep making it higher if you
justjust<00:04:16.639> by<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.090> input<00:04:17.510> from<00:04:17.690> what<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:17.870> see

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
justjust by the input from what I see

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.400 
justjust by the input from what I see
this<00:04:18.859> way<00:04:19.099> you<00:04:19.160> can<00:04:19.280> fire<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.760> laser<00:04:20.349> so<00:04:21.349> you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
this way you can fire the laser so you

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.180 
this way you can fire the laser so you
can<00:04:21.829> you<00:04:22.250> can<00:04:22.729> fire<00:04:22.940> your<00:04:23.180> primary<00:04:23.840> later<00:04:24.190> okay

be<00:04:57.230> consistent<00:04:57.949> and<00:04:58.160> if<00:04:58.790> not<00:04:59.120> consistent<00:04:59.630> you

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
be consistent and if not consistent you

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.100 
be consistent and if not consistent you
should<00:05:00.320> be<00:05:00.500> if<00:05:01.220> you're<00:05:01.430> not<00:05:01.610> going<00:05:02.180> if<00:05:02.900> you're

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
should be if you're not going if you're

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.990 
should be if you're not going if you're
like<00:05:03.500> it<00:05:03.740> should<00:05:03.889> be<00:05:03.919> consistent<00:05:04.400> at<00:05:04.820> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
like it should be consistent at the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.360 
like it should be consistent at the
highest<00:05:05.210> rate<00:05:05.570> but<00:05:05.960> any<00:05:06.350> lower<00:05:06.740> should<00:05:07.220> be<00:05:07.340> a

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
highest rate but any lower should be a

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.340 
highest rate but any lower should be a
true<00:05:07.610> control<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:09.760> so<00:05:10.760> yeah<00:05:11.030> but<00:05:12.020> I'm<00:05:12.139> liking

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
true control and so yeah but I'm liking

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.140 
true control and so yeah but I'm liking
this<00:05:12.560> demo<00:05:12.919> so<00:05:13.100> far<00:05:13.340> I'm<00:05:13.460> hoping<00:05:13.850> that<00:05:13.910> it

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
this demo so far I'm hoping that it

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.300 
this demo so far I'm hoping that it
improves<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:15.020> lot<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.500> developers<00:05:16.190> I'm

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
improves a lot and developers I'm

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.860 
improves a lot and developers I'm
putting<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.669> lot<00:05:16.790> of<00:05:16.820> faith<00:05:17.060> in<00:05:17.090> abilities<00:05:17.720> for

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
putting a lot of faith in abilities for

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.879 
putting a lot of faith in abilities for
this<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:18.729> hopefully<00:05:19.729> they<00:05:20.479> fix<00:05:21.169> whatever's

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
this so hopefully they fix whatever's

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.100 
this so hopefully they fix whatever's
wrong<00:05:21.919> maybe<00:05:22.729> if<00:05:23.150> there's<00:05:23.419> any<00:05:23.630> physics

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
wrong maybe if there's any physics

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.930 
wrong maybe if there's any physics
issues<00:05:24.530> or<00:05:24.740> anything<00:05:25.010> I<00:05:25.250> haven't<00:05:25.490> seen<00:05:25.760> the

vs<00:05:40.040> where<00:05:41.110> someone<00:05:42.110> activates<00:05:42.470> eax<00:05:42.950> burst<00:05:43.220> and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
vs where someone activates eax burst and

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.690 
vs where someone activates eax burst and
it<00:05:44.570> zooms<00:05:44.780> in<00:05:45.050> I<00:05:45.470> hope<00:05:45.680> every<00:05:46.039> player<00:05:46.340> sees

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
it zooms in I hope every player sees

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.590 
it zooms in I hope every player sees
that<00:05:46.940> suited<00:05:47.419> for<00:05:48.289> local<00:05:48.650> and<00:05:48.860> online<00:05:49.039> play<00:05:49.600> so
