this<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.300> really<00:02:13.750> important<00:02:14.670> after<00:02:15.670> you're

overnight or until it's dry you can

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.720 
overnight or until it's dry you can
probably<00:02:22.200> use<00:02:23.200> your<00:02:23.620> blow<00:02:23.830> dryer<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.490> cool

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
probably use your blow dryer in a cool

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.620 
probably use your blow dryer in a cool
setting<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.840> speed<00:02:26.170> up<00:02:26.320> this<00:02:26.500> process<00:02:26.710> as<00:02:27.630> you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
setting to speed up this process as you

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.510 
setting to speed up this process as you
can<00:02:29.050> see<00:02:29.290> here<00:02:29.590> I'm<00:02:29.710> having<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.070> hard<00:02:30.400> time

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
can see here I'm having a hard time

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.000 
can see here I'm having a hard time
taking<00:02:31.030> these<00:02:31.360> rollers<00:02:31.780> out<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.410> hair<00:02:32.740> I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
taking these rollers out of the hair I

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.100 
taking these rollers out of the hair I
think<00:02:33.700> that's<00:02:33.880> because<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.540> has<00:02:34.810> those

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
think that's because it has those

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.500 
think that's because it has those
brushes<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:36.100> them<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.430> pulled<00:02:36.790> out<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.970> lot<00:02:37.390> of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
brushes in them I pulled out a lot of

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.000 
brushes in them I pulled out a lot of
hair<00:02:37.720> while<00:02:37.930> trying<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.200> take<00:02:38.380> these<00:02:38.620> rollers

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
hair while trying to take these rollers

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.910 
hair while trying to take these rollers
out<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:39.940> recommend<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.780> use<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
out so I recommend that you use the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.130 
out so I recommend that you use the
plastic<00:02:42.460> rollers<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.660> clips<00:02:43.960> on

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
plastic rollers that have the clips on

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.190 
plastic rollers that have the clips on
the<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.860> can<00:02:45.010> just<00:02:45.130> clip<00:02:45.370> on<00:02:45.550> top<00:02:46.200> just

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
the that you can just clip on top just

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.720 
the that you can just clip on top just
make<00:02:47.350> sure<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.680> get<00:02:47.770> an<00:02:47.920> assorted<00:02:48.460> size

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
make sure that you get an assorted size

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.540 
make sure that you get an assorted size
after<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.960> take<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.590> roller<00:02:50.860> out<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
after you take the roller out of the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.000 
after you take the roller out of the
hair<00:02:51.910> you're<00:02:52.570> just<00:02:52.870> gonna<00:02:53.020> twist<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.800> hair

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
hair you're just gonna twist the hair

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:05.690 
hair you're just gonna twist the hair
into<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.430> nice<00:02:55.030> curled<00:02:55.720> position

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.870
