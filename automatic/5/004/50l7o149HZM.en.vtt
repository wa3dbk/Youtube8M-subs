00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.160
 quad core i7 processor and 12 whole 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.420
 beyond ram 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.190
 makes excellent for growth and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.300
 sizes use of photos videos 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.130
 playing the newest games 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.109
 but also the daily things such as or 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.520
 is and internet as first viewer 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.109
 material we see manufacturers of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.210
 a gray plastic 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.010
 perhaps to white with a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 grain in the chrome hp logo 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.519
 bull the middle at the top and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.599
 bottom you can see that I click axis 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.220
 valves so that you for example easy 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.840
 a disaster came with an interchangeable one 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.610
 battery which is nice for people who 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.700
 often traveling for example 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.800
 is 2.8 centimeters thick and 2.2 kilos heavy 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.079
 once is fairly compact for laptop with 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 with these specs especially i will have a moment 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.140
 an advice to the old man so you 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.090
 idea of ​​how big that 15.6 inch 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.590
 is about if you do n't know that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.809
 of course and if I hold those two up 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.399
 you can see that it is slightly less wide 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.590
 or just that less high but something 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.469
 wider than an a4tje and therefore enough 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.420
 space to work it is a glossy 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.280
 hd the screen which i have in itself 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 a shame as he really is a good one 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.550
 has specs 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.170
 and a laptop with or deserves power 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.299
 actually a full hd screen 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
 you can of course with the hdmi on them 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.659
 always connect an hd monitor 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.030
 but watch over the screen myself 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 not full hd is at the top of it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.570
 screen see my shares that webcam 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.680
 for very fine example skype it 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.060
 keyboard has a numeric part 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.770
 of course very nice if you were 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.880
 the keyboard often works in documents 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.100
 also enlightened she will never 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.540
 unable to see where the keys are 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 he has a nice neat to play 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.750
 is concealed in the design two physical 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.979
 button at the bottom but if you were 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.780
 Well, I don't like that , of course 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.340
 always a wired or under other mouse 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.049
 connect to the device 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.159
 in addition to the two normal speakers that are in 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.880
 the device also has two 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.950
 subwoofers 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.380
 and that are provided by beats audio 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.750
 think you also like the low tones fine 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.040
 ca n't get my blood on this laptop or 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.479
 four point 0 so that you for example you 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.220
 smartphone or tablet can be wireless 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.020
 and as I just said 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.649
 an hdmi for that extra monitor where i 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.899
 it was just over 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.460
 all usb ports that are on the device 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.960
 a shiner all fish type 0 so 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 already has a very fast with sander 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.380
 transfer in the laptop find my one 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.899
 terabyte hard drive and that's one 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.600
 conventional hard drive no ssd and 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.310
 we find a nvidia geforce gt 640 m 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.520
 so that you can play that new game 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.990
 but then for media 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.489
 settings if you want more 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.450
 know about this laptop or be it right 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.340
 want to purchase 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.940
