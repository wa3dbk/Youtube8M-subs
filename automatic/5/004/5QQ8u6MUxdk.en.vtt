00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.790
 I hope everyone is super 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.800
 well and today they will see my routine 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.960
 makeup starting at the base I'm going to 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.800
 put a few points on the whole face without 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.540
 no order 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.730
 - on the forehead because I have it super 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.679
 dry and there I can not put base then 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.599
 yes and I'm going to blur it with the viola and 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:22.740
 to sell and well let's blur 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.740
 blur 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.430
 I do not forget to tell you that I had already 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.080
 put the first the cream in all that 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.599
 that you have to put before because if 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.950
 I was not going to take hours recording but 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.329
 if I had already put everything is the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.329
 eye contour etcetera et cetera 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.250
 it was time for the proofreader I'm going 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.640
 to put in a triangle the circles under 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.200
 illuminate on the bridge of the nose and a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 little on the chin because I have a few 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.280
 granites and right now I do not have so many 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.160
 imperfections then nothing else better 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.660
 I put it in these parts as I go 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.660
 to blur with the reverse vibration 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.410
 this should do it at first but 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.240
 I forgot but they are going to put a 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.240
 balsam and we keep blurring 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.860
 it was time to seal all the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.899
 makeup with a loose village around 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.420
 the face and more in the dark circles so that 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.420
 do not do the wrinkles nobody 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.480
 and the stress of the hair so I'm going 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.310
 to tie the fringe a little bit and I'm going to 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.760
 continue to place dust in the areas that 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.760
 I lack 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.070
 with a clean brush I will blur 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.050
 all good well good so that they take off 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.300
 those excesses of dust and now I'm going to 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.050
 place a little bit of blush or rouge or 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.050
 as they say 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.189
 I'm going to pollute the face a bit 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.079
 I'm just going to give a little bit of 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.770
 tan color because I'm you in 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.780
 Spring looks very pretty and very subtle 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.550
 we will also continue contouring the nose 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.550
 so that it looks a little more finite 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.600
 the time came for the eyebrows I'm going to 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.030
 fill your eyebrows a bit with these two 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.530
 colors and good they will notice a little the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.930
 difference the truth do not me the mussels 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.240
 a lot for the day to day or they are not so 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.750
 dramatic nothing but highlighting a 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.750
 bit 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.700
 now I'm going to put a gel so that 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.810
 fix well and eyebrows I say I do not have many 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.810
 but to be in place 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.080
 for the eyelids I'm just going to put one 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.519
 shadow color ketchup and I'll know how 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.400
 a bronze tone nothing else I will apply 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.530
 that in the eyes did not apply much more nothing 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.739
 more with the fingers and I'm blurring 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.470
 and we are going to apply a shadow clarita 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.910
 vanilla color to give light in the bow 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.910
 of the eyebrow and the lacrimal 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.090
 now I'm going to take this illuminator and I'm going 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.470
 to put it in the upper areas of the face 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.470
 and ready 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.320
 I'm going to delineate the black eyes by the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.320
 water line and that fit well 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.760
 now it's time for the mascara not me 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.090
 realized that he was not recording so 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.169
 I already put on my mascara but if normal 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.570
 you know and now I have to throw myself fixer 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.100
 of makeup to last hours and 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.830
 hours because he is making good of 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.960
 heat and I will put this color 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.280
 very powerful on the lips of mac because 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.500
 you know that I love the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.510
 purple and then the makeup is not very 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.280
 charged in the eyes so we can 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.700
 put any shade of lipstick on 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.700
 lips 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.500
 I do not know if everything is for today's video 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.120
