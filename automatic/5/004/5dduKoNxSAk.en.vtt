that's just containing some green heat
gels<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> moment<00:02:06.180> they're<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.420> of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
gels at the moment they're kind of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.630 
gels at the moment they're kind of
left<00:02:06.690> over<00:02:06.900> from<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.860> winter<00:02:08.130> months

left over from that the winter months
when<00:02:08.880> here<00:02:09.149> sometimes<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.869> pretty

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
when here sometimes it can be pretty

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.590 
when here sometimes it can be pretty
difficult<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.619> get<00:02:10.770> fire<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.730> dampness

next thing to come out is essentially a

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.850 
next thing to come out is essentially a
combination<00:05:09.570> piece<00:05:10.169> of<00:05:10.320> kit<00:05:10.440> now<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.710> can

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
combination piece of kit now this can

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.189 
either be used as the Hobo stove or I
can<00:05:13.380> use<00:05:13.470> it<00:05:13.650> as<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:13.910> windbreaker<00:05:14.910> 1/2<00:05:15.509> this<00:05:16.020> is

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
can use it as a windbreaker 1/2 this is

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.110 
can use it as a windbreaker 1/2 this is
essentially<00:05:17.009> the<00:05:17.190> Hobo<00:05:17.460> stove<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.729> I'd<00:05:17.970> like

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
essentially the Hobo stove that I'd like

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.279

to<00:05:18.270> use<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.669> natural<00:05:20.880> fuel<00:05:21.389> in<00:05:21.630> quite<00:05:22.260> a

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
to use the the natural fuel in quite a

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.960 
to use the the natural fuel in quite a
large<00:05:22.530> opening<00:05:23.070> on<00:05:23.220> there<00:05:23.460> now<00:05:23.610> some<00:05:23.880> people

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
large opening on there now some people

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.560 
large opening on there now some people
might<00:05:24.210> say<00:05:24.389> too

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
might say too

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.270 
might say too
too<00:05:24.690> large<00:05:24.900> it's<00:05:25.229> not<00:05:25.530> actually<00:05:25.949> it<00:05:26.010> tends<00:05:26.220> to

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
too large it's not actually it tends to

this thing I think stainless steel again
just<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:46.349> equivalent<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.159> the<00:05:47.430> Trangia

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
just the equivalent of the the Trangia

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.360

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.720 
that and enables me just to give a
little<00:06:52.020> pinch<00:06:52.320> on<00:06:52.500> the<00:06:52.620> handles<00:06:53.040> and<00:06:53.280> that

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
little pinch on the handles and that

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.400 
little pinch on the handles and that
actually<00:06:54.000> keeps<00:06:54.210> that<00:06:54.390> upright<00:06:54.810> with<00:06:55.050> even

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
actually keeps that upright with even

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.080 
actually keeps that upright with even
four<00:06:55.590> sort<00:06:55.740> of<00:06:55.800> 400<00:06:56.220> mils<00:06:56.400> of<00:06:56.490> water<00:06:56.670> in<00:06:56.910> there

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
four sort of 400 mils of water in there

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.140 
four sort of 400 mils of water in there
perfect<00:06:57.930> distance<00:06:58.220> from<00:06:59.220> the<00:06:59.580> flames<00:06:59.850> in<00:07:00.060> the

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
perfect distance from the flames in the

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.180 
perfect distance from the flames in the
bottom<00:07:00.420> and<00:07:00.600> the<00:07:00.750> fuel<00:07:01.050> to<00:07:01.650> the<00:07:01.770> bottom<00:07:02.010> of<00:07:02.100> the

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
bottom and the fuel to the bottom of the

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.850 
bottom and the fuel to the bottom of the
mug<00:07:02.400> works<00:07:02.820> really<00:07:03.180> really<00:07:03.330> well<00:07:03.570> and<00:07:04.020> of

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
mug works really really well and of

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.500 
mug works really really well and of
course<00:07:05.100> the<00:07:05.220> final<00:07:05.580> piece<00:07:05.760> to<00:07:05.790> this<00:07:06.090> is<00:07:06.270> on<00:07:06.390> the

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
course the final piece to this is on the

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.210 
course the final piece to this is on the
bottom<00:07:06.870> this<00:07:07.050> is<00:07:07.110> actually<00:07:07.500> the<00:07:07.680> lid<00:07:07.980> of<00:07:08.100> the

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
bottom this is actually the lid of the

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.150 
bottom this is actually the lid of the
canister<00:07:08.790> which<00:07:09.450> is<00:07:09.780> what<00:07:09.960> I<00:07:09.990> use<00:07:10.350> to<00:07:10.650> cover

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
canister which is what I use to cover

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.930 
canister which is what I use to cover
the<00:07:11.400> top<00:07:12.200> generally<00:07:13.200> round<00:07:13.380> that<00:07:13.560> way<00:07:13.940> so

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
the top generally round that way so

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.850 
the top generally round that way so
again<00:07:15.060> that<00:07:15.810> enables<00:07:16.170> me<00:07:16.230> to<00:07:16.320> increase<00:07:16.710> the

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
again that enables me to increase the

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.980 
again that enables me to increase the
ball<00:07:17.010> time<00:07:17.310> for<00:07:17.490> the<00:07:17.550> fluids<00:07:17.910> in<00:07:18.060> there<00:07:18.270> the

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
ball time for the fluids in there the

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.690 
ball time for the fluids in there the
other<00:07:19.200> alternative<00:07:19.830> that<00:07:19.860> I've<00:07:20.100> got<00:07:20.340> is<00:07:20.460> if<00:07:20.580> I

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
other alternative that I've got is if I

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.880 
other alternative that I've got is if I
find<00:07:20.880> swimmer<00:07:21.450> and<00:07:21.660> the<00:07:22.230> sniffing<00:07:22.740> there

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.890 
find swimmer and the sniffing there

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.740 
find swimmer and the sniffing there
quite<00:07:23.040> nicely<00:07:23.120> the<00:07:24.120> other<00:07:24.240> option<00:07:24.570> that<00:07:24.600> I've

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
quite nicely the other option that I've

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.690 
quite nicely the other option that I've
got<00:07:24.930> is<00:07:25.050> I<00:07:25.170> can<00:07:25.350> use<00:07:25.380> this<00:07:25.680> as<00:07:25.860> the<00:07:25.980> stove<00:07:26.250> I<00:07:26.460> can

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:26.700 
got is I can use this as the stove I can

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.250 
got is I can use this as the stove I can
use<00:07:26.880> this<00:07:27.030> as<00:07:27.210> a<00:07:27.240> little<00:07:27.480> frying<00:07:27.810> pan<00:07:28.080> if

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
use this as a little frying pan if

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.490
