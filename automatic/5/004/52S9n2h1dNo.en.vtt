00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.190
 and changing the subject more channels and better visual quality are some of the 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.319
 benefits of digital television 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:14.009
 this system, although novel, will take a few years and be presented throughout the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.729
 country 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:19.659
 but in case you are worried it is necessary to specify that you do not need to buy a television 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:20.419
 new 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.289
 More details in the following note 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.690
 television is renewed 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.160
 Peru chose the Japanese-Brazilian standard for television 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.100
 digital terrestrial but what that means we will continue using the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.750
 same televisions today what costs does this change ikea risks have 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.460
 in technological change but to improve by the way quite lopez the quality of 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.600
 audio and video 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.870
 we have this that can be up to the quality of dividing among other advantages 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.650
 offered by the digital system is the possibility to see more channels of the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.420
 that we currently have 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.890
 watch television through mobile devices like cell phones 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.200
 and even from home to use the television monitor to access the internet 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.920
 However, despite the various changes that digital television involves, 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.990
 you will stop using the TVs that you have at home 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.370
 there are two possibilities is not the first time 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.480
 that we have to buy a new television with the standard that already 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.560
 it was done now that is he I do not consider Japanese 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.220
 pokÃ©mon the televisions that we have now we can use it to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.799
 through a decoder the price according to the standard of d by the way a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.409
 tube will fluctuate between the 28 30 13 5 dollars 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.410
 Although this system has its advantages, it also presents some risks 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.570
 among them the possibility 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.670
 p that the current channels want the competitors have to be very from 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.160
 the company that propagated it and hopefully it will go away employment but of that same 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.840
 advertising cake 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.820
 will be destroyed in more actors as a saint therefore 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.140
 p you have to start 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.140
 access to service remains democratic 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.770
 finally the implementation of this standard model 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.900
 will be completed within 15 years but it is necessary to emphasize that the election 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.500
 of the Brazilian Japanese standard would be under some criteria is a 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.810
 technology capable of adapting to the difficult Peruvian geography and spending 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.640
 what it will mean for users
