00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
think of you can put here it's really a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.670 
think of you can put here it's really a
nice<00:02:29.280> simple<00:02:30.280> setup<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.500> hold<00:02:32.500> your

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
nice simple setup and hold your

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.849 
nice simple setup and hold your
accessories<00:02:33.280> well<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.790> has<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.810> little<00:02:35.620> bit<00:02:35.799> of

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
accessories well it has a little bit of

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.640 
accessories well it has a little bit of
padding<00:02:36.189> here<00:02:36.609> with<00:02:37.239> what<00:02:37.930> feels<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.379> be<00:02:38.409> maybe

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
padding here with what feels to be maybe

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.910 
padding here with what feels to be maybe
a<00:02:38.769> cardboard<00:02:39.189> or<00:02:39.489> plastic<00:02:39.760> liner<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:41.260> would<00:02:41.769> say

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
a cardboard or plastic liner I would say

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.039 
a cardboard or plastic liner I would say
it's<00:02:42.040> probably<00:02:42.069> plastic<00:02:43.000> might<00:02:43.810> be<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> little

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
it's probably plastic might be a little

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.559 
it's probably plastic might be a little
bit<00:02:44.200> more<00:02:44.290> durable<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:45.430> know<00:02:45.849> scuba<00:02:46.209> cases

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
bit more durable and I know scuba cases

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.640 
bit more durable and I know scuba cases
are<00:02:46.689> made<00:02:46.840> fairly<00:02:47.230> well<00:02:47.409> so<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.049> I

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
are made fairly well so this is a I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.710 
are made fairly well so this is a I
think<00:02:51.310> it's<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.489> plastic<00:02:51.970> zipper<00:02:52.299> except<00:02:52.540> for

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
think it's a plastic zipper except for

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.330 
think it's a plastic zipper except for
this<00:02:52.840> piece<00:02:53.109> here<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.709> it's<00:02:53.859> not<00:02:53.980> really<00:02:54.040> going

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
this piece here so it's not really going

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.440 
this piece here so it's not really going
to<00:02:54.459> scratch<00:02:54.730> much<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:57.000> parts<00:02:58.000> here<00:02:58.239> these<00:02:58.389> are

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
to scratch much the parts here these are

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.770 
to scratch much the parts here these are
kind<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.079> nylon<00:02:59.530> mesh<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:01.030> nice<00:03:01.239> zippers

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
kind of a nylon mesh with nice zippers

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.339 
kind of a nylon mesh with nice zippers
and<00:03:02.909> these<00:03:03.909> are<00:03:04.209> elastic<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.049> can<00:03:05.200> just

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
and these are elastic and you can just

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.539 
and these are elastic and you can just
see<00:03:05.409> I've<00:03:05.590> got<00:03:05.650> these<00:03:05.950> cables<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.519> the

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
see I've got these cables and the

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.690 
see I've got these cables and the
headphones<00:03:06.939> in<00:03:07.120> here<00:03:07.299> so<00:03:08.139> it's<00:03:08.919> really<00:03:09.430> quite

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
headphones in here so it's really quite

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.449 
headphones in here so it's really quite
a<00:03:09.730> nice<00:03:10.030> case<00:03:10.329> I<00:03:10.569> have<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.260> say<00:03:11.439> as<00:03:11.650> far<00:03:11.680> as<00:03:12.099> how

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
a nice case I have to say as far as how

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.610 
a nice case I have to say as far as how
simple<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.419> does<00:03:13.569> a<00:03:13.599> great<00:03:13.870> job<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.409> an

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
simple it is it does a great job is an

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.110 
simple it is it does a great job is an
accessory<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.430> tablet<00:03:16.030> or<00:03:17.280> any<00:03:18.280> accessory

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
accessory to a tablet or any accessory

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.030 
accessory to a tablet or any accessory

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
so it really does a good job of that and

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.680 
so it really does a good job of that and
it<00:03:23.470> keeps<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.859> safe<00:03:24.069> so<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.329> see<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.569> do

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
it keeps it safe so you can see I do

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.000 
it keeps it safe so you can see I do
have<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.959> little<00:03:25.989> bit<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.290> wear<00:03:26.530> on<00:03:26.560> here<00:03:26.919> but

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.680 
have a little bit of wear on here but
that's<00:03:27.159> not<00:03:27.310> really<00:03:27.489> from<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:28.000> that's<00:03:28.329> from

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
that's not really from this that's from

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.960 
that's not really from this that's from
my<00:03:28.870> think<00:03:29.440> setting<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.859> down<00:03:29.889> over<00:03:30.159> there<00:03:30.310> if<00:03:30.879> I

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
my think setting it down over there if I

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.469 
my think setting it down over there if I
close<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:32.169> holds<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.829> nicely<00:03:33.209> when<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.239> zip

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:34.479
