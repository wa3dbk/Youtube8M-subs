Michelin Rob people don't realize how
tires<00:00:08.050> affect<00:00:08.559> their<00:00:08.710> vehicle<00:00:09.100> in<00:00:09.250> their

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.430 
tires affect their vehicle in their

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.160 
tires affect their vehicle in their
environment<00:00:09.940> but<00:00:10.389> today<00:00:10.630> we<00:00:10.809> hope<00:00:10.900> to<00:00:11.049> show

environment but today we hope to show
them<00:00:11.289> otherwise<00:00:11.559> that's<00:00:12.129> right<00:00:12.400> we<00:00:12.940> don't

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
them otherwise that's right we don't

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.330 
them otherwise that's right we don't
often<00:00:13.209> think<00:00:13.389> about<00:00:13.629> tires<00:00:14.100> tires<00:00:15.100> are

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
often think about tires tires are

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.680 
often think about tires tires are
actually<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:15.850> only<00:00:16.059> part<00:00:16.270> of<00:00:16.360> our<00:00:16.480> vehicle

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
actually the only part of our vehicle

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.019 
actually the only part of our vehicle
that<00:00:17.020> ever<00:00:17.140> touches<00:00:17.530> the<00:00:17.650> road<00:00:17.880> parents<00:00:18.880> can

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
that ever touches the road parents can

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.939 
that ever touches the road parents can
help<00:00:19.179> keep<00:00:19.539> us<00:00:19.720> safer<00:00:20.170> they<00:00:20.650> help<00:00:20.830> our

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
help keep us safer they help our

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.980 
help keep us safer they help our
vehicles<00:00:21.340> perform<00:00:21.789> and<00:00:22.150> they<00:00:22.480> can<00:00:22.630> also<00:00:22.750> help

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
vehicles perform and they can also help

vehicles perform and they can also help
us<00:00:23.140> save<00:00:23.380> money<00:00:23.410> through<00:00:23.859> fuel<00:00:24.189> efficiency

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
us save money through fuel efficiency

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.300 
us save money through fuel efficiency
and<00:00:25.119> Michelin<00:00:25.689> we<00:00:26.259> designed<00:00:26.560> tires<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:27.070> last

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
and Michelin we designed tires the last

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.640 
and Michelin we designed tires the last
long<00:00:27.609> stop<00:00:28.240> short<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.900> are<00:00:29.169> more<00:00:29.349> fuel

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
long stop short and are more fuel

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.800 
long stop short and are more fuel
efficient<00:00:30.160> so<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.910> type<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.150> tires<00:00:31.480> really

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
efficient so the type of tires really

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.170 
efficient so the type of tires really
does<00:00:32.079> matter<00:00:32.290> absolutely<00:00:33.130> in<00:00:33.250> fact<00:00:33.460> if<00:00:34.030> we

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
does matter absolutely in fact if we

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.120 
does matter absolutely in fact if we
take<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.510> Michelin<00:00:34.840> hydrogen<00:00:35.380> as<00:00:35.680> an<00:00:35.800> example

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
take the Michelin hydrogen as an example

in a different portion of the track what

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.240 
in a different portion of the track what
will<00:01:01.570> we<00:01:01.690> see<00:01:01.870> here<00:01:02.140> well<00:01:02.860> we<00:01:02.950> talked<00:01:03.190> about

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
will we see here well we talked about

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.979 
will we see here well we talked about
two<00:01:03.610> ways<00:01:03.790> that<00:01:04.030> your<00:01:04.150> vehicle<00:01:04.540> can<00:01:04.689> help<00:01:04.900> you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
two ways that your vehicle can help you

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.510 
two ways that your vehicle can help you
save<00:01:05.199> money<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.890> second<00:01:06.220> we're<00:01:06.340> going<00:01:06.430> to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
save money the second we're going to

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.860 
save money the second we're going to
talk<00:01:06.670> about<00:01:06.700> is<00:01:07.090> through<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.330> force<00:01:07.600> called

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
talk about is through a force called

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.500 
talk about is through a force called
rolling<00:01:08.290> resistance<00:01:08.760> rolling<00:01:09.760> resistance<00:01:09.910> is

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
rolling resistance rolling resistance is

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.060 
rolling resistance rolling resistance is
actually<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:11.080> force<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.560> your<00:01:11.710> vehicle

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
actually the force that your vehicle

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.890 
actually the force that your vehicle
must<00:01:12.220> overcome<00:01:12.520> in<00:01:12.970> order<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.390> keep<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.750> moving

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
must overcome in order to keep it moving

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.520 
must overcome in order to keep it moving
forward

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
forward

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.470 
forward
it<00:01:15.160> sounds<00:01:15.520> more<00:01:15.640> complicated<00:01:16.300> than<00:01:16.360> it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
it sounds more complicated than it

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.899 
it sounds more complicated than it
actually<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:17.650> easier<00:01:18.070> your<00:01:18.250> tires<00:01:18.460> are<00:01:18.730> to

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
actually is the easier your tires are to

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.450 
actually is the easier your tires are to
roll<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.780> less<00:01:20.050> force<00:01:20.680> that's<00:01:20.920> required<00:01:21.040> out

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
roll the less force that's required out

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.950 
roll the less force that's required out
of<00:01:21.580> your<00:01:21.730> engine<00:01:21.909> that<00:01:22.570> means<00:01:22.720> less<00:01:22.930> money

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
of your engine that means less money

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.320 
of your engine that means less money
spent<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:23.620> fuel<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.040> less<00:01:24.430> co2<00:01:24.700> release<00:01:25.150> than

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
spent on fuel and less co2 release than

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.130 
spent on fuel and less co2 release than
in<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.480> environment

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
in the environment

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.260 
in the environment
let's<00:01:26.530> take<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> look<00:01:26.950> here<00:01:27.159> both<00:01:27.940> vehicles

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
let's take a look here both vehicles

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.330 
let's take a look here both vehicles
accelerated<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.200> same<00:01:29.440> speed<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.070> then

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
accelerated to the same speed and then

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.940 
accelerated to the same speed and then
let<00:01:30.550> off<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.880> gas<00:01:31.030> at<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.360> same<00:01:31.570> time<00:01:31.950> the
