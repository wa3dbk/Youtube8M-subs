00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.410 

then<00:02:36.280> we<00:02:36.400> tracks<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:39.640> looks

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
then we tracks it looks

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.780 
then we tracks it looks
they're<00:02:41.110> both<00:02:41.200> 2.4<00:02:41.800> gigahertz<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.430> think

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.100 

otherwise<00:02:45.790> are<00:02:46.000> pretty<00:02:46.209> similar<00:02:46.510> $10

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
otherwise are pretty similar $10

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.000 
otherwise are pretty similar $10
difference<00:02:50.700> he's<00:02:51.700> been<00:02:51.910> doing<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.150> six<00:02:52.450> l<00:02:52.810> or

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
difference he's been doing the six l or

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.550 
difference he's been doing the six l or
me<00:02:54.010> now<00:02:54.160> six<00:02:54.430> well<00:02:54.610> six<00:02:55.000> volt<00:02:55.390> five<00:02:56.050> sounds

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
me now six well six volt five sounds

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
me now six well six volt five sounds
nickel<00:02:57.070> metal<00:02:57.160> hydride<00:02:57.340> battery<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.810> think

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
nickel metal hydride battery but I think

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.479 
nickel metal hydride battery but I think
this<00:03:00.580> one<00:03:00.910> comes<00:03:01.209> with<00:03:04.650> six<00:03:05.650> point<00:03:05.950> two<00:03:06.160> volt

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
this one comes with six point two volt

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.830 
this one comes with six point two volt
1200<00:03:07.420> mAh<00:03:07.540> battery

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.089 

so<00:03:12.840> they<00:03:13.650> look<00:03:13.829> very<00:03:14.129> similar<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.970> think<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
so they look very similar I think the

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.890 
so they look very similar I think the
microwave<00:03:17.099> or<00:03:17.519> looks<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.849> lot<00:03:17.970> better<00:03:18.150> probably

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
microwave or looks a lot better probably

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.190 
microwave or looks a lot better probably
will<00:03:19.170> perform<00:03:19.579> better<00:03:23.540> either<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.840> them<00:03:25.019> are

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
will perform better either of them are

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.270 
will perform better either of them are
out<00:03:25.500> quite<00:03:25.980> yet

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.729 

this<00:03:29.280> one<00:03:29.489> will<00:03:29.730> be<00:03:29.760> out<00:03:30.079> mid-july<00:03:31.079> well<00:03:31.709> I

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
this one will be out mid-july well I

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.099 
this one will be out mid-july well I
think
