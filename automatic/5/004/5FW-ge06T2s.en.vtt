00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:12.360
 him so yes I'm here for you 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:16.030
 present so my Spanish team so 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.950
 so I find it very interesting 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:25.240
 so I play in 4 1 2 1 2 this is a 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:29.050
 good device so then we have 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.380
 casillas at the bar so very good guardian 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.020
 this is the best of the game itself 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.210
 play then right I took juanfran 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.440
 because in fact 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.690
 arbeloa there was but 80 but the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.399
 departures so I preferred to take a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.090
 train that was enraged that goes faster 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:52.359
 and who defends better than arbeloa convoy 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.760
 that's my choice then I took sergio 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.510
 ramos so nothing to say ramos so who 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.199
 defends well 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.140
 he finds fast enough so impeccable to 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.670
 his sides I took pique so he defends 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.720
 well on corners and for good 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.689
 to score 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.310
 So here paris as the defender ramos 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.380
 georgian bay goes fast 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.189
 they defend well it's pretty 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.320
 therefore applicable technique 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.610
 defensive midfielder in front of the defense they 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.610
 advance chair that fabregas 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.950
 so here with fabregas at these 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.299
 techniques that can go up a bit and 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.670
 give caviars 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.700
 so that's fine then right genius 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.450
 rights have boosted name that goes fast there 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.960
 Mark 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.340
 he can deliver good looks that's 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.240
 impeccable 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.479
 on the left we have iniesta that's all 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.359
 the world will of course know it 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.600
 is very technical including caviar 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:58.659
 impeccable it can also mark 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.049
 so that's when we say we have 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.039
 david silva so this is a man a very 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.539
 good organizer 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.190
 he can he can mark he has a good 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.769
 strikes from afar they distribute this lack 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.319
 at leers is impeccable then we 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.739
 have torres in tip 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:21.310
 so he also marks here it's a 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.110
 justified choice against there when you 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.360
 can see it I put cazorla or list 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.340
 is in base so at the base he was 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.720
 offensive midfielder I wanted to do it 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.790
 ride in front because he's 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.400
 interesting he has a good typing of 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.640
 ball a good ball driving 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.780
 he dribbles well he pulls well he can 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.870
 make passes to torres so here you go 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.000
 cazorla so here I think you have 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.930
 everything says about this Spanish team that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.130
 is really not bad 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:56.069
 she is practically all played at the esam that 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.420
 that's good ben voila I 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.730
 tell you next time for a 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.730
 next video go ciao ciao
