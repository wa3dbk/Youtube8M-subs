00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.020 

so<00:04:16.859> one<00:04:17.859> of<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.070> things<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.370> we<00:04:18.579> do<00:04:18.880> with

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
so one of the things that we do with

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.550 
so one of the things that we do with
game<00:04:19.239> works<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.600> something<00:04:19.959> called<00:04:20.079> hair<00:04:20.380> work

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
game works is something called hair work

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.490 
game works is something called hair work
so<00:04:20.859> if<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.010> look<00:04:21.160> on<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:21.459> character<00:04:21.730> he<00:04:22.030> has

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
so if you look on this character he has

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.980 
so if you look on this character he has
simulated<00:04:23.500> hair<00:04:24.100> on<00:04:24.400> his<00:04:25.210> body<00:04:25.390> he's<00:04:25.660> covered

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
simulated hair on his body he's covered

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.050 
simulated hair on his body he's covered
in<00:04:26.110> little<00:04:26.440> tiny<00:04:26.710> particles<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.640> make<00:04:28.030> up

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
in little tiny particles that make up

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.010 
in little tiny particles that make up
hairs<00:04:29.910> those<00:04:30.910> are<00:04:31.030> being<00:04:31.120> simulated<00:04:31.450> using

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
hairs those are being simulated using

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.100 
hairs those are being simulated using
our<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:33.430> know<00:04:33.550> basically<00:04:34.540> our<00:04:34.750> special

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
our you know basically our special

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.290 
our you know basically our special
technology<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.580> that's<00:04:36.820> part<00:04:37.090> of<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.270> game

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
technology and that's part of the game

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.260 
technology and that's part of the game
works<00:04:37.570> program<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.620> we're<00:04:39.490> super<00:04:39.880> excited<00:04:39.910> to

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
works program so we're super excited to

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.560 
works program so we're super excited to
work<00:04:40.450> with<00:04:40.510> s2<00:04:41.169> on<00:04:41.410> strife<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.419> give<00:04:43.419> them

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
work with s2 on strife and give them

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.930 
work with s2 on strife and give them
some<00:04:43.810> of<00:04:43.930> our<00:04:44.110> art<00:04:44.770> game<00:04:45.130> works<00:04:45.310> technologies

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
some of our art game works technologies

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.570 
some of our art game works technologies
to<00:04:46.150> enhance<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:47.230> high-end<00:04:47.620> graphics<00:04:48.040> of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
to enhance the high-end graphics of

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.390 
to enhance the high-end graphics of
strength<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:50.020> this<00:04:50.200> for<00:04:50.350> example<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.919> hair

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
strength so this for example is the hair

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.490 
strength so this for example is the hair
works<00:04:51.580> on<00:04:51.760> its<00:04:51.910> tail<00:04:52.090> they're<00:04:52.390> on<00:04:52.840> ray<00:04:53.200> and

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
works on its tail they're on ray and

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.620 
works on its tail they're on ray and
then<00:04:54.220> what<00:04:54.820> we're<00:04:54.970> actually<00:04:55.090> going<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.419> do<00:04:55.540> is

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
then what we're actually going to do is

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.780 
then what we're actually going to do is
we're<00:04:55.720> going<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:55.870> go<00:04:56.020> into<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.410> game<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.890> show

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
we're going to go into the game and show

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.260 
we're going to go into the game and show
you<00:04:57.850> guys<00:04:58.740> some<00:04:59.740> cool<00:04:59.950> effects<00:05:01.320> in<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.500> game

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
you guys some cool effects in the game

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.310 
you guys some cool effects in the game
so<00:05:04.270> what<00:05:04.600> we're<00:05:04.720> going<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:04.900> do<00:05:04.990> is<00:05:05.110> we're<00:05:05.230> going

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.690 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:05:05.410> show<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.590> some<00:05:05.950> of<00:05:05.979> those<00:05:06.190> effects<00:05:06.550> that

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
to show you some of those effects that

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.680 
to show you some of those effects that
we've<00:05:06.850> already<00:05:07.000> put<00:05:07.300> into<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.600> game<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:09.690> kind

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
we've already put into the game and kind

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.240 
we've already put into the game and kind
of<00:05:10.750> give<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:10.960> an<00:05:10.990> example<00:05:11.440> of<00:05:11.650> what<00:05:11.830> we<00:05:11.919> can<00:05:12.070> do

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
of give you an example of what we can do

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.000 
of give you an example of what we can do
with<00:05:12.550> food<00:05:12.760> that's<00:05:13.000> in<00:05:13.350> game<00:05:14.350> works<00:05:14.560> so<00:05:14.800> if<00:05:14.890> you

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
with food that's in game works so if you

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.670 
with food that's in game works so if you
see<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:16.050> particles<00:05:17.050> created<00:05:17.229> by<00:05:17.530> this

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
see the the particles created by this

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.070 
see the the particles created by this
hero<00:05:17.950> when<00:05:18.160> he<00:05:18.310> slams<00:05:18.640> down<00:05:18.880> is<00:05:19.090> ability<00:05:19.390> are

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
hero when he slams down is ability are

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.420 
hero when he slams down is ability are
actually<00:05:20.440> interactable<00:05:20.979> see<00:05:21.280> how<00:05:21.370> the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
actually interactable see how the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.890 
actually interactable see how the
character<00:05:21.820> can<00:05:22.030> kick<00:05:22.180> them<00:05:22.300> around<00:05:22.419> like<00:05:22.720> that

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
character can kick them around like that

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.560 
character can kick them around like that
that's<00:05:23.680> because<00:05:23.860> they're<00:05:24.040> their<00:05:24.820> simulated

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
that's because they're their simulated

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.400 
that's because they're their simulated
particles<00:05:26.169> so<00:05:26.229> they're<00:05:26.380> actually<00:05:27.240> rigidbody

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
particles so they're actually rigidbody

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.750 
particles so they're actually rigidbody
particles<00:05:29.410> that<00:05:29.530> exist<00:05:29.919> in<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.160> world<00:05:30.190> and

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
particles that exist in the world and

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.170 
particles that exist in the world and
the<00:05:30.940> character<00:05:31.330> can<00:05:31.510> interact

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
the character can interact

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.560 
the character can interact
it's<00:05:32.690> pretty<00:05:32.900> cool<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:34.460> game<00:05:34.729> works<00:05:34.940> is<00:05:35.060> as<00:05:35.120> the

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
it's pretty cool so game works is as the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.210 
it's pretty cool so game works is as the
library<00:05:35.990> is<00:05:36.110> really<00:05:36.199> cool<00:05:36.470> because<00:05:36.680> we<00:05:37.009> work

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
library is really cool because we work

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.860 
library is really cool because we work
with<00:05:37.430> developers<00:05:37.669> to<00:05:38.389> integrate<00:05:38.419> the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
with developers to integrate the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.420 
with developers to integrate the
technology<00:05:39.410> of<00:05:39.440> their<00:05:39.620> game<00:05:39.860> but<00:05:40.039> we<00:05:40.190> can<00:05:40.340> do

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
technology of their game but we can do

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.430 
technology of their game but we can do
this<00:05:40.550> on<00:05:40.669> different<00:05:41.060> levels<00:05:41.199> so<00:05:42.199> for<00:05:42.380> this

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
this on different levels so for this

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.310 
this on different levels so for this
particular<00:05:42.620> game<00:05:43.130> they<00:05:43.340> have<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:44.320> custom

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
particular game they have a custom

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.379 
particular game they have a custom
engine<00:05:45.680> s2<00:05:46.130> created<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.580> custom<00:05:46.759> engine<00:05:47.210> for

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
engine s2 created a custom engine for

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.420 
engine s2 created a custom engine for
this<00:05:47.479> game<00:05:47.660> and<00:05:47.900> so<00:05:48.530> we<00:05:48.680> can<00:05:48.860> come<00:05:49.039> in<00:05:49.160> with<00:05:49.280> our

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
this game and so we can come in with our

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.830 
this game and so we can come in with our
engineers<00:05:49.880> and<00:05:50.150> kind<00:05:50.330> of<00:05:50.389> work<00:05:50.539> with<00:05:50.690> those

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
engineers and kind of work with those

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.040 
engineers and kind of work with those
guys<00:05:51.020> to<00:05:51.550> collaborate<00:05:52.550> on<00:05:52.789> art<00:05:53.180> assets<00:05:53.690> and

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
guys to collaborate on art assets and

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.590 
guys to collaborate on art assets and
different<00:05:54.919> things<00:05:55.100> to<00:05:55.250> make<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.639> make<00:05:56.090> their

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
different things to make the make their

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.749 
different things to make the make their
game<00:05:56.750> look<00:05:56.930> cool<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:58.190> that's<00:05:58.370> where<00:05:58.520> you<00:05:58.639> get

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
game look cool and that's where you get

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:59.800 
game look cool and that's where you get
the<00:05:58.820> effects<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.270> you're<00:05:59.449> looking<00:05:59.539> at<00:05:59.780> right

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
the effects that you're looking at right

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.480 
the effects that you're looking at right
now<00:05:59.900> so<00:06:00.169> as<00:06:00.320> he<00:06:00.470> walks<00:06:00.710> through<00:06:01.009> that<00:06:01.039> spoke

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
now so as he walks through that spoke

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.310 
now so as he walks through that spoke
yeah<00:06:01.759> see<00:06:02.539> how<00:06:02.660> it<00:06:02.780> interacts<00:06:03.139> with<00:06:03.229> the

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
yeah see how it interacts with the

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.890 
yeah see how it interacts with the
character<00:06:03.740> and<00:06:03.949> kind<00:06:04.160> of<00:06:04.720> loser<00:06:05.720> out

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.090 

as<00:06:10.990> he<00:06:11.139> walks<00:06:11.350> through<00:06:11.500> it

as he walks through it

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.790 
as he walks through it

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
so this is our test application that we

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.100 
so this is our test application that we
can<00:06:15.950> use<00:06:15.980> to<00:06:16.160> test<00:06:16.610> different<00:06:16.820> effects<00:06:17.330> so

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110
