different<00:01:56.590> presentation<00:01:57.399> than<00:01:57.580> jigging<00:01:57.849> I

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
different presentation than jigging I

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.160 
different presentation than jigging I
think<00:01:58.090> sometimes<00:01:58.450> especially<00:01:58.630> impression

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
think sometimes especially impression

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.889 
think sometimes especially impression
lakes<00:01:59.410> they<00:01:59.950> see<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.280> jig<00:02:00.489> and<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.780> know

they're<00:02:02.229> more<00:02:02.979> hesitant<00:02:03.459> to<00:02:03.489> hit<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.849> rather

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
they're more hesitant to hit it rather

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.880 
they're more hesitant to hit it rather
than<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.450> crank<00:02:04.810> bait<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.259> they<00:02:05.500> haven't<00:02:05.770> seen
