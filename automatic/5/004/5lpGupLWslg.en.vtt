 the Eindhoven marathon and will start on Sunday for the 26th time 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.490

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:14.629
 nervous 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.099
 I am a ca man it was for the 25th time so 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.730
 Thursday morning was of course also present at the press conference 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.319
 what can we expect from it 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.919
 the club is in any case the team of different people 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.699
 Yes that is 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.780
 considering the field of participants 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780
 the participants afterwards the athlete who already 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.910
 often won 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.120
 I think it will be a very good match there 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.410
 Barton is unpredictable from a setback for time but from a point 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.600
 more that the sudden 2 6 is run and time one 72 I think I 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.740
 and my sentence like xtc 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.810
 martijn to the civil court 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.990
 he got over the wheel and clapped 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.540
 he focuses on a time of 2 hours and 7 minutes and 30 seconds 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.479
 he is on paper with a personal record of 2 hours and 7 minutes and 12 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.000
 seconds and from the fastest runners 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.100
 but also last year's winner is going to see Jeffrey in Moerdijk and the Philip

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.980
 walked for less than 2 hours and 8 minutes 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.770
 they spoke of a strong field of participants when the youth fall by 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.580
 Jeffrey finished the room two games 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.580

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.580

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.400
 I think this is an earlier post 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.460
 On the board stood the medium can be a few years to deliver I am 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.920
 broadcast time it was a nice place six this has the effect because it 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.180
 The truth remains is that I have a response 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.660
 the detainees hurt the queen it was literally there is even to be shortened 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.050
 but 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.470
 March and I credit the urban owner for being late 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.469

 he looks back with great satisfaction 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.669
