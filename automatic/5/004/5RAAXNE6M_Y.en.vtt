 or your video cassette or us or pay-TV and at the same time 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.070
 time never seen sounds and it did not go so well 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.110
 It's alright not to do with the book as an object. 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.860
 were so threatening that and yet so many were never sold 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.560
 books of the world that Brazil is not an exception the growth of the market 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.619
 editorial 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.669
 is very large especially because of the affective relationship 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.529
 What do we have with 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.900
 what are the main challenges facing the world for countries like France and 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:28.849
 Brazil 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.729
 they are very big challenges 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.150
 In the case of France, I think 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.300
 I do not know if a Frenchwoman who presented a French one is the present 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.780
 but many have already felt it is because france lost 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.850
 the racing opportunities could have boarded 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.740
 I know if you typed France in the 70's in the 80's with ronaldo 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.990
 cape fear 3 an important part of the upper course but does not know it 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.670
 the mini tell 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.580
 was a postulate is a small television password 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.410
 that French families had at home 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.380
 and where you could access for example cultural programming read the reviews 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.440
 of film dozens of recent movies sector books 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.300
 and yet on account of duncan a colleague 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.990
 the activity 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.720
 and the lack of strategic vision of an important part of the entrepreneurs 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.350
 French military did not perform because later it would be 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.350
 process mechanisms such as comex 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.820

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.060
 france today bush 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.130
 through the internet and society iets 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.980
 especially cultural diversity 'and she protected herself from land 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.860
 technologically it is vile I would say rabbani the mind 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.220
 this summary is the world view 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.469
 because if you who have ever been in france a country of French language 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.679
 and they did what they wanted to write an email you know goals 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.659
 different buttons is very complicated, right? 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.890
 it does not exist for example an alphabet and even in the case would not follow 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.970
 are there, this ends up working with a kind of barrier 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.829
 for protectionist 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.099
 to the ticket 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.440
 of force ditch the house pure home 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.320
 and almost a billy calvin klein of english rock that revolution 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.739
 technological 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.749
 in the case of Brazil 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.240
 this revolution is also exposing some risk phrase 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.640
 but also some opportunities we are a country today 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.719
 and has essentially 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:33.649
 the gross domestic power of more than 20 1 trillion and 500 billion davi sectors 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.489
 club's internal purchasing power par 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.590
 Portuguese wants to want or not 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.169
 is the seventh most spoken language in the world 300 million people act today 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.999
 they speak Portuguese so the language that will also create ends up creating 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.290
 1 marks psd market reserve the contents produced for this 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.890
 network 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.029
 of countries that speak 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.869
 who speak Portuguese so we have there I think a great chance 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.969
 especially if we hurry not just in the 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.560
 technology itself but also in the part of 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.919
 that part of the content is not 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.829
 I would say that 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.870
 man was not new media ronaldo I do not know if he is happier or if 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:18.950
 he is - they what I can say is that he has maybe more than ever 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.330
 possible tools to build even if technologically 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.610
