00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.799 
myself I got this one at Godzilla first
I<00:00:32.870> believe<00:00:34.370> there<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.399> only<00:00:35.760> 600<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> these

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I believe there was only 600 of these

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.459 
I believe there was only 600 of these
made<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> yeah<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:41.399> pretty<00:00:42.200> as<00:00:43.200> you'd

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
made and so yeah it's pretty as you'd

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.130 
made and so yeah it's pretty as you'd
say<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.800> pretty<00:00:43.980> rare<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.430> year<00:00:44.780> if<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.930> die

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
say it's pretty rare for a year if I die

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.790 
say it's pretty rare for a year if I die
I<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:46.739> since<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.789> bought<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.800> glad

I was you know since I bought it so glad

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.700 
I was you know since I bought it so glad
I<00:00:49.829> bought<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> when<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> did<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.750> uh<00:00:52.489> well<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
I bought it when I did and uh well I

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.840 
I bought it when I did and uh well I
guess<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.329> little<00:00:57.329> bit<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.690> history<00:00:58.079> gabru<00:00:58.850> only

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
guess a little bit of history gabru only

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
guess a little bit of history gabru only
made<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.210> movie<00:01:00.539> appearance<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.710> was

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
made one movie appearance and that was

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
made one movie appearance and that was
in<00:01:04.400> Godzilla's<00:01:05.400> revenge<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.270> forgot<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> name

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
in Godzilla's revenge I forgot the name

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.510 
in Godzilla's revenge I forgot the name
for<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> second<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.720> he's<00:01:09.720> pretty<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.490> not<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
for a second and he's pretty much not a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
for a second and he's pretty much not a
lot<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.880> people<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.330> whether<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:12.900> he's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
lot of people know whether or not he's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.370 
lot of people know whether or not he's
really<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:14.549> real<00:01:14.790> mafia<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.540> pieces<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.020> dream

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
really a real mafia or pieces of dream

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
really a real mafia or pieces of dream
monster<00:01:17.420> but<00:01:18.650> because<00:01:19.650> he<00:01:20.220> only<00:01:20.520> appears<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
monster but because he only appears and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.380 
monster but because he only appears and
dreams<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.930> you've<00:01:22.110> never<00:01:22.259> seen<00:01:22.590> him<00:01:22.710> since

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
dreams that you've never seen him since

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
dreams that you've never seen him since
so<00:01:24.799> that's<00:01:25.799> always<00:01:26.040> debatable<00:01:27.350> but<00:01:28.350> what's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so that's always debatable but what's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.530 
so that's always debatable but what's
going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:31.159> articulation<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.400> you've<00:01:33.240> got<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
going to articulation know you've got a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.890 
going to articulation know you've got a
few<00:01:33.780> points<00:01:33.990> um<00:01:35.240> he's<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.930> arms<00:01:37.549> rotate

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
few points um he's got the arms rotate

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.609 
few points um he's got the arms rotate
360<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> hands

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
360 the hands

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.550 
360 the hands
rotate<00:01:45.579> all<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.329> way<00:01:46.570> around<00:01:46.719> it's<00:01:47.289> a<00:01:47.380> little

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
rotate all the way around it's a little

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.469 
rotate all the way around it's a little
tough<00:01:47.829> but<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:49.750> do<00:01:49.810> go<00:01:50.969> 360<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.440 

here<00:01:57.479> there<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.990> blue<00:01:58.380> seal<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.450> hadn't

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
here there is a blue seal I hadn't

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.280 
here there is a blue seal I hadn't
broken

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
broken

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.280 
broken
I<00:02:01.320> might<00:02:01.979> pretty<00:02:02.280> good<00:02:02.520> uh<00:02:02.700> uh<00:02:03.080> that's<00:02:04.080> already

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
I might pretty good uh uh that's already

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
I might pretty good uh uh that's already
kind<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.740> broken<00:02:05.159> right<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.939> can't<00:02:06.540> see

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
kind of broken right there I can't see

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.330 
kind of broken right there I can't see
that<00:02:07.399> but<00:02:08.399> yeah<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.380> that's<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.860> yah<00:02:11.039> why<00:02:11.310> I

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that but yeah so that's the yah why I

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.430 
that but yeah so that's the yah why I
must<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.910> cadra<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:13.400> now<00:02:14.400> let's<00:02:14.640> do<00:02:14.819> some

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
must have cadra and now let's do some

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.979 
must have cadra and now let's do some
sizing<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.430> first<00:02:17.900> just<00:02:20.030> first<00:02:21.030> opponent

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
sizing so first just first opponent

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.589 
sizing so first just first opponent
I<00:02:22.190> mean<00:02:23.190> yeah<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.950> um<00:02:26.160> all<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.420> two

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
I mean yeah and um all I have is the two

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.790 
I mean yeah and um all I have is the two
inch<00:02:28.970> Bandai<00:02:29.970> creations<00:02:30.019> meeting<00:02:31.019> up<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:31.500> I

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
inch Bandai creations meeting up but I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.190 
inch Bandai creations meeting up but I
think<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.330> actually<00:02:33.540> accurate<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.830> to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
think this is actually accurate as to

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.940 
think this is actually accurate as to
for<00:02:37.200> me<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:38.850> know<00:02:39.080> magically<00:02:40.080> just<00:02:40.290> every

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
for me you know magically just every

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.990 
for me you know magically just every
rule<00:02:41.630> that's<00:02:42.630> that's<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:44.660> size

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.920 

and<00:02:52.000> next<00:02:53.000> up<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:54.160> Godzilla<00:02:55.160> who<00:02:56.120> fought

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
and next up is Godzilla who fought

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.770 
and next up is Godzilla who fought
Gabrielle<00:02:57.850> after<00:02:58.850> he<00:02:59.060> beat<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.390> crap<00:02:59.420> out<00:02:59.750> of

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
Gabrielle after he beat the crap out of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:08.920 
Gabrielle after he beat the crap out of
me<00:02:59.990> for<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.410> while<00:03:04.750> well<00:03:07.210> well<00:03:08.210> what<00:03:08.780> about

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
me for a while well well what about

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.710 
me for a while well well what about
right<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.410> would<00:03:09.770> think<00:03:10.090> gabbro<00:03:11.090> was<00:03:11.270> I<00:03:11.510> believe

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
right I would think gabbro was I believe

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.740 
right I would think gabbro was I believe
was<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.290> little<00:03:12.530> bit<00:03:12.650> taller<00:03:12.890> than<00:03:13.040> Godzilla<00:03:16.750> so

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
was a little bit taller than Godzilla so

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.199 
was a little bit taller than Godzilla so
this<00:03:17.930> looks<00:03:18.200> pretty<00:03:18.350> accurate<00:03:23.890> figure<00:03:25.209> very

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
this looks pretty accurate figure very

worth<00:05:18.520> it<00:05:18.820> because<00:05:19.650> up<00:05:20.650> until<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:21.160> point
