been frustrating this week you try to
analyze<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.890> sunspots<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> you're<00:01:47.670> getting

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
analyze the sunspots and you're getting

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880 
analyze the sunspots and you're getting
nothing<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.330> grainy<00:01:48.690> images<00:01:49.350> more<00:01:49.590> than<00:01:49.740> half

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
nothing but grainy images more than half

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.370 
nothing but grainy images more than half
the<00:01:50.070> time<00:01:50.310> I'll<00:01:50.640> quickly<00:01:51.330> note<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.840> incoming

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the time I'll quickly note the incoming

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.260 
the time I'll quickly note the incoming
sunspot<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.130> watch<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.549> north<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:53.940> then<00:01:54.090> let's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
sunspot to watch up north but then let's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
sunspot to watch up north but then let's
go<00:01:54.390> ahead<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> lean<00:01:54.900> on<00:01:55.049> solent<00:01:55.500> info<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
go ahead and lean on solent info for a

go ahead and lean on solent info for a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
better look this is the flare maker so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.250
