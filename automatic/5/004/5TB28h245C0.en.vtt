cagliari cagliari I've no idea how you
pronounce<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.380> that's<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> nature

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
pronounce it but that's the nature

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.160 
pronounce it but that's the nature
that's<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> team<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.060> he<00:01:15.689> played<00:01:15.869> 20<00:01:16.140> games

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that's the team and he played 20 games

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
that's the team and he played 20 games
for<00:01:16.439> them<00:01:16.619> only<00:01:16.890> scored<00:01:17.369> four<00:01:17.460> goals<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.299> only

it'll<00:01:51.930> be<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> 9<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.619> 15<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.430> he<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.820> be

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
it'll be as a 9 on 15 because he will be

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
moving over to the bright side because

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.469 
moving over to the bright side because
he's<00:01:56.009> played<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.460> most<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.969> his<00:01:57.090> games<00:01:57.149> all

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
he's played the most of his games all

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
he's played the most of his games all
the<00:01:57.540> majority<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.930> his<00:01:58.049> games<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.070> right

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the majority of his games at that right

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.709 
the majority of his games at that right
mid<00:01:59.460> position<00:01:59.640> all<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.119> right<00:02:00.390> wing<00:02:00.570> position

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
mid position all the right wing position

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.969 
mid position all the right wing position
so<00:02:01.079> I'm<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.259> too<00:02:01.320> sure<00:02:01.530> whether<00:02:01.710> it'll<00:02:01.860> be

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
so I'm not too sure whether it'll be

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.380 
so I'm not too sure whether it'll be
right<00:02:02.130> Nadal<00:02:02.490> right<00:02:02.670> wing<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:02.939> believe<00:02:03.270> it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
right Nadal right wing I do believe it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.749 
right Nadal right wing I do believe it
will<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.719> mid<00:02:03.899> because<00:02:04.469> he<00:02:04.590> has<00:02:04.740> had<00:02:04.920> 22

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
will be right mid because he has had 22

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.639 
will be right mid because he has had 22
in<00:02:06.060> farm<00:02:06.329> cats<00:02:06.540> at<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:07.049> mid<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.439> that's

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
in farm cats at right mid so that's

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.440 
in farm cats at right mid so that's
clearly<00:02:08.129> way<00:02:08.310> plays<00:02:08.610> most<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.000> his<00:02:09.119> games<00:02:09.149> at

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
clearly way plays most of his games at

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.510 
clearly way plays most of his games at
Dortmund<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.500> season<00:02:10.800> he<00:02:10.890> played<00:02:11.009> 24

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
and his speed will go down one in my

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.160 
and his speed will go down one in my
opinion<00:03:26.640> because<00:03:26.880> obviously<00:03:27.150> getting<00:03:27.750> older
