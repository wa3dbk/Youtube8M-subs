00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
some safety glasses and I started

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.340 
some safety glasses and I started
wearing<00:01:22.350> them<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.150> my<00:01:24.150> eyes<00:01:24.390> does<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:25.049> burn

any<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.759> reason<00:01:27.000> why<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> believe

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
any more and the reason why I believe

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.649 
any more and the reason why I believe
our<00:01:28.320> eyes<00:01:28.530> burn<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.369> we're<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.030> close<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
our eyes burn because we're so close to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
our eyes burn because we're so close to
people<00:01:30.990> head<00:01:31.290> wear<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.549> we're<00:01:32.790> locking

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
people head wear when we're locking

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.260 
people head wear when we're locking
their<00:01:33.689> hair<00:01:33.990> retightening<00:01:34.680> their<00:01:34.860> hair<00:01:35.270> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
their hair retightening their hair the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.929 
their hair retightening their hair the
oil<00:01:36.570> from<00:01:37.079> their<00:01:37.320> scalp<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.979> dander<00:01:38.549> from

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
oil from their scalp the dander from

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.630 
oil from their scalp the dander from
their<00:01:39.119> scalp<00:01:39.420> loose<00:01:39.720> hair<00:01:40.049> fly<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.159> into<00:01:41.490> our

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
their scalp loose hair fly up into our

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.819 
their scalp loose hair fly up into our
face<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.180> microscopic<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:43.680> really

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
face is microscopic so we don't really

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.280 
face is microscopic so we don't really
pay

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
pay

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.130 
pay
we<00:01:44.680> can't<00:01:44.920> even<00:01:45.220> fill<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.700> but<00:01:46.270> all<00:01:46.510> that<00:01:46.870> is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
we can't even fill it but all that is

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.340 
we can't even fill it but all that is
going<00:01:47.470> on<00:01:47.740> in<00:01:48.010> our<00:01:48.160> face<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:49.720> gets<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.230> our

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
going on in our face and it gets in our

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.170 
going on in our face and it gets in our
eyes<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:51.010> so<00:01:51.190> that's<00:01:51.430> what<00:01:51.670> causes<00:01:51.910> the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
eyes and so that's what causes the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.390 
eyes and so that's what causes the
burning<00:01:52.750> some<00:01:53.050> may<00:01:53.260> experience<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.950> somebody

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
burning some may experience it somebody

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.430 
burning some may experience it somebody
not<00:01:54.580> but<00:01:55.090> anyway<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.480> want<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.840> share<00:01:56.050> that<00:01:56.230> with

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
not but anyway I want to share that with

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.710 
not but anyway I want to share that with
you<00:01:56.500> also<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:57.190> have<00:01:57.520> my<00:01:57.670> little<00:01:57.820> work<00:01:58.120> glasses

and because I'm nearsighted I have to

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.690 
and because I'm nearsighted I have to
wear<00:02:00.910> glasses<00:02:01.300> on<00:02:01.960> top<00:02:02.620> of<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.310> these

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
wear glasses on top of this so these

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.670 
wear glasses on top of this so these
precedes<00:02:04.360> safety<00:02:05.140> glasses<00:02:05.410> are
