when the actions you want prospects to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.260 
when the actions you want prospects to

should include you move process to
action<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:54.030> rather<00:01:54.299> than<00:01:54.450> just

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
action and I think that rather than just

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
action and I think that rather than just
telling<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.710> by<00:01:56.219> asking<00:01:56.610> these

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.590 
questions and prompting you to write it
down<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.549> it's<00:02:00.149> really<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.540> to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
down and to think it's really going to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.410 
down and to think it's really going to
help<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.960> build<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.890> site<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.360> to
