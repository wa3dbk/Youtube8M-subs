00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
with this it's it sucks if they had its

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.910 
with this it's it sucks if they had its
animated<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.240> entire<00:02:33.660> thing<00:02:34.020> would<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.470> know

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
animated the entire thing would you know

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.810 
animated the entire thing would you know
would<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:36.080> less<00:02:37.080> harsh<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.640> whole

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
would you be less harsh on the whole

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.670 
would you be less harsh on the whole
thing<00:02:39.030> like<00:02:39.510> if<00:02:39.660> they<00:02:39.780> had<00:02:39.900> animated<00:02:40.440> all<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
thing like if they had animated all the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.070 
thing like if they had animated all the
fight<00:02:40.860> sequences<00:02:41.100> underwater<00:02:41.910> rather<00:02:42.750> than

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
fight sequences underwater rather than

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.740 
fight sequences underwater rather than
done<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.650> CG<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:46.110> know<00:02:47.060> maybe<00:02:48.060> presented

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
done the CG and you know maybe presented

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.490 
done the CG and you know maybe presented
it<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.990> little<00:02:49.200> better

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
it a little better

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.740 
it a little better
all<00:02:49.710> right<00:02:49.860> would<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.880> would<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.210> make<00:02:51.480> you

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
all right would that would that make you

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.260 
all right would that would that make you
happy<00:02:52.080> would<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.770> make<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.520> easier<00:02:54.030> on

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
happy would it make you like easier on

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.940 
happy would it make you like easier on
it<00:02:54.420> at<00:02:54.540> least<00:02:54.720> okay<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.290> story<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.620> so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
it at least okay this story is so

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.840 
it at least okay this story is so
complex<00:02:57.110> apparently<00:02:58.110> an<00:02:58.350> epic<00:02:59.250> tale<00:02:59.490> should

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
complex apparently an epic tale should

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.360 
complex apparently an epic tale should
take<00:03:00.120> more<00:03:00.420> than<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:01.290> many<00:03:01.590> episodes<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
take more than this many episodes to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.630 
take more than this many episodes to
tell<00:03:02.640> well<00:03:03.210> it's<00:03:06.020> worked<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.520> didn't<00:03:08.520> even

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
tell well it's worked I didn't even

tell well it's worked I didn't even
count<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.180> can't<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.630> can't<00:03:09.870> study<00:03:10.110> here<00:03:14.030> it

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
count it I can't I can't study here it

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.350 
count it I can't I can't study here it
was<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.390> bad<00:03:17.959> for<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.410> extras<00:03:20.040> okay<00:03:20.730> four

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
was just bad for and extras okay four

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.020 
was just bad for and extras okay four
episodes<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.950> Chalmers<00:03:23.250> they<00:03:23.459> come<00:03:23.640> out<00:03:23.670> all

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
episodes the Chalmers they come out all

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.650 
episodes the Chalmers they come out all
right<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.510> story<00:03:25.050> from<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:26.220> think<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.670> takes<00:03:26.820> take

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
right a story from I think it takes take

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.110 
right a story from I think it takes take
the<00:03:27.870> span<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.200> like<00:03:28.650> three<00:03:28.920> or<00:03:29.130> four<00:03:29.190> days<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
the span of like three or four days the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.020 
the span of like three or four days the
action<00:03:30.450> was<00:03:30.540> lame<00:03:31.340> yeah<00:03:32.340> pretty<00:03:32.700> much

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
action was lame yeah pretty much

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.350 
action was lame yeah pretty much
except<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:34.250> actually<00:03:35.250> animated<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
except that actually animated the the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.690 
except that actually animated the the
ones<00:03:36.570> between<00:03:37.250> towards<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.400> end<00:03:38.520> do<00:03:38.670> you

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
ones between towards the end do you

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.930

when he fights the beauty that guy yeah

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.670 
when he fights the beauty that guy yeah
why<00:03:45.330> would<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.660> mix<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.110> up<00:03:46.230> then<00:03:46.440> why<00:03:46.530> would

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
why would you mix it up then why would

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.370 
why would you mix it up then why would
you<00:03:46.770> mix<00:03:46.920> up<00:03:47.190> perfectly<00:03:48.150> good<00:03:48.420> CG<00:03:48.930> with

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
you mix up perfectly good CG with

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.940 
you mix up perfectly good CG with
perfectly<00:03:49.800> fine<00:03:50.070> animation<00:03:51.739> that's<00:03:52.739> just

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
perfectly fine animation that's just

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.949 
perfectly fine animation that's just
across<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.430> generics<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.450> doesn't<00:03:54.810> work

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
across the generics and it doesn't work

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.290 
across the generics and it doesn't work
it's<00:03:55.620> yeah<00:03:56.580> they<00:03:56.790> should<00:03:56.940> have<00:03:57.060> done<00:03:57.090> the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
it's yeah they should have done the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.140 
it's yeah they should have done the
whole<00:03:57.480> thing<00:03:57.980> anime<00:03:58.980> or<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.610> whole<00:03:59.760> thing<00:03:59.970> see

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
whole thing anime or the whole thing see

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.910 
whole thing anime or the whole thing see
most<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.920> computer-generated

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
most of this is computer-generated

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.330 
most of this is computer-generated
imagery<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.880> lot<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.690> yeah<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.410> if<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.190> have

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
imagery a lot of it yeah and if you have

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.360 
imagery a lot of it yeah and if you have
Michelle<00:04:05.720> don't<00:04:06.720> do<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:07.440> mildly<00:04:07.920> uses

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
Michelle don't do it and it mildly uses

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.600 
Michelle don't do it and it mildly uses
imagery<00:04:08.760> like<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.560> but<00:04:10.560> ninety<00:04:11.160> percent<00:04:11.370> of

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
imagery like this but ninety percent of

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.000 
imagery like this but ninety percent of
it<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.790> actually<00:04:12.300> genuine<00:04:12.959> animation<00:04:13.739> that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
it is actually genuine animation that

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.280 
it is actually genuine animation that
has<00:04:14.190> no<00:04:14.459> good<00:04:14.850> be<00:04:15.030> okay<00:04:15.360> thinking<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.870> think

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
has no good be okay thinking I think

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.479 
has no good be okay thinking I think
