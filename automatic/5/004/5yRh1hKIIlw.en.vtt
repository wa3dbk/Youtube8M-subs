00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
still enjoyable and I still like the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.179 
still enjoyable and I still like the
whole<00:00:20.580> dense<00:00:21.330> little<00:00:22.080> sad<00:00:22.439> stories<00:00:23.010> even

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
whole dense little sad stories even

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.380 
whole dense little sad stories even
though<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.580> kind<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.789> obvious<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.300> this

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
though it's kind of obvious at this

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.210 
though it's kind of obvious at this
point<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.750> anime<00:00:25.019> has<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.500> relegated<00:00:25.769> him

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
point the anime has just relegated him

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.859 
point the anime has just relegated him
too<00:00:26.400> unimportant<00:00:27.680> character<00:00:28.680> status<00:00:29.630> which<00:00:30.630> I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
too unimportant character status which I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.450 
too unimportant character status which I
guess<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.410> lot<00:00:31.679> better<00:00:31.920> than<00:00:32.189> Brock's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
guess is a lot better than Brock's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.010 
guess is a lot better than Brock's
progression<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.149> Brock<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.719> irrelevant

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
progression because Brock was irrelevant

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
progression because Brock was irrelevant
uh<00:00:35.270> pretty<00:00:36.270> much<00:00:36.360> from<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> get-go<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
uh pretty much from the get-go so the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
uh pretty much from the get-go so the
fact<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.120> didn't<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.690> least<00:00:39.719> made<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> all

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
fact that didn't at least made it all

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.100 
fact that didn't at least made it all
the<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.829> until<00:00:41.010> about<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:42.059> think<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the way up until about I think the in

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
the way up until about I think the in
Arcis<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> argue<00:00:44.430> he<00:00:44.579> started<00:00:44.940> he<00:00:45.059> was

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
Arcis is when I argue he started he was

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.450 
Arcis is when I argue he started he was
he<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.660> mainly<00:00:45.899> he<00:00:46.170> became<00:00:46.440> irrelevant<00:00:46.739> um

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
he was mainly he became irrelevant um

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
he was mainly he became irrelevant um
not<00:00:48.420> saying<00:00:48.809> she<00:00:49.140> doesn't<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
not saying she doesn't have the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.110 
not saying she doesn't have the
potential<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> become<00:00:50.129> relevant<00:00:50.550> again<00:00:50.700> but

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
potential to become relevant again but

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.990 
potential to become relevant again but
it's<00:00:51.390> highly<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.469> highly<00:00:53.280> doubt<00:00:53.579> he's<00:00:53.879> gonna

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it's highly I highly doubt he's gonna

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.490 
it's highly I highly doubt he's gonna
become<00:00:54.329> relevant<00:00:54.660> again<00:00:55.100> um<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.379> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
become relevant again um it was not in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
become relevant again um it was not in
terms<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.890> cuz<00:00:59.070> i<00:00:59.250> even<00:00:59.699> i<00:00:59.910> mean<00:01:00.239> granted<00:01:00.449> they

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
terms of cuz i even i mean granted they

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
terms of cuz i even i mean granted they
have<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> mock<00:01:01.230> tournament<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.370> which

have a mock tournament in here which

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
have a mock tournament in here which
kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> annoyed<00:01:03.329> me<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> want

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
kind of annoyed me because if you want

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
kind of annoyed me because if you want
to<00:01:04.530> argue<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.460> thing<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.790> june<00:01:06.240> five

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
to argue the one thing about june five

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
to argue the one thing about june five
people<00:01:06.780> probably<00:01:06.960> hate<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> fact<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
people probably hate is the fact that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.740 
people probably hate is the fact that
they<00:01:08.220> tournament<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.270> out<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
death which in a sense you can call a
