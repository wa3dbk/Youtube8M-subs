00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello you probably already have 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.180
 often asked what type of figure you are 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.529
 and that's why you have to go today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.660
 I will give you these five today 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.219
 explain and then to my figure type 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.230
 give some more styling tips 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.730
 the individual figure types will be 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 usually labeled with letters 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.300
 and the first figure type is an ex her 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.710
 you probably already can 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.660
 Let us introduce ourselves to this type of figure 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 field and although it is mostly curvy 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.099
 people that means a broader shoulders 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.439
 of course, also a busen up the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.449
 is called a wide breast and of course 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.579
 also a pronounced hip what 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.230
 This type of figure is particularly pronounced 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.329
 the thalia that is very narrow and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.010
 lean one also refers to this type 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.930
 often as 90 60 90 so model of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 second type of figure is this and that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 is also often referred to as apple shape 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.680
 or in society that becomes 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.329
 usually just considered as chubby 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.640
 that means you have a bit belly and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.469
 everything is a bit more detailed 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.480
 nevertheless one can also there its advantages 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.309
 I stress you the third guy 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
 Imagination is the hair and that is 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.019
 This often as the sporty 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.510
 if you belong to it then 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.810
 you probably have the same width 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.700
 shoulders and hips and a waist which 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.340
 not very stressed city that is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.470
 a very straight body course 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.150
 in contrast to ixs the penultimate 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.340
 figures of the fourth type 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 type that I imagine you is the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 v-form and this really rare 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 to meet women 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 that means you have narrow hips and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.590
 really wider shoulders and that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.540
 often happens when you are really very 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.030
 much trained in the upper body that is 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.650
 For example swimmer are there 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.270
 It is often the case that shoulders 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.659
 really really strong 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.729
 are 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.869
 the last character type to which I too 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.140
 belong is the kind of or triangles or 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.299
 also pear shape and that's really how it is 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.549
 that you have something narrower shoulders 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.790
 that means the upper body is a lot 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.320
 narrower and the hips are wider that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.640
 you will see again now 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.960
 if I lift the sweater because of the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 that's pretty good 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.409
 My friend always says gun 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.500
 happy pool which I of course very much 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.450
 would find very funny, I must say if 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.770
 So you are like me too 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.640
 You should get the video on each one 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.720
 case continue to watch and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.210
 Although I will give you a few now 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.650
 styling tips like you the whole 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.750
 could hide with the other must 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.430
 I am sorry to say sorry for myself 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.819
 I do not want to have any experience myself 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.530
 I also do not like you tips and 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.580
 give tricks because I do not know if that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.880
 really true 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.620
 I hope you can understand that 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.360
 Now to the colors and that applies to me 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.790
 of course the classic rules that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.240
 means white makes you wide and black 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.950
 slim 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.110
 That's why this is a whole 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 simple rules mostly then that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.280
 use in lighter things above and 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.750
 than pants then prefer to use darker ones 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.040
 In the following I will introduce you again 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.510
 show some examples and that too 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.769
 compare so we still show 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.510
 times exactly what kind of effect 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.880
 have the colors and although I have only 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.510
 a light pair of pants and a black one 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.980
 top 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.709
 you realize it is for my figure 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.970
 pretty and beneficial and now 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.500
 will you see again in comparison 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.269
 how the whole looks and indeed I want 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.769
 recommend you if you already have one 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.019
 dark top part attracts that is one 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.090
 black no tight but 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.830
 a looser i think by the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.600
 Comparisons are also clearly recognizable 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.010
 that is a lot more proportional 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.010
 work on the left side 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.019
 Now again the combination bright top part 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.209
 and bright jeans here you see that me 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.310
 really in general a lot wider 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.560
 that means also on the shoulder 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.230
 but through the web in the top part 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.629
 also on the hip and that's exactly what it is 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.640
 if you put on such plum tops 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.590
 you should really do without it 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.879
 put on a light trousers underneath 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.340
 then you should really try 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.140
 at least to put on a black one 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.580
 in comparison, it will also be in degrees 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.410
 every case clear that it 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.700
 actually makes a difference 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.440
 nothing considering that I have one now 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.579
 a bit stupid switzerland I'm doing now 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.230
 with you again a pants form 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.670
 Comparison and now see first 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.250
 the tube actually for ours 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.420
 figurines are not thought that way 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.910
 I do not think that's so bad 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.660
 but you can see that straight 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.890
 the wider hip somewhat concealed and 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.959
 then see again in comparison 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.660
 to the rail pants actually for 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.360
 Actually we did not necessarily think so 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.459
 because it stops something for me at the moment 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.169
 hip is and if you then too 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.049
 still combined with a Eigentor part 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.060
 not good but since i have chino pants all the way 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.889
 Of course, I also like to wear it 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.590
 a tip for you so that you the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.930
 could prevent and although I wear 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.300
 very happy first high heels was to 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.430
 of course the leg is stretched and 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.550
 Another blazer is special 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.990
 cool that in a short cut 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.310
 blazer that's important too 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.770
 Objections can be cut long 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.539
 be that on the hip and off 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.979
 so your hips then automatically 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.490
 in turn, what we do not get broader 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.010
 want 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.979
 with a blazer, you just have it 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.050
 mostly light shoulder pads in it 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.330
 and that leaves euro shouldering then 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.860
 ultimately as wide as yours 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.740
 hips and if you then the 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.210
 Blazer just like here to do the same 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.599
 you even have the effect that yours 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.940
 Thalia stresses your shoulders will be emphasized 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.789
 and your hips that means you have 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.650
 a slight extreme I hope so 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.870
 could you guys with this little tips 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.210

 help and me it will be great 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.960

 or what you like for figures 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.889

 Of course also like to sign and

 otherwise we will see each other on mine 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.669
