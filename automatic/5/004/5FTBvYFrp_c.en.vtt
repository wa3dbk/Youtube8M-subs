00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.350
 problem with my sound and mine 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 point some chips 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.890

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 you can still hear the piece on the tape and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.969
 the microphone does not yet turn on and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.600
 but he didn't like it then and then 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.680

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.410

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.120
 a lot 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.489
