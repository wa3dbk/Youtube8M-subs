00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
running board like this one that becomes

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
running board like this one that becomes
a<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.530> more<00:01:07.680> difficult<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.090> still

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
a little more difficult you can still

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
a little more difficult you can still
run<00:01:09.659> them<00:01:09.900> below<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.470> running<00:01:10.770> board<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.220> up

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
run them below the running board and up

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.980 
run them below the running board and up
and<00:01:11.490> around<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> Ledge<00:01:12.570> under

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and around and there's a Ledge under

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.499 
and around and there's a Ledge under
there<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> hook<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.280> strap<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.299> comes

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
there to hook on to the strap that comes

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
there to hook on to the strap that comes
from<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.170> corner<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> tent<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.310> can

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
from the very corner of the tent you can

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.390 
from the very corner of the tent you can
run<00:01:17.820> into<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> wheel<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.229> clip<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.040> like

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
run into the wheel well and clip on like

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.149 
run into the wheel well and clip on like
so<00:01:21.119> you'll<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> same<00:01:22.110> effect<00:01:22.530> once

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so you'll have the same effect once

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.010 
so you'll have the same effect once
you've<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> poles<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.420> want<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> come
