00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.460
 welcome last already mainz here 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.340
 we blame the dwarf city â€‹â€‹and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.680
 moment sesame open up so that 's just 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
 the entrance to the branches instead and here 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.720
 This tower is well lit. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.490
 Stayed with the monastery and that is where 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.660
 I'll hand over the word to you 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.660
 first an eternally long staircase 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:54.200
 at the moment is up with you too 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.440
 blanket well packaged then explain what 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.699
 we here so have so exactly here 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.739
 is actually just the queued 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.619
 the entrance hall to the dwarf state 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.920
 with a damn lot of damn huge 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:15.110
 The emphasis is on only the pillars 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.820
 At the beginning exactly but I think so 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.550
 the first few meters I run and 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.920
 then I fly because otherwise it takes to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.229
 long time I stopped and time 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.340
 I noticed that it was about 45 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.479
 takes the entire second 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.500
 entrance hall to fly through 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.020
 Actually, it's always the same 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.740
 here are always those pillars on each 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.600
 page 4 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.330
 left and right of me and mine 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.890
 opinion this pretty good turn 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.119
 to a wall then we consider this as 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:57.920
 other people these beautiful 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:59.600
 ornaments and where we are as well as 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.360
 just run it is then just the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.189
 main road through these passages 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.890
 This entrance hall leads you with it 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.509
 also can not get lost 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.459
 then then either stop 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.060
 exit or neck to where we are 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.060
 want to go 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.160
 otherwise it is really difficult 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:37.150
 to find one's way if one does 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:41.020
 not that we have already on 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.390
 Entrance next to big beautiful shovels 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.600
 the ones placed on this frame 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:51.630
 are and then it just marks yes 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:56.920
 is then just the menu for want 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.810
 follow the dwarfs if you are right 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:17.470
 flow then so should actually 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:18.840
 the one you can then me 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.000
 actually still here 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:28.450
 the rest of it somehow as a pillar 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.690
 undergo or so grab something safe 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.130
 if you stop here at the corner 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.560
 here in the stairs and then stop 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.270
 this huge outlook on the whole 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.050
 on the entrance hall on these borders 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:56.489
 should the entrance hall have it too 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:56.489
 so big that you are just right 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.709
 Of course you think so the architectural style 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.860
 the host is actually going to be that way 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.450
 the houses partly in the wall or in 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.880
 Just build the mountain because it is 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.670
 stop for the dwarfs 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.760
 It's easiest to do that than he does or so 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.690
 so here for raw materials or for doctors 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.880
 search and then just of course yes 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.389
 maybe something else when building a house 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.009
 Find 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.969
 I remember that later 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.520
 perhaps something with this 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.949
 loren connected with which one can he 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.930
 Definitely the whole different roll 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:41.120
 here are good that was it actually yes 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.099
 for the sake of the purposes instead of itself 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.889
 a little outlook what else 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.889
 will come and equal 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:05:00.080
 but that's all well then yes 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:02.710
 Let's say creative and report 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.330
 See you soon when we are 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.919
 further on are in the branches or city 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.729
 maybe even the second 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.110
 completed the city 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.110
 that 's the next episode of 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.159
 our minecraft bed show and i know 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.779
 you can also say 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:22.009
 actually here again to conclusion 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:24.949
 here the entrance show of dogs am 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.379
 best of the middle also say 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.639
 We wanted to be in the next time 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.949
 I think a few let's play 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.110
 So start scanning normally let's play 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:37.039
 look, maybe see 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.529
 minecraft let's see what else we have there 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.089
 incident 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:44.919
 until next time exactly until 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.919
