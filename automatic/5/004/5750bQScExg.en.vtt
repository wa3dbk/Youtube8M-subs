hi my name is Shonda and this is a video
where<00:00:03.179> I'm<00:00:03.389> showing<00:00:03.890> the<00:00:04.890> use<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:06.089> streak

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
where I'm showing the use of a streak

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.110 
where I'm showing the use of a streak
filter<00:00:07.610> this<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.849> actually<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:10.730> light<00:00:11.730> streak

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
filter this is actually a light streak

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.799 
filter this is actually a light streak
filter<00:00:12.630> from<00:00:12.990> Koken<00:00:13.759> with<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.969> use<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
filter from Koken with the use of the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.310 
filter from Koken with the use of the
Koken<00:00:16.440> adapters<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.130> put<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.960> and<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
Koken adapters to put it on and this is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.400 
Koken adapters to put it on and this is
how<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.770> looks<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.000> light<00:00:21.689> streak<00:00:22.109> on

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
how it looks with the light streak on

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.769 
how it looks with the light streak on
you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.580> there's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> nice<00:00:24.300> horizontal

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
you can see there's a nice horizontal

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.290 
you can see there's a nice horizontal
streak<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.949> actually<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.820> twist<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.230> turn

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
streak and actually I can twist and turn

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
streak and actually I can twist and turn
the<00:00:30.300> filter<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.210> instead<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.880> horizontal

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the filter so it's instead of horizontal

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.910 
the filter so it's instead of horizontal
its<00:00:36.090> vertical<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:37.219> its<00:00:38.239> diagonal<00:00:39.770> just<00:00:40.770> an

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
its vertical or its diagonal just an

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.229 
its vertical or its diagonal just an
interesting<00:00:41.670> style<00:00:45.620> so

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.950 

and<00:00:49.450> that's<00:00:50.440> cool<00:00:51.010> focus

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.470 

however<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.850> filter<00:00:58.300> does<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:01.180> you're<00:01:01.390> a

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
however the filter does if you're a

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.590 
however the filter does if you're a
slight<00:01:01.930> quality<00:01:02.920> loss<00:01:03.220> because<00:01:04.000> it's<00:01:04.300> an

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
slight quality loss because it's an

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.250 
slight quality loss because it's an
extra<00:01:05.310> glass<00:01:06.310> with<00:01:06.940> basically<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.840> lot<00:01:08.140> of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
extra glass with basically a lot of

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.520 
extra glass with basically a lot of
horizontal<00:01:08.680> scratches<00:01:09.580> on<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:12.900> let's<00:01:13.900> see<00:01:14.140> the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
horizontal scratches on it let's see the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.000 
horizontal scratches on it let's see the
compare<00:01:15.160> it<00:01:15.280> with<00:01:15.360> without<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.830> is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
compare it with without and this is

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.390 
compare it with without and this is
basically<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.729> shot<00:01:19.030> without<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:20.400> adapter

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
basically the shot without the adapter

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.570 
basically the shot without the adapter
or<00:01:21.670> without<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.479> light<00:01:22.660> streak<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:24.130> can<00:01:24.340> see

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
or without the light streak you can see

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.630 
or without the light streak you can see
it's<00:01:24.850> much<00:01:25.420> clearer<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.650> colors<00:01:27.400> are

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
it's much clearer and the colors are

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.100 
it's much clearer and the colors are
much<00:01:29.190> more<00:01:30.190> contrast<00:01:30.850> II<00:01:31.119> than<00:01:31.540> with<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.960> a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
much more contrast II than with it's a

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.490 
much more contrast II than with it's a
nice<00:01:35.550> cool<00:01:36.550> effect<00:01:37.300> at<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.869> moment<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:38.350> like

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
nice cool effect at the moment it's like

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.660 
nice cool effect at the moment it's like
with<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> small<00:01:39.729> toy<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.350> should<00:01:42.250> be<00:01:42.430> way

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
with a small toy so it should be way

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.030 
with a small toy so it should be way
different<00:01:42.940> if<00:01:43.360> I'm<00:01:43.720> shooting<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.290> person<00:01:44.590> and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
different if I'm shooting a person and

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.070 
different if I'm shooting a person and
then<00:01:45.190> having<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:45.729> bigger<00:01:46.390> light<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
then having a bigger light on the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.359 
then having a bigger light on the
background<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.759> is<00:01:48.970> just<00:01:49.180> like<00:01:49.680> me<00:01:50.680> trying

of it and I have to say if yeah and the
current<00:02:45.420> problem<00:02:45.959> only<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:47.489> using

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
current problem only with like using

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.199 
current problem only with like using
this<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:49.879> it's<00:02:50.879> slightly<00:02:52.790> less<00:02:53.790> than<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
this is it's slightly less than the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.300 
this is it's slightly less than the
quality<00:02:54.659> of<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.019> shots<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:55.799> basically

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
quality of the shots and basically

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.599 
quality of the shots and basically
nowadays<00:02:56.909> with<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:59.040> red<00:02:59.220> giant<00:03:02.060> with

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
nowadays with like the red giant with

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.899 
nowadays with like the red giant with
light<00:03:05.609> streaks<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.329> called<00:03:06.739> does<00:03:07.739> plug<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.609> for

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
light streaks is called does plug in for

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.759 
light streaks is called does plug in for
basically<00:03:09.329> replicating<00:03:10.230> these<00:03:10.530> light

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
basically replicating these light

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.220 
basically replicating these light
streaks<00:03:11.099> however<00:03:11.579> if<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.030> want<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.019> actually

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
streaks however if you want to actually

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.819 
streaks however if you want to actually
see<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.040> light<00:03:14.189> streaks<00:03:14.639> in<00:03:15.120> real<00:03:15.989> time<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
see the light streaks in real time and

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.209 
see the light streaks in real time and
actually<00:03:17.069> see<00:03:17.760> what<00:03:18.090> you're<00:03:18.299> filming<00:03:19.219> and

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:20.219 
actually see what you're filming and

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.610 
actually see what you're filming and
actually<00:03:20.730> more<00:03:21.060> realistic<00:03:21.840> light<00:03:22.169> streaks

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
actually more realistic light streaks

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.300 
actually more realistic light streaks
you<00:03:23.069> could<00:03:23.790> use<00:03:24.120> this<00:03:24.419> filter<00:03:24.930> however<00:03:25.379> at<00:03:26.189> the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
you could use this filter however at the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.129 
you could use this filter however at the
