00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
recommend the ladybug doesn't have a

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.509 
recommend the ladybug doesn't have a
pocket<00:00:58.989> clip<00:00:59.140> but<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.100> you're<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:00.309> going<00:01:00.460> to

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
pocket clip but if you're just going to

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.310 
pocket clip but if you're just going to
slip<00:01:00.670> inside<00:01:00.850> your<00:01:01.149> pocket<00:01:01.300> works<00:01:01.690> well<00:01:01.929> still

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
slip inside your pocket works well still

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.460
