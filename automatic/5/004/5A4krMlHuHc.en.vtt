 also obstruction in this presentation of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.400
 the renault kazuri 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.470
 and the c series that is the cheese the heavy 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.210
 duty or around car 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.970
 the sea is more the construction and that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 less supply of construction 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.510
 most important thing we do here is the line 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.060
 these beasts are training here 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.520
 quarry and yes that is something else 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.240
 than in the swampy ground dutch 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240
 very nice to do 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.420
 oh its tough steel box has one 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.280
 movable under fabric step 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.840
 wanted was in different configurations 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.490
 get through the 2446 key 466 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.789
 you name it and they put the whole stuff 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.479
 is there except for the dutch 5 boxers 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.479
 it was a pity again 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.739
 I'm in a rolo here 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.819
 k-series that is the successor of 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.739
 the kerax 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.270
 and those are the heavy construction vehicles from 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.300
 renault trucks 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.470
 With the new design, things will freak you out 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.930
 dashboard 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.230
 completely new construction vehicles and together 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.230
 with the series with 8 11 or 13 liters 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.140
 motors with many variations in terms of 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.310
 drive to apologize to he is coming 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.440
 soon the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.410
 implementation contributes to this and that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.450
 has the ironically powered for bait 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.010
 we are going to see today what 's what's that 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.069
 What is this site here in the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.690
 rooftops in barcelona 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.519
 if you have a cross-country drive you must have a you 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.799
 must be up a hill or strech terrain then 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.989
 It is often that you have a foot up and down 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.130
 continues that the terrain is roller 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.680
 and the force yes it says on it 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.450
 accelerator pedal so that the car goes 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.330
 They have something there 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.730
 minded at renault and that's one 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.110
 offroad cruise control that you operate with 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.780
 these buttons here now 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.910
 and then you can with these buttons you can 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.760
 speed still regulating that you go up 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.980
 goes that works super efficiently 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.299
 you go very nice colin up the slope and 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.070
 that only works if you have the 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.579
 gearbox manually set it 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.260
 that is to say 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.810
 let's choose your gears 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.390
 say the second you sit anywhere cruise 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.760
 control at a certain speed and that 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.859
 own tea nicely up so that 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.630
 you are not burdened by the 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.359
 rocks and buses and also giving you the 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.769
 powertrain not burdened with all that 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.380
 peak loads of your dance and the 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.819
 your right foot is also very neat 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.769
 operation of the spare 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.720
 that's with this switch and i can do you 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.910
 You can do both along and across pens 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.829
 turn on and in the dashboard 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.340
 then everything appears nicely to you 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.069
 are doing it 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.670
 in short, a particularly efficient vehicle 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.670
 friends terrain 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.959
 the euro piras 844 60 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.380
 loaded keeper four-axle we are now going one 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.380
 quarry 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.810
 Yes 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.850
 ciska your tractor with a trailer with 520 hp 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.580
 and on this car has a special or 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.550
 rand software now runs with all tips 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.770
 switched on and quite steep slope and 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.390
 I use the mountain on the cruise 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.310
 control and that really works great 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.290
 of course a button 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.450
 ordered your speed in suit you are allowed 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.600
 do have scale is a three-color 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.129
 up 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.349
 without peak loads from the hairline 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.000
 without the rumbling of your foot on it 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.230
 gas pedal 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.230
 back sound neat condition 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.240
