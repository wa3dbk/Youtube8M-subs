 what they watch ads everyone doesn't watch 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.770
 Of course, Pushkin, this ad I want 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.299
 I earn something because they are 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.759

 personalities 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.930
 true i want to say a comment 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.460
 that i'm not as often as you think it is 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.049
 generally extremely rare because just 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.900
 no time I really flip through 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.060
 look comments in lichku vkontakte 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.420
 also I can not answer everyone writes 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.869
 quite a lot of people that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.509
 still appreciate the person who writes me 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.399
 in the mail now I looked stopped 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.229
 a long time ago she stopped answering just 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.720
 I can not find anything but I will answer 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.640
 I will definitely find time and answer further 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.760
 what else in general plans 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.100
 what am I going to do 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.820
 how will the channel evolve let's about 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.390
 let's talk this 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.720
 accordingly , I will have several 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.340
 new headings will not know what but not 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.060
 will definitely stand together they are going 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.450
 I will come up with some new headings 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.660
 will be promoted and of course more 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.580
 announced video this is a joke 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.220
 maybe soon will be under the tune 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.530
 will be as I planned when soon 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.810
 it will be I don't know the rubric myself 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.970
 nagibator possible to endure small 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.380
 changes i'm planning no further 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.420
 I know when to start yet now 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.090
 get well and then think well 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.740
 need to do planning on doing something 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.420
 maybe some winners 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.820
 even a few nominations to be 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.900
 more honestly then winning is just one of 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.880
 Cache writes about sea play would be better 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.280
 replace as it was for now what will be 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.470
 one win further see how 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.840
 will go if you like the rubric here 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.040
 take root then maybe even did 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.780
 few kill or will be different 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.180
 nominations may even be by class 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.980
 divide see I have not thought of it yet 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.709
 it is so exorbitant plans 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.090
 more about the map review section 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.350
 key points she will she go nowhere 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.690
 units up will exist 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.100
 all the time while cards are new cards 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.410
 will be found new how to display 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.160
 often therefore it is a rubric for long 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.959
 about the heading 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.450
 our gendotch random beads are simple 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.730
 I want to say that lately that 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.950
 It looked less normal 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.750
 questions may be getting smaller 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.519
 she begins to quietly get rid of herself 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.230
 FMD think this set up yet 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.150
 question next issue i cant exactly 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.930
 say when it comes out but i will try 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.060
 make it as soon as possible how well that's just 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.519
 only my voice will return less 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.840
 runny nose will pass then I will write 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.519
 already ok well more exam yet 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.750
 it remains to give and then already happiness in general 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.650
 I will immediately start recording video more often 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.380
 about the heading 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.550
 only playlist tutorial for newbies is 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.220
 In general, just a great playlist and I 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.420
 I will definitely never abandon him 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.140
 add some video to it 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.680
 still I will be as soon as he will 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.090
 I can not replenish anything 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.680
 By the way, thinking about opening the second 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.970
 channel because tanks sometimes start 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.180
 bother and want to relax and 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.180
 as you often write to me in PM 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.389
 VKontakte that video goes rarely fail 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.220
 missing something else 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.810
 strange common channel on tanks especially 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.790
 yes i have a subway playlist i 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.830
 held in this until the end of it did not pass 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.020
 by the way the video examines it so 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.850
 I wrote it down but I did not put it to the parameter 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.620
 I don't know why I can't do anything 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.030
 lay out for a long time I have already recorded 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.100
 maybe created a separate channel there 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.800
 I will lay out everything that is not on the tanks 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.230
 all that for other games or 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.030
 In general, under a different theme, well, so that 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.340
 do not distract from the audience from the main 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.530
 channel create astra 2 no when 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.110
 will can generally create just i'm sharing 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.760
 with you their such plans that are not 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:05.550
 the fact that it will be implemented further 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.620
 it is possible that we should somehow have to do 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.180
 advance our community which 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.740
 it was on sort of broke up but we 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.450
 maintain a good relationship 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.700
 like and chat there 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.590
 it's like usual but communities seem to be 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.840
 no screensaver I did not remove well let them be 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.679
 not only its screensaver and so far 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.699
 hang on maybe 

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:29.319
 don't know what will happen maybe 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:34.059
 muddied new actually all that 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:39.129
 will be like will just see already 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:40.899
 something like that why don't even know if you 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.550
 want to create your channel if you have 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:43.539
 allows glands to record video revenge 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.529
 even playlist 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:49.629
 and he was somewhere here, but 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.719
 young channel to help there and recorded 2 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.559
 video tutorials how to record video and 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.300
 accordingly there I said again 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:57.729
 a little about youtube and affiliate program 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:03.219
 I think you will connect 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:05.169
 I wonder also what else is basically a video 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.580
 now will not go out rarely is 1 v2 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.669
 same every three days 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.800
 because the exam and because sick 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.529
 and somehow I don't want to write down yet 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.149
 Is it an inspiration or something ? 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.759
 fix it the other day you sew where 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:21.639
 amendment of food is therefore possible already through 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.889
 I'm 23, I'll switch to normal mode 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.800
 one video per day 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:29.259
 so wait soon everything will be okay 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.069
 on this end if you happen to 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:32.050
 somehow hit this form necessarily 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.879

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.830
 questions in the comments I will try on 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:38.289
 they answer well, of course not the video already 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.149
 so ask your questions in the heading 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.439

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:44.079
 I will answer them in the next issue 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.789
