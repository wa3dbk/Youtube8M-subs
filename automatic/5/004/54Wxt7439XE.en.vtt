simplest<00:00:11.040> radical<00:00:11.250> form<00:00:11.820> now<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.750> this

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
simplest radical form now do this

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.790 
simplest radical form now do this
problem<00:00:13.620> since<00:00:14.549> both<00:00:14.969> our<00:00:15.210> numerator<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.990> our

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
problem since both our numerator and our

denominator<00:00:17.039> are<00:00:17.640> both<00:00:18.060> underneath<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
denominator are both underneath the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.599 
denominator are both underneath the
radicals<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.949> just<00:00:20.100> go<00:00:20.310> ahead<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
radicals we can just go ahead and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.730 
radicals we can just go ahead and
simplify<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.420> as<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.230> were<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
simplify this as if it were just a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.830 
simplify this as if it were just a
normal<00:00:22.980> fraction<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.180> let<00:00:24.330> me<00:00:24.390> write<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
normal fraction so let me write it a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.400 
normal fraction so let me write it a
little<00:00:25.080> larger<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:27.900> my

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
little larger here so you can see my

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.010 
little larger here so you can see my
reducing<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.789> go<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.640> I<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.600> numerator

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
reducing as I go so I have the numerator

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.270 
reducing as I go so I have the numerator
in<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:35.090> just<00:00:36.090> need<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> 6<00:00:36.420> X<00:00:37.219> Y<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
in there and then just need the 6 X Y to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.920 
in there and then just need the 6 X Y to
the<00:00:38.460> fifth<00:00:38.730> underneath<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.300> radical<00:00:39.750> there

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the fifth underneath that radical there

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.420 
the fifth underneath that radical there
alright<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> start

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
alright so I'm just going to start

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.270 
alright so I'm just going to start
reducing<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> six<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.920> reduce

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
reducing here so the six will reduce

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.150 
reducing here so the six will reduce
with<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> 108<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.649> that<00:00:46.649> will<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:46.950> when

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
with the 108 and that will go when

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.549 
with the 108 and that will go when
they're<00:00:49.070> 18<00:00:50.070> times<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.579> X<00:00:53.899> will<00:00:54.899> reduce<00:00:55.260> with

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
they're 18 times the X will reduce with

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.439 
they're 18 times the X will reduce with
X<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.949> fifth<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:56.820> left<00:00:57.030> over<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
X to the fifth so that I'm left over the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.360 
X to the fifth so that I'm left over the
X<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.930> fourth<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.420> then<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.949> y<00:01:01.949> 2<00:01:02.010> 8th

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
X to the fourth and then i have y 2 8th

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.270 
X to the fourth and then i have y 2 8th
reducing<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.210> y<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> fifth<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.439> that's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
reducing with y to the fifth and that's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.679 
reducing with y to the fifth and that's
going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.790> leave<00:01:05.939> me<00:01:06.119> with<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> lie<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
going to leave me with the lie to the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.280 
going to leave me with the lie to the
third<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> rewrite

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
third up here so when I go to rewrite

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
third up here so when I go to rewrite
this<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> leave<00:01:11.729> me<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.210> just

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this it's going to leave me with just

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.760 
this it's going to leave me with just
the<00:01:12.780> square<00:01:13.080> root<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.650> 18<00:01:15.259> times<00:01:16.259> X<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the square root of 18 times X to the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.429 
the square root of 18 times X to the
fourth<00:01:18.200> times<00:01:19.200> y<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.799> third<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:21.170> I'm<00:01:22.170> still

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
fourth times y to the third so I'm still

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.890 
fourth times y to the third so I'm still
not<00:01:22.590> done<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:24.030> want<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.360> simplest

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
not done because they want in simplest

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620 
not done because they want in simplest
radical<00:01:25.200> form<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> reduce<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> fraction

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
radical form now I reduce the fraction

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.920 
radical form now I reduce the fraction
down<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> single<00:01:28.500> radical<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.390> i<00:01:30.390> can

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
down into the single radical and i can

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
down into the single radical and i can
simplify<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.560> radical<00:01:31.829> down<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.549> bit

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
simplify this radical down a little bit

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.160 
simplify this radical down a little bit
more<00:01:32.909> i'm<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.710> rewrite<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:36.170> terms

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
more i'm going to rewrite this in terms

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.899 
more i'm going to rewrite this in terms
of<00:01:38.090> well<00:01:39.090> 18<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.920> factors<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
of well 18 so that i have factors one is

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.539 
of well 18 so that i have factors one is
a<00:01:42.030> perfect<00:01:42.450> square<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:43.009> i<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.189> only<00:01:44.280> take

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
a perfect square because i can only take

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.700 
a perfect square because i can only take
the<00:01:44.670> square<00:01:44.880> roots<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.360> perfect<00:01:45.930> squares<00:01:45.990> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the square roots of perfect squares so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.910 
the square roots of perfect squares so
i'm<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> write<00:01:47.009> 18<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.790> 9<00:01:48.030> times<00:01:48.110> 2x<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
i'm going to write 18 is 9 times 2x to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
i'm going to write 18 is 9 times 2x to
the<00:01:50.040> fourth<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.610> okay<00:01:50.909> i'm<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.329> leave<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the fourth is okay i'm going to leave it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920 
the fourth is okay i'm going to leave it
as<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.430> now<00:01:53.430> y<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.880> third<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
as is now y to the third I'm going to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
as is now y to the third I'm going to
break<00:01:55.110> down<00:01:55.409> into<00:01:55.710> y<00:01:56.189> squared<00:01:56.960> times<00:01:57.960> y<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.310> Y

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
break down into y squared times y so Y

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.569 
break down into y squared times y so Y
the<00:01:59.610> third<00:02:00.030> turns<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.530> now<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the third turns in to this now the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.359 
the third turns in to this now the
reason<00:02:02.820> why<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> broke<00:02:03.479> apart<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.079> 18<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
reason why I broke apart the 18 and the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.950 
reason why I broke apart the 18 and the
why<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.549> third<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.540> cannot<00:02:06.780> take

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
why of third is because I cannot take

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.460 
why of third is because I cannot take
the<00:02:07.140> square<00:02:07.290> root<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.590> 18<00:02:07.920> or<00:02:08.129> Y<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.910> third

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the square root of 18 or Y to the third

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.970 
the square root of 18 or Y to the third
just<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.649> they<00:02:11.009> are<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.450> step

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
just how they are at this step

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.730 
just how they are at this step
so<00:02:14.980> when<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:15.520> break<00:02:15.790> them<00:02:15.940> apart<00:02:16.060> into<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.560> two

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
so when I break them apart into the two

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.220 
so when I break them apart into the two
factors<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.520> just<00:02:18.790> make<00:02:19.000> sure<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.450> one<00:02:19.660> factor

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
factors I just make sure that one factor

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.940 
factors I just make sure that one factor
is<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.890> perfect<00:02:21.400> square<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:22.800> there's<00:02:23.800> nothing

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
is a perfect square and there's nothing

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.380 
is a perfect square and there's nothing
I<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.280> do<00:02:24.460> with<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.670> other<00:02:24.730> one<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.270> we're

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
I can do with the other one and so we're

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.610 
I can do with the other one and so we're
going<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.570> have<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.780> leave<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.050> under<00:02:26.230> there<00:02:26.320> so

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
going to have to leave it under there so

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.220 
going to have to leave it under there so
let's<00:02:26.830> finish<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.490> up<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.540> nine<00:02:28.810> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
let's finish this up here the nine the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.880 
let's finish this up here the nine the
square<00:02:29.500> root<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.650> nine<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.040> three<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.560> square

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
square root of nine is three the square

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.020 
square root of nine is three the square
root<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.040> x<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.580> fourth<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.660> x<00:02:34.900> squared<00:02:35.080> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
root of x to the fourth is x squared and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.990 
root of x to the fourth is x squared and
then<00:02:37.030> we<00:02:37.180> have<00:02:37.360> y<00:02:37.690> squared<00:02:38.730> square<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.940> is

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
then we have y squared square that is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.720 
then we have y squared square that is
why<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.770> took<00:02:41.920> care<00:02:42.460> of<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:43.740> that<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:45.280> that

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
why so I took care of this that and that

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.780 
why so I took care of this that and that
in<00:02:45.970> my<00:02:46.480> radical<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.170> you'll<00:02:47.590> see<00:02:47.890> I'm<00:02:48.430> left

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
in my radical and you'll see I'm left

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.720 
in my radical and you'll see I'm left
over<00:02:49.270> with<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:50.260> two<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.010> could<00:02:51.310> not<00:02:51.490> do

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
over with the two that I could not do

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.870 
over with the two that I could not do
anything<00:02:51.970> with<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:53.200> Y<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.310> don't<00:02:54.610> forget

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
anything with and the Y so don't forget

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.390 
anything with and the Y so don't forget
to<00:02:55.360> leave<00:02:55.660> those<00:02:56.020> underneath<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.220> radical

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
to leave those underneath the radical

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.320 
to leave those underneath the radical
right<00:02:57.970> here<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.610> when<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.120> point

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
right here and when you get to the point

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.240 
right here and when you get to the point
where<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.810> cannot<00:03:02.170> simplify<00:03:02.590> your<00:03:02.890> radical

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
where you cannot simplify your radical

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.330 
where you cannot simplify your radical
anymore<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.990> have<00:03:05.260> your

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
anymore and then you have your

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.130 
anymore and then you have your
expression<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.460> simplest<00:03:06.940> radical<00:03:07.450> form<00:03:07.990> and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
expression and simplest radical form and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.070 
expression and simplest radical form and
this<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.770> our<00:03:08.860> answer
