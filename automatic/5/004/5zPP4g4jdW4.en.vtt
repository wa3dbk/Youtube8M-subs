and I was very concerned about the
limits<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.860> food<00:00:38.010> production<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.120> began

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
limits to food production and as I began

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.049 
limits to food production and as I began
to<00:00:39.660> look<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.980> whole<00:00:41.250> question<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.820> how

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
to look at this whole question of how

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.000 
to look at this whole question of how
long<00:00:42.570> could<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.840> produce<00:00:43.110> enough<00:00:43.440> food<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
long could we produce enough food I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
long could we produce enough food I
began<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> realize<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.300> much<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.690> we

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
began to realize that so much of what we

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
began to realize that so much of what we
were<00:00:46.020> doing<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.500> terms<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.860> modern

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it is I finally said how can I make the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.179 
it is I finally said how can I make the
American<00:01:12.570> people<00:01:12.869> aware<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.770> their<00:01:13.950> food

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
American people aware of what their food

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
American people aware of what their food
demands<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.760> doing<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> world<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
demands are doing to the world and I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.390 
demands are doing to the world and I
thought<00:01:16.380> well<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> only<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
thought well the only way I can do that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.710 
thought well the only way I can do that
is<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.060> know<00:01:18.210> something<00:01:18.630> about

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
is they have to know something about

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.179 
is they have to know something about
farming<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> only<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.159> know

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
farming and the only way they can know

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
farming and the only way they can know
about<00:01:20.369> farming<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.689> they're<00:01:21.869> farmers

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
about farming is if they're farmers

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.289 
about farming is if they're farmers
nearby<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.549> only<00:01:23.670> way<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.119> keep

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
nearby and the only way we can keep

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.219 
nearby and the only way we can keep
farmers<00:01:24.750> by<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.490> localize<00:01:27.420> our<00:01:27.720> food

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
farmers by is if we localize our food

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
farmers by is if we localize our food
supply<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.100> eat<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.060> we

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
supply and if we eat you know if we

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.950 
supply and if we eat you know if we
provide<00:01:30.659> customers<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.560> nearby<00:01:31.829> farmers<00:01:32.400> so

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
provide customers to nearby farmers so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
provide customers to nearby farmers so
having<00:01:33.960> reached<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.320> point<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.860> realized<00:01:35.070> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
having reached that point I realized I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.510 
having reached that point I realized I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
well the only way I'm going to know is

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.360 
well the only way I'm going to know is
if<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.020> myself<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.860> find<00:02:35.130> out

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
if I do it myself I have to find out

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.490 
if I do it myself I have to find out
what<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.330> could<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.960> know<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.350> so

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
what what you could have you know and so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400 
what what you could have you know and so
I<00:02:37.530> began<00:02:37.980> trying<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.550> do<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.900> do

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I began trying to do that I really do

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.770 
I began trying to do that I really do
think<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:41.030> we're<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.210> time<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:44.600> hope<00:02:45.600> it

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
think that we're in a time I hope it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.350 
think that we're in a time I hope it
lasts<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.410> little<00:02:46.740> while<00:02:46.980> I'm<00:02:47.640> sorry<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.150> say

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
lasts a little while I'm sorry to say

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.260 
lasts a little while I'm sorry to say
that<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:49.280> we're<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> time<00:02:50.700> when<00:02:50.880> people<00:02:51.000> are

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
that but we're in a time when people are

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.880 
that but we're in a time when people are
really<00:02:51.420> having<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.900> say<00:02:52.080> what<00:02:52.320> were<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.710> doing

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
really having to say what were we doing

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.420 
really having to say what were we doing
and<00:02:53.600> I<00:02:54.600> hope<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.930> doesn't<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.560> swing<00:02:55.980> back<00:02:56.220> up

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and I hope it doesn't like swing back up

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.970 
and I hope it doesn't like swing back up
and<00:02:56.610> people<00:02:56.790> start<00:02:57.710> trading<00:02:58.710> derivatives

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
and people start trading derivatives

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.510 
and people start trading derivatives
again<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.760> say<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.210> know<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.310> very

sobering time but there's a lot of

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.360 
sobering time but there's a lot of
people<00:03:04.320> who<00:03:04.380> still<00:03:04.650> need<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.950> sober<00:03:05.190> up
