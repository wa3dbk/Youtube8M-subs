00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.179
 hello with you rating bookmakers with 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.920
 you are your expert maxim your knees than 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.480
 today I would like to talk to you about 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 the return game 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 about the second game qualifying 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.580
 Champions League round between cisco and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.050
 sporting what can say cisco 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 seemed to make a good game on 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.969
 checkout missed twice well and scored one 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 Goal 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.640
 with not scored kicked i mean if 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.010
 Watch dry numbers in principle 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.989
 Favorite probably should be cisco but I 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.390
 would not appeal strongly to cisco fans 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.559
 why because sporting created 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.879
 enough moments in the first game only 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.620
 slowness probably attackers not 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.379
 allowed for sporting choose larger 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.000
 so what 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.290
 that I would probably play 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.650
 the coefficients are good enough and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.770
 victory king sky to win sports all 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.659
 everywhere not bad and nothing special 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 odds are good i probably would without 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:22.850
 something without any risk and probably like me 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.439
 see it would put on sports with zero 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.509
 why because what i saw in 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:34.170
 the first game makes me think about 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.049
 that sporting is probably still pass 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.159
 further and if so then they will have to like 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.990
 at least not lost 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:48.860
 so I take with the port with zero forgot 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.590
 20 next you decide with you I was 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.970
 subscribe to our youtube channel and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.810

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.810
 good luck
