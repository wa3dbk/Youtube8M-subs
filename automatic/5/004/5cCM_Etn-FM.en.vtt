00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.319
 and then good to upload more to the new video 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.269
 of android mix in this video we will see 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 how to install a series of themes 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.700
 for lg 2 it's worth in the previous video 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.029
 I made a video of how to install the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.689
 android theme android 4.4 own for 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.160
 this device that is the 2's worth 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.449
 worth these issues that I will download no 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.150
 you know the appstore you can 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.609
 find all together on the internet 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.029
 has obviously in the description that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.029
 is this 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.550
 the page would be this because I'm 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.710
 uploading a video I have the play 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.149
 I always have everything together 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.350
 on this page in the description of 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.989
 video so you can download 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.149
 the pac and good here you give to download 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.219
 and already its scale directly in the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 download I do not give it because I do not have 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.600
 and this is downloaded 46 megs look 59 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.519
 it's pretty but good depends on how 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.020
 want to have it installed because this 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.600
 they can eliminate and keep the issues 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 the same goes for what they will receive 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.570
 are the applications from this 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 that we are not going to download an application 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.399
 that particularly I use a lot that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.020
 is the android application 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.330
 zip that will leave the name of the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.190
 description of the video and if you can not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.479
 visit other videos in an application 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.069
 very useful that I recommend having 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.170
 wrapped android device if you know 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.830
 enough to unzip files 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 or another thing is worth saying that we are going to 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.429
 proceed to install how to install it like this 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.230
 that we have to go to the application 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.610
 leaving 5 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.440
 but let's enter the room when 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.210
 you have the free version works 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.630
 fairly good 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.920
 with this white where he puts 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.869
 2 We have stock s you give to extract here 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.800
 once they extract all the themes 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.360
 for the video and when the announcements are 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.010
 bad guys once I had you 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.720
 decompressed the goats will put that 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.370
 the file can not be opened is a 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.500
 normal do not worry then have to 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.000
 go from that application once the thread 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.680
 the application you are going to these files 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.509
 of our 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.920
 the device or the one that you have 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.770
 defect if for example I have the one that was 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.150
 the device since I quite like 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.600
 you have where to put all the files 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.570
 in internal storage and when you can 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.870
 to fold there will be a folder that 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.820
 call of two themes stock you give to that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.190
 folder since the whole series will appear 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.330
 of topics on our device 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.680
 now very easy to install it just 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.110
 you have to give for example to street 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.750
 put in the bird here you give him and a 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.060
 the installer of the list install and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.620
 move this is the subject they occupy quite 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.720
 you have to admit it but they have 11 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.640
 29 I do not think it's a point of 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.830
 reference and very high 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.050
 We will try to install and we can 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.030
 select the theme we give you has done 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.400
 we go back we come tired of 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.130
 menu themes we already have here the someone 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.260
 as you can see and that would be all 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.820
 the topics that you can apply and the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.060
 terminal because it remains applied in 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.670
 from alien 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.930
 so you can also enter then 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.049
 download all that 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.650
 the themes that attract this pack that I've 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.739
 could find and go together therefore 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.739
 example 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.620
 to finish it just finishes entering the 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.700
 room where I'm recording and then for 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.460
 that did not bother good as it was 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.940
 saying for example this one of 7 you give to 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.890
 install I really like them a lot 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.480
 some look the glass also 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.830
 that is one of the most 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.900
 we like him 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:44.250
 we give topics and topics we have 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.170
 seven I really like a launcher and without 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.610
 download 50 things for him can have 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.610
 in the authorship that to me is a result 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.830
 quite heavy and that you will have then 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.210
 all the good subject as this has been 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.940
 everything for today I hope you liked it 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.630
 subscribe as I said the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.750
 application is this this issue already brings by 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.010
 defect so you can not find in 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.330
 particularly since I like them a lot 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.470
 your generated content topics 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.810
 totally all that you 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.160
 you want to even have the folder and if 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.630
 you see that it weighs a lot then eliminate 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.760
 some install them when we 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.019
 want that theme again or even to 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.880
 show off your friends always 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.320
 they have the same theme, I think you 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.690
 you will have that is to fuck a little 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.280
 Well I hope you liked that the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.280
 to subscribe thanks and goodbye
