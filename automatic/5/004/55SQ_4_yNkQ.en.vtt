okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.469> here's<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.829> vintage<00:00:02.190> modified

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
okay so here's a vintage modified

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.880 
okay so here's a vintage modified
squatter<00:00:03.300> Jazzmaster<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:05.270> I<00:00:06.770> was<00:00:07.770> gonna

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
squatter Jazzmaster and I was gonna

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.400 
squatter Jazzmaster and I was gonna
replace<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.460> bracket<00:00:08.970> here<00:00:09.110> with<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> longer

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
replace this bracket here with a longer

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.910 
replace this bracket here with a longer
one<00:00:10.679> so<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.889> could<00:00:10.950> fit<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.309> us<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.759> pick<00:00:12.000> guard<00:00:12.920> but

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
one so I could fit a us a pick guard but

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:24.550 
one so I could fit a us a pick guard but
check<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.730> out

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.800 

don't<00:00:25.560> actually<00:00:25.980> fit<00:00:26.759> through<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.720> hole

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
don't actually fit through the hole

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.040 
don't actually fit through the hole
the<00:00:30.810> screw<00:00:31.140> threads<00:00:31.469> aren't<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:32.129> through

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
the screw threads aren't in through

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.500 
the screw threads aren't in through
because<00:00:34.050> you've<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:36.110> much<00:00:37.110> wider<00:00:37.440> hole<00:00:38.510> on

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
because you've got much wider hole on

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
because you've got much wider hole on
the<00:00:39.720> original<00:00:41.839> so<00:00:42.839> you<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> drill<00:00:43.379> those

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the original so you have to drill those

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.020 
the original so you have to drill those
holes<00:00:43.589> out<00:00:44.100> does<00:00:44.850> an<00:00:44.940> absolute<00:00:45.329> bastard

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.899 

okay<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.170> go

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
okay so here we go

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.859 
okay so here we go

bracket so the Mascis and the vintage

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.170 
bracket so the Mascis and the vintage
modified<00:01:07.470> holes<00:01:08.040> look<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.579> same<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.090> they

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
modified holes look at the same so they

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.380 
modified holes look at the same so they
should<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.509> able<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> fit<00:01:10.970> let's<00:01:11.970> give<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
should be able to fit let's give that a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.830 
should be able to fit let's give that a
quick<00:01:12.659> try<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:17.220> yep<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> threads<00:01:18.390> coming

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
quick try and yep the threads coming

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.040 
quick try and yep the threads coming
through<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.140> let's<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.649> back

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.990 

okay<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.890> managed<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.250> fit<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.550> bracket<00:01:26.910> on

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
okay so I managed to fit the bracket on

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.310 
okay so I managed to fit the bracket on
okay<00:01:28.610> what<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> had<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.940> do<00:01:30.120> though<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.360> make

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
okay what you had to do though is make

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.040 
okay what you had to do though is make
sure<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:32.550> burner<00:01:32.970> knobs<00:01:33.180> actually<00:01:33.570> loosely

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
sure the burner knobs actually loosely

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.320 
sure the burner knobs actually loosely
attached<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:35.940> you<00:01:36.030> screw<00:01:36.210> your

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
attached so that when you screw your

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.100 
attached so that when you screw your
bracket<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.550> mine<00:01:38.550> were<00:01:38.700> too<00:01:38.940> far<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.510> this<00:01:39.840> way

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
bracket in mine were too far up this way

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.700 
bracket in mine were too far up this way
so<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.650> were<00:01:40.770> knocking<00:01:41.220> onto<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.640> pickguard

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
so they were knocking onto the pickguard

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.170 
so they were knocking onto the pickguard
so<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> had<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.980> loosen<00:01:44.160> off<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.490> screws<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
so I had to loosen off the screws and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
so I had to loosen off the screws and
then<00:01:46.490> make<00:01:47.490> sure<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.820> were<00:01:48.620> screwed<00:01:49.620> in

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
then make sure these were screwed in

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.270 
then make sure these were screwed in
tight<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:51.470> tightened<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.620> then<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
tight and then tightened that up then to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.660 
tight and then tightened that up then to
get<00:01:53.940> this<00:01:54.060> rolling<00:01:54.300> ops<00:01:54.600> fixed<00:01:55.670> nice

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
get this rolling ops fixed nice

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.190 
get this rolling ops fixed nice
essentially<00:01:57.300> pretty<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:59.900> yeah<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.080> that's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
essentially pretty much yeah and that's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.830 
essentially pretty much yeah and that's
the<00:02:01.380> us<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.740> torch<00:02:02.040> guard<00:02:04.040> looks<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.190> right

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the us a torch guard looks all right

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.479 
the us a torch guard looks all right
just<00:02:07.469> put<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> few<00:02:07.799> screws<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> moment

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
just put a few screws in at the moment

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.490 
just put a few screws in at the moment
so<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.970> test<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> electronics<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.289> still

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
so I can test the electronics will still

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.680 
so I can test the electronics will still
work<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:13.680> only<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.450> screw<00:02:15.450> hole

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
work in and it's only one screw hole

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.619 
work in and it's only one screw hole
which<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.050> bit<00:02:16.230> off<00:02:16.349> which<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.069> one<00:02:17.629> you

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
which is a bit off which is that one you

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.580 
which is a bit off which is that one you
have<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.959> come<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.260> an<00:02:19.379> angle<00:02:19.709> there<00:02:21.470> but<00:02:22.470> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
have to come in an angle there but that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.180 
have to come in an angle there but that
shouldn't<00:02:22.830> be<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> problem

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
shouldn't be a problem

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.270 
shouldn't be a problem
okay<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.340> next<00:02:26.459> bit<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.970> bridge<00:02:28.280> taking

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
okay the next bit is the bridge taking

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.809 
okay the next bit is the bridge taking
out<00:02:29.400> these<00:02:29.549> screws<00:02:29.989> from<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.170> actual<00:02:31.819> post

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
out these screws from the actual post

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.580 
out these screws from the actual post
here<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.970> wrap<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.209> with<00:02:36.299> PTFE<00:02:36.989> tape<00:02:38.569> so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
here and wrap it with PTFE tape so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.660 
here and wrap it with PTFE tape so
basically<00:02:42.230> gives<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.410> thread<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.160> coat<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
basically gives the thread a coat in a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.960 
basically gives the thread a coat in a
tape<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.890> kind<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.160> plastic<00:02:47.640> II<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.880> it

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
tape it's kind of plastic II and it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.509 
tape it's kind of plastic II and it
wraps<00:02:48.150> around<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.599> really<00:02:48.840> nicely<00:02:51.079> and

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
wraps around it really nicely and

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.410 
wraps around it really nicely and
hopefully<00:02:53.519> when<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.730> screws<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.269> it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
hopefully when that screws in it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.830 
hopefully when that screws in it
shouldn't<00:02:54.840> rattle<00:02:55.230> anymore<00:02:56.450> put<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.569> back

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
shouldn't rattle anymore put that back

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.350 
shouldn't rattle anymore put that back
in<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.110> right<00:02:58.200> way

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.369 

their<00:03:06.900> resistance<00:03:07.200> there

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:36.820 

seems<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.040> be<00:03:15.099> going<00:03:15.430> okay
