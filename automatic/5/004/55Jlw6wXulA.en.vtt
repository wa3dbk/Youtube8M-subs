00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.140 
three o'clock and have a seat melting
away<00:03:15.170> etc<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:16.460> could<00:03:16.790> make<00:03:16.940> all<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
away etc that could make all the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.640 
away etc that could make all the
difference<00:03:17.570> if<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.780> ever<00:03:17.900> needed<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:18.410> gun

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
difference if I ever needed that gun

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.130 
difference if I ever needed that gun
quickly<00:03:19.270> not<00:03:20.270> saying<00:03:20.540> I'm<00:03:20.690> never<00:03:20.780> going<00:03:21.080> to

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
quickly not saying I'm never going to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.910 
quickly not saying I'm never going to
need<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.560> quickly

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
need it quickly

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.100 
need it quickly
but<00:03:22.160> if<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.340> did<00:03:22.580> it's<00:03:23.000> there<00:03:23.330> it's<00:03:23.630> easy<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.960> get

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
but if I did it's there it's easy to get

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.320 
but if I did it's there it's easy to get
to<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.320> like<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:24.860> said<00:03:25.100> previously<00:03:25.280> it's<00:03:26.120> more

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
to and like I said previously it's more

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.480 
to and like I said previously it's more
comfortable<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:26.960> way<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:28.070> because<00:03:28.310> these

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
comfortable that way so because these

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.580 
comfortable that way so because these
reasons<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:29.060> always<00:03:29.720> mount<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.050> holster<00:03:30.410> in<00:03:30.470> my

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
reasons I always mount the holster in my

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.350 
reasons I always mount the holster in my
car<00:03:30.830> like<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.190> said<00:03:31.400> it's<00:03:31.730> more<00:03:31.850> comfortable

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
car like I said it's more comfortable

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.900 
car like I said it's more comfortable
it's<00:03:32.690> more<00:03:32.870> convenient<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.550> rare

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
it's more convenient and in the rare

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.160 
it's more convenient and in the rare
instance<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.510> might<00:03:35.720> need<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.990> quickly

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
instance that I might need it quickly

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.660 
instance that I might need it quickly
it's<00:03:36.650> going<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.860> make<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.100> lot<00:03:37.250> easier<00:03:37.550> to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
it's going to make it a lot easier to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.640 
it's going to make it a lot easier to
get<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:38.870> someone<00:03:39.140> tells<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.380> they<00:03:39.500> want

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
get to so if someone tells you they want

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.990 
get to so if someone tells you they want
to<00:03:39.709> mount<00:03:39.890> a<00:03:39.980> holster<00:03:40.280> in<00:03:40.340> their<00:03:40.430> car<00:03:40.640> it's<00:03:40.910> not

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
to mount a holster in their car it's not

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.400 
to mount a holster in their car it's not
because<00:03:41.270> they're<00:03:41.450> paranoid<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.140> they<00:03:42.200> think

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
because they're paranoid and they think

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.810 
because they're paranoid and they think
they're<00:03:42.530> gonna<00:03:42.680> have<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:42.920> draw<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.550> quickly

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
they're gonna have to draw it quickly

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.340 
they're gonna have to draw it quickly
most<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.630> us<00:03:44.750> understand<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.290> that's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
most of us understand that that's

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.840 
most of us understand that that's
probably<00:03:45.739> not<00:03:45.860> going<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.100> happen<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:46.730> it

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
probably not going to happen but it

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.250 
probably not going to happen but it
still<00:03:47.000> doesn't<00:03:47.180> hurt<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.540> be<00:03:47.570> prepared<00:03:47.959> for<00:03:48.140> it

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
still doesn't hurt to be prepared for it

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.410 
still doesn't hurt to be prepared for it
if<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.470> do<00:03:48.620> have<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.010> do<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.790> it's<00:03:50.209> more

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
if you do have to do that and it's more

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.240 
if you do have to do that and it's more
comfortable<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.680> guess<00:03:51.860> you<00:03:51.980> want<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.160> make
