00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
application fitness so you can use the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.719 
application fitness so you can use the
nike<00:01:16.229> app<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> wear<00:01:16.890> nike<00:01:17.280> shoes<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
nike app or if you wear nike shoes you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
nike app or if you wear nike shoes you
can<00:01:17.880> hook<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.770> compatible

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
can hook it up with that is compatible

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.179 
can hook it up with that is compatible
with<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.659> i<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.439> may<00:01:22.530> even<00:01:22.560> work<00:01:22.890> with

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
with the i think it may even work with

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.890 
with the i think it may even work with
the<00:01:23.280> accelerometer<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.030> maybe<00:01:24.600> i<00:01:24.720> will<00:01:24.810> just

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the accelerometer so maybe i will just

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.510 
the accelerometer so maybe i will just
turn<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.500> run<00:01:25.920> i<00:01:25.950> haven't<00:01:26.250> tested<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
turn that on and run i haven't tested it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.469 
turn that on and run i haven't tested it

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
artists etc so that's basically the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.550 
artists etc so that's basically the
applications<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.200> simple

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
applications there so it's really simple

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.139 
applications there so it's really simple
and<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.220> gay<00:01:50.369> guys<00:01:50.549> i<00:01:50.640> want<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:50.909> over<00:01:50.939> this

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and the gay guys i want to go over this

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
and the gay guys i want to go over this
design<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.350> small<00:01:52.619> s

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
design it's really really small s

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.280 
design it's really really small s
probably<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:53.850> small<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.240> ipod<00:01:54.659> shuffle

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
probably not as small as ipod shuffle

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
probably not as small as ipod shuffle
but<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.130> mean<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:56.640> definitely<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> benefit

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
very portable you can literally just

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.500 
very portable you can literally just
clip<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.580> your<00:03:06.850> shirt<00:03:07.090> while<00:03:07.390> you're

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
clip this to your shirt while you're

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.380 
clip this to your shirt while you're
working<00:03:07.870> out<00:03:08.460> so<00:03:09.460> you<00:03:09.550> can<00:03:09.640> run<00:03:09.910> or<00:03:10.120> whatever

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
working out so you can run or whatever

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.600 
working out so you can run or whatever
and<00:03:10.660> you'll<00:03:11.080> have<00:03:11.230> music<00:03:11.620> playing<00:03:11.650> constantly

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
and you'll have music playing constantly

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.130 
and you'll have music playing constantly
is<00:03:12.760> extremely<00:03:13.360> light<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.900> won't<00:03:14.050> be

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
is extremely light so it won't be

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.449 
is extremely light so it won't be
bothersome<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.010> have<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.250> clipped

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
bothersome if you have it clipped

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.520 
bothersome if you have it clipped
anything<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.940> won't<00:03:16.030> be<00:03:16.180> dangling<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.320> think

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
anything it won't be dangling so I think

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.810
