 human anatomy dot net presents 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.660
 muscles of the tongue the tongue is a 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.610
 mobile muscular organ that is made up of 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.679
 Three parts body root and tip occupies 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.160
 most of the mouth between 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:25.539
 Dental arcades the tongue participates in 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.820
 chewing taste swallowing speaks and 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.070
 oral cleaning although its function 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.370
 main consists in bringing the food 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 towards the pharynx during swallowing and 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.580
 articulate words of spoken language 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.610
 the tongue is divided into two halves 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.770
 by a medium fibrous lingual septum each 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.860
 half of the tongue consists of four 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.310
 extrinsic muscles and four muscles 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.860
 intrinsic which are in erba 2 by 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.940
 the hypoglossal nerve 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.070
 and twelfth for cranial except the plate 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.070
 glossed that it is and snowed by the vagus nerve 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.710
 extreme tongue muscles 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.080
 muscle genius gloss or originates from the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.930
 Upper geni apophysis of the maxilla 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.270
 lower and extends in fan by the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.909
 lower face of the tongue until the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.310
 back of it the more fibers 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.789
 inferiors are inserted in the face 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.880
 anterior of the body and today of the muscle and 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.360
 glossed this muscle originates in the 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.789
 body and even greater the hyoid has 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.159
 direction to antero superior for 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.460
 insert on the side and bottom side 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.399
 of the tongue a muscle bunch can 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.330
 originate from the minor to the hyoid and 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.780
 it's called control bear muscle style 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.880
 glossed 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.510
 originates at the anterior edge of the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.600
 styloid process near the tip and 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.610
 in the ligament style and today's o 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.320
 descends in the previous direction and passes 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.200
 below the insertion of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.570
 superior constrictor of the pharynx up 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.649
 its insertion on the lateral side of the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.340
 language 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.560
 cough muscle glossed this muscle 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.189
 originates from the lower face of the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.780
 aponeurosis of the soft palate 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.269
 it descends forming the anterior pillar of the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.090
 palatal veil in front of the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.480
 amygdala to insert in the portion 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.799
 lateral of the tongue 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.590
 intrinsic tongue muscles the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.170
 superior longitudinal muscle forms a 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.330
 thin layer in the depth of the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.050
 mucous membrane of the back of the tongue 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.170
 the inferior longitudinal muscle is a 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.930
 narrow band next to the face 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.200
 lower tongue 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.269
 the transverse muscle of the tongue is 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.299
 located in the depth of the muscle

 longitudinal superior muscle 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.250
 vertical of the tongue has a

 direction in 0 lateral from the back of 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.950
 the tongue the nerve section 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.519
 hypoglossus determines paralysis and 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.109
 final atrophy on one side of the tongue the 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.889
 tongue is diverted to the side 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:20.200
 paralyzed during production by the 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.169
 effect of the genius muscle glossed from the side 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.720
 against lateral usually the cause of 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:29.040
 the paralysis of hypoglossus are the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.189
 Mandibular fractures is 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.859
 all the muscles of the tongue are in 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.409
 erba 2 by the hypoglossus except the 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.049
 muscle for tolosa that is in erbated to 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.250
 through the plexus pharynx or through the nerve
