00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.780
 in the last weeks I was in 15 all 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.820
 this 15 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.800
 But lidls do not buy eggs 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.470
 any eggs but one from the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.460
 so-called ground ten pieces for 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.070
 99 cents 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.329
 that's an absolute dumping price i 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.869
 wanted to know under what circumstances 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.050
 the chickens live these cheap eggs 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.899
 to produce 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 Based on the stamp of each egg 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.520
 I could be present 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.629
 find out where the chickens live so 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.399
 I drove across Germany 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.590
 and in the Netherlands 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.590
 looking for the chickens 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.030
 living in these huge halls 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.070
 hundreds of thousands of 9 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.470
 There are lands there 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.180
 only such halls live there 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.180
 a hundred times more animals than humans 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.899
 because many companies I am not 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.210
 Come in because they will be hailed 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.750
 extremely well guarded security service 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.469
 watchdogs video cameras come in 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.469
 impossible 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.230
 I have these eggs here at aldi in 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.090
 bought dortmund and there it is me 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.100
 also succeeded in finding out where the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.180
 wiener be kept and also in the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.000
 come in 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.640
 the company is already in holland 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.260
 outside there were dead animals in the protection of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.660
 darkness I sneaked into the stall 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.020
 I crowded thousands of chickens 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.490
 next to each other and one above the other 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.690
 The consumer is standing in the ground 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
 certainly different 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.580
 the chickens are under the roof 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.440
 stacked a floor to scratch and 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.000
 sandbaths are not there in the reason 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.460
 Animals must be on a grid floor 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.090
 are the torment so far the eye 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:06.399
 This is perfectly normal 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.590
 Animals simply die in these ones 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.410
 attitudes in this pose the animals 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.430
 simply summarized 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.320
 you have to be aware that it is 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.980
 this animal owner like you to the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.750
 profit goes 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 and that's why the animals are level 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.140
 together become dangerous among these 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.330
 rat foreign conditions 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.100
 yes, it makes me very sad 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.420
 see 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.470
 I'm only a few minutes here and 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.470
 I've found a dead animal again 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.460
 that is trapped underneath 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.990
 androsch brings 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.190
 as you can imagine 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.780
 animal cruelty because they just do not and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.590
 I can go full time on to 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.590
 stand on the ground again 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.990
 Thousands will also be available in the next business 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.550
 Chickens without spout kept the ground 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.560
 These animals can only 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.030
 Nonetheless, the eggs are kept as soil 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.030
 sold at aldi in mÃ¼nster 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.400
 apparently is a former battery 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.490
 that goes there in front was removed and that 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.660
 whole is now called soil conservation 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.530
 I do not have a single one on the floor 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.530
 animal seen 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.110
 on my lane search in Holland 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.080
 I met an egg producer 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.080
 produces 700,000 eggs per week and 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.700
 delivers to Germany the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.710
 Production runs completely automatically 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.690
 the eggs come from conveyor belts 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.880
 The lines here are monitored by 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.880
 Video camera packed by robot 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.240
 Of course I am proud 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.240
 the design again look 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:05:01.049
 fits but just rebuilt 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:03.479
 this concerns what also here must the 

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:06.439
 chickens are crowded chickens per 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:11.999
 Square outlet failed 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:15.110
 but the wiener can be found here 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.110
 diving in germany 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:41.249
 Aldi I do not think so 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:47.039
 mother 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:48.239
 retro looking for the chickens the 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.129
 four lidl and aldi 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:52.019
 The cheap eggs I produce 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.869
 seen and experienced a lot 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:56.399
 supermarket chains the egg producers and 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:58.679
 the lobbyists are trying to 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.329
 consumers to suggest that the 

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:02.969
 ground husbandry equates to 

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:04.739
 a farm idyll but that has with 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.319
 not much to do with reality 

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:09.689
 Over 17 million eggs are produced each year 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.019
 eaten in germany and this mass 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:15.539
 has to be produced somehow 

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:19.009
 and who is it that must be clear that he 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.009
 this system supports
