00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 the fastest being on our planet 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.359
 small california mite 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.120
 no larger than sesame seeds 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.400
 turned out to be so fast that he beat 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.349
 world record for running among animals and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.790
 I will move my two fastest 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.369
 competitors for second 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 and actually the third place as it was found out 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.330
 Californian students 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.859
 college this agile inhabitant of the south 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
 california is capable for a second 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.670
 overcome the distance you only 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.090
 ponder equal to the length of its 3122 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.219
 own body until recently 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.260
 according to his Persian belonged to the Australian 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.530
 boredom well 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.559
 scattering up to 171 their body length 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.610
 second and the second place was taken by all 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 famous and bar 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.360
 being the fastest among the land 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.030
 animals and developing speed 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.579
 h100 three kilometers per hour and pairs per 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.100
 second to overcome only 16 lengths 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.980
 of your body that is 20 times slower 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.969
 tiny california mite 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.340
 man already to get close to 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.070
 new record holder will have to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.740
 run at about two speeds 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.820
 thousand one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.060
 watching these amazing things 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.890
 future biologists spent in the back 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.860
 using high-speed camera oleg 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.659
 Californian kilns are described back in 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.920
 1916 almost nothing is known for 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.710
 except that they live under 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 stones or along roadsides and has 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.400
 habit abruptly has direction 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 movement another interesting fact 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 discovered by the students turned 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.900
 california ability includes 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.270
 run on hot surfaces 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.210
 whose temperatures approach 60 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.210
 degrees Celsius new discovery right away 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.130
 attracted the attention of scientists they sure 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.350
 that studying the operator mechanism is not 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.320
 banned give impetus to the development of new 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.710
 technology in bionics
