three power and FX the noise back your
hearing<00:02:02.190> probably<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.730> belt<00:02:03.420> or<00:02:04.170> alternator

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
hearing probably the belt or alternator

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.300 
hearing probably the belt or alternator
just<00:02:05.280> got<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.550> tighten<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> belt<00:02:06.660> up<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.990> that

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
just got to tighten the belt up on that

just got to tighten the belt up on that
and<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.460> pretty<00:02:08.670> much<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:08.940> so

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
and that's pretty much it so

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.800 
and that's pretty much it so
