00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:41.800
 Old album turn over Thank you I always mutter people who always encourage me in my heart 

00:00:41.801 --> 00:01:15.500
 It's a sunny day, it's a sunny day, it's a smiley day that floats away Even when it's going to be far away, it's a day when I'm looking for a resurgence 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:43.000
 Pray for the first star It's my habit and it looks up at dusk. 

00:01:43.001 --> 00:02:17.000
 Sorrow, pleasure, already, that smile I believe that I can meet someday if I see you from your place, I will live 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Even on a sunny day or a rainy day, I remember that smile memories that float in the distance Even if I am far away, I miss you I feel for you I think so 

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:28.800
 I want to meet I want to meet my feelings for you
