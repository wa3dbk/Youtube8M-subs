00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hey guys, beauty that makro in the video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 Today I have the second episode of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.470
 tips series of pvp and what we will 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.800
 learn today 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.660
 I'm going to teach combo today and everything 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.790
 buy for example as you give one like 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.770
 How do you get out of a combo, which is a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.029
 how then to start what is serious 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.970
 I'll explain to you what 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.859
 basically it 's a combo a combo's is not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 just from minecraft various games and has a 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 system of combos business of how 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.800
 mainly fight games of this kind 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.480
 kind of platform, right? 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.189
 Congo is more or less this here that I 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.380
 I'll try to do it now, see. Looks 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.020
 How many I laughed at this guy and he did not 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.180
 could imitate are half I give 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.399
 several expensive pace he failed 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.899
 to irritate for some reason alone or because 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.520
 He can not beat me. 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.899
 or because I 'm doing something 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.469
 very good strategy 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.030
 for example, this face here is a country 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.469
 He died too. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.530
 now got to stay here which is a rack 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.789
 My god the attack that hit fast here. 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.039
 Do you see what I'm doing here? 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.469
 streiff in them they can not beat 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.370
 right here, you see agents perceive 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.500
 this is not it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 so this is the combo how it is 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.049
 basically this now which types of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.450
 like that there exist streiff streiff 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.820
 is simply like here that basically 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.070
 so this is a person you turn in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.080
 the person who makes it impossible for her to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.490
 get attacked like that because she will not 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 You can stay spinning. 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.299
 confused and will not know where to attack and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.090
 with a nursery has a small delay 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.829
 game even though not the server 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.869
 he will not be able to attack 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.210
 you have spinning movement and how it is 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.400
 that you get off that fuel and how 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.520
 streiff as I said you have to leave 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.380
 more or less so, fifa is based on 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.150
 Will you go around the guy in? 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.369
 enable and debate as I have already said 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.590
 so what are you going to do if the guy 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.570
 You have spinning here you will turn to 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.850
 Cause if the guy is turning to 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.079
 and you will go along with it will be the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.090
 same thing on your line 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.890
 Because here 's the guy on the line and it's 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.780
 spinning forth or rotating along with it 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.159
 It's going to be the same as nothing, so the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.170
 what do i have to do if the guy 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.390
 okay so turning I'll take over here 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.909
 because I'll get close enough 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.520
 enough close to him to give a hit 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.440
 In him and city ​​will break as of him I 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.150
 I can go back to him and try to 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.190
 noise again and if he can 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.690
 fight I have 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.790
 I left the Congo again using this 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.410
 technique of trying to get out so by turning 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.470
 aside from him giving you an example 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.560
 here to check and hackmann this is what the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.820
 old scrotum good another kind of how it is 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.920
 the one that I had signed a 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.170
 bit in the first episode that is 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.850
 how is the www combo you get 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.620
 thinking of giving several times what it is that 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.270
 I'll try to do it here now, see. 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.760
 a little bit in him but he died 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.430
 the comude www it is based simply 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.830
 you tighten up w you instead of giving 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.410
 one dash stay clicking on the guy you go 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.910
 keep giving each other so look at the 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.950
 Snowman going forward all the time 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.090
 because the moment you give this test 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.760
 of a hit 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.350
 he plays the player one more distance 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.440
 far away than when you had so 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.580
 Look at either a dash attacks and only you 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.350
 will be doing it fast so the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.980
 dash attacks leave the chain 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.360
 attacks 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.580
 This is going to be attacking the person to 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.530
 far and you will stay with manuela 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.600
 and how do you get out of yourself as 10 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.880
 of attack leaves cap leaves and only step 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.690
 demonstrate this and this technique here in 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.150
 Someone here in this guy here with you here 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.980
 O to die old if I get a guy 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.690
 here that does not die to show this 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.209
 attack test technique for you 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.280
 because fishing here means making the 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.660
 assassin murders a kit that kills 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.360
 very fast here only this 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.400
 This hefty one here was good so 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.560
 dash of ww more or less 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.840
 that's right there you just have to stay 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.550
 pressing w to you attack the people 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.410
 It will be a lot easier for you with 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:45.290
 pans between the cua tech candidate www 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.030
 destroys I prefer to destroy it because 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.190
 destroys was very efficient you stay 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.769
 turning around the guy and a lot of people 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.870
 You do not know how to get out of Streiff's kind 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.920
 complicated to distract and how 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.950
 You leave the Congo congo, the guy will 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.750
 cuban www what are you do you will 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 back when it gives you a rhythm 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.400
 because if the guy keeps giving like 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.239
 www you try to get going over it 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.830
 sprint 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.720
 Are you going to help because you're only going to stay? 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.400
 getting closer to the guy who gives you 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.410
 another dash with the attack of playing to 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.239
 How much do you want to make you? 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.040
 You want to leave the congo then you enjoy 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.650
 This hit that deal with 10 that will play 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.210
 far and goes back and jump goes to 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.530
 back and jump for example leaves I do not know 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.900
 if someone knows how to do this as 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.669
 www 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.310
 see if there's anyone who can handle it with a bar 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.130
 to show how I know I came 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.630
 here someone and bolatti would have me back of 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.820
 back there and realize that I 've been a lot 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.009
 It 's because he was already there. 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.530
 giving the dash combo and still 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.669
 complements that with the handle and 111 and 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.259
 I walked back 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.389
 it helped a lot and touched me 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.000
 back and when you touch me back what I 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.740
 I go out, for example, to this 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.370
 business here in the combo I went back and 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.080
 by law 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.840
 I come out back and jumped on him 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.830
 because in the air there is not much that and how it is 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.530
 that I can say 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.880
 and if that little sword knoc that 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.470
 Throw you back. 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.229
 in the air it is a little smaller in these 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.210
 started on this occasion but sometimes in the air 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.010
 When you're in the air, you hit. 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.110
 in it it goes far beyond the foot 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.030
 on the ground but on this occasion if you jump 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.139
 on top of the type car so look it goes 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.539
 If you lose, you'll see that the guy missed it. 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.889
 totally bulimia saved on top of it 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.930
 he stayed on his back for a few moments 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.940
 saw this technique of jumping a lot 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.590
 good for you to leave as wwf face it 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.000
 kidnaps to just let something I 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.800

 counter position it is turning the 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.729
 Another one as I taught was the ww combo. 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.830
 dash for you to leave him you go to 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.360
