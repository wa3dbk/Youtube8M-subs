about<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.780> let's<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> look<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
about that let's just take a look at the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.030 
about that let's just take a look at the
figure<00:00:38.579> itself<00:00:39.110> here's<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> figure<00:00:40.680> itself

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
figure itself here's the figure itself

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.369 
figure itself here's the figure itself
it's<00:00:41.340> completely<00:00:41.820> plastic<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.899> seems<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it's completely plastic but it seems to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's completely plastic but it seems to
be<00:00:43.469> based<00:00:43.710> off<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.309> proportions<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.090> the

familiar with it's got really good
detail<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.469> its<00:00:49.559> size<00:00:49.940> whatever<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> see

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
detail for its size whatever you see

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
go up and down here you can see the knee

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.850 
go up and down here you can see the knee
articulation<00:01:06.390> which<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> actually<00:01:07.650> pretty

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
articulation which is actually pretty

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.490 
articulation which is actually pretty
good<00:01:07.979> his<00:01:08.939> knees<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.479> Bend<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
good his knees do Bend all the way and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.170 
good his knees do Bend all the way and
there's<00:01:11.310> sort<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.729> crouching<00:01:12.000> position

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
there's sort of a crouching position

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.310 
there's sort of a crouching position
there<00:01:12.750> he<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.830> sit<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.990> amount<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
there he can sit for the amount of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.660 
there he can sit for the amount of
articulation<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.100> gave<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> legs<00:01:17.549> I'm

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
articulation that gave the legs I'm

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.280 
articulation that gave the legs I'm
surprised<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.210> did<00:01:18.450> nothing<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> arms

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
surprised they did nothing with the arms

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.359 
surprised they did nothing with the arms
you<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.939> go<00:01:20.939> forward<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.220> can

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you just go forward like so so you can

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
you just go forward like so so you can
make<00:01:23.520> Oh<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.000> flying<00:01:24.600> position

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
make Oh like a little flying position

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.770 
make Oh like a little flying position
with<00:01:25.229> his<00:01:25.320> knee<00:01:25.500> bent<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.979> Superman<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.780> like

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
with his knee bent like Superman I like

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
with his knee bent like Superman I like
the<00:01:27.930> fact<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.439> did<00:01:28.829> work<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.189> some

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the fact that they did work in some

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.120 
the fact that they did work in some
detents<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> arms<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:31.439> wings<00:01:31.680> move

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
detents in the arms the wings move

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.800 
detents in the arms the wings move
around<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.820> there's<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.090> no<00:01:33.299> reason<00:01:33.479> for

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
around but there's really no reason for

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.830 
around but there's really no reason for
that<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:34.860> fold<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> lines<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.810> not

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that they don't fold the lines do not

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.179 
that they don't fold the lines do not
separate<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.619> there's<00:01:37.829> no<00:01:37.920> type<00:01:38.159> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
separate so there's no type of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
separate so there's no type of
transformation<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.780> just

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
transformation going on here it's just

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
transformation going on here it's just
the<00:01:40.170> basic<00:01:40.530> figure<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.610> took<00:01:41.759> me<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> while<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the basic figure it took me a while to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.520 
the basic figure it took me a while to
take<00:01:42.420> him<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.750> his<00:01:42.810> packaging<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.470> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
take him out of his packaging because I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.719 
take him out of his packaging because I
