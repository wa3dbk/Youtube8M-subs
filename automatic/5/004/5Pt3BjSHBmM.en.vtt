a<00:00:37.770> time<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.280> isn't<00:00:38.550> too<00:00:38.730> long<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.180> should<00:00:39.239> be

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
a time that isn't too long it should be

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.479 
a time that isn't too long it should be
more<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:39.930> 2<00:00:40.079> minutes<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.770> 30<00:00:40.890> seconds<00:00:41.309> but

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
more than 2 minutes and 30 seconds but

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
more than 2 minutes and 30 seconds but
probably<00:00:42.180> less<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.600> 10<00:00:42.809> minutes<00:00:43.050> or<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
probably less in like 10 minutes or so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.639 
probably less in like 10 minutes or so
so<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.539> legit<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so it you know it's legit if it's on the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.459 
so it you know it's legit if it's on the
map<00:00:46.829> criminal<00:00:47.460> minds<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.870> land<00:00:49.140> race

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
