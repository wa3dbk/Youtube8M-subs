it<00:00:51.210> used<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.690> higher<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.320> I'm<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it used to be higher but I'm going to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.790 
it used to be higher but I'm going to
have<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> crank<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.430> back<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.850> again<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.800> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
have to crank that back up again as you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410 
have to crank that back up again as you
will<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.280> second<00:00:56.699> some<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> spies

will see in a second some of the spies

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.979 
will see in a second some of the spies
from<00:00:57.660> America<00:00:58.199> had<00:00:58.379> died<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.390> are<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
from America had died so we are going to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.799 
from America had died so we are going to
move<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.280> about<00:01:02.309> point<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.480> spies<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
move it down to about point one spies a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.109 
move it down to about point one spies a

day maybe I'll be able to replenish my

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.070 
day maybe I'll be able to replenish my
stock<00:01:06.180> fast<00:01:06.900> enough<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.270> I've<00:01:09.270> done<00:01:09.810> some

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
stock fast enough and I've done some

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:24.850 
stock fast enough and I've done some
research<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:11.430> here

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.530 

pretty<00:01:25.490> low<00:01:25.700> on<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:25.970> naval<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.390> air

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540

doctrines<00:01:27.080> usually<00:01:27.860> now<00:01:28.100> usually<00:01:28.310> I'll<00:01:28.520> do

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
doctrines usually now usually I'll do

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.070 
doctrines usually now usually I'll do
too<00:01:28.820> many<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.090> those<00:01:29.180> believe<00:01:29.510> it<00:01:29.600> or<00:01:29.660> not<00:01:29.780> and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
too many of those believe it or not and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.200 
too many of those believe it or not and
with<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.070> said<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.400> think<00:01:31.580> it's<00:01:31.820> time<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.060> we

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
with that said I think it's time that we

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.510 
with that said I think it's time that we
start<00:01:32.510> off<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.810> game<00:01:37.060> also<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.330> address<00:01:38.810> that

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
start off the game also to address that

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.250 
start off the game also to address that
the<00:01:40.520> intelligence<00:01:40.940> portion<00:01:41.510> you<00:01:41.900> can<00:01:41.930> see

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
the intelligence portion you can see

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.700 
the intelligence portion you can see
that<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.770> number<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.640> spies<00:01:44.030> i<00:01:44.060> have<00:01:44.600> here<00:01:45.050> has

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
that the number of spies i have here has

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.900 
that the number of spies i have here has
significantly<00:01:46.610> reduced<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:47.210> America<00:01:47.740> Austria

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
significantly reduced in America Austria

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.570 
significantly reduced in America Austria
so<00:01:49.910> I<00:01:50.210> simply<00:01:51.140> changed<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.740> plans<00:01:52.070> back<00:01:52.400> to

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
so I simply changed the plans back to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.250 
so I simply changed the plans back to
counter<00:01:53.000> espionage<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.660> USA<00:01:54.020> will<00:01:54.200> I

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
counter espionage in the USA will I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.969 
counter espionage in the USA will I
build<00:01:54.470> up<00:01:54.620> additional<00:01:54.950> spies<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:56.630> way<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:56.750> can

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
build up additional spies that way I can

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.650 
build up additional spies that way I can
kill<00:01:57.979> some<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.310> theirs<00:01:58.460> before<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:59.000> continue<00:01:59.360> to

many new infantry units and that's

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.810 
many new infantry units and that's
because<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:33.229> wait<00:04:33.979> until<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.310> get<00:04:34.430> quite<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.729> few

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
because I wait until I get quite a few

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.610 
because I wait until I get quite a few

divisions<00:04:41.510> I<00:04:41.750> just<00:04:42.560> find<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.889> by<00:04:43.280> doing<00:04:43.340> it

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
divisions I just find that by doing it

this<00:04:43.729> way<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.360> saved<00:04:45.139> down<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.620> save<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:45.979> lot<00:04:46.160> of

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
this way I saved down I save a lot of

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.760 
this way I saved down I save a lot of
money<00:04:46.490> on<00:04:46.580> upgrades<00:04:47.350> because<00:04:48.350> I<00:04:48.500> would<00:04:48.650> need

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
money on upgrades because I would need

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.290 
money on upgrades because I would need
to<00:04:48.830> upgrade<00:04:49.040> just<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.610> many<00:04:49.790> more<00:04:49.970> units

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
to upgrade just that many more units

when I hit that a research plateau it is

when I hit that a research plateau it is
December<00:04:59.450> 1936<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.680> is<00:05:00.830> where<00:05:00.979> I<00:05:01.010> start

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
December 1936 and this is where I start

nothing<00:05:04.400> serious<00:05:04.669> but<00:05:05.210> just<00:05:05.900> something<00:05:06.110> to

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
nothing serious but just something to

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.460 
nothing serious but just something to

ok<00:05:13.010> then<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.820> can<00:05:13.940> see<00:05:14.150> that<00:05:14.389> with<00:05:14.539> that<00:05:14.810> a

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
ok then you can see that with that a

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.469 
ok then you can see that with that a
little<00:05:15.800> bit<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.250> leadership<00:05:16.639> I<00:05:16.910> invested<00:05:17.360> I'll

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
little bit of leadership I invested I'll

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.279 
little bit of leadership I invested I'll
gain<00:05:17.750> about<00:05:18.410> nine<00:05:18.740> liters<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.130> day<00:05:20.110> that<00:05:21.110> adds
