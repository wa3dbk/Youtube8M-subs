Moody I think just because he's just a

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.340 
Moody I think just because he's just a
nutcase<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.510> he<00:01:01.510> just<00:01:01.750> doesn't<00:01:02.050> mind<00:01:02.230> getting

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.770 

I<00:02:11.160> probably<00:02:11.610> say<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:12.510> best

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
skills to stick it runner with the wall

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.009 
skills to stick it runner with the wall
so<00:02:20.099> probably<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.120> ability<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.750> be

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019
