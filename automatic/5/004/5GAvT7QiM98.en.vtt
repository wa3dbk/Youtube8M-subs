console I can see three green lights
this<00:00:49.420> indicates<00:00:49.929> that<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.199> flaps<00:00:50.469> are<00:00:50.710> in

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
this indicates that the flaps are in

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.919 
this indicates that the flaps are in
landing<00:00:51.190> position<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.910> that<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.570> landing

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.720 
gear is down and locked as I get closer
to<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.379> airfield<00:00:56.739> I'm<00:00:57.010> going<00:00:57.219> to<00:00:57.280> do<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.399> weave

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
and place the airfield on the right side

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.279 
and place the airfield on the right side
of<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.160> nose<00:01:00.449> I'm<00:01:01.449> also<00:01:01.629> going<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.960> raise<00:01:02.079> my

better look I'm going to keep my

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.270 
better look I'm going to keep my
vertical<00:01:06.880> velocity<00:01:07.450> gauge<00:01:07.690> between<00:01:08.020> 2.5<00:01:08.619> and

I<00:01:11.579> now<00:01:12.579> have<00:01:12.759> a<00:01:12.790> good<00:01:13.000> look<00:01:13.150> at<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.360> airfield

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
I now have a good look at the airfield

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.539 
I now have a good look at the airfield
on<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.960> right<00:01:14.170> side<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.650> those<00:01:14.860> which<00:01:15.250> places

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
on the right side in those which places

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.429 
on the right side in those which places
me<00:01:15.759> in<00:01:15.939> a<00:01:16.030> good<00:01:16.210> position<00:01:16.329> for<00:01:16.960> my<00:01:17.049> final

me in a good position for my final

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.249 
me in a good position for my final
approach<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.450> I'll<00:01:19.450> turn<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.689> my<00:01:19.869> final

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
approach and I'll turn to my final

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.109 
approach and I'll turn to my final
approach<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.979> place<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.369> nose<00:01:21.549> shortly

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
approach and place the nose shortly

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.280 
approach and place the nose shortly
before<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.600> runway<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:25.630> keeping<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.049> close

before the runway I'm keeping a close
eye<00:01:26.500> on<00:01:26.530> my<00:01:26.740> airspeed<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.520> make<00:01:27.700> sure<00:01:27.909> that

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
eye on my airspeed to make sure that

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.590 
eye on my airspeed to make sure that
it's<00:01:28.299> not<00:01:28.509> fall<00:01:28.869> below<00:01:29.079> 200<00:01:29.680> km/h<00:01:30.600> anything
