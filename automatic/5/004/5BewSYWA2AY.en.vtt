00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
but they did fix a bunch of bugs so I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.750 
but they did fix a bunch of bugs so I
think<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> definitely<00:00:22.500> worth<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.550> most

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

spawn a little less frequently than they

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.720 
spawn a little less frequently than they
did<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.680> guess<00:00:55.949> they're<00:00:56.160> responding<00:00:56.489> too

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.400 
did I guess they're responding too
frequently<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.870> had<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> cut<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> down

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410

frequently and they had to cut that down
a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:59.699> also<00:00:59.820> changed<00:01:00.329> anvil<00:01:00.780> naming

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
a little they also changed anvil naming

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.539 
a little they also changed anvil naming
over<00:01:01.469> here<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.370> no<00:01:02.640> matter<00:01:02.820> how<00:01:03.480> many<00:01:04.549> things

something<00:01:19.500> levels<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.460> now<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.759> works<00:01:20.970> great

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
something levels but now it works great

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.440 
something levels but now it works great
with<00:01:21.900> normal<00:01:22.650> levels<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.189> they<00:01:23.850> also<00:01:24.090> tweaked

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
with normal levels and they also tweaked

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870 
with normal levels and they also tweaked
how<00:01:24.900> much<00:01:25.110> enchantment<00:01:25.740> reward<00:01:26.670> or

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
how much enchantment reward or

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
how much enchantment reward or
experience<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:27.780> smelting<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
experience you get from smelting and I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.350 
experience you get from smelting and I
haven't<00:01:29.220> tested<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> smoked<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
haven't tested this so I smoked it a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
haven't tested this so I smoked it a
whole<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:31.259> cooked<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.710> whole<00:01:31.860> stack<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.159> steak

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
whole or cooked a whole stack of steak

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.710 
whole or cooked a whole stack of steak
and<00:01:32.640> let's<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:32.909> much<00:01:33.030> experience<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> get

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and let's see how much experience we get

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.219 
and let's see how much experience we get
for<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:35.100> got<00:01:35.280> two<00:01:35.579> levels<00:01:35.939> which<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:36.900> not

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
for it we got two levels which I'm not

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
for it we got two levels which I'm not
sure<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.590> that's<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.100> probably<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> little

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
sure if that's it's probably a little

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940 
sure if that's it's probably a little
less<00:01:38.850> than<00:01:39.150> normal<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.560> would<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.920> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
less than normal what you would get I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.700 
less than normal what you would get I
think<00:01:41.130> they've<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.460> made<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> little<00:01:42.710> less

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
think they've just made a little less

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
think they've just made a little less
experience<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.880> pretty<00:01:45.360> easy

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
experience because it was pretty easy
