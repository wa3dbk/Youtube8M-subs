00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 lived on the same street since childhood 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.550
 best communicated knew well friend 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.880
 always tried to be friends 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.340
 together he was friend the best she the best 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.430
 friend supported her when she was 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.580
 hard beat the scum who to not 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.670
 pestered never swore at her and not 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.420
 was rude endured all her antics and everything 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.449
 scandals 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.449
 but years go by teens become adults 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.759
 all began to look at her and hands gaze 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.510
 feeling floated to her he held back 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.149
 simply 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.110
 and so loved when she was near 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.079
 Trembling every moment 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.980
 seconds without it poured flour but not 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.710
 could decide 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.510
 tell her about it thought than the way she didn't 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.510
 so better stay friend 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.160
 this story would have ended fun but not 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.610
 always in life happy ending life 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.519
 the other is not like the songs he loved and 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.190
 but strongly but she did not know he was shy 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.200
 confessed afraid to spoil the relationship 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.710
 kind of cherishes 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.290
 they were afraid that if she did not fall in love she would leave him 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.900
 so I suffered when she met 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.140
 by others he was not a simple guy 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.690
 the majors are a little timid and in the shower solid 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.229
 romantic did not hurt her and not 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.110
 entered into a quarrel gave her flowers and braided 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.860
 and bows will make it all reality 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.940
 whims 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.520
 did everything to see her smile 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.899
 incredible deeds and surprises and every 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.630
 holiday for the ring open i and here 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.539
 the moment came he was already ready could not 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.950
 pick up words when writing a note to her 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.680
 bought a huge bunch 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.860

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.500
 rushed straight to her she opened the door 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.600
 he stepped into her apartment and 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.840
 ran wedding dress 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.290

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.620

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.650
