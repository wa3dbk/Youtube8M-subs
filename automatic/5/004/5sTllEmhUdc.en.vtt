when<00:00:04.460> I<00:00:04.490> set<00:00:04.790> out<00:00:04.819> to<00:00:05.029> make<00:00:05.060> a<00:00:05.210> router<00:00:05.509> table<00:00:06.050> I

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
when I set out to make a router table I

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.530 
when I set out to make a router table I
actually<00:00:06.620> thought<00:00:07.160> about<00:00:07.490> just<00:00:08.059> building<00:00:08.270> a

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
actually thought about just building a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.330 
actually thought about just building a
simple<00:00:08.809> little<00:00:09.170> stand<00:00:09.910> but<00:00:11.110> I<00:00:12.219> had<00:00:13.219> the

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
simple little stand but I had the

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.820 
simple little stand but I had the
mindset<00:00:13.820> that<00:00:14.059> thinking<00:00:14.780> well<00:00:14.990> if<00:00:15.259> I'm<00:00:15.559> going

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
mindset that thinking well if I'm going

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.760 
mindset that thinking well if I'm going
to<00:00:15.950> have<00:00:16.160> something<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:16.939> big<00:00:17.410> then<00:00:18.410> I<00:00:18.439> might

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
to have something this big then I might

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.980 
to have something this big then I might
as<00:00:18.800> well<00:00:18.890> build<00:00:19.160> it<00:00:19.340> right<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:19.970> and<00:00:20.480> get<00:00:20.869> all

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
as well build it right and and get all

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.980 
as well build it right and and get all
the<00:00:21.080> features<00:00:21.260> in<00:00:21.560> it<00:00:21.619> that<00:00:21.770> I<00:00:21.859> want<00:00:22.779> my<00:00:23.779> router

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990
