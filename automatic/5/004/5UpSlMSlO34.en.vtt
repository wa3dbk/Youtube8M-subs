00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.970
 to summer when it starts to fall which 19 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.500

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.350
 Similar 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.620
 history of grand theft auto 5 or 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.930
 we are going to do missions similar to that of 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.330
 grand theft auto 5 but it is multiplayer 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.020
 study was confirmed today and 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.030
 will come in the future for online gta 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.640
 who have no memory should remember 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.690
 that this type of mission should have 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.180
 left on day 1 of gta launch 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.010
 online but in the end it never came out because 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.800
 the people to face was more 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.060
 worried about good at recovering the 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.190
 server reminds us that it was the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.470
 contra server there were flaws in the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.140
 gta servers online and you could not 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.820
 play good because that was the reason why 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.800
 which did not get this kind of mission 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.200
 not now you will be able to do missions with 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.690
 your mates from the main story 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.720
 some were going to have new weapons 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.490
 do not department many new things like that 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.260

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.150
