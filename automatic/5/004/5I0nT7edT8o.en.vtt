00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
earth buildings in Yemen I wouldn't call

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.350 
earth buildings in Yemen I wouldn't call
them<00:00:29.470> earth<00:00:29.710> buildings<00:00:30.340> I<00:00:30.670> would<00:00:30.910> be<00:00:31.119> more

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
them earth buildings I would be more

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.450 
them earth buildings I would be more
specific<00:00:32.020> because<00:00:32.230> there<00:00:32.650> are<00:00:32.770> various<00:00:33.160> types

for the last at least 25 if not more
years<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:55.019> work<00:00:56.019> in<00:00:56.500> some<00:00:57.250> great<00:00:57.550> detail<00:00:57.579> at

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
years I work in some great detail at

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.630 
years I work in some great detail at
establishing<00:00:59.170> how<00:00:59.620> these<00:00:59.920> buildings<00:01:00.489> are

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
establishing how these buildings are

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:24.109 
establishing how these buildings are
made

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.930 

not<00:01:25.119> story<00:01:25.810> so<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:26.799> don't<00:01:27.130> like<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.610> attach

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
not story so I don't like to attach

not story so I don't like to attach
dates<00:01:28.390> in<00:01:28.840> buildings<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.790> buildings<00:01:30.820> I've

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
dates in buildings the buildings I've

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.680 
dates in buildings the buildings I've
worked<00:01:31.930> on<00:01:32.259> definitely<00:01:33.100> go<00:01:33.460> back<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.880> 200<00:01:34.090> 300

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
worked on definitely go back to 200 300

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.550 
worked on definitely go back to 200 300
and<00:01:35.229> some<00:01:35.530> more<00:01:36.250> years<00:01:36.550> but<00:01:37.090> we<00:01:38.080> know<00:01:38.259> for<00:01:38.500> a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
and some more years but we know for a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.170 
and some more years but we know for a
fact<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.950> these<00:01:39.220> buildings<00:01:39.790> have<00:01:40.000> been

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
fact that these buildings have been

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.380 
fact that these buildings have been
there<00:01:40.479> since<00:01:41.369> creosote<00:01:42.369> which<00:01:42.399> appeared

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
there since creosote which appeared

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.830 
there since creosote which appeared
civilizations<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.619> old<00:01:44.860> as<00:01:45.100> seven<00:01:45.690> Queen<00:01:46.690> of

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
civilizations as old as seven Queen of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.800 
civilizations as old as seven Queen of
Sheba<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.490> think<00:01:48.820> if<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.240> go<00:01:49.420> back<00:01:49.630> to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
Sheba then I think if you go back to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.620 
Sheba then I think if you go back to
Genesis<00:01:50.350> you'll<00:01:50.680> find<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.160> mention<00:01:51.580> of<00:01:51.759> both

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
Genesis you'll find the mention of both

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.180 
Genesis you'll find the mention of both
shabam<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.860> Teddy<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.550> how<00:01:54.789> did<00:01:54.940> our<00:01:55.030> moment

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
shabam and Teddy and how did our moment

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.750 
shabam and Teddy and how did our moment
in<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.369> Torah

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.300 

now<00:02:01.360> how<00:02:01.570> they're<00:02:01.870> made<00:02:02.110> is<00:02:02.590> extremely

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
now how they're made is extremely

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.430 
now how they're made is extremely
complex<00:02:03.820> with<00:02:04.180> his<00:02:04.360> Yemen's<00:02:04.780> one<00:02:05.020> who<00:02:05.200> most

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
complex with his Yemen's one who most

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.490 
complex with his Yemen's one who most
sophisticated<00:02:06.960> civilizations<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:08.260> has

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
sophisticated civilizations that has

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.540 
sophisticated civilizations that has

buildings<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.240> like<00:02:13.930> texture<00:02:14.560> with

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
buildings and it's like texture with

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.270 
buildings and it's like texture with
these<00:02:15.370> materials<00:02:16.470> when<00:02:17.470> you've<00:02:17.680> got<00:02:17.860> seven

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
these materials when you've got seven

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.400 
these materials when you've got seven
and<00:02:18.400> eight<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.610> nine<00:02:18.880> floors<00:02:19.390> constructed<00:02:20.290> in

and eight and nine floors constructed in

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.280 
and eight and nine floors constructed in
sun-dried<00:02:20.890> mud<00:02:20.920> brick<00:02:21.220> it's<00:02:22.210> already<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.840> huge

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
sun-dried mud brick it's already a huge

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.820 
sun-dried mud brick it's already a huge
feat<00:02:23.800> both<00:02:24.250> engineering<00:02:25.000> Lee<00:02:25.450> and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
feat both engineering Lee and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.740 
feat both engineering Lee and
construction<00:02:26.830> wise<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.490> when<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.210> comes<00:02:28.420> to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
construction wise and when it comes to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:03:00.040 
construction wise and when it comes to
design<00:02:29.170> its<00:02:29.500> superior

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.140 

so<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.110> know<00:03:01.470> whether<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.160> sell<00:03:02.400> palaces

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
so you know whether you can sell palaces

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.900 
so you know whether you can sell palaces

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
building as a saleable example one just

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.000 
building as a saleable example one just
needs<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.560> look<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:15.170> know<00:03:16.170> why<00:03:16.620> and
