00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
trying to break this thing down because

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.770 
trying to break this thing down because
it<00:00:29.140> is<00:00:29.289> too<00:00:29.759> small<00:00:30.759> of<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:31.179> sample<00:00:31.449> and<00:00:33.150> I<00:00:34.150> really

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
it is too small of a sample and I really

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.479 
it is too small of a sample and I really
just<00:00:34.810> I<00:00:35.230> don't<00:00:35.560> really<00:00:35.950> think<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.280> this<00:00:36.430> is

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
just I don't really think that this is

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.619 
just I don't really think that this is
madden<00:00:37.300> 25<00:00:37.660> I<00:00:37.989> think<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.380> is<00:00:38.410> madden<00:00:38.890> 13<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
madden 25 I think it is madden 13 it

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.020 
madden 25 I think it is madden 13 it
might<00:00:40.840> be<00:00:40.960> madden<00:00:41.289> 25<00:00:41.590> pre-alpha<00:00:42.489> but

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
might be madden 25 pre-alpha but

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.939 
might be madden 25 pre-alpha but
basically<00:00:43.840> what<00:00:44.079> it<00:00:44.109> looks<00:00:44.350> like<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.559> me<00:00:44.710> is

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
basically what it looks like to me is

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.110 
basically what it looks like to me is
mad<00:00:45.219> 13<00:00:45.850> with<00:00:46.090> some<00:00:46.239> new<00:00:47.170> animations<00:00:47.800> or

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
mad 13 with some new animations or

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.189 
mad 13 with some new animations or
adjustments<00:00:49.120> that<00:00:49.239> they<00:00:49.359> made<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.840> show<00:00:50.050> this

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
adjustments that they made to show this

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.330 
adjustments that they made to show this
off<00:00:50.440> for<00:00:50.769> a<00:00:50.829> sizzle<00:00:51.280> trailer<00:00:51.430> and<00:00:53.129> hey<00:00:54.129> you

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
can't really read too much into this

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.889 
can't really read too much into this
because<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.730> looks<00:00:57.910> like<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.210> same<00:00:58.390> game<00:00:58.690> at

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
because it looks like the same game at

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
discussion one here because to me this

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.459 
discussion one here because to me this
game<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.790> not<00:01:40.210> going<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.479> change<00:01:40.540> at<00:01:41.020> its<00:01:41.200> core

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
game is not going to change at its core

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.649 
game is not going to change at its core
until<00:01:42.280> next<00:01:42.579> gen<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.119> I<00:01:43.180> don't<00:01:43.299> know<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.390> lot<00:01:43.600> of

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
until next gen and I don't know a lot of

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.080 
until next gen and I don't know a lot of
people<00:01:43.780> probably<00:01:44.049> are<00:01:44.860> upset<00:01:45.460> with<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.820> but

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
people probably are upset with that but

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.480 
people probably are upset with that but
like<00:01:46.960> seven<00:01:47.320> football<00:01:47.500> critic<00:01:48.009> said<00:01:48.219> in<00:01:48.399> his

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
like seven football critic said in his

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.270 
like seven football critic said in his
video<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:48.969> think<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.780> as<00:01:49.960> far<00:01:50.289> as<00:01:50.590> they

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
video I think that this as far as they

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.209 
video I think that this as far as they
could<00:01:51.340> go<00:01:51.719> with<00:01:52.719> the<00:01:52.810> current<00:01:53.020> systems<00:01:53.590> now

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
could go with the current systems now

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.580 
could go with the current systems now
it'll<00:01:54.610> be<00:01:54.789> up<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:54.969> e8<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.570> deliver<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.200> not<00:01:56.350> lay

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
it'll be up to e8 to deliver and not lay

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.679 
it'll be up to e8 to deliver and not lay
a<00:01:56.619> good<00:01:56.950> like<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.399> heel<00:01:57.610> with<00:01:57.789> madden<00:01:58.149> 06<00:01:58.570> I

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
a good like the heel with madden 06 I

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.389 
a good like the heel with madden 06 I
think<00:01:58.899> we<00:01:59.020> all<00:01:59.049> remember<00:01:59.649> that<00:01:59.799> if<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.130> don't

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
think we all remember that if you don't

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.109 
think we all remember that if you don't
go<00:02:01.000> back<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.390> look<00:02:01.479> up<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.810> mad<00:02:01.990> no<00:02:02.229> 6<00:02:02.590> trailer

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.260 
like or let's just say what they sold us
that<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.070> game<00:02:09.250> was<00:02:09.399> supposed<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.910> look<00:02:10.090> and

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
that the game was supposed to look and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.500 
that the game was supposed to look and
play<00:02:10.420> like

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
play like

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.839 
play like
when<00:02:12.379> that<00:02:12.530> no<00:02:12.769> six<00:02:13.040> dropped<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.489> was<00:02:13.610> bare

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
when that no six dropped it was bare

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.080 
when that no six dropped it was bare
bone<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.569> hopefully<00:02:15.140> we<00:02:15.349> don't<00:02:15.560> get<00:02:15.829> that<00:02:16.090> and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
bone so hopefully we don't get that and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.089 
bone so hopefully we don't get that and
I<00:02:17.209> think<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.599> might<00:02:17.840> get<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.379> Madden's<00:02:18.920> this

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
I think you might get to Madden's this

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.830 
I think you might get to Madden's this
year<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.489> might<00:02:19.670> get<00:02:19.939> since<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.329> new

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
consoles are coming out you might get

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.970 
consoles are coming out you might get

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
is just make improvements on what ian

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.210 
is just make improvements on what ian
cummings<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.599> team<00:02:53.599> development<00:02:54.230> team<00:02:54.560> tried

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
cummings and team development team tried

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.000 
cummings and team development team tried
to<00:02:55.489> do<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.000> obviously<00:02:56.900> they<00:02:57.530> reached<00:02:57.859> their

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
to do and obviously they reached their

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.080 
to do and obviously they reached their
limit<00:02:58.370> because<00:02:58.730> i<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:01.459> don't<00:03:01.819> think<00:03:01.849> they

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
limit because i just don't think they

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.819 
limit because i just don't think they
could<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.359> it<00:03:02.389> i<00:03:02.599> think<00:03:02.840> they<00:03:02.959> tried<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.290> fix<00:03:03.650> it

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
could do it i think they tried to fix it

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.640 
could do it i think they tried to fix it
and<00:03:04.329> they<00:03:05.329> couldn't<00:03:05.569> fix<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:05.989> all<00:03:06.109> the<00:03:06.290> way<00:03:06.440> man

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
and they couldn't fix it all the way man

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.920 
and they couldn't fix it all the way man
so<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.129> has<00:03:07.159> some<00:03:07.670> we<00:03:07.970> all<00:03:08.120> know<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:08.540> legacy

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
so it has some we all know the legacy

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.229 
so it has some we all know the legacy
