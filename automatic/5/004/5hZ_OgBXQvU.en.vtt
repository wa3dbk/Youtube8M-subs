our this ice is racing into the ocean

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.900 
our this ice is racing into the ocean
faster<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.379> faster<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.430> need<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> know

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
faster and faster and we need to know

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.450 
faster and faster and we need to know
why<00:00:42.860> we<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:45.950> two<00:00:46.950> months<00:00:47.129> ago<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
why we have to go there two months ago I

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.170 
why we have to go there two months ago I
was<00:00:47.760> able<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> stand<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> ice<00:00:49.559> shelf<00:00:50.180> there

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
was able to stand on the ice shelf there

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.119 
was able to stand on the ice shelf there
was<00:00:51.360> debate<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.840> our<00:00:51.989> community<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.860> can't

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
was debate in our community you can't

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.799 
was debate in our community you can't
even<00:00:53.370> land<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> ice<00:00:54.149> shelf<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.600> too

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
even land on the ice shelf it's too

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.900 
even land on the ice shelf it's too
heavily<00:00:55.170> crevasse<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.399> again<00:00:56.520> with

heavily crevasse but again with
satellite<00:00:57.420> imagery<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.170> were<00:00:58.260> able<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
satellite imagery we were able to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.889 
satellite imagery we were able to
identify<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.280> spot<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.449> thought<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.870> could

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
identify a spot that we thought we could

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.369 
identify a spot that we thought we could
land<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:02.129> did<00:01:02.570> we're<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> sweet<00:01:04.199> spot

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
land and we did we're in the sweet spot

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.620 
land and we did we're in the sweet spot
on<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.830> ice<00:01:04.979> shelf<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> only<00:01:06.119> place<00:01:06.390> you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
on the ice shelf but the only place you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.750 
on the ice shelf but the only place you
can<00:01:06.750> leave<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> good<00:01:08.220> news<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> bad

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
can leave that was the good news the bad

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.179 
can leave that was the good news the bad
news<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> surface<00:01:10.020> was<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.710> hard<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
news was the surface was so hard that

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.030 
news was the surface was so hard that
the<00:01:11.640> airplane<00:01:12.170> airplane<00:01:13.170> pilots<00:01:13.710> were<00:01:13.890> not

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the airplane airplane pilots were not

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.740 
the airplane airplane pilots were not
willing<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.430> land<00:01:14.820> again<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> game<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
willing to land again on the game and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.469 
willing to land again on the game and
again<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.710> heavy<00:01:16.950> cargo<00:01:17.430> loads<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.360> we

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
again was with heavy cargo loads so we

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.410 
again was with heavy cargo loads so we
couldn't<00:01:18.750> put<00:01:18.930> our<00:01:19.049> camp<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.920> ice<00:01:20.100> shelf

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.910 

because<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.780> couldn't<00:01:25.049> land<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> ice

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
because we couldn't land on the ice

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
because we couldn't land on the ice
shelf<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.610> were<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.360> still

shelf what we were going to do we still

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.149 
shelf what we were going to do we still
have<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.990> instruments<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.619> set<00:01:28.950> these

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
have some instruments we set these

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.310 
have some instruments we set these
instruments<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.150> close<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> ice<00:01:30.990> shelf

instruments up as close to the ice shelf

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
instruments up as close to the ice shelf
as<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.740> could<00:01:32.009> an<00:01:32.460> automatic<00:01:32.909> weather<00:01:33.270> station

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
as we could an automatic weather station

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.020 
as we could an automatic weather station
fairly<00:01:34.650> complex<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.430> took<00:01:35.579> us<00:01:35.729> about<00:01:35.880> three

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
fairly complex it took us about three

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.569 
fairly complex it took us about three
days<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> set<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.280> there

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
days to set it all up but it's there

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.370 
days to set it all up but it's there
it's<00:01:38.820> working<00:01:39.299> that's<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> operate<00:01:40.200> we

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's working that's going to operate we

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
it's working that's going to operate we

cold Antarctic winter helping us to
prepare<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.170> next<00:01:46.350> time<00:01:46.680> we're<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.220> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
prepare for the next time we're going to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.480 
prepare for the next time we're going to
go<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.820> ice<00:01:47.970> shelf<00:01:48.409> we<00:01:49.409> also<00:01:49.649> set<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.189> some

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
go to the ice shelf we also set up some

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.420 
go to the ice shelf we also set up some
to<00:01:50.880> GPS<00:01:51.479> receivers<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.590> tell<00:01:52.799> us<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.100> fast

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
to GPS receivers that tell us how fast

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.310 
to GPS receivers that tell us how fast
the<00:01:53.670> ice<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.990> there<00:01:55.200> any

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the ice is going and if there any

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.120 
the ice is going and if there any
changes<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.340> also<00:01:56.930> bones<00:01:57.930> its<00:01:58.229> data<00:01:58.500> back<00:01:58.799> by

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
changes that also bones its data back by

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.940 
changes that also bones its data back by
satellite<00:02:00.119> phone<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.229> receive<00:02:01.680> these
