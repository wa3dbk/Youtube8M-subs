I calyx here this is the three of the
started<00:00:08.710> glass<00:00:08.860> replacement<00:00:09.219> I<00:00:09.460> made<00:00:09.610> some

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
started glass replacement I made some

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.859 
started glass replacement I made some
progress<00:00:09.940> I<00:00:10.270> pull<00:00:10.570> out<00:00:10.690> the<00:00:10.900> rotor<00:00:12.270> I<00:00:13.270> have<00:00:13.750> it

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:13.869 
progress I pull out the rotor I have it

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.470 
progress I pull out the rotor I have it
out<00:00:13.990> and<00:00:14.410> I<00:00:14.980> have<00:00:15.520> all<00:00:15.670> the<00:00:15.789> marks<00:00:16.059> lined<00:00:16.270> up

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
out and I have all the marks lined up

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.109 
out and I have all the marks lined up
and<00:00:16.740> today<00:00:17.740> we're<00:00:18.070> gonna<00:00:18.250> disassemble<00:00:18.699> the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
and today we're gonna disassemble the

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.999 
and today we're gonna disassemble the
whole<00:00:19.150> think<00:00:19.570> and<00:00:19.810> see<00:00:20.020> what<00:00:20.289> happened<00:00:20.830> with

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
whole think and see what happened with

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.249 
whole think and see what happened with
the<00:00:21.070> starter<00:00:21.460> clutch<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:22.660> it's<00:00:22.869> written<00:00:23.080> in

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
the starter clutch as it's written in

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.019 
the starter clutch as it's written in
the<00:00:23.320> manual<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:24.039> way<00:00:24.189> how<00:00:24.519> to<00:00:24.550> check<00:00:24.880> the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
the manual the way how to check the

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.609 
the manual the way how to check the
operation<00:00:25.359> of<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.630> starter<00:00:25.929> clutch<00:00:26.080> is<00:00:26.410> to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
operation of the starter clutch is to

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.710 
operation of the starter clutch is to
put<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:27.099> rotor<00:00:27.310> on<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:27.519> bench<00:00:27.789> hold<00:00:28.330> it<00:00:28.509> and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
put the rotor on the bench hold it and

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.569 
put the rotor on the bench hold it and
try<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.169> rotate<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.710> clockwise<00:00:30.099> and<00:00:30.369> then<00:00:30.460> it

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
try to rotate the clockwise and then it

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.600 
try to rotate the clockwise and then it
should<00:00:30.730> move<00:00:30.880> freely<00:00:31.119> and<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.980> is<00:00:33.130> not<00:00:33.430> the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
should move freely and this is not the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.779 
should move freely and this is not the
case<00:00:33.790> in<00:00:34.210> my<00:00:34.510> case<00:00:35.190> nor<00:00:36.190> doesn't<00:00:36.579> move<00:00:36.670> the

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
case in my case nor doesn't move the

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.010 
case in my case nor doesn't move the
other<00:00:36.910> direction<00:00:37.300> so<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:39.160> completely<00:00:39.370> stuck

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
other direction so it's completely stuck

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.810 
other direction so it's completely stuck
here<00:00:41.020> we're<00:00:41.170> going<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.469> follow<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.980> climbers

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
here we're going to follow the climbers

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.790 
here we're going to follow the climbers
manual<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.660> first<00:00:43.870> thing<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.260> do<00:00:44.410> is<00:00:44.620> to

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
manual and the first thing to do is to

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.330 
manual and the first thing to do is to
remove<00:00:45.100> this<00:00:45.309> snap<00:00:45.579> ring<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.010> special

pliers I get really cheap once there are
better<00:00:51.039> ones<00:00:51.250> but<00:00:51.460> hopefully<00:00:52.300> they<00:00:52.420> will<00:00:52.570> do

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
better ones but hopefully they will do

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:03.430 
better ones but hopefully they will do
the<00:00:52.809> work

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
now it's required to remove the gear

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.370 
now it's required to remove the gear
which<00:02:01.479> doesn't<00:02:02.020> move<00:02:02.170> either<00:02:02.920> direction

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.800 

twisting<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.830> use<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> screwdriver<00:02:13.290> once

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810

twisting if I use a screwdriver once
here<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:16.840> there<00:02:17.940> there's<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.030> chance

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
here and there there's a chance

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:32.250 
here and there there's a chance
remove<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.880> yep<00:02:24.880> goes<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:31.239> not<00:02:31.450> stretch

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
remove the yep goes just not stretch

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.630 
remove the yep goes just not stretch
they<00:02:32.500> don't<00:02:32.680> think<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.610> piece<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.570> cardboard

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
they don't think the piece of cardboard

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.760 
they don't think the piece of cardboard
underneath<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.880> video

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:52.800 

so<00:02:41.770> went<00:02:50.610> what<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.700> think<00:02:52.030> after<00:02:52.330> removing<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
so went what I think after removing the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.420 
so went what I think after removing the
gear<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.290> thing<00:02:53.550> moves<00:02:54.550> fall<00:02:55.030> asleep

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
gear the thing moves fall asleep

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.210 
gear the thing moves fall asleep
clockwise<00:02:57.430> doesn't<00:02:58.420> move<00:02:59.220> counterclockwise

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
clockwise doesn't move counterclockwise

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.479 
clockwise doesn't move counterclockwise
so<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.270> don't<00:03:01.810> even<00:03:01.989> know<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:04.230> got<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
so I don't even know but I got the

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.640 
so I don't even know but I got the
static<00:03:06.489> watchkit<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:07.450> I'm<00:03:07.660> gonna<00:03:07.870> replace<00:03:08.530> it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
static watchkit so I'm gonna replace it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.780 
static watchkit so I'm gonna replace it
either<00:03:09.010> way<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.580> we'll<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.000> keep<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.600> as<00:03:10.840> a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
either way and we'll just keep this as a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.280 
either way and we'll just keep this as a
replacement<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.239> case<00:03:13.480> something<00:03:13.900> happens<00:03:14.200> to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
replacement in case something happens to

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.199 
replacement in case something happens to
the<00:03:14.410> future<00:03:16.200> when<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.230> turn<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.620> wheel<00:03:18.209> there's

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
the future when I turn the wheel there's

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.540 
the future when I turn the wheel there's
this<00:03:19.620> sounds<00:03:20.620> like<00:03:20.800> it's<00:03:22.140> scraping<00:03:23.140> up

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
this sounds like it's scraping up

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.809 
this sounds like it's scraping up
something<00:03:27.690> wonder<00:03:28.690> if<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.050> will<00:03:29.819> disappear

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
something wonder if that will disappear

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.710 
something wonder if that will disappear
when<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.030> put<00:03:31.300> in<00:03:31.450> your<00:03:31.600> parts<00:03:33.180> before<00:03:34.180> remove

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
when I put in your parts before remove

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.330 
when I put in your parts before remove
anything<00:03:35.200> can<00:03:35.350> move<00:03:35.470> involves<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.100> need<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
anything can move involves I need to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.460 
anything can move involves I need to
check<00:03:36.550> whether<00:03:36.819> I<00:03:36.910> have<00:03:37.209> everything<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:38.350> place

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
check whether I have everything in place

here again under static latch itself

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.539 
here again under static latch itself
with<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.410> place<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.860> list<00:03:57.130> of<00:03:57.340> all<00:03:57.519> the

with a place so the list of all the

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.930 
with a place so the list of all the
parts<00:03:57.850> here<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:58.810> have<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.500> ceiling<00:04:00.160> for<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.760> ship

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
parts here I have a ceiling for the ship

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.180 
parts here I have a ceiling for the ship
shaft<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.290> bearing<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.709> Sun<00:04:02.980> from

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190

this side and the other side of the
idler<00:04:05.320> gear<00:04:05.350> so<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:05.950> think<00:04:06.220> we're<00:04:06.489> good<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.670> go

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
idler gear so I think we're good to go

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.330 
idler gear so I think we're good to go
and<00:04:06.940> we're<00:04:07.090> gonna<00:04:07.269> be<00:04:07.450> removing<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:09.190> whole

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
and we're gonna be removing the whole

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.250 
and we're gonna be removing the whole
assembly<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.450> replacing<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:10.989> with<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.170> new

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
assembly and replacing it with the new

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:36.320 
assembly and replacing it with the new
parts

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.110 

there<00:04:37.259> is<00:04:37.379> a<00:04:37.409> through<00:04:37.680> hole<00:04:37.710> which<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.520> bit

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
there is a through hole which is bit

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.300 
there is a through hole which is bit
smaller<00:04:39.479> in<00:04:39.629> diameter<00:04:39.840> than<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.379> rest<00:04:41.069> of<00:04:41.189> the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
smaller in diameter than the rest of the

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.029 
smaller in diameter than the rest of the
holes<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.759> are<00:04:41.939> meant<00:04:42.210> for<00:04:42.270> bolts<00:04:43.199> so<00:04:44.009> I

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
holes that are meant for bolts so I

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.279 
holes that are meant for bolts so I
presume<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:45.349> for<00:04:46.939> not<00:04:47.939> be<00:04:48.449> able<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.990> put

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
presume this is for not be able to put

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.850 
presume this is for not be able to put
the<00:04:49.610> static<00:04:50.610> clashes<00:04:50.939> something<00:04:51.270> differently

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
the static clashes something differently

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.020 
the static clashes something differently
so<00:04:52.860> this<00:04:53.039> way<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:54.150> can<00:04:54.300> see<00:04:54.889> arrow<00:04:56.030> the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
so this way and you can see arrow the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.529 
so this way and you can see arrow the
rotation<00:04:57.509> direction<00:04:57.539> I<00:04:58.310> believe<00:04:59.330> that<00:05:00.330> is

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
rotation direction I believe that is

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.309 
rotation direction I believe that is
opposite<00:05:01.409> that<00:05:01.680> hole<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:02.960> when<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:03.990> will

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
opposite that hole so when I will

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.149 
opposite that hole so when I will
assemble<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:05.009> think<00:05:05.580> back<00:05:05.879> again<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:07.159> will

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
assemble the think back again I will

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.390 
assemble the think back again I will
align<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:09.060> hole<00:05:09.210> here<00:05:09.569> I<00:05:09.780> can<00:05:10.710> see<00:05:10.979> my<00:05:11.009> mark

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
align the hole here I can see my mark

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.180 
align the hole here I can see my mark
here<00:05:11.729> which<00:05:11.969> is<00:05:12.150> on<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.419> one<00:05:13.229> two<00:05:13.680> between<00:05:14.069> the

here which is on the one two between the
first<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.789> second<00:05:15.330> bolt<00:05:15.780> hole<00:05:16.080> on<00:05:16.229> the

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
first and the second bolt hole on the

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:24.129 
first and the second bolt hole on the
right<00:05:16.560> from<00:05:17.039> the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
with a bit of 3d 40 applied to a bolt so

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.460 
with a bit of 3d 40 applied to a bolt so
this<00:06:21.580> is<00:06:21.760> just<00:06:22.000> a<00:06:22.150> normal<00:06:22.300> Empire<00:06:22.930> bolt<00:06:23.200> with

this is just a normal Empire bolt with

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.960 
this is just a normal Empire bolt with
the<00:06:24.210> rule<00:06:25.210> here<00:06:25.950> so<00:06:26.950> when<00:06:27.100> you<00:06:27.220> screw<00:06:27.760> it<00:06:27.880> in

the rule here so when you screw it in

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.890 
the rule here so when you screw it in
and<00:06:28.150> turn<00:06:28.690> it<00:06:29.040> then<00:06:30.040> all<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.460> dirt<00:06:30.670> falls<00:06:31.630> into

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
and turn it then all the dirt falls into

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.730 
and turn it then all the dirt falls into
here<00:06:32.320> and<00:06:33.300> still<00:06:34.300> allows<00:06:34.600> bolt<00:06:34.930> to<00:06:35.140> turn<00:06:35.380> and

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
here and still allows bolt to turn and

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.370 
here and still allows bolt to turn and
