then now you're nineteen sixty in a
hospice<00:01:26.039> in<00:01:26.599> Poland<00:01:27.599> you<00:01:28.200> break<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.649> of<00:01:28.679> there

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
hospice in Poland you break out of there

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
hospice in Poland you break out of there
and<00:01:29.280> now<00:01:29.459> you<00:01:29.520> realize<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.599> Nazis<00:01:30.929> have<00:01:31.050> won

and now you realize the Nazis have won

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
and now you realize the Nazis have won
the<00:01:31.380> war<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:31.800> wanted<00:01:32.099> a<00:01:32.190> long<00:01:32.399> time<00:01:32.789> ago<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the war they wanted a long time ago and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
the war they wanted a long time ago and
that<00:01:34.289> technology<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.039> was<00:01:35.160> so<00:01:35.310> novel<00:01:35.580> in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that technology that was so novel in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.949 
that technology that was so novel in
1946<00:01:36.509> has<00:01:36.750> gotten<00:01:37.050> only<00:01:37.679> more<00:01:38.039> sophisticated

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
1946 has gotten only more sophisticated

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.169 
1946 has gotten only more sophisticated
it's<00:01:39.959> an<00:01:40.140> interesting<00:01:40.619> premise<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
it's an interesting premise but the

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.969 
it's an interesting premise but the
presentation<00:01:42.959> is<00:01:43.080> what<00:01:43.229> probably<00:01:43.679> makes<00:01:43.890> this

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
presentation is what probably makes this

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.559 
presentation is what probably makes this
game<00:01:44.190> more<00:01:44.310> interesting<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:45.030> using<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> tech

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
game more interesting it's using it tech

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.749 
game more interesting it's using it tech
five<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.170> they<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.069> trying<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.580> a

Wolfenstein 3d this is something they're
trying<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.989> draw<00:01:55.229> more<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.649> character<00:01:55.860> out

trying to draw more of a character out
of<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.789> mean<00:01:56.910> it's<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> very<00:01:57.119> pulpy<00:01:57.840> story<00:01:58.200> but

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
of it I mean it's a very pulpy story but

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.710 
of it I mean it's a very pulpy story but
there's<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.039> sense<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.819> serious<00:02:00.149> drama

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
there's a sense of very serious drama

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.139 
there's a sense of very serious drama
that's<00:02:01.020> underpinning<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.590> entire<00:02:01.679> affair<00:02:02.399> in

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that's underpinning the entire affair in

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.419 
that's underpinning the entire affair in
terms<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.569> gameplay<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.739> shooter<00:02:05.069> but<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
terms of gameplay it's a shooter but the

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.589 
terms of gameplay it's a shooter but the
shooter<00:02:05.789> I<00:02:05.819> think<00:02:06.119> they're<00:02:06.209> trying<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.420> give<00:02:06.569> a

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
shooter I think they're trying to give a

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.180 
shooter I think they're trying to give a
lot<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.959> adventure<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.679> I<00:02:07.800> said<00:02:07.860> when

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
frames a second it was just that sense

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.380

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
on getting a bead it really is that kind

really<00:02:54.280> satisfying<00:02:54.819> their<00:02:55.689> guns<00:02:56.049> but<00:02:56.470> they<00:02:56.560> do

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
really satisfying their guns but they do

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.589 
really satisfying their guns but they do
kind<00:02:56.799> of<00:02:56.920> short<00:02:57.159> burst<00:02:57.430> fire<00:02:57.700> there's<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.329> real

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
kind of short burst fire there's a real

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.210 
kind of short burst fire there's a real
sense<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.079> heft<00:02:59.379> and<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.739> really<00:03:00.040> kind<00:03:00.189> of

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
sense of heft and I really kind of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.190 
sense of heft and I really kind of
enjoyed<00:03:00.519> swapping<00:03:01.060> them<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.569> getting<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.900> try

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
enjoyed swapping them and getting to try

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.170 
enjoyed swapping them and getting to try
out<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.560> different<00:03:02.889> ones<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.370> then<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:04.030> know

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
out the different ones and then you know

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.270 
out the different ones and then you know
hopefully<00:03:04.659> picking<00:03:05.500> up<00:03:05.620> something<00:03:05.829> new<00:03:06.099> they

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
hopefully picking up something new they

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.610 
hopefully picking up something new they
just<00:03:06.489> had<00:03:06.639> that<00:03:06.790> boom<00:03:07.450> behind<00:03:08.109> it<00:03:08.230> now<00:03:08.530> the

shooter you tend to find some open areas
that<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.319> different<00:03:14.470> paths<00:03:14.889> that<00:03:15.189> you<00:03:15.340> can

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
that have different paths that you can

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.220 
that have different paths that you can

available in this game but the problem I
noticed<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.359> many<00:03:22.569> instances<00:03:23.109> is<00:03:23.560> once<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.519> had

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
noticed in many instances is once I had

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.949 
noticed in many instances is once I had
killed<00:03:24.879> everybody<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.419> didn't<00:03:25.720> know<00:03:25.780> how<00:03:25.900> to

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.719 
that your differing and you're lost and
confused<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.870> say<00:03:32.019> hey<00:03:32.409> go<00:03:32.919> over<00:03:33.159> here<00:03:33.370> let's

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:33.729 
confused and say hey go over here let's

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.980 
confused and say hey go over here let's
try<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.090> advance<00:03:34.419> the<00:03:34.690> game

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.320 

on<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.740> whole<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.010> game<00:03:38.640> performed<00:03:39.180> well

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
on the whole the game performed well

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.730 
on the whole the game performed well
it's<00:03:39.540> still<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.900> beta<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.440> there<00:03:40.620> would<00:03:40.710> be

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
it's still in beta and so there would be

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.290 
it's still in beta and so there would be
hiccups<00:03:41.190> here<00:03:41.460> and<00:03:41.520> there<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:42.030> one<00:03:42.270> of

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
hiccups here and there I think one of

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.910 
hiccups here and there I think one of
the<00:03:42.390> key<00:03:42.600> things<00:03:42.630> i<00:03:43.020> hope<00:03:43.170> happens<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.860> that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
the key things i hope happens is that

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.370 
the key things i hope happens is that
the<00:03:44.640> transitions<00:03:45.300> from<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.630> gameplay<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
the transitions from the gameplay to the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.710 
the transitions from the gameplay to the
cutscene<00:03:46.860> aren't<00:03:47.520> is<00:03:47.640> jarring<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.300> they<00:03:48.450> came

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
cutscene aren't is jarring as they came

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.560 
cutscene aren't is jarring as they came
across<00:03:48.870> I'm<00:03:49.500> for<00:03:49.740> all<00:03:50.070> reason<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.030> cutscenes

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
across I'm for all reason the cutscenes

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.530 
across I'm for all reason the cutscenes
themselves<00:03:52.110> are<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.830> letterbox<00:03:53.460> and<00:03:53.850> going

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
themselves are in letterbox and going

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.850 
themselves are in letterbox and going
from<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.780> full<00:03:54.930> screen<00:03:55.170> obviously<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> first

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
from the full screen obviously a first

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.320 
from the full screen obviously a first
person<00:03:55.980> gameplay<00:03:56.310> into<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.970> was<00:03:57.150> something

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
person gameplay into that was something

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.060 
person gameplay into that was something
that<00:03:57.450> my<00:03:57.960> eyes<00:03:58.140> just<00:03:58.170> never<00:03:58.770> really

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
that my eyes just never really

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.070 
that my eyes just never really
accustomed<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.820> I<00:03:59.880> had<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.150> kinda<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.840> the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
accustomed to and I had to kinda be the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.780 
accustomed to and I had to kinda be the
sense<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.410> shock<00:04:01.680> every<00:04:01.980> time<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.340> happened

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
sense of shock every time that happened

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.550 
sense of shock every time that happened
but<00:04:03.300> at<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.540> end<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.900> day<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.290> wasn't

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
but at the end of the day it wasn't

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.470 
but at the end of the day it wasn't
enough<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.040> know<00:04:05.550> what<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.880> game<00:04:06.090> can<00:04:06.270> really

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
enough to know what this game can really

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.120 
enough to know what this game can really
sustain<00:04:06.900> itself<00:04:07.230> what<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.500> assume<00:04:07.860> would<00:04:07.950> be<00:04:08.100> a

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
sustain itself what I assume would be a

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.490 
sustain itself what I assume would be a
10<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.520> 12-hour<00:04:08.910> experience<00:04:09.660> but<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.170> was<00:04:10.260> nice

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
10 to 12-hour experience but it was nice

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.950 
10 to 12-hour experience but it was nice
to<00:04:10.770> get<00:04:11.040> back<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.730> kind<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.180> play<00:04:12.360> just<00:04:12.780> a

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
to get back and kind of play just a

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.470 
to get back and kind of play just a
shooter<00:04:13.440> uh<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.520> know<00:04:14.580> probably<00:04:15.030> not<00:04:15.240> since

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
shooter uh you know probably not since

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.990 
shooter uh you know probably not since
crysis<00:04:16.260> 3<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.830> last<00:04:17.130> year<00:04:17.430> have<00:04:17.610> I<00:04:17.730> played<00:04:17.970> a

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
crysis 3 of last year have I played a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.180 
crysis 3 of last year have I played a
game<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:18.930> was<00:04:19.110> my<00:04:19.500> favorite<00:04:19.830> day

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
game like that that was my favorite day

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.700 
game like that that was my favorite day
but<00:04:20.400> 2013<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.090> be<00:04:21.209> honest<00:04:21.540> but<00:04:22.049> yeah<00:04:22.470> there

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
but 2013 to be honest but yeah there

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.560 
but 2013 to be honest but yeah there
there<00:04:22.890> is<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.070> think<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.550> place<00:04:23.850> for<00:04:24.540> a

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
there is I think a place for a

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.900 
there is I think a place for a
story-driven<00:04:25.430> first-person<00:04:26.430> shooter<00:04:26.760> and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
story-driven first-person shooter and

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.120 
story-driven first-person shooter and
wolfenstein<00:04:27.390> right<00:04:27.690> now<00:04:27.900> looks<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.410> be<00:04:28.860> the

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
wolfenstein right now looks to be the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.190 
wolfenstein right now looks to be the
one<00:04:29.310> coming<00:04:29.670> up<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.940> soonest<00:04:30.390> that<00:04:30.870> can<00:04:31.020> fit

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
one coming up the soonest that can fit

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.380 
one coming up the soonest that can fit
the<00:04:31.320> bill<00:04:31.500> there's<00:04:32.040> just<00:04:32.340> one<00:04:32.670> thing<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:33.240> I

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
the bill there's just one thing that I

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.030 
the bill there's just one thing that I
cannot<00:04:33.900> get<00:04:34.110> out<00:04:34.230> of<00:04:34.350> my<00:04:34.440> head<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.890> is

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
cannot get out of my head and this is

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.070 
cannot get out of my head and this is
more<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.340> personal<00:04:35.730> issue<00:04:35.910> obviously<00:04:36.570> takes

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
more of a personal issue obviously takes

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.810 
more of a personal issue obviously takes
place<00:04:37.320> in<00:04:37.500> kind<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.770> cartoonish<00:04:38.310> alternate

reality of World War two but our

reality of World War two but our
elements<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.490> game<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:42.540> just<00:04:42.780> play<00:04:43.050> upon

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
elements of the game that just play upon

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.830 
elements of the game that just play upon
that<00:04:43.530> lurid<00:04:44.070> fascination<00:04:44.880> with<00:04:45.000> Nazi<00:04:45.390> doctors

that lurid fascination with Nazi doctors

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.570 
that lurid fascination with Nazi doctors
and<00:04:46.050> it's<00:04:46.170> something<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.500> for<00:04:47.190> time

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
and it's something that for time

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.550 
and it's something that for time
immemorial<00:04:47.790> has<00:04:48.630> always<00:04:48.900> made<00:04:49.110> me<00:04:49.230> feel<00:04:49.260> a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
little queasy obviously there were some

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.570 
little queasy obviously there were some
horrible<00:04:52.200> things<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.800> were<00:04:53.160> done<00:04:53.310> by<00:04:53.520> the

reality that I think many people need to
remember<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:06.120> we<00:05:06.210> never<00:05:06.360> go<00:05:06.540> down<00:05:06.720> such<00:05:06.960> a

horrific path of civilization ever again
it's<00:05:09.750> an<00:05:09.870> element<00:05:10.260> of<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.410> game<00:05:10.590> I<00:05:10.770> wish

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010

it's an element of the game I wish
wasn't<00:05:11.280> there<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:11.970> it<00:05:12.060> was<00:05:12.150> something<00:05:12.480> that

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
wasn't there and it was something that

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.540 
wasn't there and it was something that
when<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.990> did<00:05:13.230> emerge<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.190> actually

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
when it did emerge and it actually

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.490 
when it did emerge and it actually
resulted<00:05:15.420> in<00:05:15.540> something<00:05:15.750> is<00:05:15.900> fundamentally<00:05:16.110> a

resulted in something is fundamentally a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.160 
resulted in something is fundamentally a
Sophie's<00:05:16.950> Choice<00:05:17.310> it<00:05:18.270> really<00:05:18.540> kind<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.900> sucked

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
Sophie's Choice it really kind of sucked

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.830

the<00:05:19.290> fun<00:05:19.530> out<00:05:20.010> of<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.340> game<00:05:20.370> for<00:05:20.790> me<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:21.120> I'm

the fun out of the game for me I I'm

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.840 
the fun out of the game for me I I'm

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
hoping that the game just gets sillier

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.880 
hoping that the game just gets sillier
and<00:05:23.910> sillier<00:05:24.090> as<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:24.630> goes<00:05:24.780> on<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.530> don't

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
and sillier as it goes on and you don't

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.890 
and sillier as it goes on and you don't
have<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.310> kind<00:05:26.370> of<00:05:26.670> unpleasant<00:05:27.060> sense<00:05:27.690> that

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900
