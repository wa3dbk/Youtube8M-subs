00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
obviously yeah and I think that it's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.910 
obviously yeah and I think that it's
like<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:17.090> kind<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.990> feels<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.440> little

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
like it's kind of like it feels a little

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.810

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
it doesn't feel really gritty but I

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.210 
it doesn't feel really gritty but I
think<00:02:22.820> those<00:02:23.060> bursts<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.900> your<00:02:24.170> hair<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:25.010> give
