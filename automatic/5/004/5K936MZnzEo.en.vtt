00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 meat is good and healthy it is 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.640
 is definitely healthy too 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.480
 regular meat and she also healthy 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.620
 man needs it to survive 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.820
 our hunger is on meat 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.820
 insatiable meanwhile also in asia 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.020
 produced over 42 million tons 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.310
 europe every year 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.960
 Meat is so cheap that we even have it 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.960
 to export to africa 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.960
 The food for the animals comes from there 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 often from south america the globalized 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.010
 Diet has consequences 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.220
 because the hunger for meat changed 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.220
 the world 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.879
 the european market is saturated 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.530
 that means it's not very 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
 probably that we still in europe 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.090
 we will eat more meat 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.000
 already meat for breakfast as bacon 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.549
 and cold cuts, and we eat meat for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 lunch and dinner 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.320
 I do not believe that anyone 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.880
 eating meat cake for coffee 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.049
 dennis crown is already exporting in 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.000
 130 countries 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.490
 So there are not many markets left 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.979
 left only for the last year 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.990
 China is the fastest of the market 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.390
 What has been growing normally in europe for a long time 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.130
 is now also in asia for everyday life 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.319
 the daily consumption of meat in 1980 as 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.860
 Every year, every Chinese spends just under 14 kilo 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.259
 from that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.810
 now it's more than four times that way 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.119
 much the traditional Chinese cuisine 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.819
 loses more and more space to western 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 fastfood chains where vegetables used to be 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.950
 The focus was dominated today 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.909
 meat with the hamburger as icon of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.909
 new prosperity 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.240
 the people in the big cities have 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.250
 your eating habits are already strong 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.780
 changed the country dwellers of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.780
 billions of people will probably follow suit 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.980
 Also serve Chinese housewives 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.410
 their family nasty chop and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.410
 meanwhile roast daily 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.600
 Experts estimate that per capita 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.100
 consumption of the biggest folk festival until 2017 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.100
 will almost double again 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.440
 the increasing consumption of meat has in 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.530
 China also has social causes 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.300
 who has come to prosperity shows that 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.300
 like to eat too 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.840
 the entrepreneur visits as often as possible 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.209
 with wife mother and his wife 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.650
 two and a half years old son the dong 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:03.170
 live already restaurant in the center of Beijing 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.180
 of course meat is ordered 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.269
 specialty of the popular locality 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.849
 Mongolian vegetables are for the 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.140
 Family rather decoration than me 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.180
 was small was maybe something else 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.970
 special 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.290
 that's why, of course, that did not happen often 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.549
 meanwhile we can each other every day 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.500
 perform meat 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:29.510
 now it is a very normal thing, the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.209
 changed diet gets many 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.519
 Chinese are not always more people 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:39.680
 suffer from diseases that one used to 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:43.250
 Only in the west could coop note that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.230
 too much meat is not healthy 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.530
 but it does change that 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.530
 Nothing 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.970
 I eat meat 21 times a day so 21 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.579
 times in the week 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.329
 and sometimes I grab at night too 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.329
 in the refrigirator 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.859
 China's economy is in the last 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.930
 years have grown rapidly 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.139
 especially the city â€‹â€‹population has it 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.400
 benefits the new prosperity and the 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.469
 this changed lifestyle 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.959
 leave clear traces 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.250
 every third adult has chinese 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.430
 extreme overweight 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.620
 that's 60 million people one of the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.620
 Causes of too high meat consumption 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:34.840
 Chinese doctors have been pointing for years 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.240
 the alarming development is good 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:47.320
 Scope is one of the best known 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:50.410
 doctors of the country our researches 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.449
 alone show the hypertension 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.919
 Diseases of the people are on 200 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.919
 millions of cases have risen 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.009
 and we have in Chinese 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:08.659
 Population also an extremely elevated 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:11.029
 proportion of obese and diabetics in 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.369
 The next 20 years will be 21 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:20.059
 million people in china heart or 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:23.289
 get circulatory disease that is 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:23.289
 a very frightening number 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:30.919
 it corresponds to the entire population 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:32.899
 from smaller european countries and 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.399
 one of these many people will become one 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.389
 third to the corresponding 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:37.389
 illnesses died 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.019
 the health awareness of many 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:47.559
 Chinese has with the development of their 

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:49.819
 purchasing power not kept pace 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.800
 meanwhile you are in Chinese 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.459
 big cities eat almost as much meat 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.459
 like in europe
