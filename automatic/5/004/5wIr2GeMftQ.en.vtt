 orphans and the care of their grandparents 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.320

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.870
 authorities but that have now been 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.110
 completely forgotten my sister that 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.300
 I was 24 years old, my brother-in-law who was 26 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.980
 years left them three children in orphanage 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.630

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.440
 the mothers who stayed to work and 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.850
 get their children out of there that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.950
 rejects the decision of certain 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.719
 administrators of justice who left 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.220
 in freedom to the coyote to whom 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.990
 they directly accuse of death 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.480
 and his relatives and rest of his compatriots 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.410
 that his only dream was to reach the 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.240
 USA 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.370
 here in the equator there is no justice for 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.710
 do justice to these who carry and 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.350
 kill they do not mind wearing when I 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.750
 I said that because he killed my son said 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.270
 that day the bad luck that the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.760
 sharks have eaten them and told me 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.730
 the so cruel so they are now asking for a 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.930
 compensation for expenses and damages 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.910
 now we ask that you give us the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.330
 compensation and pay expenses and 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.369
 damages we had determined that by 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.500
 each person about twenty thousand dollars 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.000
 approximately the minimum 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.920
 We have filed seven accusations 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.170
 particular although we have already passed 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240
 seven years of the tragedy manifested 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.130
 that they will not faint in their fight so that 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.020
 the coyote returns to jail without 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.310
 import even the threats that have 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.310
 received from this one
