00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 or the leaves and compass and welcome to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.810
 another new clairvoyant as they saw it in the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.330
 chair title and remastered for 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.240
 Great Cars 5 PC Character 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.160
 downloadable ok way this was something that was 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 it made me extremely interesting about 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.539
 tell them since today I've been 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.270
 watching over the internet some things and the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.859
 user to the corner has created various 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.080
 things first of all I'm going to tell you 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.180
 how all this comes about and what is it all about 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.310
 you will know that some time ago a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.949
 user was representing how it would be 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 continues and in the current era with consoles 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.030
 of new generation and if you can 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.030
 remember with all this what we saw 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.730
 It was quite a few things but more than anything a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.739
 chair and remasterizado ok well good 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.230
 basically here you may be seeing the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.510
 first image and how can you see here 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.670
 we can appreciate a chair in the age 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.129
 modern not since we can see that I do not 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.410
 is the same young man who was around in the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.120
 great car game san andreas but 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.190
 which is totally remastered but 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 You can also see him over the years 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 and here as you can see we are seeing 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.640
 the second image and in the second image 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.900
 we can appreciate a chair that is 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.150
 with his old neighborhood but 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.180
 we can appreciate that you already have 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.990
 things but not how it can be more features 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.700
 because the chair of the xbox and playstation 2 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 they did not notice gestures as much as 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 now they can be perceived in consoles of 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.800
 new generation is obviously because 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 the consoles of that time were not 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.520
 as advanced as we have in the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.490
 present and here as you can see 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.560
 we are looking up and jay but what 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.120
 we can be appreciating very well of 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.670
 front you will not say that these are 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.620
 simple images but they are truly 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.650
 planes made by the user at 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.970
 korn and whose link to what doing his 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.350
 I'll leave them on the page 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.300
 description so that you can 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.490
 Check this out more thoroughly to me the truth 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.530
 I loved his work and they are not 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.180
 just simply images but 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.070
 he also has plans for that character 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.229
 so that in the future you can download 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.300
 as a type of skin or as a type of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.130
 textures suppose that maybe we're not going 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.110
 to have a new story with follow 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.119
 but we are going to be able to play with this 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.369
 character not simply what maybe 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.979
 We will replace it with the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.750
 character of what do I know about maikol 's 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.760
 franklin or any of these 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.319
 characters to be able to take the identity 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 of cinema and power 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.389
 as if we were going back to the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.510
 era of great car san andreas but with 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:23.609
 a most current age dj here as what 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.499
 you can see we are looking at the planes of 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.659
 what was the creation of chair and 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.370
 remastered as you can see already 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.680
 they notice some textures here was when 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.510
 the saddle was not that advanced because 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.430
 we can notice that in his body and in what 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.950
 that is making your face not so much 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.049
 the traits as it might have been noticed in 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.700
 the previous one since here we have seen the 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.650
 creation of what is being said 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.409
 character and the truth that looks super 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.510
 well now we can see the face 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.849
 of a chair and how it has been 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.579
 time we can notice that the lips the 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.409
 nose and other gestures that have been 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.239
 just as they were at the beginning no longer 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.099
 that we can remember how it was chair 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.959
 but now we can appreciate more things 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.969
 since they are no longer the same young man of 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.609
 20 years that he was around in the city of 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:08.400
 great auto san andreas but this 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.650
 game is already based on the year 2015 and it's already 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.049
 has about a little more than almost 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.790
 40 years which this is pretty much 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.310
 well and it makes us think many things 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.709
 besides that the gentlemen 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.239
 in the current big caution there are not so 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.250
 bad because if we note the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.599
 michael character would haunt the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.190
 same age thing that can make us 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.959
 think that maybe they met in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.819
 some time but this has nothing 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.280
 what to do with the story and what a great car 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.010
 san andreas and other great cars are 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.630
 in another totally alternate universe not 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.209
 the only ones who are in the same 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.010
 universe is the trilogy of great auto san 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.530
 andreas which was great for car 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.230
 vice city and grand theft auto '3 the world 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.750
 or universe that is round in great point 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.900
 5 is the universe as great Auto 4 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.510
 is the enemy band of the platforms not 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.000
 and here as we can see we are 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.060
 looking at a plane which we see the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.099
 perfection the texture of dj in what goes 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.380
 doing the actuality we can notice that 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.880
 we appreciate everything as much physical traits 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.610
 like the ears that are very good 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.580
 created up to each point of facial hair 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.590
 not like hair can be the beard and 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.840
 the mustache even the dry one that has it 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.940
 a bit distorted, which does not look 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.250
 perfect just like the vein that 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.780
 we can see right in his neck to me 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.550
 I really loved all 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.120
 these aspects since we can see that it is 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.699
 something 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.620
 exaggeratedly professional and not just an 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.169
 image created by photoshop but that 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.760
 it is also thought to include this mode myself 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.260
 I really love the play gets 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.510
 llosa although he may not play his 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.880
 remastered history or know what happened 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.650
 with him but able to play and be able to have 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.930
 a good memory of what we had in 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.240
 some past not here as you see it 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.830
 a small plane which is how it was 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.260
 starting this whole project and we can 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.180
 see that the complexion is very similar not 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.740
 although he continues to how we are going to see 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.540
 now he will not have the same 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.160
 thin complexion since it is not a young 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.750
 and it can be a gentleman 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.310
 so kids like they see it is extremely 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.370
 interesting everything is fine the truth that 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.690
 I loved it and I find extremely 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.699
 interesting not the truth see still follows 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.860
 currently in this game the truth 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.389
 I'm very excited about that 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.669
 it looks pretty good you tell me what 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.650
 they think of this what they think a follow 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.660
 at present as they would like to 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.389
 you unravel with him and where 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.760
 would like to go if they would like to go to 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.530
 old fritz group or any of these 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.389
 things so I hope you liked it 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.789
 this video remember that the description 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.800
 I'll leave the link to the corning 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.840
 who has created this mobile is 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.940
 in charge of all this I do not know 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.010
 is for a personal project or for what 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.199
 be it but the truth is that it is super good 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.850
 also here it gives us to think and that if a 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.610
 person could do all this 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.350
 totally alone then obviously a 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.630
 great team of workers can 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.220
 do it much better not since already 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.650
 they have the idea they do not have to create anything 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.729
 it's basically a remastering 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.380
 you already me what they think of this that 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.900
 another character would like it to have 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.120
 and what else would you like in this new 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.070
 big 5 pc point to me what else i 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.320
 I would be excited would be to play what I know with 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.450
 a mold spider man or iron man since 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.820
 they are the funniest no or even 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.530
 a lot like goku lara that would make me 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.060
 pretty excited to be able to play with one of 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.440
 these so guys but there are
