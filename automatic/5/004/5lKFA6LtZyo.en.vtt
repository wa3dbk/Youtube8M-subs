00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.240 

here's<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.750> shot<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.170> shock<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.010> we<00:02:22.099> just

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
here's a shot of the shock that we just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.559 
here's a shot of the shock that we just
took<00:02:22.400> out<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.120> see<00:02:23.300> when<00:02:23.450> it's

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
took out and you can see when it's

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.220 
took out and you can see when it's
compressed<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.230> does<00:02:24.440> not<00:02:25.209> come<00:02:26.209> come<00:02:26.630> back<00:02:26.780> up

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
compressed it does not come come back up

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.530
