bounce up and down and that really

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.040 
bounce up and down and that really
causes<00:02:43.860> dramatic<00:02:44.730> swings<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.510> price<00:02:45.810> when

at where it's gone it has gone up
significantly<00:04:20.280> from<00:04:21.090> its<00:04:21.299> low<00:04:21.479> point<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.960> is

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
significantly from its low point that is

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.130 
significantly from its low point that is
for<00:04:22.440> sure<00:04:22.820> adjusted<00:04:23.820> for<00:04:24.000> inflation<00:04:24.060> we<00:04:24.960> have

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
for sure adjusted for inflation we have

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.730 
for sure adjusted for inflation we have
a<00:04:25.169> much<00:04:25.530> different<00:04:25.919> number<00:04:26.400> of

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
a much different number of

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.159 
a much different number of
course<00:04:26.919> it<00:04:27.370> hasn't<00:04:27.819> reached<00:04:28.300> its<00:04:28.539> peak<00:04:28.930> yet

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
course it hasn't reached its peak yet

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.950 
course it hasn't reached its peak yet
but<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.310> point<00:04:30.669> is<00:04:30.849> that<00:04:30.880> nothing<00:04:31.780> is

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
but the point is that nothing is

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.800 
but the point is that nothing is
bulletproof<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.220> because<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.759> that<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.389> need

bulletproof and because of that you need

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.830 
bulletproof and because of that you need
