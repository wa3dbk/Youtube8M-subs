the<00:00:04.430> MRI<00:00:04.730> showed<00:00:05.300> that<00:00:05.480> there<00:00:05.600> was<00:00:05.660> a<00:00:05.779> cancer

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.050 
the MRI showed that there was a cancer

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.690 
the MRI showed that there was a cancer
or<00:00:07.040> growth<00:00:07.460> a<00:00:07.790> tumor<00:00:08.660> on<00:00:08.690> my<00:00:08.809> liver<00:00:09.230> and<00:00:09.700> they

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
or growth a tumor on my liver and they

it<00:00:40.310> was<00:00:40.430> on<00:00:40.610> melanoma<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:42.590> they<00:00:43.010> had<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.250> very

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
it was on melanoma and they had a very

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.240 
it was on melanoma and they had a very
high<00:00:43.790> suspicion<00:00:44.060> then<00:00:44.630> and<00:00:44.870> now<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:46.100> the

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
high suspicion then and now that the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.680 
high suspicion then and now that the
melanoma<00:00:46.640> started<00:00:47.000> somewhere<00:00:47.360> else<00:00:47.480> on<00:00:47.630> my

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
melanoma started somewhere else on my

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.090 
melanoma started somewhere else on my
body<00:00:47.810> and<00:00:48.140> spread<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.090> liver

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.880 

well<00:00:55.850> at<00:00:55.969> first<00:00:56.000> I<00:00:56.480> I<00:00:57.370> felt<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.699> was<00:00:58.820> saw

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
well at first I I felt that it was saw

well at first I I felt that it was saw
confined<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.039> my<00:01:01.070> liver<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.789> they<00:01:02.300> had<00:01:02.480> the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
confined to my liver and they had the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.560 
confined to my liver and they had the
operation<00:01:03.320> had<00:01:03.759> completely<00:01:04.759> removed<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.269> so<00:01:05.509> I

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
operation had completely removed it so I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.800 
operation had completely removed it so I
had<00:01:05.810> quite<00:01:06.229> relieved<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:07.180> then<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:08.509> same

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
had quite relieved and then that same

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.969 
had quite relieved and then that same
afternoon<00:01:09.610> we<00:01:10.610> had<00:01:10.640> an<00:01:10.880> MRI<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.630> my<00:01:12.409> head<00:01:12.950> and

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
afternoon we had an MRI of my head and

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.649 
afternoon we had an MRI of my head and
neck<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:13.670> showed<00:01:13.909> up<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.509> was

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
neck and it showed up that it was

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.859 
neck and it showed up that it was
already<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.229> four<00:01:15.440> places<00:01:15.649> in<00:01:15.890> my<00:01:16.009> brain<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:16.869> I

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
already in four places in my brain so I

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.230 
already in four places in my brain so I
would<00:01:18.170> say<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.350> night<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.729> next<00:01:19.759> day

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240
