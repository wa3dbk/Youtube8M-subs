i<00:00:46.500> don't<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.430> i<00:00:47.489> ever<00:00:47.520> got<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> sense<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
i don't think i ever got a sense as to

i don't think i ever got a sense as to
whether<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.840> were<00:00:48.930> satisfied<00:00:49.170> with

a<00:00:52.829> humorous<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.350> obviously

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
a humorous because you know obviously

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.979 
a humorous because you know obviously
gold<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.430> money<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
gold is money and it is not because I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.930 
gold is money and it is not because I
say<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.469> funny<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:58.949> history<00:00:59.430> says<00:00:59.670> it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
say it's funny because history says it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.450

currency<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:28.620> much<00:02:29.070> more<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.460> favor<00:02:29.670> of

that<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.620> deciding<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:31.830> should<00:02:32.100> be<00:02:32.310> money<00:02:32.940> I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
that and deciding what should be money I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.390 
that and deciding what should be money I
just<00:02:33.780> think<00:02:33.990> that<00:02:34.200> history<00:02:34.830> shows<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.070> they

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
just think that history shows that they

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.300 
just think that history shows that they
will<00:02:35.610> see<00:02:35.850> gold<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.050> think<00:02:37.470> gold<00:02:37.770> is<00:02:37.920> acting

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
will see gold and I think gold is acting

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.980 
will see gold and I think gold is acting
as<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> very<00:02:38.730> strong<00:02:39.030> currency<00:02:39.420> right<00:02:39.750> now

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
as a very strong currency right now

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.900 
as a very strong currency right now
because<00:02:40.500> people<00:02:41.160> are<00:02:41.280> very<00:02:41.460> very<00:02:41.700> nervous

loss is coming anyway because these

now opted to send keep sending the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.830 
now opted to send keep sending the
checks<00:03:44.370> out<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.940> we're<00:03:45.090> not<00:03:45.209> going<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.660> be

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
checks out and we're not going to be

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.229 
checks out and we're not going to be
clear<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.410> default<00:03:47.340> by<00:03:47.549> not<00:03:47.760> sending<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
clear a default by not sending the

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.539 
clear a default by not sending the
checks<00:03:48.510> we've<00:03:49.350> decided<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.980> print<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.370> money

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
checks we've decided to print the money

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.490 
checks we've decided to print the money
and<00:03:50.880> send<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.239> checks<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.690> less<00:03:52.019> value

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
and send the checks that have less value

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.050 
and send the checks that have less value
and<00:03:52.739> that's<00:03:52.890> why<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.130> standard<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.670> living<00:03:53.790> is

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and that's why the standard of living is

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.240 
and that's why the standard of living is
going<00:03:54.330> down<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:54.870> those<00:03:55.350> programs<00:03:55.920> are<00:03:56.070> not

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
going down so those programs are not

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.220 
going down so those programs are not
viable<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:56.910> as<00:03:57.030> our<00:03:57.180> point<00:03:57.390> policy<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:58.110> our

Committee if you could do it because a

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
and it's going to be awfully difficult

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.550 
and it's going to be awfully difficult
to<00:04:20.430> find<00:04:20.669> someone<00:04:21.090> who<00:04:21.299> will<00:04:21.959> want<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.320> bargain

and make it 725

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000 
and make it 725
well<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.660> would<00:04:25.870> challenge<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.470> in<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.710> course

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
well I would challenge it in the course

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.400 
well I would challenge it in the course
and<00:04:27.400> i<00:04:27.730> would<00:04:27.760> say<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.240> it's<00:04:29.200> not<00:04:29.380> a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
and i would say that it's not a

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.980 
and i would say that it's not a
constitutional<00:04:30.660> function<00:04:31.660> there's<00:04:31.840> no

removed from what was intended that it

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.830

been going on wholesale since 1971 since

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.219 
been going on wholesale since 1971 since
we've<00:05:39.340> launched<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:39.880> last<00:05:40.120> link<00:05:40.419> to<00:05:40.540> gold<00:05:40.870> and

we've launched the last link to gold and

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.800 
we've launched the last link to gold and
so<00:05:41.950> these<00:05:42.340> these<00:05:43.150> problems<00:05:43.600> that<00:05:43.690> we're

so these these problems that we're

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.409 
so these these problems that we're

yellow metal well I think I understand

yellow metal well I think I understand

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
what you're saying that my my policy

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.300 
what you're saying that my my policy
would<00:06:10.210> be<00:06:10.690> if<00:06:10.960> they<00:06:11.110> followed<00:06:11.530> my<00:06:11.770> policies

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
would be if they followed my policies

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.090 
would be if they followed my policies
the<00:06:12.850> gold<00:06:13.240> coins<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.690> I<00:06:13.930> hold<00:06:14.229> will<00:06:14.680> not<00:06:14.890> go

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
the gold coins that I hold will not go

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.340 
the gold coins that I hold will not go
up<00:06:15.250> in<00:06:15.430> dollar<00:06:15.640> value<00:06:16.090> anymore<00:06:16.419> that<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:17.050> true

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
up in dollar value anymore that is true

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.760 
up in dollar value anymore that is true
it<00:06:17.680> sort<00:06:18.250> of<00:06:18.310> contradicts<00:06:18.940> it<00:06:19.500> but<00:06:20.500> if<00:06:20.650> you

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
it sort of contradicts it but if you

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.219 
it sort of contradicts it but if you
have<00:06:20.890> found<00:06:21.130> money<00:06:21.490> gold<00:06:22.419> in<00:06:22.780> many<00:06:23.050> ways

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
have found money gold in many ways

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.290 
have found money gold in many ways
remains<00:06:23.650> more<00:06:23.890> stable<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.430> relationship<00:06:25.150> to

remains more stable and relationship to
the<00:06:25.390> dollar<00:06:25.630> so<00:06:26.260> how<00:06:26.500> badly<00:06:26.800> do<00:06:27.160> you<00:06:27.220> feel<00:06:27.520> the

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
the dollar so how badly do you feel the

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.400 
the dollar so how badly do you feel the
need<00:06:27.850> to<00:06:28.030> enact<00:06:28.240> change<00:06:28.390> at<00:06:28.810> the<00:06:28.930> moment<00:06:29.290> if

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
need to enact change at the moment if

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.080 
need to enact change at the moment if
you<00:06:29.440> don't<00:06:29.590> get<00:06:29.979> the<00:06:30.190> nomination<00:06:30.880> of<00:06:30.970> the

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
you don't get the nomination of the

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.170 
you don't get the nomination of the
Republican<00:06:31.660> Party<00:06:31.690> would<00:06:32.140> you<00:06:32.290> consider

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
Republican Party would you consider

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.800 
Republican Party would you consider
declaring<00:06:34.180> as<00:06:34.330> a<00:06:34.710> libertarian<00:06:35.710> third<00:06:36.310> party

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
declaring as a libertarian third party

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.450 
declaring as a libertarian third party
candidate<00:06:37.320> even<00:06:37.650> if<00:06:37.770> that<00:06:37.800> split<00:06:38.340> the

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
candidate even if that split the

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.300 
candidate even if that split the
anti-obama<00:06:39.030> votes<00:06:39.740> well<00:06:40.740> I<00:06:40.770> think<00:06:41.040> whether<00:06:41.160> it

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
anti-obama votes well I think whether it

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.610 
anti-obama votes well I think whether it
splits<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:41.820> anti-obama<00:06:42.660> voter<00:06:43.050> nadia<00:06:43.590> is

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
splits the anti-obama voter nadia is

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.050 
splits the anti-obama voter nadia is
pretty<00:06:43.950> irrelevant<00:06:44.250> but<00:06:44.639> I<00:06:44.730> think<00:06:44.970> they're

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
pretty irrelevant but I think they're

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.740 
pretty irrelevant but I think they're
not<00:06:45.210> given<00:06:45.450> that<00:06:45.600> option<00:06:46.260> any<00:06:46.650> consideration

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750
