00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
hand all you can see that this plan for

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.880 
hand all you can see that this plan for
a<00:01:04.589> 308<00:01:05.280> pounder<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.390> what's<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:06.930> massage

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.950 

so<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> lever<00:01:11.520> stick<00:01:11.790> show<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.270> made<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so when the lever stick show that made a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.980 
so when the lever stick show that made a
little<00:01:13.229> bit<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.439> sense<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:16.340> if<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> talk<00:01:17.670> about

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
little bit of sense is if you talk about

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.910 
little bit of sense is if you talk about
Jalen<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.049> how<00:01:19.200> much<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.560> claim<00:01:19.860> that
