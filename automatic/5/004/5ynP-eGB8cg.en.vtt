hydroxyl<00:02:11.659> is<00:02:11.870> 0<00:02:12.409> H<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.340> we<00:02:13.640> all<00:02:13.790> know<00:02:14.030> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
hydroxyl is 0 H and we all know that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.869 
hydroxyl is 0 H and we all know that
water<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.750> h2o<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.860> somewhere<00:02:16.310> along<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
water is h2o so somewhere along the

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.410 
water is h2o so somewhere along the
along<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.720> way<00:02:19.060> hydroxyl<00:02:20.060> which<00:02:20.239> was

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
along the way hydroxyl which was

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.500 
along the way hydroxyl which was
originally<00:02:20.989> water<00:02:21.500> lost<00:02:21.980> an<00:02:22.220> H<00:02:22.400> well<00:02:23.239> that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
originally water lost an H well that

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.839 
originally water lost an H well that
process<00:02:24.110> occurred<00:02:24.530> billions<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.430> years<00:02:25.610> ago

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
process occurred billions of years ago

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.839

when<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.269> moon<00:02:26.480> originally<00:02:27.379> formed<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.099> so

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
when the moon originally formed and so

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.399 
when the moon originally formed and so
the<00:02:28.970> measurements<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.629> they're<00:02:29.900> making<00:02:30.230> now

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
the measurements that they're making now

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.240 
the measurements that they're making now
finding<00:02:31.040> these<00:02:31.250> very<00:02:31.849> small<00:02:32.739> incredibly<00:02:33.739> tiny

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
finding these very small incredibly tiny

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.880 
finding these very small incredibly tiny
amounts<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.939> hydroxyl<00:02:35.659> tell<00:02:36.319> us<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.620> lot<00:02:36.829> about

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
amounts of hydroxyl tell us a lot about

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.940 
amounts of hydroxyl tell us a lot about
the<00:02:37.849> amount<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.239> water<00:02:38.510> at<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.959> early

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
the amount of water at the early

the amount of water at the early

moon<00:02:42.379> well<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.400> not<00:02:43.930> really<00:02:44.930> h2o<00:02:45.709> water

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
moon well this is not really h2o water

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.640 
moon well this is not really h2o water
that<00:02:46.700> we<00:02:46.879> know<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.359> it's<00:02:47.599> not<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:48.079> it's<00:02:48.290> pools

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
that we know so it's not like it's pools

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.580 
that we know so it's not like it's pools
of<00:02:48.980> water<00:02:49.010> or<00:02:49.670> even<00:02:50.030> ponds<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.659> water<00:02:50.959> it's

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
of water or even ponds of water it's

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.220 
of water or even ponds of water it's
actually<00:02:51.920> ancient<00:02:52.519> water<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.810> has<00:02:53.989> been

actually ancient water that has been

actually ancient water that has been
modified<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.790> solidification<00:02:56.359> process

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.009 
of the moon during the time of its early
formation<00:03:01.310> what's<00:03:01.939> really<00:03:02.359> exciting<00:03:02.510> about

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
formation what's really exciting about

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.199 
formation what's really exciting about
these<00:03:03.379> observations<00:03:04.129> is<00:03:04.340> it's<00:03:04.549> allowing<00:03:05.060> us

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
these observations is it's allowing us

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.110 
these observations is it's allowing us
for<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.540> first<00:03:05.840> time<00:03:06.109> to<00:03:06.829> understand<00:03:07.700> what

the conditions of the early Earth was

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.929 
the conditions of the early Earth was
when<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.439> earth<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.189> moon<00:03:13.340> were<00:03:13.549> formed

when the earth and the moon were formed

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.000 
when the earth and the moon were formed

mars-sized object that hit the earth 4.5
billion<00:03:19.160> years<00:03:19.310> ago<00:03:19.549> well<00:03:20.030> there's<00:03:20.209> been

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
billion years ago well there's been

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.420 
billion years ago well there's been
quite<00:03:20.599> a<00:03:20.690> bit<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.049> talk<00:03:21.230> about<00:03:21.440> how<00:03:21.949> did<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
quite a bit of talk about how did the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.360 
quite a bit of talk about how did the
earth<00:03:22.609> get<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.180> water<00:03:23.419> that<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.870> has<00:03:24.220> did<00:03:25.220> it

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
earth get the water that it has did it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.270 
earth get the water that it has did it
begin<00:03:25.699> that<00:03:26.209> way<00:03:26.239> or<00:03:26.959> did<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.530> Comets<00:03:28.010> bring

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
begin that way or did the Comets bring

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.569 
begin that way or did the Comets bring
it<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.579> or<00:03:28.819> even<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.299> Kuiper<00:03:29.540> belt<00:03:29.840> objects

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
it in or even the Kuiper belt objects

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.399 
it in or even the Kuiper belt objects
bringing<00:03:31.579> it<00:03:31.730> bringing<00:03:31.909> water<00:03:32.359> in<00:03:32.629> and<00:03:32.870> so

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
bringing it bringing water in and so

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.680 
bringing it bringing water in and so
this<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.769> now<00:03:33.949> the<00:03:34.010> first<00:03:34.549> evidence<00:03:34.909> that<00:03:35.569> we

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
this is now the first evidence that we

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.270 
this is now the first evidence that we
had<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.139> there<00:03:36.319> actually<00:03:36.500> was<00:03:36.889> a<00:03:36.919> fair

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
had that there actually was a fair

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.759 
had that there actually was a fair
amount<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:37.730> water<00:03:38.319> initially<00:03:39.319> in<00:03:39.560> the

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
amount of water initially in the

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.189 
amount of water initially in the
earth-moon<00:03:39.979> system<00:03:40.540> 4.5<00:03:41.540> billion<00:03:41.810> years<00:03:41.959> ago

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
earth-moon system 4.5 billion years ago

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.309 
earth-moon system 4.5 billion years ago
what<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.040> scientists<00:03:43.909> discovered<00:03:44.780> by

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
what the scientists discovered by

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.849 
what the scientists discovered by
examining<00:03:46.190> specific<00:03:47.060> lunar<00:03:47.930> rocks<00:03:48.199> and<00:03:48.650> these

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
examining specific lunar rocks and these

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.270 
examining specific lunar rocks and these
lunar<00:03:49.129> rocks<00:03:49.400> are<00:03:49.729> called<00:03:50.209> appetite<00:03:50.930> and

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
lunar rocks are called appetite and

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.369 
lunar rocks are called appetite and
appetite<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.489> one<00:03:52.699> of<00:03:52.849> those<00:03:53.000> as<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.449> forms<00:03:53.959> it

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
appetite is one of those as it forms it

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.030 
appetite is one of those as it forms it
grabs<00:03:54.889> water<00:03:55.699> now<00:03:56.479> it<00:03:56.690> did<00:03:56.900> that<00:03:57.139> in<00:03:57.349> its<00:03:57.590> early

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
grabs water now it did that in its early

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.719 
grabs water now it did that in its early
formation<00:03:58.659> 4.5<00:03:59.659> billion<00:04:00.379> years<00:04:00.590> ago<00:04:00.889> it
