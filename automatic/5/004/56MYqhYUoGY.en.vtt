00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
forward a little bit for it to work I

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.070 
forward a little bit for it to work I
guess<00:03:15.560> yeah<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.220> don't<00:03:16.610> know<00:03:16.730> i'm<00:03:17.510> assuming

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
guess yeah I don't know i'm assuming

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.320 
guess yeah I don't know i'm assuming
maybe<00:03:18.470> just<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.950> corner<00:03:19.220> let<00:03:19.610> me<00:03:19.730> when<00:03:20.269> you

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
maybe just in the corner let me when you

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.720 
maybe just in the corner let me when you
get<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.510> spin<00:03:20.690> in<00:03:20.810> as<00:03:21.230> an<00:03:21.380> anti-air<00:03:21.799> but<00:03:22.310> you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
get the spin in as an anti-air but you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.520 
get the spin in as an anti-air but you
have<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.180> judge<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.510> spacing<00:03:23.840> really<00:03:24.140> fast<00:03:24.320> as

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
have to judge the spacing really fast as

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.440 
have to judge the spacing really fast as
you're<00:03:24.650> able<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:25.010> do<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.250> maybe<00:03:25.970> if<00:03:26.209> they're

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
you're able to do it maybe if they're

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.509 
you're able to do it maybe if they're
above<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:27.200> on<00:03:27.380> wake<00:03:27.650> up<00:03:27.799> you<00:03:27.980> know<00:03:28.130> sure

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
above you like on wake up you know sure

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.190 
above you like on wake up you know sure
to<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:29.299> think<00:03:29.660> that's<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.840> best<00:03:29.959> right

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
to it I think that's the best right

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.430 
to it I think that's the best right
