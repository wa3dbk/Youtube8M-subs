00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.549
 hello good kids and we're here 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.140
 new video of modern warfare 2 this 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.879
 I 'm going to try a duel lighting 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.980
 teams because we're looking for game 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.780
 in domain and it was practically impossible 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.060
 I was going to miss the connection let's see 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.820
 like here because I do not trust myself good three 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.490
 brand lines let's see to see I'm going to 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.159
 try the cr and high school the app 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.710
 2000 to see to see how this makes 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.749
 time that I do not play and I do not use 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.239
 the acr I think he did not have it there in the 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.239
 classes but good let's see 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.140
 this out there 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.140
 now it seems that there is nobody 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.800
 what happens that I do not have I have it 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.829
 taken away 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.710
 I prestige there scavenger then I 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.190
 I will be without super fast ammunition and another 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.870
 do not 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.870
 OK, it looks like they are here 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 it's a pity that there are almost no people 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.030
 in this game is at the end at the end of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.030
 Map 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.970
 because the truth that is a pass of 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.740
 I play the maps I've been seeing there 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.230
 they left and that they gave me no 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.350
 you remember some incredible memories 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.270
 as he has fired the markings from behind 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.799
 good for this part we will not go like this 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.320
 I 'm going to try to go around 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.170
 up because it's at the end of the map the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.600
 site is that there was a cube and at the end 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.390
 and I do not trust anything 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.330
 let's get caught 21 came the gusts 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.250
 of nuclear but what happens what 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.480
 not by teams and on this map I do not know 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.370
 what are you going to go 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.670
 you have 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.770
 to see I need a weapon 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.640
 I could not stand by and see if 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.640
 I see someone 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.230
 to see what is taking away from me then 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.230

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.990
 and here they are all here 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.820
 come on let's go I have 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.820
 to see where I throw it 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.480
 or I'm in your response 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.270
 same 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.360
 the other one is up here I think we're going 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.910
 we have seen that I am 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.550
 I'm screwed I'm screwed I am very 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.550

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.550
 do not 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.880
 do not 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.780
 seen what seen what seen what killed 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.780
 how are we doing 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.360
 OK 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.360

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.860
 here we go let's go let's go run 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.040
 come here I'm fine the least I do not know 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.130
 he lost a little good a c zero bones of 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.800
 support we go on this map is very fucked 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.300
 of killing with support because there are many 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.780
 houses where they can get in now is 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.780
 so many here 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.490
 but as they came for me they are all 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:20.150
 type herein kill 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:24.010
 if it falls this does not fall 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.519
 ok ok let's go let's go let's go there is another 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.790
 roller this bar is worth it, so let's go 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.010
 spike 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.140
 is it so 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.100
 it's so fast 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.750
 if anything 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.200
 end 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.160
 how this was changed this does not turn 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.160
 it's there it's there 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.870
 ok let's go let's go 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.870
 where are they 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:02.940
 they come out here here come on let's tour tour 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:07.320
 fast run is not worth 21 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.980
 no jo jo jo can not be fuck me 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.630
 seemed just right in front and how little 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.250
 He has been missing but he was not there 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.900
 wrong 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.920
 21 streak on this map that is fucked 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.740
 to get a streak so with there is a 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.720
 nuclear with these gusts or not with 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.000
 any streak because it 's more than bad 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.620
 by teams but good as I have seen that 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.260
 I did not have much time either 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.530
 there are two thousand points about 20 casualties 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.530
 thing like that 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.640
 and spied the black with shortcuts 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.640
 four times in a row 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:54.300
 here I do not know where they shoot but I'm going to 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.300
 try to get into this part 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.770
 he dies 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.889
 but 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.349
 that does not die 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.349
 this woman all that power and they take it from me 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.169
 to see see 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.370
 what's up , mother, if it's that 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.660
 Mark three lines but 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.520
 very false this 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.100
 Let's see 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.560
 and go up to see 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.840
 I invite you to be here 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.840
 I had allied them there what happens that I 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.340
 I was fucking already there I do not kill anymore 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.190
 I do not think that killed the one they have 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.290
 got another support as he dared good 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.260
 22 to 6 has been pretty good that streak 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.030
 enough tension that they were living 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.650
 everyone to sack knew too much where 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.290
 they were city â€‹â€‹not me nor the silencer 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.669
 nothing, but I hope that I have 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.669
 liked and until next time
