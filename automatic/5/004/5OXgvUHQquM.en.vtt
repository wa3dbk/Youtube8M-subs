here's<00:00:01.439> that<00:00:01.620> 83<00:00:02.310> Midland<00:00:03.000> 13-inch<00:00:03.810> color<00:00:04.140> TV

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
here's that 83 Midland 13-inch color TV

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.619 
here's that 83 Midland 13-inch color TV
that<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:05.040> picked<00:00:05.310> up<00:00:05.490> today<00:00:05.700> we're<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.330> to

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
that I picked up today we're going to

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.919 
that I picked up today we're going to
clean<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:08.150> potentiometers<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.630> teener

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
clean the potentiometers and the teener

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.839 
clean the potentiometers and the teener
and<00:00:10.260> make<00:00:10.440> any<00:00:10.620> adjustments<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.460> might<00:00:11.670> be

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
and make any adjustments it might be

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.330 
and make any adjustments it might be
necessary<00:00:12.440> and<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.559> definitely<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
necessary and this definitely is a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.710 
necessary and this definitely is a
Samsung<00:00:15.120> TV<00:00:16.310> with<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> minimum<00:00:17.910> name<00:00:18.150> snapped

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
Samsung TV with the minimum name snapped

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.380 
Samsung TV with the minimum name snapped
on<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.199> back<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.340> has<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> Samsung

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
on it back you can see it has a Samsung

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.609 
on it back you can see it has a Samsung
branded<00:00:22.070> CRT<00:00:23.840> looks<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> pretty<00:00:25.380> well

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
branded CRT looks like a pretty well

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.130 
branded CRT looks like a pretty well
built<00:00:25.920> set<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.880> doesn't<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> whole<00:00:27.840> lot<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
built set it doesn't have a whole lot of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.710 
built set it doesn't have a whole lot of
hours<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.910> old<00:00:30.119> enough<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.449> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
hours on it and it's old enough that it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.510 
hours on it and it's old enough that it
still<00:00:31.019> uses<00:00:31.380> to3<00:00:32.009> cased<00:00:34.100> horizontal<00:00:35.100> output

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
still uses to3 cased horizontal output

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.139 
still uses to3 cased horizontal output
transistors<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.340> voltage<00:00:38.340> regulator

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
transistors and the voltage regulator

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
transistors and the voltage regulator
I<00:00:41.570> think<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.809> set<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.290> probably<00:00:43.710> sold

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
I think this set was probably sold

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.330 
I think this set was probably sold
through<00:00:44.309> Western<00:00:44.760> auto<00:00:45.079> after<00:00:46.079> they<00:00:46.340> after

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
through Western auto after they after

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.670 
through Western auto after they after
Western<00:00:47.910> Auto<00:00:48.090> abandoned<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> true<00:00:49.410> tone

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
Western Auto abandoned the true tone

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.400 
Western Auto abandoned the true tone
name<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.370> believe<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.879> 81<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.930> started

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
name I believe in 81 they started

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.540 
name I believe in 81 they started
carrying<00:00:53.149> middlin<00:00:54.149> branded<00:00:54.780> products<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
carrying middlin branded products and I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.860 
carrying middlin branded products and I
think<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.420> such<00:00:57.719> product<00:00:59.870> I've

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
think this is one such product I've

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
think this is one such product I've
worked<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> lot<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.890> sets<00:01:02.250> back<00:01:02.640> in

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
worked on a lot of these sets back in

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.329 
worked on a lot of these sets back in
the<00:01:02.910> 90s<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> flyback<00:01:04.339> transformers

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the 90s and the flyback transformers

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.760 
the 90s and the flyback transformers
were<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:06.590> big<00:01:07.590> weak<00:01:07.920> spot<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.520> these<00:01:08.729> sets

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
were a big weak spot in these sets

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
were a big weak spot in these sets
although<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.950> one's<00:01:11.189> lasted<00:01:11.640> 30<00:01:12.090> years<00:01:12.570> so

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
although this one's lasted 30 years so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
although this one's lasted 30 years so
maybe<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.740> transformer<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
maybe this is a good transformer that

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.249 
maybe this is a good transformer that
will<00:01:15.229> hold<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.100> few<00:01:17.490> more<00:01:17.670> year<00:01:18.080> okay<00:01:19.080> we

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
will hold up for a few more year okay we

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
will hold up for a few more year okay we
have<00:01:19.439> our<00:01:19.619> control<00:01:20.009> cleaner<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.909> the

for the adjustment procedure we had to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.929 
for the adjustment procedure we had to

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
turn our brightness just about all the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
turn our brightness just about all the
way<00:02:03.119> up<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> sufficiently<00:02:04.439> bright
