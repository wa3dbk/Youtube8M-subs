for<00:00:29.800> this<00:00:29.890> project<00:00:30.610> I<00:00:31.060> found<00:00:31.720> inspiration<00:00:32.020> in

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
for this project I found inspiration in

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.790 
for this project I found inspiration in
to<00:00:32.920> fend<00:00:33.700> his<00:00:33.850> own<00:00:34.030> brand<00:00:34.420> identity<00:00:34.990> and<00:00:35.230> i

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
to fend his own brand identity and i

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.010 
to fend his own brand identity and i
discovered<00:00:36.340> that<00:00:36.460> fendi<00:00:37.000> has<00:00:37.450> been<00:00:37.630> inspired

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
discovered that fendi has been inspired

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.070 
discovered that fendi has been inspired
by<00:00:38.670> modernist<00:00:39.670> graphics<00:00:40.090> and<00:00:40.330> modernist

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
by modernist graphics and modernist

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.830 
by modernist graphics and modernist
patterns<00:00:41.500> for<00:00:42.460> many<00:00:42.700> many<00:00:42.850> decades<00:00:43.120> that's

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
patterns for many many decades that's

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.410 
patterns for many many decades that's
also<00:00:44.020> while<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:45.130> famous<00:00:45.520> back<00:00:45.940> cam<00:00:46.120> came

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
also while the the famous back cam came

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.350 
also while the the famous back cam came
from<00:00:46.630> and<00:00:46.900> I<00:00:47.470> decided<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.340> do<00:00:48.910> something<00:00:49.150> with

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
from and I decided to do something with

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.270 
from and I decided to do something with
this<00:00:49.510> as<00:00:49.690> well<00:00:49.720> like<00:00:50.500> they<00:00:50.680> have<00:00:50.860> been<00:00:51.040> using

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
this as well like they have been using

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.630 
this as well like they have been using
graphic<00:00:52.260> modernist<00:00:53.260> graphics<00:00:53.650> only<00:00:54.489> in<00:00:54.580> a

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
graphic modernist graphics only in a

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.160 
graphic modernist graphics only in a
two-dimensional<00:00:54.910> way<00:00:55.420> for<00:00:55.720> many<00:00:55.900> many<00:00:56.050> years

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
two-dimensional way for many many years

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.380 
two-dimensional way for many many years
and<00:00:56.590> I<00:00:57.040> wanted<00:00:57.340> to<00:00:57.460> transform<00:00:57.940> its

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
and I wanted to transform its

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.119 
and I wanted to transform its
two-dimensional<00:00:59.110> patterns<00:00:59.470> into<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.800> three

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
two-dimensional patterns into a three

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.730 
two-dimensional patterns into a three
dimensional<00:01:00.570> system<00:01:01.570> basically<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:02.260> decided

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
dimensional system basically I decided

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.580 
dimensional system basically I decided
to<00:01:02.980> design<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.730> system<00:01:04.119> with<00:01:04.930> which<00:01:05.110> it's<00:01:05.380> very

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
to design a system with which it's very

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.890 
to design a system with which it's very
easy<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.160> create<00:01:06.490> any<00:01:06.790> pattern<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.390> want<00:01:07.570> and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
easy to create any pattern you want and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.080 
easy to create any pattern you want and
to<00:01:08.080> let<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.410> over<00:01:09.070> grow<00:01:09.369> an<00:01:09.640> existing

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
to let it over grow an existing

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:19.970 
to let it over grow an existing
structure

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.120 

with<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.700> installation<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.720> try<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
with this installation here I try to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
with this installation here I try to
show<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:24.180> cheap<00:01:24.390> metric<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
show that some really cheap metric and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
show that some really cheap metric and
strayed<00:01:25.380> shapes<00:01:25.770> where<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.910> apply<00:01:27.060> these

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
strayed shapes where you can apply these

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.360 
strayed shapes where you can apply these
cushions<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.260> some<00:01:28.500> benches<00:01:29.070> which

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
cushions on you have some benches which

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.760 
cushions on you have some benches which
have<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.150> which<00:01:30.870> have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> show<00:01:31.350> people<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
have to I which have to show people that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130 
have to I which have to show people that
they<00:01:32.040> could<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.520> buy<00:01:33.120> some<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.660> apply<00:01:33.930> them

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
they could just buy some and apply them

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.450 
they could just buy some and apply them
on<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.920> bench<00:01:35.130> they<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.340> an<00:01:35.580> in<00:01:36.090> their<00:01:36.240> house
