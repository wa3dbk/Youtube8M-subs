the GTA 5 gameplay early if you wanted
to<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.649> basically<00:02:11.160> all<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
to and basically all you have to do is

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.370 
to and basically all you have to do is
type<00:02:12.450> up<00:02:12.660> GT

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
type up GT

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
type up GT
five<00:02:13.560> gameplay<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.640> loads<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.150> filter

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
five gameplay and loads of the filter

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.170 
five gameplay and loads of the filter
options<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.290> lookup<00:02:16.800> last<00:02:17.130> hour<00:02:17.490> now<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
options and lookup last hour now the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.010 
options and lookup last hour now the
reason<00:02:18.600> why<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:20.030> YouTube<00:02:21.030> deletes

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
reason why is because YouTube deletes

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.260 
reason why is because YouTube deletes
those<00:02:22.320> YouTube<00:02:22.800> videos<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.850> game<00:02:24.240> that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
those YouTube videos of a game that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.480 
those YouTube videos of a game that
comes<00:02:24.660> out<00:02:24.810> early<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.680> they're<00:02:25.800> not<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.460> to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490
