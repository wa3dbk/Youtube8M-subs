make<00:06:12.530> them<00:06:12.680> for<00:06:13.010> 33<00:06:13.490> and<00:06:13.669> there<00:06:14.630> will<00:06:14.720> be<00:06:14.780> no

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
make them for 33 and there will be no

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.529 
make them for 33 and there will be no
connection<00:06:15.590> here<00:06:15.830> so<00:06:16.099> there<00:06:16.220> will<00:06:16.310> be<00:06:16.539> great

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
connection here so there will be great

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.870 
connection here so there will be great
great<00:06:18.080> connection<00:06:18.470> everywhere<00:06:18.590> if<00:06:19.580> they<00:06:19.760> all

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
great connection everywhere if they all

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.460 
great connection everywhere if they all
were<00:06:20.090> in<00:06:20.180> the<00:06:20.270> proper<00:06:20.510> formation<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:21.050> four<00:06:21.260> 33

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
were in the proper formation of four 33

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.640 
were in the proper formation of four 33
there<00:06:21.800> will<00:06:21.889> be<00:06:21.979> 99<00:06:22.340> chemistry<00:06:23.139> but<00:06:24.139> even<00:06:24.320> as

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
there will be 99 chemistry but even as

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.170 
there will be 99 chemistry but even as
four<00:06:24.889> three<00:06:25.070> two<00:06:25.190> one<00:06:25.370> even<00:06:25.729> with<00:06:25.849> this<00:06:25.970> red

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
four three two one even with this red

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.430 
four three two one even with this red
bar<00:06:26.389> there's<00:06:27.020> a<00:06:27.110> medida<00:06:28.010> still<00:06:28.370> has<00:06:29.440> 9

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
bar there's a medida still has 9

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.900 
bar there's a medida still has 9
chemistry<00:06:30.919> everybody<00:06:31.400> in<00:06:31.490> this<00:06:31.550> team<00:06:31.760> has

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
chemistry everybody in this team has

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.690 
chemistry everybody in this team has
nine<00:06:32.150> chemistry<00:06:32.599> which<00:06:32.750> is<00:06:32.870> amazing<00:06:33.550> we<00:06:34.550> have

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
nine chemistry which is amazing we have

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.460 
nine chemistry which is amazing we have
one<00:06:35.300> two<00:06:35.659> three<00:06:35.919> five<00:06:36.919> star<00:06:37.130> scalars<00:06:37.490> and

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
one two three five star scalars and

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.980 
one two three five star scalars and
Lucas<00:06:39.280> four<00:06:39.820> star<00:06:40.090> I'm<00:06:40.570> not<00:06:40.810> sure<00:06:40.960> about

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
Lucas four star I'm not sure about

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.200 
Lucas four star I'm not sure about
Wellington<00:06:41.530> I<00:06:41.620> think<00:06:41.800> he's<00:06:41.890> for<00:06:42.040> sorry<00:06:42.310> so<00:06:43.150> you

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
Wellington I think he's for sorry so you

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.570 
Wellington I think he's for sorry so you
have<00:06:43.420> bunch<00:06:44.260> of<00:06:44.410> force<00:06:44.620> a<00:06:44.680> bunch<00:06:45.130> of<00:06:45.220> four<00:06:45.550> and

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
have bunch of force a bunch of four and

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.340 
have bunch of force a bunch of four and
five<00:06:45.820> stars<00:06:46.060> but<00:06:46.270> Ramires<00:06:46.750> is<00:06:46.930> three<00:06:47.140> sides

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
five stars but Ramires is three sides

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.410 
five stars but Ramires is three sides
but<00:06:47.560> Ramirez<00:06:48.070> is<00:06:48.190> there<00:06:48.370> for<00:06:48.910> the<00:06:48.970> defending

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
but Ramirez is there for the defending

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.100 
but Ramirez is there for the defending
also<00:06:49.770> so<00:06:50.770> this<00:06:51.310> will<00:06:51.460> be<00:06:51.580> about<00:06:51.930> 250,000<00:06:52.930> i

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
also so this will be about 250,000 i

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.560 
also so this will be about 250,000 i
hope<00:06:53.890> you<00:06:54.040> liked<00:06:54.220> it<00:06:54.340> if<00:06:54.580> it<00:06:55.240> would<00:06:55.330> be<00:06:55.390> nice<00:06:55.540> if

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
hope you liked it if it would be nice if

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.240 
hope you liked it if it would be nice if
you<00:06:55.780> leave<00:06:55.990> a<00:06:56.020> like<00:06:56.520> thanks<00:06:57.520> bye
