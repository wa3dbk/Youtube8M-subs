00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.600
 hello my love 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.390
 Here we are again our second video 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.930
 were senders yes we are we produce 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.340
 in record and always not quiet the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.840
 has an awful lot of questions and we have 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.420
 will work it all off 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 we start with our ten golden ones 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.480
 regulate or 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 with our golden rule number one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.600
 and that's almost the most important 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.710
 that's why they are the number for us 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.140
 one never authenticity you dress 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.559
 are what you wear so wear what you do 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.510
 I would like to be in other words 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.410
 learn to know Finland 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.940
 where you stand now many would say 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.489
 okay you both are not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.770
 just against the paradigm for 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 license and not disguised but that 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.649
 are we 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.320
 these are our personalities we 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.880
 like that and we would not be anyone 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.560
 force others to run around as well 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.460
 So who knows our work, we know each other 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.990
 he has followed white 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.580
 we expect that the people on the one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.869
 That's the key point 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.159
 no longer be what it is not about 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.049
 someone his own style 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.600
 imprint but to grasp how the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.640
 person is ticking and there the right style 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.040
 also for the habitat in which the one 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.080
 to find yourself moving or you too 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.659
 So we will have a process 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.400
 long needed to find ourselves 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.150
 you try out one is sometimes 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.490
 Besides 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.009
 so he has mine there are also quite 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.110
 both of us have one or the other 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.240
 Pictures from the past where we are too 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 looked and tried differently 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.130
 So that's what they're for now 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.360
 maybe 8 19 years old that's one 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.100
 few events have been 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.780
 yes there are a few years now 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.850
 Drawn into the country and traffic 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.040
 not had tragic but 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.250
 you see we have there still such a 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.250
 bit more tussi alarm and also a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.720
 I send a bit of latin lover though 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520
 these 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.810
 the flap with the pinstripe 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.650

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.430
 peak current confused me today as well 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.690
 do not wear anymore 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.670
 but who knows maybe there was still 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.140
 unnatural the super but that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.150
 So try to know that seems 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.610
 Do not be afraid and just go out 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.530

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.660

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.820
 These are just a few inspirations from 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.200
 different fashion weeks and occurs 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.740
 obviously, summer is here 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.710

 mini show or no pantyhose 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.150

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.420
 I'm a little bumpy and too 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.730
 But I also like the love we want 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.970
 Where does your life take place? 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.130
 you are between kita job and 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.959
 household somehow on the way then must 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.970
 it was not that unusual 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.640
 lives the big city in the small town 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.650
 everything that helps your personality 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.050
 express and you still express yourself 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.760
 probably always feels good in yours 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.670
 environment yes that may be one 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.620
 little bit the essence of the whole 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.090
 Inspiration inspiration is the deciding factor 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.830
 because sometimes lack the basic of this 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.610
 look and you do not know what could 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.590
 because be beautiful 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.030
 There are a lot of pages there are 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.830
 crazy as the magazines he goes to 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.630
 for example, on bitter this is one 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.150
 you can actually do it here for everyone 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.709
 Enter term and you will find hundreds 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.930
 from photos inspiration to possibilities 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.160
 Just to see what I can do 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.049
 because nice and if you found me 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.150
 he says that if I actually 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.549
 you can cool on that side even 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.290
 All you just pinned the fin 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.120
 push on it if you can do that in 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.420
 collect albums and has as 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.290
 inspiration in a virtual folder 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.239
 Great I have here for example 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.010
 street style fashion week 2015 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.480
 but you really can 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.430
 if you are interested then then there 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.320
 up there in anime or anime skirts 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.090
 or whatever all come so 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.770
 many pictures you can do it very easy 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.250
 you also have no peasy collection 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.560
 space tens people in each case 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.540
 no power is so a great tip me 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.650
 think it's so great so you mean 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.570
 easy peasy is better than the cost 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:28.390
 let's say that yes yes 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.280
 I do not care if it's about having fun 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.290
 and that it is soon going to decide 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.450
 out you have fun and find 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.140
 yourselves of in the end is the way 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.780
 the goal 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.100
 and if I leave that then stands and 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.540
 rwe can also make fun of the power 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.870
 super fun when do not leave for us 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.080
 I have of any people 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.960
 occupied because the green ones got silver 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.610
 and most of the time they are somehow 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.990
 just somehow or not 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.940
 they have been completely understood by them too 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.169
 do not get it or not ourselves 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.180
 have to cry through 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.680
 you 'll have to tingle on her 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.400
 just great but do not let you 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.610

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.130
 listen to your heart you know so you 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.380

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.470
 yourself what do you want to be now 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.450
 To finish , a grandiose picture 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.800
 what they both found what they believe 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.780
 I'm three months after you 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.850
 come together about pages 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.120
 has arisen and this makes a picture 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.120
 a little bit bigger 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.430
 Nobody can see that 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.410
 just this picture because we are exactly again 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.720

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.580
 said three months after you can completely 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.530
 We can easily calculate that is now 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.530
 in the year you are now 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.960
