it might be a better week to do the hate

it might be a better week to do the hate
live<00:05:25.820> podcast<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.750> then<00:05:27.110> maybe<00:05:27.260> I<00:05:27.349> can<00:05:27.590> have

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
live podcast and then maybe I can have

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.300
