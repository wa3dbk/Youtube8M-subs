learned a tremendous amount about the

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.029 
learned a tremendous amount about the
SKF<00:00:10.510> beyond<00:00:10.780> zero<00:00:11.080> initiative<00:00:11.379> but<00:00:11.889> I'd

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:12.039 
SKF beyond zero initiative but I'd

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.350 
SKF beyond zero initiative but I'd
really<00:00:12.219> like<00:00:12.430> for<00:00:12.490> you<00:00:12.639> to<00:00:12.730> talk<00:00:12.940> to<00:00:13.000> me<00:00:13.240> about

means to you I mean beyond zero is an

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.920 
means to you I mean beyond zero is an
integral<00:00:17.440> part<00:00:17.500> of<00:00:17.920> a<00:00:18.100> climate<00:00:19.090> strategy<00:00:19.510> it's

few<00:00:52.780> years<00:00:53.020> ago<00:00:53.200> I<00:00:53.350> actually<00:00:53.739> attended<00:00:54.340> a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
few years ago I actually attended a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.049 
few years ago I actually attended a
seminar<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:55.600> listen<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:57.010> presentation<00:00:57.460> and

seminar and listen to a presentation and

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.130 
seminar and listen to a presentation and
what<00:00:58.180> was<00:00:58.300> happening<00:00:58.660> with<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.899> environment

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
what was happening with the environment

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.900 
what was happening with the environment
what<00:00:59.530> was<00:00:59.620> happening<00:00:59.860> we<00:00:59.920> co2<00:01:00.340> emissions<00:01:00.760> etc

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
what was happening we co2 emissions etc

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.150 
what was happening we co2 emissions etc
and<00:01:01.600> what<00:01:02.020> was<00:01:02.140> likely<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.559> happen<00:01:02.829> going

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
and what was likely to happen going

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.580 
and what was likely to happen going
forward<00:01:03.250> but<00:01:03.670> actually<00:01:04.000> I<00:01:04.210> then<00:01:04.569> also<00:01:04.749> held<00:01:05.199> a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
forward but actually I then also held a

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.230 
forward but actually I then also held a
phrase<00:01:06.249> from<00:01:06.459> some<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.759> which<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:06.969> thought<00:01:07.090> was

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
phrase from some of which I thought was

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.870 
phrase from some of which I thought was
very<00:01:07.389> importantly<00:01:08.049> said<00:01:08.289> that<00:01:09.249> that<00:01:09.609> we're

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
very importantly said that that we're

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.239 
very importantly said that that we're
the<00:01:10.179> first<00:01:10.719> generation<00:01:11.049> to<00:01:11.979> really

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
the first generation to really

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:15.389 
the first generation to really
understand<00:01:12.969> climate<00:01:13.389> change<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:15.159> last

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
understand climate change and the last

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.370 
understand climate change and the last
generation<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.119> do<00:01:16.240> something<00:01:16.569> about<00:01:16.689> it<00:01:16.840> and

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
generation to do something about it and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.199 
generation to do something about it and
I<00:01:17.770> felt<00:01:18.039> that<00:01:18.189> was<00:01:18.340> an<00:01:18.399> important<00:01:18.939> thing<00:01:19.179> for

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:19.209 
I felt that was an important thing for

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.629 
I felt that was an important thing for
us<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.689> could<00:01:19.779> help<00:01:19.929> drive<00:01:20.170> or<00:01:21.039> initiative<00:01:21.520> in

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:21.639 
us and could help drive or initiative in

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:23.760 
us and could help drive or initiative in
this<00:01:21.759> area<00:01:21.939> and<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.149> felt<00:01:22.179> that<00:01:22.450> wees<00:01:22.749> SKF<00:01:23.259> could

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
this area and I felt that wees SKF could

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.440 
this area and I felt that wees SKF could
make<00:01:23.889> a<00:01:23.920> difference<00:01:24.279> in<00:01:24.399> this<00:01:24.490> area<00:01:24.789> so<00:01:24.969> but

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
make a difference in this area so but

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.629 
make a difference in this area so but
that's<00:01:25.689> what<00:01:25.929> drove<00:01:26.619> us<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.249> if<00:01:27.369> your<00:01:27.490> customer

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:27.639 
that's what drove us so if your customer

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:29.609 
that's what drove us so if your customer
has<00:01:27.909> been<00:01:28.090> there<00:01:28.569> they<00:01:28.719> engaged<00:01:29.109> in<00:01:29.319> this<00:01:29.469> so

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
has been there they engaged in this so

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.129 
has been there they engaged in this so
they<00:01:29.770> fired<00:01:30.340> up<00:01:30.520> excited<00:01:30.909> about<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.389> let

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:32.139 
they fired up excited about it I let

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:33.899 
they fired up excited about it I let
those<00:01:32.289> different<00:01:32.649> customer<00:01:33.130> reactions<00:01:33.759> of

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
those different customer reactions of

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.370 
those different customer reactions of
course<00:01:34.090> but<00:01:34.209> more<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.630> more<00:01:34.719> you're<00:01:35.079> seeing

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
course but more and more you're seeing

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.910 
course but more and more you're seeing
customers<00:01:36.099> interested<00:01:36.939> in<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.209> and<00:01:37.389> I<00:01:37.450> think

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
customers interested in this and I think

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.309 
customers interested in this and I think
whether<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.099> believe<00:01:39.490> in<00:01:39.880> climate<00:01:40.689> change<00:01:41.139> in

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
whether you believe in climate change in

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.039 
must believe is energy efficiency is
important<00:01:57.219> and<00:01:57.310> energy<00:01:57.669> efficiency<00:01:58.149> it<00:01:58.840> means

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
important and energy efficiency it means

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.449 
important and energy efficiency it means
you're<00:01:59.200> reducing<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.889> impact<00:01:59.950> on<00:02:00.340> the

from<00:02:16.250> our<00:02:16.400> customers<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.300> understand<00:02:17.720> how

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
from our customers so I understand how

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.780 
from our customers so I understand how
beyond<00:02:18.170> zero<00:02:18.440> affects<00:02:18.890> your<00:02:19.069> customers<00:02:19.580> but

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
beyond zero affects your customers but

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.820 
beyond zero affects your customers but
how<00:02:19.880> does<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.180> affect<00:02:20.480> your<00:02:20.569> suppliers<00:02:20.989> it's

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
how does it affect your suppliers it's

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.229 
how does it affect your suppliers it's
important<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.220> them<00:02:22.280> as<00:02:22.489> well<00:02:22.520> because<00:02:23.060> we

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
important for them as well because we

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.630 
important for them as well because we
look<00:02:23.450> at<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.840> full<00:02:24.440> value<00:02:24.620> chain<00:02:25.040> when<00:02:25.489> we're

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
look at the full value chain when we're

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.300 
look at the full value chain when we're
working<00:02:25.819> on<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:27.290> environmental<00:02:27.680> strategy

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
working on the environmental strategy

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.250 
working on the environmental strategy
it's<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.760> life<00:02:28.940> cycle<00:02:29.209> approach<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.110> it's

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
it's a life cycle approach so it's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.770 
it's a life cycle approach so it's
everything<00:02:30.770> from<00:02:31.069> where<00:02:31.580> we<00:02:31.850> get<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> steal

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
everything from where we get a steal

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.660 
everything from where we get a steal
from<00:02:33.110> all<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.860> way<00:02:33.980> through<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.340> how<00:02:34.610> we

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
from all the way through to how we

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.760 
from all the way through to how we
recycle<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.390> products<00:02:35.780> there<00:02:35.959> just<00:02:36.410> apply<00:02:36.530> as

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
recycle the products there just apply as

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.530 
recycle the products there just apply as
an<00:02:37.010> important<00:02:37.610> part<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.090> when<00:02:38.239> we<00:02:38.390> look

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
an important part of that when we look

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.500 
an important part of that when we look
at<00:02:38.720> energy<00:02:39.560> consumption<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:40.519> SKF<00:02:41.000> for<00:02:41.209> co2

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
at energy consumption for SKF for co2

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.020 
at energy consumption for SKF for co2
emissions<00:02:41.989> for<00:02:42.380> SKF<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:43.310> look<00:02:43.489> not<00:02:43.700> only<00:02:43.760> what

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
emissions for SKF we look not only what

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.820 
emissions for SKF we look not only what
we<00:02:44.120> do<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.360> our<00:02:44.450> facilities<00:02:45.019> but<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.560> look<00:02:45.680> for

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
we do in our facilities but we look for

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.949 
we do in our facilities but we look for
suppliers<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.459> pipes<00:02:46.670> are<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.269> require

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
suppliers and pipes are so we require

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.110 
suppliers and pipes are so we require
our<00:02:48.170> suppliers<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.980> have<00:02:49.370> an<00:02:49.489> environmental

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
our suppliers to have an environmental

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.850 
our suppliers to have an environmental
strategy<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.230> be<00:02:51.319> working<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.709> reduce

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
strategy and to be working to reduce

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.979 
strategy and to be working to reduce
their<00:02:52.220> environmental<00:02:52.489> impacts<00:02:53.239> ago<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.840> this

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
their environmental impacts ago so this

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.630 
their environmental impacts ago so this
initiative<00:02:54.500> has<00:02:54.590> been<00:02:55.069> going<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.370> for<00:02:55.430> how

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
initiative has been going on for how

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.870 
initiative has been going on for how
long<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.709> sks<00:02:57.709> we<00:02:57.860> always<00:02:58.160> been<00:02:58.340> working<00:02:58.700> in

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
long the sks we always been working in

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.550 
long the sks we always been working in
to<00:02:59.180> be<00:02:59.299> more<00:02:59.540> environment<00:03:00.049> different<00:03:00.410> Demi

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
to be more environment different Demi

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.199 
to be more environment different Demi
basically<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.340> building's<00:03:01.790> about<00:03:01.970> reducing

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
basically a building's about reducing

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.910 
basically a building's about reducing
friction<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.200> it's<00:03:03.350> about<00:03:03.440> being<00:03:03.709> more

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
friction so it's about being more

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.140 
friction so it's about being more
environmentally<00:03:04.610> friendly<00:03:04.640> more

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
environmentally friendly more

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.570 
environmentally friendly more
energy-efficient<00:03:05.900> anyway<00:03:06.230> but<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.069> specific

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
energy-efficient anyway but the specific

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.280 
energy-efficient anyway but the specific
beyond<00:03:07.850> zero<00:03:08.150> initiative<00:03:08.450> started<00:03:08.690> back<00:03:09.260> in

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
beyond zero initiative started back in

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.460 
beyond zero initiative started back in
2005<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.700> was<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> put<00:03:11.690> together<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.049> young<00:03:12.200> team

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
2005 it was a put together a young team

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.590 
2005 it was a put together a young team
of<00:03:12.739> people<00:03:12.980> from<00:03:13.430> our<00:03:13.580> own<00:03:13.670> desk<00:03:14.030> F<00:03:14.150> group<00:03:14.390> and

something more and they say that what
could<00:03:21.260> we<00:03:21.350> do<00:03:21.500> they<00:03:22.010> came<00:03:22.160> up<00:03:22.220> with<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.400> strategy

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
could we do they came up with a strategy

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.330 
could we do they came up with a strategy
and<00:03:23.000> said<00:03:23.600> hey<00:03:23.840> we<00:03:24.320> can<00:03:24.500> go<00:03:24.620> beyond<00:03:24.890> zero<00:03:25.220> and

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and said hey we can go beyond zero and

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.310 
and said hey we can go beyond zero and
explain<00:03:25.730> what<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.000> meant<00:03:26.150> about<00:03:26.690> reducing<00:03:27.019> our

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
explain what it meant about reducing our

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.560 
explain what it meant about reducing our
environmental<00:03:27.769> impact<00:03:28.430> at<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.000> same<00:03:29.269> time

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
environmental impact at the same time

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.110 
environmental impact at the same time
it's<00:03:30.079> helping<00:03:30.440> our<00:03:30.560> customers<00:03:30.739> improve<00:03:31.609> their

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
it's helping our customers improve their

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.479 
it's helping our customers improve their
environmental<00:03:32.720> impact<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.769> that<00:03:33.890> we<00:03:34.010> make<00:03:34.459> a

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
environmental impact so that we make a

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.220 
environmental impact so that we make a
positive<00:03:34.790> contribution<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.780> Bible<00:03:36.049> and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
positive contribution to the Bible and

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.259 
positive contribution to the Bible and
other<00:03:36.380> was<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.620> great<00:03:37.040> strategy<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:38.060> must

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
other was a great strategy and I must

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.060 
other was a great strategy and I must
say<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.510> was<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.690> great<00:03:39.530> name<00:03:39.739> they<00:03:39.890> come<00:03:40.010> up

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
say it was a great name they come up

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.710 
say it was a great name they come up
with<00:03:40.100> beyond<00:03:40.459> zero<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.120> we<00:03:41.150> launched<00:03:41.630> our

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
with beyond zero so we launched our

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.860 
with beyond zero so we launched our
internally<00:03:42.320> in<00:03:42.530> there<00:03:42.890> in<00:03:43.070> March<00:03:43.400> 2005<00:03:44.090> how<00:03:44.810> do

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
internally in there in March 2005 how do

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.930 
internally in there in March 2005 how do
you<00:03:45.019> see<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.260> BR<00:03:45.560> 0<00:03:45.920> initiative<00:03:46.400> moving<00:03:46.700> into

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
you see the BR 0 initiative moving into

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.520 
you see the BR 0 initiative moving into
the<00:03:47.060> future<00:03:47.239> you<00:03:47.570> see<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> continued<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.410> grow

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
continuously working internally we've

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.610 
continuously working internally we've
not<00:03:53.450> only<00:03:53.480> looked<00:03:53.900> at<00:03:54.049> how<00:03:54.170> we<00:03:54.230> can<00:03:54.470> be<00:03:54.590> more

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
not only looked at how we can be more

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.650 
not only looked at how we can be more
energy<00:03:55.070> efficient<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.579> facilities<00:03:56.090> we've

ago<00:04:24.110> we<00:04:24.349> launched<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.860> beyond<00:04:25.490> zero

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
ago we launched the beyond zero

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.129 
ago we launched the beyond zero

years if you look at what's happening in

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.409 
years if you look at what's happening in
fuel<00:04:51.830> efficiency<00:04:51.949> in<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.610> vehicles<00:04:52.999> it

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
fuel efficiency in the vehicles it

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.209 
fuel efficiency in the vehicles it
really<00:04:53.900> is<00:04:54.080> quite<00:04:54.139> remarkable<00:04:54.469> and<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:55.039> must

really is quite remarkable and I must

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:56.980 
really is quite remarkable and I must
say<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.430> personally<00:04:56.330> don't<00:04:56.449> think<00:04:56.599> the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
say I personally don't think the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.510 
say I personally don't think the
automotive<00:04:57.439> industry<00:04:57.529> gets<00:04:58.219> enough<00:04:58.490> credit

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
automotive industry gets enough credit

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.070 
automotive industry gets enough credit
for<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.360> changes<00:04:59.629> they've<00:04:59.750> made<00:04:59.779> over<00:05:00.050> the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
for the changes they've made over the

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.769 
for the changes they've made over the
last<00:05:00.169> five<00:05:00.529> ten<00:05:00.860> years<00:05:01.210> going<00:05:02.210> forward<00:05:02.479> I

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:02.779 
last five ten years going forward I

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.330 
last five ten years going forward I
think<00:05:02.840> there<00:05:03.379> will<00:05:03.469> be<00:05:03.529> three<00:05:03.889> fates<00:05:04.159> of

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
think there will be three fates of

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.219 
think there will be three fates of
driving<00:05:04.639> lanes<00:05:04.819> and<00:05:05.000> vehicles<00:05:05.689> they'll<00:05:06.199> be

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
driving lanes and vehicles they'll be

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.959 
driving lanes and vehicles they'll be
the<00:05:06.560> traditional<00:05:07.039> engines<00:05:07.430> which<00:05:07.789> will

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:07.969 
the traditional engines which will

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.610 
the traditional engines which will
become<00:05:08.210> more<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:08.659> more<00:05:08.719> fuel<00:05:09.050> efficient<00:05:09.529> as

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
become more and more fuel efficient as

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.399 
become more and more fuel efficient as
they<00:05:09.680> use<00:05:10.210> supercharger<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.419> use<00:05:11.629> different

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
they use supercharger to use different

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.709 
they use supercharger to use different
technologies<00:05:13.219> there<00:05:13.430> there<00:05:14.000> will<00:05:14.120> be<00:05:14.150> hybrid

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
technologies there there will be hybrid

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:16.269 
technologies there there will be hybrid
vehicles<00:05:15.139> the<00:05:15.469> combination<00:05:15.830> between

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:16.279 
vehicles the combination between

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.279 
vehicles the combination between
electric<00:05:16.849> and<00:05:17.029> maybe<00:05:17.389> smaller<00:05:17.719> engines<00:05:18.139> and

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
electric and maybe smaller engines and

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.769 
electric and maybe smaller engines and
then<00:05:18.650> with<00:05:18.740> fully<00:05:18.949> electric<00:05:19.400> vehicles<00:05:19.819> sks

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:20.779 
then with fully electric vehicles sks

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.600 
then with fully electric vehicles sks
gotten<00:05:21.050> portable<00:05:21.589> to<00:05:21.830> play<00:05:22.039> and<00:05:22.219> all<00:05:22.279> three<00:05:22.580> of

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
gotten portable to play and all three of

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.959 
gotten portable to play and all three of
these<00:05:22.789> drive<00:05:23.060> to<00:05:23.270> move<00:05:23.539> do<00:05:23.659> that<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.819> SKF<00:05:25.819> is

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
these drive to move do that so SKF is

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.170 
these drive to move do that so SKF is
obviously<00:05:26.330> leading<00:05:27.259> by<00:05:27.409> example<00:05:27.969> but<00:05:28.969> but

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
obviously leading by example but but

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.329 
obviously leading by example but but
outside<00:05:29.569> of<00:05:29.599> SKF<00:05:30.199> there<00:05:30.379> has<00:05:30.589> to<00:05:30.770> be<00:05:30.800> forces

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:31.339 
outside of SKF there has to be forces

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:32.320 
outside of SKF there has to be forces
that<00:05:31.520> are<00:05:31.639> trying<00:05:31.819> to<00:05:32.029> move<00:05:32.210> the

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
that are trying to move the

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.779 
that are trying to move the
sustainability<00:05:32.900> issue<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:34.069> the<00:05:34.099> forefront<00:05:34.189> is

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
sustainability issue to the forefront is

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.519 
sustainability issue to the forefront is
that<00:05:35.300> coming<00:05:35.629> from<00:05:35.659> industry<00:05:36.169> is<00:05:36.289> it<00:05:36.409> coming

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
that coming from industry is it coming

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:38.230 
that coming from industry is it coming
from<00:05:36.650> government<00:05:37.250> is<00:05:37.370> it<00:05:37.819> coming<00:05:37.969> from<00:05:38.060> the

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
from government is it coming from the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.269 
from government is it coming from the
consumer<00:05:38.810> or<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.139> collection<00:05:39.770> of<00:05:39.919> all<00:05:40.099> those

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
consumer or is a collection of all those

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:43.149 
consumer or is a collection of all those
things<00:05:40.550> I<00:05:40.759> think<00:05:41.210> it's<00:05:41.449> a<00:05:41.860> there's<00:05:42.860> not<00:05:42.949> enough

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
things I think it's a there's not enough

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.950 
things I think it's a there's not enough
consumer<00:05:43.639> pool<00:05:43.939> at<00:05:44.149> the<00:05:44.180> moment<00:05:44.449> I<00:05:44.539> feel<00:05:44.779> I

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
consumer pool at the moment I feel I

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.659 
consumer pool at the moment I feel I
feel<00:05:45.229> that<00:05:45.649> we<00:05:45.770> could<00:05:45.949> do<00:05:46.099> more<00:05:46.310> from<00:05:46.580> a

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
feel that we could do more from a

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.249 
feel that we could do more from a
consumer<00:05:47.120> viewpoint<00:05:47.569> to<00:05:47.719> actually<00:05:48.020> cool

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
consumer viewpoint to actually cool

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.920 
consumer viewpoint to actually cool
things<00:05:48.560> things<00:05:49.250> through<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.789> I<00:05:50.539> think<00:05:50.779> that's

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
things things through and I think that's

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.510 
things things through and I think that's
need<00:05:51.199> I<00:05:51.379> think<00:05:51.589> governments<00:05:52.039> are<00:05:52.129> trying<00:05:52.399> to

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
need I think governments are trying to

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.360 
need I think governments are trying to
do<00:05:52.639> things<00:05:52.909> but<00:05:53.389> too<00:05:53.689> often<00:05:53.930> this<00:05:54.740> gets<00:05:55.069> a

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
do things but too often this gets a

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.490 
do things but too often this gets a
mixed<00:05:55.849> up<00:05:56.000> in<00:05:56.149> all<00:05:56.240> sorts<00:05:56.300> of<00:05:56.750> debates<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.379> all

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
mixed up in all sorts of debates and all

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.519 
mixed up in all sorts of debates and all
sorts<00:05:57.830> of<00:05:57.949> deals<00:05:58.490> there<00:05:59.270> so<00:05:59.719> we<00:05:59.960> an<00:06:00.050> industry<00:06:00.500> I

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
sorts of deals there so we an industry I

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.019 
sorts of deals there so we an industry I
think<00:06:00.560> of<00:06:00.979> I've<00:06:01.310> got<00:06:01.520> to<00:06:01.639> be<00:06:01.759> one<00:06:01.879> of<00:06:01.909> the

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
think of I've got to be one of the

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.820 
think of I've got to be one of the
leaders<00:06:02.210> and<00:06:02.509> doing<00:06:02.719> this<00:06:02.870> but<00:06:03.379> we<00:06:03.529> do<00:06:03.680> need

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
leaders and doing this but we do need

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.129 
leaders and doing this but we do need
government<00:06:04.219> support<00:06:04.610> because<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:05.750> economy

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
government support because the economy

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.499 
government support because the economy
is<00:06:06.169> global<00:06:06.699> but<00:06:07.699> the<00:06:07.909> environment<00:06:08.419> is

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
is global but the environment is

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:09.879 
is global but the environment is
definitely<00:06:08.899> global<00:06:09.229> and<00:06:09.349> whilst<00:06:09.589> you<00:06:09.740> can

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
definitely global and whilst you can

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.829 
definitely global and whilst you can
look<00:06:10.069> at<00:06:10.189> things<00:06:10.430> like<00:06:10.550> trade<00:06:11.000> barriers<00:06:11.539> and

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:11.839 
look at things like trade barriers and

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.659 
look at things like trade barriers and
different<00:06:12.500> ways<00:06:12.649> to<00:06:12.680> try<00:06:13.039> and<00:06:13.159> manage<00:06:13.279> trade

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
different ways to try and manage trade

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.480 
different ways to try and manage trade
you<00:06:14.120> cannot<00:06:14.509> manage<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.289> floor<00:06:15.560> of<00:06:15.800> the

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
you cannot manage the floor of the

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.639 
you cannot manage the floor of the
atmosphere<00:06:16.610> own<00:06:17.419> so<00:06:17.689> therefore<00:06:18.139> from<00:06:18.409> that

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:18.649 
atmosphere own so therefore from that

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:21.369 
atmosphere own so therefore from that
viewpoint<00:06:18.889> we<00:06:19.250> need<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:20.139> some<00:06:21.139> global

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
viewpoint we need a some global

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.339 
viewpoint we need a some global
