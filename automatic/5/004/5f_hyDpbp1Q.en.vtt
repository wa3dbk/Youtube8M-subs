a sort of seriously get you just off

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.660 
a sort of seriously get you just off
balance<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> word<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.220> and<00:00:53.340> never<00:00:53.550> go

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
balance and the word go and never go

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
balance and the word go and never go
never<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.180> into<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> race<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.989> hoping

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
never get into the race and I'm hoping

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.110 
never get into the race and I'm hoping
that<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> reason<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> tests<00:00:57.030> were

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
that was the reason all the tests were

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119 
that was the reason all the tests were
clear<00:00:57.360> afterwards<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.620> she's<00:00:58.860> being

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
clear afterwards so she's being

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.500 
clear afterwards so she's being
freshened<00:00:59.519> up<00:00:59.610> for<00:00:59.790> Royal<00:00:59.940> Ascot<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.420> the
