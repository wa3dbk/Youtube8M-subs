00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.970
 Russian operating system and how are we here 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.590
 installed cpu memory and so on from 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.680
 there are 10 participants of the poet’s memory 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.340
 512 ooo use qualcomm msm 7 processor with 2 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.690
 25 is the first generation of these 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 processors 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 and energy consumption rub increased by 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.739
 compared to that 2 27 for example which 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.380
 used in sony ericsson motorola latix 10 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.550
 June for example or a bottle of Muslims 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.210
 this is just the first generation 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.670
 I use windows mobile 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.470
 n version 6 5 professional 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.229
 amg version 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.949
 but let's look at the parameters here and 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.099
 systems here is the actual memory 

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:57.369
 only 340 1 megabyte free 296 there is a card 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:01.129
 memory memory card Mailyan exit 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.270
 The percentage of the system here is still less than 6 5 4 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.530
 test pore com screams the exact name 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.740
 processors arm 11 tver with values ​​2 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.200
 25 just like that 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.479
 Further somewhere here I saw more 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.750
 schegolev but here's the information about the system 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.720
 here from most take the stylus 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.560
 Normally keep qualcomm memory 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.060
 256 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.290
 allowed 512 prizes st 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.030
 display can be viewed 16 bits 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.929
 imagined 240 by 400 pixels 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.819
 But the pro in the wireless module retouch 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.109
 I understand the same center royal club 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.820
 Unfortunately, there is no better surname 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.700
 let's talk about the house 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.220
 the organization is not in the menu here will be 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.050
 presented in two variants, that is, it 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.710
 standard bendov mobile that is to this 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.070
 normal start 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.909
 such here but the menu is standard windows 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.940
 mom pavel 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.160
 m very good that he 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.999
 the percentage is pretty good work 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.359
 this system 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.699
 that is, there is no all news here 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.559
 groups of archaeologists very quickly 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.959
 moves genetics works 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.799
 fine 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.579
 in previous generations of phones 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.589
 on windows phone paul here of course were 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:31.059
 scary pants but also 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.990
 the percentage of the main menu is presented here 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.790
 most frequently run 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.250
 whose applications you can 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.150
 The mood of this case is the Samara phone 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.000
 phonebook then yo menu approach 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.960
 by pushing the sun on 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.689
 a button in the middle of kim 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.829
 if we click on the wheels 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.969
 then we can delete but with the application 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.109
 but 6 and dragged reassigned 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.040
 war will for example we remove the album and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.650
 we can change the label for example May 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.470
 diary so we set geneva 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.810
 romanovsky does not apply as 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.140
 mechanical works 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.160
 demo keys 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.180
 finally the sun on the court panel 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.750
 Mechanical keys of copies of a photo can 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.160
 scroll your fingers clockwise we 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.649
 we go to the right, counterclockwise to the left 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:28.349
 I also like the keys, although to whom 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.699
 as 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.489
 move for example just right and 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.190
 push the booths we fall 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.449
 posts 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:40.739
 we leave 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.870
 and most of all there is nothing special 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.319
 tell the key home that is return 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.679
 occasionally any minimum 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:54.039
 on the home page churov show Windows 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:56.999
 mom pavel how organized but 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.259
 he saw me like that 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.259
 everything is standard as usual 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.799
 we often did not screenshots 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.579
 assigned to this key do 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.979
 screenshot 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:10.589
