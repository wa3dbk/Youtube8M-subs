00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.959
 [Music] 

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.000
 and the cooler first impressions to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.950
 beginning of the chapter we can notice 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 something like a parody of what 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.520
 it happens in government institutions 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.469
 dedicated to the national defense of 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.719
 different countries is like in those 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.120
 movies where the pentagon of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.430
 the us and never miss the general 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.650
 veteran who at all costs sees as unique 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.380
 Attacking solution with all the weaponry 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 possible but hey let's get to 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.670
 theories and curiosities it turns out that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.860
 within the kingdom of fire are found 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 ancestral beings that worked as 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.600
 protective guards of the kingdom of fire 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.370
 in fact they are supposed to be so old 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.430
 that the history of its creation is 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.739
 go back generations ago now here 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 comes interesting as it turns out that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.600
 those ancient guardians apparently 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.180
 they are not gods or supernatural beings 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.980
 but rather very old machines this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.170
 we check it because the sweet 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 princess can open a compartment and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.460
 extract what seems to be the source of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.559
 energy of those machines and for that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.510
 energy has lasted for generations 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.519
 it means that it is a very 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.250
 Powerful energy and the sweet princess 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.960
 want those energy cells either 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.300
 because you want to use them for your 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.580
 benefit or simply because he does not trust 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.710
 in the queen flames as she distrusts 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 She believed that she could use that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.880
 armament to attack the sweet kingdom and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.580
 we do not know the extent of destruction of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.800
 those huge machines but good more 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.720
 forward moneeb he confesses to civil 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.000
 which is the real name of the queen 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.520
 Flame that in fact she is looking for 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.770
 new weapons reserves this is 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 something curious I insist that the sweet 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.510
 princess keeps many secrets 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.210
 of her land without a doubt 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.070
 having lived for just over 800 years 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.899
 enough to know the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.090
 great dangers that lie between 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.770
 the shadows and very likely she 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.990
 he fears that at any moment some 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.899
 old threat go to the sweet kingdom and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 decide to attack him so what are those 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.789
 dark secrets that knows the sweet 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.640
 princess who fears him so much maybe 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.890
 we will never know or yes and almost at the end 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.110
 we can notice that the ice king was the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.450
 causing the cooling of the kingdom of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.550
 fire we do not know if it was in revenge for 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.530
 what happened earlier in your fight 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.970
 with the queen flame or because simple and 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.160
 simply not 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.960
 can deny anything to the sweet princess and 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.790
 she took advantage of that she has the ice king 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.250
 on the forehead are to use their 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.560
 ice powers hehehe and good already to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.690
 end of the episode we can notice how the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.000
 sweet princess has a whole system of 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.160
 Security cameras scattered throughout 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.330
 the land of the us let's see what we can 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.330
 find in those cameras 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.000
 What did you think about this episode? 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.730
 revealing but without leaving us a pain 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.250
 head tell me what do you think of the sweet 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.650
 princess is acting well or is 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.870
 acting wrong it's good to have so many 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.720
 security cameras that will have you 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.300
 so much fear let's hope that those mysteries 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.370
 be resolved shortly I know that this 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.920
 chapter is already something old but as 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.750
 I have always told them to be patient 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.580
 I assure you that in my videos you will find 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.220
 data and theories that very little will 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.890
 noticed by today has been everything we will see 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.140
 in the next video I leave you with the 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.360
 curiosities data and theories that have 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:07.800
