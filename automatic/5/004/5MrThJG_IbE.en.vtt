 other side 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 and the truth 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.700
 under his baton of violence 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.700
 and after being reviewed 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.530
 on day 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.530
 it suits us 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.990
 good very good 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.800
 one minute and a half 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 Leader 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.620
 were four personal and accomplished are 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.770
 goals that one puts life and the caretaker to be able to learn more in fact 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.100
 life one can learn 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.850
 and they are anton academic environment is to get the tools to teach 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.090
 better by how is your education charge and you have to learn more to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.990
 teach better and transmit 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.230
 in the best way 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.230
 pack 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.269
 he left without a doubt in that process port 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.959
 because like all the changes generated by a bit of controversy 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.829
 but this one and that to adapt a new proposal from outsiders to the present 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.259
 you have to use the tools and the form of citations that must be dead 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:45.109
 true 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.200
 necessary I could verify that a mockery is not necessary 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.199
 that you can have this 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:55.269
 reed talks by a hundred colleagues and teachers of the place is distant 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.309
 and feared does not allow you to be able to schedule your time about it the point of view 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:00.199
 labor 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.199
 l allows one to try out activities without question is a 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:06.389
 blindly a different way of learning 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.389
 but I can not help but appreciate this sense 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.339
 there are no limits to be able to learn 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.339
 reading the limits as everything alone for one as a person 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.620
 he thinks he was wrong as a human being can grow 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.979
 and transcend much 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.789
 and now it is before the challenges that there are by globalization the taking of 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:35.929
 technology 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:39.209
 education is not lethal and two personal world 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.359
 one could have even been able to learn more and look for this 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.719
 way of learning in very distant places by branch 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.439
 they are experts 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.499
 different form of signal be but that month
