let's get to some pros and cons on

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
let's get to some pros and cons on
Brandon<00:00:34.170> Coleman<00:00:34.380> first<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.340> think<00:00:35.790> his

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
Brandon Coleman first of all I think his

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.979 
Brandon Coleman first of all I think his
size<00:00:36.239> against<00:00:37.140> 6<00:00:37.410> foot<00:00:37.590> 6<00:00:37.770> 225<00:00:38.870> definitely<00:00:39.870> can

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
size against 6 foot 6 225 definitely can

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.049 
size against 6 foot 6 225 definitely can
box<00:00:40.230> out<00:00:40.469> smaller<00:00:40.829> secondary<00:00:41.430> players<00:00:41.700> his

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
box out smaller secondary players his

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.660 
box out smaller secondary players his
speed<00:00:42.390> definitely<00:00:42.870> compensates<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:44.399> well

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
speed definitely compensates very well

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.760 
speed definitely compensates very well
and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.600> he's<00:00:45.840> able<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and I think you know he's able to you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.920 
and I think you know he's able to you
know<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.520> those<00:00:47.579> guys<00:00:47.820> who<00:00:47.879> could<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
know be one of those guys who could go a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
know be one of those guys who could go a
bit<00:00:49.710> earlier<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> draft<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.149> his

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
bit earlier in the draft because of his

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.770 
bit earlier in the draft because of his
speed<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.719> size<00:00:51.989> combination<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.949> believe<00:00:53.399> his

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
speed and size combination I believe his

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.040 
speed and size combination I believe his

effect<00:01:39.509> where<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.619> whatever<00:01:40.829> reason<00:01:41.340> there

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
effect where for whatever reason there

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.039 
effect where for whatever reason there
were<00:01:41.549> some<00:01:41.820> easy<00:01:42.090> balls<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.600> he<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.869> not

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
were some easy balls that he was not

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
were some easy balls that he was not
able<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.470> catch<00:01:43.649> should<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> reel<00:01:44.490> them<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.759> but

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
able to catch should a reel them in but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
able to catch should a reel them in but
he<00:01:45.090> did<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.450> his<00:01:45.780> route<00:01:45.990> tree<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.950> read

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
he did not his route tree I kind of read

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859 
he did not his route tree I kind of read
somewhere<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.180> he<00:01:48.299> hasn't

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
somewhere that you know he hasn't

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.170 
somewhere that you know he hasn't
experienced<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.470> complete<00:01:49.860> route<00:01:50.100> tree<00:01:50.430> so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
experienced a complete route tree so

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.550 
experienced a complete route tree so
he'd<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.659> work<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.290> he<00:01:52.380> heads

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
he'd have to work on that if he heads

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.330 
he'd have to work on that if he heads
into<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> NFL<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:55.560> overall<00:01:55.860> Brandon

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
into the NFL but I think overall Brandon

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
into the NFL but I think overall Brandon
Coleman<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> receiver

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
Coleman is going to be a receiver

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
Coleman is going to be a receiver
drafted<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.200> his<00:01:58.350> size<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.920> his<00:01:58.979> speed

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
drafted for his size and his speed

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 
drafted for his size and his speed
combination<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.360> he<00:02:00.840> could<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.380> early<00:02:01.590> as

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
combination and he could go as early as

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.260 
combination and he could go as early as
the<00:02:02.009> third<00:02:02.189> round<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.880> third<00:02:03.119> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the third round I think that third of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.969 
the third round I think that third of
fourth<00:02:03.479> round<00:02:03.719> range<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.140> probably<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.619> healthy

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
fourth round range is probably a healthy

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.029 
fourth round range is probably a healthy
projection<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:07.350> now<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> lot<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> teams

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
projection and right now a lot of teams

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.770 
projection and right now a lot of teams
of<00:02:08.190> interest<00:02:08.520> could<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:09.030> possibility<00:02:09.569> just

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
of interest could be possibility just

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.510 
of interest could be possibility just
because<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.259> lot<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.649> teams<00:02:10.920> need<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> receiver

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
because a lot of teams need a receiver

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.330 
because a lot of teams need a receiver
and<00:02:11.790> Brandon<00:02:12.510> Coleman<00:02:12.690> is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
and Brandon Coleman is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.820 
and Brandon Coleman is
re<00:02:13.459> attractive<00:02:14.060> because<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.290> his<00:02:15.410> height<00:02:15.620> and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
re attractive because of his height and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.710 
re attractive because of his height and
his<00:02:15.920> speed<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.459> his<00:02:16.700> size<00:02:17.000> I'm<00:02:17.300> gonna<00:02:17.480> you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
know have to keep reiterating that but

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.830 
know have to keep reiterating that but
you<00:02:19.790> know<00:02:19.819> he<00:02:20.000> could<00:02:20.180> be<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.330> guy<00:02:20.510> who<00:02:20.569> could

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.800 
you know he could be a guy who could

and I kind of liked what I saw but again

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.289 
and I kind of liked what I saw but again
he<00:02:37.040> needs<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.310> work<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.640> things<00:02:37.879> there<00:02:38.150> and

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
he needs to work on things there and

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.460 
he needs to work on things there and
this<00:02:38.360> cons<00:02:38.629> he<00:02:38.780> needs<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.049> polish<00:02:39.349> those

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
this cons he needs to polish those

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.690 
this cons he needs to polish those
things<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:39.799> also<00:02:40.040> one<00:02:40.220> last<00:02:40.400> thing<00:02:40.549> on

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
things and also one last thing on

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.759 
things and also one last thing on
Brandon<00:02:41.030> Coleman<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.510> very<00:02:42.110> good<00:02:42.290> guy<00:02:42.440> off<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
Brandon Coleman a very good guy off the

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.890 
Brandon Coleman a very good guy off the
field<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.129> think<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.580> read<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.120> he<00:02:44.720> was<00:02:44.870> a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
field I think I read that he was a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.140 
field I think I read that he was a
player<00:02:45.140> who<00:02:45.470> has<00:02:46.190> no<00:02:46.430> off-the-field<00:02:46.849> issues

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
player who has no off-the-field issues

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.870 
player who has no off-the-field issues
no<00:02:47.720> red<00:02:47.959> flags<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.680> also<00:02:49.250> his<00:02:49.400> injury<00:02:49.760> history

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
no red flags and also his injury history

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.460 
no red flags and also his injury history
I<00:02:50.120> think<00:02:50.360> he<00:02:50.450> tweaked<00:02:50.750> his<00:02:50.870> knee<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.140> little<00:02:51.230> bit

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
I think he tweaked his knee a little bit

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.759 
I think he tweaked his knee a little bit
earlier<00:02:51.799> in<00:02:52.519> 2013<00:02:53.090> but<00:02:53.420> overall<00:02:54.170> didn't

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
earlier in 2013 but overall didn't

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.620 
earlier in 2013 but overall didn't
really<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.130> an<00:02:55.250> injury<00:02:55.610> history<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:56.090> well<00:02:56.299> so

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
really have an injury history as well so

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.839 
really have an injury history as well so
you<00:02:57.140> know<00:02:57.260> overall<00:02:57.560> could<00:02:57.890> be<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> pretty

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
you know overall could be a pretty

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.819 
you know overall could be a pretty
polished<00:02:59.450> player<00:02:59.810> going<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.379> with<00:03:00.560> not<00:03:00.709> too

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
polished player going in with not too

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.699 
polished player going in with not too
many<00:03:00.920> concerns<00:03:01.599> we'll<00:03:02.599> see<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.200> liked<00:03:03.530> what
