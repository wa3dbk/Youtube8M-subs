00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.360
 we will work today on 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.750
 the chapter of geometry in 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.459
 space 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.770
 we will be interested in the first notions 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.790
 which concerns straight lines and plans this 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.740
 are some reminders that you 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.939
 know probably then know when 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.680
 same as this chapter falls 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.279
 systematically to the tests of 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.199
 baccalaureate 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.090
 you will have to prepare well 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.600
 look a little closer at these 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.420
 Notions 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.100
 in space we can define a straight line 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.110
 in many ways these are notions 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.180
 that you obviously know by 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.920
 two distinct points we observe here 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 that ib are distinct there is a 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.140
 single right that will go through these two 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.970
 points another way and choose a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.640
 point is a director vector a 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.670
 vector that will give a direction to you 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.890
 see here with your streets with a point to 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.290
 of space well all these defines 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.750
 a right we can see them two more 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.460
 particular ways when we will see the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.019
 plan concept a right can 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.580
 maybe the intersection of two shots 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.400
 these are notions that we will see a little 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.650
 little later we will be interested in 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.620
 present to the concept of plan and see 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.010
 some properties of these plans a plan 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.659
 of space there again several ways 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.640
 to define it I chose three but 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.680
 you will see that over the exercises we 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.320
 can define a plan of many others 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.630
 ways the most intuitive way and the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.250
 simpler is to choose three points 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.570
 not aligned obviously if the points 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.659
 will be aligned you have a straight 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.579
 look at the points lowered here are going to 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.860
 determine a plane then in space 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.049
 are used to represent a plan of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.430
 this way there very often the shovel p 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.409
 to convince you 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.060
 take your fingers you take your three 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.570
 fingers that are three fixed points of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.250
 the space you see that using a 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.380
 sheet or less here I have a slate 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.850
 you can see that we define a plan 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.100
 not leave if you choose another 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.420
 position for your three fingers well 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.990
 you will have one more plans but who 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.990
 is unique 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.570
 we can also define a plan with a 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.000
 right that I named here delta and a 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.069
 point outside there again you can 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.810
 convince yourself by using 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.940
 example a pen and an outside point 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.190
 the pen acts as the right 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.890
 and then your finger will serve as the point 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.569
 and you will see that only one plan will pass 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.819
 by this line containing this point 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.230
 you're still another way 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.940
 although there are many others 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.680
 it's taking two vectors 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.390
 will call the plan director vectors 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.489
 it is important that these two vectors 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.560
 do not be linear because then you 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.830
 have only one right and finally of course 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.440
 a point that I called not here here 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.220
 there are other ways once again of 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.989
 define a plan 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.510
 I think especially I tell you to 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.250
 spoken with two parallel lines that 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.810
 define a plan or right is 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.330
 when still who will define a plan 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.500
 all these notions been seen since the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.120
 beginning of your high school years 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.099
 so we do not linger 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.780
 now focus on the position 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.780
 relative of plans and right
