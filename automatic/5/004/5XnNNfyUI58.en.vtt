00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.610 

okay<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> pot<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> water<00:01:22.290> that's

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
okay so I have a pot of water that's

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.070 
okay so I have a pot of water that's
come<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> boil<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.550> then<00:01:24.510> I'm<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.690> going<00:01:25.050> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
come to boil and then I'm just going to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
come to boil and then I'm just going to
put<00:01:25.350> my<00:01:25.470> steamer<00:01:25.830> basket<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:30.420> gonna

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
put my steamer basket in and we're gonna

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.680 
put my steamer basket in and we're gonna
cover<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> pot<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.850> I'm<00:01:32.970> gonna<00:01:33.090> cook<00:01:33.300> this<00:01:33.510> on

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
cover the pot and I'm gonna cook this on

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.530 
cover the pot and I'm gonna cook this on
medium<00:01:34.170> steam<00:01:34.800> it<00:01:35.010> for<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> probably

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
medium steam it for I think it probably

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.810 
medium steam it for I think it probably
needs<00:01:36.920> 10<00:01:37.920> minutes<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.430> most

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
needs 10 minutes at most

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
needs 10 minutes at most
so<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.720> course<00:01:39.869> it'll<00:01:40.140> depend<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:40.920> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so of course it'll depend on the kind of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130 
so of course it'll depend on the kind of
fish<00:01:41.160> that<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.479> size<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.050> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
fish that you have or the size and the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.870 
fish that you have or the size and the
thickness<00:01:43.310> but<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.610> I'm<00:01:44.700> gonna<00:01:44.790> say

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
thickness but this one I'm gonna say

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850 
thickness but this one I'm gonna say
about<00:01:45.090> 10<00:01:45.300> minutes<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.690> want<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> until<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
about 10 minutes you want it until the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.630 
about 10 minutes you want it until the
the<00:01:47.369> fish<00:01:47.550> basically<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.750> flaky<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.369> cooked

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the fish basically is flaky and cooked

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.290 
the fish basically is flaky and cooked
through

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
through

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.570 
through
but<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.659> overdone<00:01:54.800> okay<00:01:55.800> I<00:01:56.039> think<00:01:56.340> our<00:01:56.430> fish

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
but not overdone okay I think our fish

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.389 
but not overdone okay I think our fish
is<00:01:56.759> done<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.740> I'm<00:01:58.800> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> turn<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.220> heat

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
is done so I'm going to turn the heat

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.160 
is done so I'm going to turn the heat
off<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.910> then<00:02:00.180> I'm<00:02:00.330> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.630> gently

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
off and then I'm going to gently

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:24.860 
off and then I'm going to gently
transfer<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.940> fish<00:02:03.440> onto<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.800> plate<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:23.870> then

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
transfer the fish onto a plate and then

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.930 
transfer the fish onto a plate and then
I'm<00:02:24.989> gonna<00:02:25.110> make<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.440> topping<00:02:28.700> now<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> one

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
I'm gonna make the topping now the one

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.130 
I'm gonna make the topping now the one
thing<00:02:30.060> we're<00:02:30.180> gonna<00:02:30.269> do<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.540> we're<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:31.019> to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
thing we're gonna do is we're going to

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.460
