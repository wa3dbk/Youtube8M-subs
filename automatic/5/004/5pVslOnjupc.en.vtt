00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:24.410
 what were your first as the people 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.410
 rate each other there 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:33.530
 Well, that's my first impression 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.970
 First of all for me it was me 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.380
 here from berlin i am from the city 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.270
 It was a bit open to me 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.600
 that's like nowhere in the world 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.820
 you nowhere with so once an island 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.770
 and it's just fascinating 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.200
 fascinating and then you get me that 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.030
 people live there 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:57.230
 without work without electricity without so 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.540
 almost without something we or me in 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.840
 my world as something important 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.380
 and you think so all the time years 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.540
 But nothing and learn piece by piece 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.320
 also know this is maybe what 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.910
 for us so for example you do not have 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.380
 the feeling that the electricity 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:25.240
 Miss and the people were instant 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.740
 insane curious curious open 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.549
 We also have their help very in 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.570
 claim 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.070
 without them we would not have that at all 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.750
 can handle everything so need 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.820
 someday you also needed someone 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.440
 time you when you are in the dark 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.940
 comes back who can make a fire 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.350
 and stuff like me for the first time 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.060
 We tried to make it beforehand 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.229
 Did they laugh at me? I did 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.900
 've tried somehow bit 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.680
 set up like viessmann indianer film 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.930
 have seen 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.500
 yes you can just learn a lot from 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.330
 left the seemingly simple 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.860
 but those in our lives, yes 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.090
 not take place and ultimately must 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.760
 you say that things are just very 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.959
 cordial, so heartfelt and warm 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.120
 insane and we have agreed 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.480
 also with some English can 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.100
 a bit sometimes no english and no 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.269
 sometimes just just understands that 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.920
 laughing at each other over something 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.920
 That was a special race 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.580
 Real there then searched locally 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.160
 to repeat 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.560
 jan the village knew the island quasi 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.950
 an island does not know how many 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.880
 live like many people 120 maybe 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.460
 there is not only me in the film there is 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.080
 yes, other figures or people in the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.190
 film and we have at the end then 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.030
 takes also found and searched without 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.610
 really to know if it is possible with 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.990
 have the optima lust and if this 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.970
 to let them at all if they do not say so 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.270
 what do you want here again? 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.280
 We cut off want to have their peace 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.580
 luckily it was not so 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.580
 opposite 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:14.880
 leased 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:21.110
 I secretly have the whole thing 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:25.800
 time is embarrassing because because of the figure 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.840
 Of course, all that we have in this 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.150
 Of course, all that is needed to survive 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.350
 So cant not know how can i 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.790
 determine a heavenly direction like no 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.510
 How can I make this boat? 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.880

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.660
 they can do it all they are with it 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.460
 grew up 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.950
 There were many situations and 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.500
 In the end, we were also ahead 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.420
 three weeks ago we were back 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.640

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.950

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.220
 I do not know as blonde holding the 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.750
 but you did not say anything 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.780

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.030

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.450
 village really have though sometimes 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.190
 something too easy to touch or something 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.160
 if such a two-year-old three-year-old 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.470

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.970

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.450
 I really have one too 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.380
 bit on the blue eyes or on 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.680
 the blond hair 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.190
