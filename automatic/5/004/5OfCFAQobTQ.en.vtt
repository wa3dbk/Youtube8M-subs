and<00:00:05.740> back<00:00:05.920> after<00:00:06.250> the<00:00:06.370> acid<00:00:06.700> wash<00:00:06.880> I'm<00:00:07.060> just

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
and back after the acid wash I'm just

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.850 
and back after the acid wash I'm just
priming<00:00:07.750> the<00:00:07.900> pump<00:00:07.930> getting<00:00:08.530> the<00:00:08.680> pool

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
priming the pump getting the pool

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.129 
priming the pump getting the pool
running<00:00:09.160> again<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.510> I'm<00:00:10.600> going<00:00:10.719> to<00:00:10.809> add<00:00:10.930> some

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
running again and I'm going to add some

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.720 
running again and I'm going to add some
conditioner<00:00:11.680> shock

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
conditioner shock

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.699 
conditioner shock
and<00:00:13.820> bounce<00:00:13.969> pH<00:00:14.629> right<00:00:14.900> now<00:00:15.019> and<00:00:15.410> you<00:00:15.469> can<00:00:15.620> see

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
and bounce pH right now and you can see

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:16.870 
and bounce pH right now and you can see
it's<00:00:15.830> a<00:00:15.860> little<00:00:16.039> bit<00:00:16.129> cloudy<00:00:16.309> from<00:00:16.640> all<00:00:16.789> the

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
it's a little bit cloudy from all the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.150 
it's a little bit cloudy from all the
soda<00:00:17.090> ash<00:00:17.330> that<00:00:17.570> I<00:00:17.660> had<00:00:17.779> thrown<00:00:17.990> in<00:00:18.170> yesterday

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
soda ash that I had thrown in yesterday

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.850 
soda ash that I had thrown in yesterday
they<00:00:19.279> kind<00:00:19.460> of<00:00:19.490> neutralize<00:00:19.939> any<00:00:20.150> acid<00:00:20.770> but<00:00:21.770> you

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
they kind of neutralize any acid but you

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.290 
they kind of neutralize any acid but you
can<00:00:21.950> see<00:00:22.099> it<00:00:22.189> looks<00:00:22.279> really<00:00:22.579> good<00:00:26.500> really<00:00:27.500> good

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
can see it looks really good really good

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.550 
can see it looks really good really good
and<00:00:29.300> you<00:00:29.419> can<00:00:29.539> see<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.779> pH<00:00:30.019> is<00:00:30.170> pretty<00:00:30.380> high

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
and you can see the pH is pretty high

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.109 
and you can see the pH is pretty high
which<00:00:30.800> is<00:00:30.949> what<00:00:31.130> it's<00:00:31.279> expected<00:00:31.759> at<00:00:31.820> all<00:00:31.910> that

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
which is what it's expected at all that

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.270 
which is what it's expected at all that
soda<00:00:32.480> ash<00:00:32.689> I<00:00:32.839> put<00:00:32.960> in<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.140> bottom<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:34.190> I

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
soda ash I put in the bottom and I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.460 
soda ash I put in the bottom and I
refilled<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.150> there's<00:00:35.900> no<00:00:35.989> chlorine<00:00:36.350> in

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
refilled it and there's no chlorine in

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.110 
refilled it and there's no chlorine in
the<00:00:36.559> pool<00:00:36.589> so<00:00:37.040> I'm<00:00:37.129> gonna<00:00:37.220> go<00:00:37.339> ahead<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.519> shock

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
the pool so I'm gonna go ahead and shock

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.090 
the pool so I'm gonna go ahead and shock
the<00:00:38.269> pool<00:00:38.480> I'm<00:00:39.290> adding<00:00:39.559> conditioner<00:00:39.949> right

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
the pool I'm adding conditioner right

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.319 
the pool I'm adding conditioner right
now<00:00:40.190> through<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.430> skimmer<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:40.970> I'm<00:00:41.180> gonna

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
now through the skimmer and I'm gonna

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.700 
now through the skimmer and I'm gonna
let<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.570> full<00:00:41.750> run<00:00:41.870> for<00:00:42.050> 24<00:00:42.379> hours

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
want to do the alkalinity tests to make

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.460 
want to do the alkalinity tests to make
sure<00:01:03.310> we're<00:01:03.430> in<00:01:03.490> range<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:05.199> alkalinity

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
sure we're in range the alkalinity

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.400 
sure we're in range the alkalinity
tested<00:01:05.950> at<00:01:06.040> 170<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.760> that's<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.000> be<00:01:07.090> expected

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
tested at 170 and that's to be expected

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.050 
tested at 170 and that's to be expected
with<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.500> soda<00:01:08.710> ash<00:01:08.890> from<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.250> bottom<00:01:09.670> plus

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
with the soda ash from the bottom plus

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.370 
with the soda ash from the bottom plus
of<00:01:10.300> water<00:01:10.510> in<00:01:10.690> this<00:01:10.810> area<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.200> little

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
of water in this area is a little

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.100 
of water in this area is a little
alkaline<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:13.060> how<00:01:13.510> many<00:01:13.570> lower<00:01:13.810> with<00:01:13.990> some

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
alkaline so how many lower with some

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.440 
alkaline so how many lower with some
peat<00:01:14.290> with<00:01:15.070> some<00:01:15.220> acid<00:01:15.790> right<00:01:15.910> now<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.330> bring

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
peat with some acid right now and bring

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.110 
peat with some acid right now and bring
it<00:01:16.600> down<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.550> went<00:01:18.730> in<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.910> shock

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
it down and so I went in the shock

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.190 
it down and so I went in the shock
before<00:01:19.270> we<00:01:19.420> can<00:01:19.540> see<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.720> chlorine<00:01:19.930> levels

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
before we can see the chlorine levels

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.640 
before we can see the chlorine levels
really<00:01:20.380> high

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
really high

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.310 
really high
hopefully<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.160> conditioner<00:01:21.610> will<00:01:21.760> hold<00:01:22.060> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
hopefully the conditioner will hold it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.600 
hopefully the conditioner will hold it
tomorrow<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.500> keep<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:23.740> at<00:01:23.830> a<00:01:23.860> decent<00:01:24.369> level

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
tomorrow and keep it at a decent level

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.370 
tomorrow and keep it at a decent level
the<00:01:25.450> sun's<00:01:25.660> gonna<00:01:25.750> burn<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:25.990> lot<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.229> this

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
the sun's gonna burn a lot of this

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.950 
the sun's gonna burn a lot of this
chlorine<00:01:26.650> off<00:01:26.890> today<00:01:27.460> as<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.330> conditioner<00:01:28.900> is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
chlorine off today as a conditioner is

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.109 
chlorine off today as a conditioner is
moving<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.680> system<00:01:30.220> by<00:01:30.640> some<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.910> it<00:01:31.030> will

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
moving to the system by some of it will

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
moving to the system by some of it will
sting

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.670 

and<00:01:41.310> here's<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.790> same<00:01:42.030> pool<00:01:42.330> 48<00:01:42.960> hours<00:01:43.320> after

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and here's that same pool 48 hours after

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
and here's that same pool 48 hours after
the<00:01:43.770> acid<00:01:44.100> wash<00:01:46.310> see<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.670> cleared<00:01:48.060> up

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the acid wash see that it all cleared up

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910 
the acid wash see that it all cleared up
and<00:01:48.510> it<00:01:48.840> looks<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.049> pretty<00:01:49.259> much<00:01:49.440> brand-new

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
and it looks like pretty much brand-new

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:00.420 
and it looks like pretty much brand-new

when<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.880> pH<00:02:16.880> gets<00:02:17.150> too<00:02:17.300> low<00:02:17.510> alkalinity<00:02:18.170> up

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
when the pH gets too low alkalinity up

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.080 
when the pH gets too low alkalinity up
the<00:02:18.830> neck<00:02:19.070> when<00:02:19.280> he<00:02:19.430> gets<00:02:19.610> too<00:02:19.760> low<00:02:19.910> it'll

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
the neck when he gets too low it'll

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.210 
the neck when he gets too low it'll
raise<00:02:20.240> just<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.540> alkalinity<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.950> pH

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
raise just the alkalinity and not the pH

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.580 
raise just the alkalinity and not the pH
when<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.330> have<00:02:23.420> soda<00:02:23.630> ash<00:02:23.870> remember<00:02:24.230> races

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
when you have soda ash remember races

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.410 
when you have soda ash remember races
both<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.950> pH<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.670> outer<00:02:26.000> even<00:02:26.330> though

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
both the pH and the outer even though

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.210 
both the pH and the outer even though
it's<00:02:26.570> been<00:02:26.720> 24<00:02:27.020> hours<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.410> looks<00:02:27.770> like<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.010> has

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
it's been 24 hours it looks like it has

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.100 
it's been 24 hours it looks like it has
some<00:02:28.490> scenario<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.240> building<00:02:29.480> up<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:29.780> there

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.330 

in<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> alkalinity<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.740> still<00:02:33.920> showing<00:02:34.100> kind

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
in the alkalinity is still showing kind

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.380 
in the alkalinity is still showing kind
of<00:02:34.370> high<00:02:34.520> I'm<00:02:34.700> gonna<00:02:34.820> check<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.150> with<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.300> have

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
of high I'm gonna check it with you have

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.480 
of high I'm gonna check it with you have
a<00:02:35.420> test<00:02:35.660> kit<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.980> air<00:02:37.070> Quinn<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.400> you're

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
a test kit in the air Quinn and you're

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
a test kit in the air Quinn and you're
still<00:02:37.670> running<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.940> little<00:02:38.090> high<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.300> about<00:02:38.540> 160

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
still running a little high is about 160

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.490 
still running a little high is about 160
and<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.600> pH<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.989> little<00:02:42.200> bit<00:02:42.290> high<00:02:42.380> I'm

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
and the pH is a little bit high I'm

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.010 
and the pH is a little bit high I'm
gonna<00:02:42.650> add<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.770> little<00:02:42.830> bit<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.190> acid<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
gonna add a little bit of acid in the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.210 
gonna add a little bit of acid in the
chlorine<00:02:45.320> level<00:02:45.560> still<00:02:45.830> high<00:02:45.980> which<00:02:46.190> is

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
chlorine level still high which is

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.590 
chlorine level still high which is
really<00:02:46.580> good<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.820> mean<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.180> conditioner

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
really good I mean the conditioner

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.420 
really good I mean the conditioner
actually<00:02:47.930> kicked<00:02:48.140> in<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.620> protecting<00:02:49.190> the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
actually kicked in and is protecting the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:03:01.160 
actually kicked in and is protecting the
chlorine<00:02:50.330> from<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.900> Sun

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
