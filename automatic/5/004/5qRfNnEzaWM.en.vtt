00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
good care of my skin so that way it just

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.100 
good care of my skin so that way it just
continues<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.720> stay<00:02:52.050> looking<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.100> certain<00:02:53.340> age

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
continues to stay looking a certain age

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.380 
continues to stay looking a certain age
that's<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.200> lot<00:02:55.290> younger<00:02:55.530> than<00:02:55.890> my<00:02:56.010> true<00:02:56.220> age

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
that's a lot younger than my true age

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.500 
that's a lot younger than my true age
hopefully<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:58.640> $23<00:02:59.640> maybe<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.910> lot<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.210> some

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
hopefully so $23 maybe a lot for some

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.450 
hopefully so $23 maybe a lot for some
people<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.900> invest<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.950> said<00:03:02.010> I've

bottom of this and with the philosophy
one<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.730> was<00:03:12.360> buying<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.660> stuff<00:03:12.840> like<00:03:13.050> once<00:03:13.260> a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
one I was buying that stuff like once a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.870 
one I was buying that stuff like once a
month<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.860> don't<00:03:14.130> know<00:03:15.230> why<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.770> went<00:03:17.490> through<00:03:17.700> it

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
month I don't know why I went through it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.570 
month I don't know why I went through it
so<00:03:18.030> fast<00:03:18.300> but<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.630> seemed<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:20.040> face<00:03:20.310> wash

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
so fast but it seemed like the face wash

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.270 
so fast but it seemed like the face wash
I<00:03:20.820> would<00:03:21.000> go<00:03:21.120> through<00:03:21.740> maybe<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.830> month<00:03:23.010> month

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
I would go through maybe a month month

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.220 
I would go through maybe a month month
and<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.430> half<00:03:23.460> it<00:03:23.760> lasts<00:03:24.000> me<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:25.080> would<00:03:25.200> be

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
and a half it lasts me and that would be

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.320 
and a half it lasts me and that would be
it<00:03:25.580> but<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.640> do<00:03:26.730> have<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.880> say<00:03:26.940> about<00:03:27.120> this

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
it but I do have to say about this

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330 
it but I do have to say about this
though<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.770> have<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:28.920> work<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.310> make

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
though is that you have to work to make

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.100 
though is that you have to work to make
it<00:03:29.580> lather<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.480> completely<00:03:30.960> natural

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110

it lather it is completely natural
there's<00:03:31.560> no<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:32.100> don't<00:03:32.250> think<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.430> any<00:03:32.610> sodium

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
there's no I don't think is any sodium

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
there's no I don't think is any sodium
lauryl<00:03:33.690> sulfate<00:03:34.350> or<00:03:34.380> whatever<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:34.860> thing<00:03:35.010> is

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
lauryl sulfate or whatever that thing is

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.520 
lauryl sulfate or whatever that thing is
that<00:03:35.580> makes<00:03:35.790> things<00:03:36.060> really<00:03:36.240> easily<00:03:36.600> sudsy<00:03:37.320> I

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
that makes things really easily sudsy I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.490 
that makes things really easily sudsy I
am<00:03:38.340> NOT<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:39.060> person<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.900> knows<00:03:40.170> these<00:03:40.440> things

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
am NOT a person that knows these things

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.610 
am NOT a person that knows these things
I<00:03:43.310> don't<00:03:44.310> know<00:03:44.400> if<00:03:44.460> I'd<00:03:44.550> like<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.030> see<00:03:45.180> down<00:03:45.330> here

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
I don't know if I'd like I see down here

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.240 
I don't know if I'd like I see down here
but<00:03:46.620> it's<00:03:46.770> supposed<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:46.980> be<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> natural

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
but it's supposed to be a natural

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.940 
but it's supposed to be a natural
product<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:49.080> kind<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.350> have<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.530> make<00:03:49.800> it

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
product so you kind of have to make it

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.880 
product so you kind of have to make it
work<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.760> suds<00:03:51.030> up<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:52.320> was<00:03:52.560> making<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
work to suds up and I was making the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.350 
work to suds up and I was making the
mistake<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.220> using<00:03:53.430> too<00:03:53.730> much<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.300> the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
mistake of using too much this in the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.170 
mistake of using too much this in the
beginning<00:03:54.480> because<00:03:55.020> it<00:03:55.500> wasn't<00:03:56.060> setting<00:03:57.060> up

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
beginning because it wasn't setting up

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.050 
beginning because it wasn't setting up
so<00:03:57.390> naturally<00:03:58.080> like<00:03:58.410> my<00:03:59.010> other<00:03:59.160> face<00:03:59.760> wash

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
so naturally like my other face wash

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.870 
so naturally like my other face wash
