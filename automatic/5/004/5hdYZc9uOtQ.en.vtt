00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.160
 / 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.970
 it's the world is fighting with today 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.150
 in stand by me and live games kraft 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.950
 lies for a little carnage let's go 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.029
 to the cave with little vampire whose more 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.220
 to fulfill these same principles as 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.110
 the team before car on the website gameblog 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.369
 you know someone we just 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.099
 all our life we â€‹â€‹make imperfections 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.840
 someone one would be podolie of splash 2 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.840
 so here it was a very good part 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.000
 that I really did then I reread 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.860
 my first course of the season 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.700
 besides, here you are, that's all 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.870
 anecdote so here is I'm reborn 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.210
 quiet I 'm just doing a little 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.909
 games and bass it went well what 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.070
 we had a small counter of 2 kg to 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.539
 left as we can see so 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.769
 there was enough of people 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.539
 people stuck so I decided the 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.850
 balloon you're a little loose my shoulder and 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.829
 knee make a little here after 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.580
 payet 22 guys on a tower sees the 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.330
 hit 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.560
 what he has I'm going so if I lose 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.640
 narc and I had a pop in there 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.430
 but I did not take that's why 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.219
 by the way in the worst the little trot 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.750
 in short, that's me, bah jean monde, I'm starting to 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.399
 approach everything I felt good I 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.750
 why because I've never 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.070
 a pop in both cities a bow and all 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.140
 the games on from the start I felt 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.159
 well and there was a team so low 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.610
 with vampire I thought that 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.369
 was going to pass 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.990
 and therefore a known skin Here I 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.240
 am one and on the second one we are going 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.619
 to work 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.610
 he had left in the party too 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.579
 they had already done four types of 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.079
 his side of which we believe disney tim the 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.460
 kits since we were a little old but 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.289
 in fact he is less there he would do that he 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 do not leave me now to better this 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.740
 on someone after they entered the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.969
 things and I'm kind of the premium corner has 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.039
 been throughout the party she was me 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.170
 show so there there have been some 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.500
 little freeze and well I finally 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.630
 managed to kill him so that's what makes me 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.560
 six small islands and after he was 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.460
 really started to chain 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.439
 kills so low 1 1 1 2nd so that makes me 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.270
 so he's really in the water with 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.640
 a bow really knew more about big 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.570
 killing is there was the other so I 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.830
 did not really understand what he was doing 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.270
 for royal is not a lot and you 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.530
 will understand that in fact they were 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.910
 miss so I really 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.810
 really scared is actually I had a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.480
 sword in my inventory that makes me 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.950
 so see at sight turned around and froze 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.030
 a little good combo so here is wally 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.440
 so this video with the video of 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.200
 on Friday how can that be a 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.989
 little Friday around 83 and Tuesday I 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.020
 believe i'm going to make the video ad 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.150
 so that they real for the 2000 subscribers 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.600
 so here I am not sure yet if I 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.890
 the farm 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.720

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.819
 do it so here I already told you they 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.910

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.550
 minutes three minutes what was it 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.920
 not bad is so Tuesday is basely the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.330

 it's really good 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.239
 I advise you against a wall that he does not 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.489

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.160
 parties often parts it's 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.290

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.730
 wood so not hot only kill I killed 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.110

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.610

 he did not speak much 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.180
 but cheap do not forget 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.090
 to follow me on twitter because I 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.700

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.810
 made there as you see on the screen that 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.950
 takes a long time to render 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.019
 but I will try to make it go 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.720

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.299

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.430
 pass and a small team of 3 that I 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.830
 managed quite easily thanks to 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.229
 the bow and modules 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.139

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.999

 in short, here you go, I 'm typing it 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.219
 am the various airtime like that 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.560
 in slow motion and there I have four 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:37.870
 hearts but a blow to heart in the love 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.919
 and I want you are I want to kill I have 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.930
 really lucky because they 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.189
 I still have a joker throw in the lava 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.360
 lands the smash a pop to both 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.370
 cities but a little page of the launch 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.229
 pad or finally j'me if I posed a bug 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.589
 short belote the small cut for m 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:52.300
 to the last alan to anyone so that's it 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.500
 is linked fast by the way I was in 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.699
 head I was surprised that he is not 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.589
 public will come to do it soon I will 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.500
 to do a rally it's the fact a pack b5 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:01.990
 so here's the cutoff so here I 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.389
 hides a little jump from the hedge 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.939
 I regret it burst one so what 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.469
 maybe what they have but and dad 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.389
 was happy and I believe in my stuff 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.669
 so there I was seventeen that he in 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.830
 my tobacco when I saw 17 9 to 18 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.289
 years true and the beautiful there is the last one 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.849
 team so I was expecting the bow as 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.800
 they said they so I went 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.000
 and the mud but the dry hills that 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.439
 so seemed at first I was stressed 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.479
 way of the cross so I set up 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.550
 to make the skin of the island and therefore plays 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.810
 after even if ben here there is no 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.460
 what to stress does not require dark on 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.200
 and that's nineteen little ones he 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.580
 not for one for a gameplay on life 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.020
 creature with them who will have worse commented 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.970

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.550
 you will have liked so code laugh the package 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.010
