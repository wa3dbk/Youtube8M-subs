ago<00:00:53.910> actually

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
ago actually

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.529 
ago actually
you<00:00:55.260> gotta<00:00:55.410> swipe<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> before<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:57.360> much

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
you gotta swipe it before you do much

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
you gotta swipe it before you do much
and<00:00:58.129> then<00:01:00.590> anyway<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.859> where<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> water

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
and then anyway this is where the water

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.490 
and then anyway this is where the water
falls<00:01:02.520> down<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:02.910> pretty<00:01:03.120> exciting

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
falls down that's pretty exciting

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
falls down that's pretty exciting
they're<00:01:05.299> three<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> wash<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.630> hands<00:01:08.479> well
