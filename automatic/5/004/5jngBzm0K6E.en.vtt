have is we usually have two hose bibbs
worn<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> front<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.730> we'll<00:01:02.850> have

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
worn in the front and then we'll have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.939 
worn in the front and then we'll have
one<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> garage<00:01:03.539> okay<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.470> people<00:01:04.799> can

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
one in the garage okay but people can

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.770 
one in the garage okay but people can
option<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> loft<00:01:06.510> area

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
option out to get one in the loft area

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.179 
option out to get one in the loft area
if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.439> want<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.070> get

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
if you want to know that you can get

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.420 
if you want to know that you can get
another<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:09.240> absolutely<00:01:09.960> correct

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
another that's absolutely correct

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.740 
another that's absolutely correct
so<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:13.439> position<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.220> keep<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.750> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
so the position to keep it on is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.899 
so the position to keep it on is
parallel<00:01:16.409> with<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.710> pipe<00:01:16.920> alright<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.729> able

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
parallel with the pipe alright be able

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.719 
parallel with the pipe alright be able
to<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> when<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:20.070> valve<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
to see that when the valve is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.160 
to see that when the valve is
perpendicular<00:01:21.509> mm-hmm

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
perpendicular mm-hmm

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.530 
perpendicular mm-hmm
then<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.220> water's<00:01:23.520> gonna<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.820> shut<00:01:24.060> off<00:01:24.090> get

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
then the water's gonna be shut off get

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.499 
then the water's gonna be shut off get
to<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> hose<00:01:24.900> bibbs<00:01:25.170> good<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.890> parent

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
to the hose bibbs good to know so parent

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.060 
to the hose bibbs good to know so parent
perpendicular<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.780> pipe<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.200> off

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
perpendicular to the pipe is off

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.870 
perpendicular to the pipe is off
parallel<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> pipe<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.930> great<00:01:31.590> ok<00:01:32.400> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
parallel to the pipe is on great ok so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.399 
parallel to the pipe is on great ok so
what<00:01:33.030> you're<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.240> end<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.479> doing<00:01:33.900> after<00:01:34.320> you
