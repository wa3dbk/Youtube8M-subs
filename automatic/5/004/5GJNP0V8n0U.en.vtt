isn't<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> market<00:00:24.060> yet<00:00:24.270> but<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:24.750> be

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
isn't on the market yet but it will be

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.050 
isn't on the market yet but it will be
very<00:00:25.230> soon<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.920> when<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> hit<00:00:26.730> store<00:00:27.029> shelves

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
very soon and when it hit store shelves

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.810 
very soon and when it hit store shelves
I<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:27.960> people<00:00:28.260> are<00:00:28.380> really<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.100> flip

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
I think people are really going to flip

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.740 
I think people are really going to flip
over<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:31.610> anyway<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.120> hell<00:00:33.239> Equestria<00:00:33.720> is

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
over it anyway the hell Equestria is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.540 
over it anyway the hell Equestria is
really<00:00:34.290> something<00:00:34.710> new<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.070> different<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
really something new and different and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.790 
really something new and different and
it's<00:00:35.790> amazing<00:00:36.449> to<00:00:36.570> fly<00:00:36.750> I've<00:00:37.350> been<00:00:37.500> having<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it's amazing to fly I've been having a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
it's amazing to fly I've been having a
lot<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.130> fun<00:00:38.370> testing<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.600> three

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
lot of fun testing it out it's a three

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
lot of fun testing it out it's a three
channel<00:00:40.200> indoor<00:00:40.770> aircraft<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> can

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
channel indoor aircraft that can

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
channel indoor aircraft that can
actually<00:00:41.730> fly<00:00:42.149> nose<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> even<00:00:43.770> upside

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
actually fly nose up and even upside

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
actually fly nose up and even upside
down<00:00:44.730> inverted<00:00:45.719> flight<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.290> one<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.739> those

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
down inverted flight is one of those

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.830 
down inverted flight is one of those
things<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> lot<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.760> RC<00:00:48.120> pilots<00:00:48.540> dream

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
things that a lot of RC pilots dream

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.869 
things that a lot of RC pilots dream
about<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.469> never<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> experience

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
about but never really get to experience

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.959 
about but never really get to experience
3d<00:00:51.809> capable<00:00:52.320> helicopters<00:00:52.950> are<00:00:53.190> expensive

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
3d capable helicopters are expensive

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.310 
3d capable helicopters are expensive
than<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:54.239> take<00:00:54.450> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.870> skill<00:00:55.290> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
than they take a lot of skill and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.660 
than they take a lot of skill and
dedication<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> master

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
dedication to master

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
dedication to master
however<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.510> heli<00:00:57.750> twister<00:00:58.200> makes<00:00:58.440> flying

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
however the heli twister makes flying

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
however the heli twister makes flying
inverted<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.489> easy<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.120> flipping<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.690> switch

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
inverted as easy as flipping a switch

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.139 
inverted as easy as flipping a switch
the<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.129> works<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.579> actually<00:01:03.000> more

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the way it works is actually more

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.579 
the way it works is actually more
complex<00:01:03.629> than<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.840> might<00:01:04.080> think

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
complex than you might think

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.680 
complex than you might think

ever<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.680> slightly<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.910> will<00:03:39.120> help

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
ever so slightly and it will help

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.840 
ever so slightly and it will help
counteract<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.110> bed<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.700> found<00:03:41.700> that

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
counteract this bed I found that

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.060 
counteract this bed I found that
twisting<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.480> rotors<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:43.020> this<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.530> using

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
twisting the rotors like this and using

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.010 
twisting the rotors like this and using
the<00:03:44.160> trim<00:03:44.370> buttons<00:03:44.700> as<00:03:44.850> well<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> great<00:03:45.660> way

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
the trim buttons as well is a great way

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.230 
the trim buttons as well is a great way
to<00:03:46.050> get<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.440> aircraft<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.950> fly<00:03:47.010> straight<00:03:47.430> now

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
to get the aircraft to fly straight now

to get the aircraft to fly straight now
with<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.630> aircraft<00:03:48.840> trim<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.830> very

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
with this aircraft trim is very

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.910 
with this aircraft trim is very
important<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.030> found<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.840> easier<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.500> set<00:03:52.740> the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
important I found it easier to set the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.370 
important I found it easier to set the
left<00:03:53.190> right<00:03:53.550> roll<00:03:53.880> trim<00:03:54.270> with<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.630> dial<00:03:54.870> first

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
left right roll trim with the dial first

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.860 
left right roll trim with the dial first
then<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.190> set<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.700> spin<00:03:57.120> trim<00:03:57.510> with<00:03:57.750> the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
then I set the spin trim with the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.870 
then I set the spin trim with the
buttons<00:03:58.200> or<00:03:58.410> by<00:03:58.590> twisting<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.160> rotors<00:03:59.490> on

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880
