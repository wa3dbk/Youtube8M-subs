00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.310
 the mole until it is very thick 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.379

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:47.239

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.800

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.410
 mole and let's shake everything well this 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.290
 so that it does not stick 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.420
 we will continue moving for two minutes to 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.550
 that is not going to hit us and if it is 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.430
 necessary, let's put a little bit of 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.920
 chicken broth 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.709

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.030
 minutes let's put the chicken inside 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.060
 in this way this will make the flavor 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.330
 concentrate more on the chicken and the sauce and 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.120

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.460

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.090
 pieces with the sauce and let's add if 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.580
