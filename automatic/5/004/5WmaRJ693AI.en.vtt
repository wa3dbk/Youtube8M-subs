00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.469
 welcome to 1 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.690
 since windows vista microsoft has that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.330
 original administrator account 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 for safety reasons by default 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.520
 disabled that is not a bad one 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.560
 thing for most actions 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.769
 the user does not need extended 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.289
 administrator rights if these rights 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 should still needed there 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.400
 still the possibility of this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.460
 activate hidden account again 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.560
 under windows 7 or 8 professional 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.440
 this account can be over the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.969
 enable computer management because that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.219
 but not in all versions of 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.879
 windows works i show this time 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.969
 the way over the prompt we 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.560
 go on state give a cmd 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.360
 right click 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:05.210
 as an administrator we can perform 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.210
 the account is now active by using net user 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:17.740
 write administrator / active 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.380
 enter I get a confirmation here 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.270
 that administrator became account 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.990
 successfully activated 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 the next time you log on to the system 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.960
 we now log in as administrator 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 I show again as fast as we do 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.770
 the whole 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.260
 if we no longer need the account 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.900
 can disable again 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.900
 we write again net user 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:56.680
 administrator right colon no 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.810
 I press enter again get one 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.570
 confirmation and now that is 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.940
 administrator account disabled again 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.190
 and you can not log in anymore 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.220
 login as administrator 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.310
 because you extended with this account 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.010
 right-wing is the permanent one 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.280
 use of the account is not recommended 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.010
 because hardware is then with admin 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.720
 right what made it easier for her 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.100
 could make the system too 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.350
 compromise 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.350
 I hope you have learned something
