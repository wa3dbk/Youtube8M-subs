00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.109
 a day in this video MHz I you 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.109
 I will show you how to enroll to register data 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.309

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.099
 clean disks of children 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.369
 either people saw it or find reserves 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.539
 as in the usual way 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.820
 for example Windows medal forwarder not 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.720
 will turn out 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.500
 for this we need it 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
 special program 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.159
 this program 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.159
 called small sits Raykov 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.260
 i.e 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.560
 go to your browser potter or google 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.010
 or according to him with 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.190
 have their own families 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.730
 Here is the name of the program 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.140
 since they say all the ideas of the projects let's 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.080
 will be 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.450
 knew to hear 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.380
 further snow 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.590
 his father's search for you provided 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.730
 several few pits 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.040
 1000 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.780
 even a million pages 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.940
 result 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.640
 we go 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.430
 here is a sudan resins environment writer download 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.010
 is free 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.860
 we go 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.890
 look 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 we went to the site software portal 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.650
 this is site data 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.750
 we don't set low 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.390
 and look 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.970
 given program which us today 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.240
 interested will need to solve 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.390
 Problems 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.320
 let them sit writer 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.950
 one fourth version 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 died daily on the link 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.590
 Further 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.160
 we go to the source 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.670
 link 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.430
 we'll see 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.430
 download food writer 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.080
 source 2 become part 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.760
 we have the Uman part 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.140
 tuple after this he 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.280
 specified path with preservation 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.549
 this program 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.200
 all this indicates save 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.189
 and be all downloaded 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.019
 farther 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.939
 us browsers 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.619
 no longer needed 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.999
 after which you download 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.869
 save this program 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.869
 we open it 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.289
 after opening the program 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:34.309
 x 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.219
 at least come close isn't it 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.219
 it turns out that you have something to show but 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.099
 listen carefully 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.849
 we opened 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.279
 and here the project files are written 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.529
 DJ pi sy us with the number that is 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.429
 disc name 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.469
 but your numbers 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.639
 on the name of the disk can be 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.359
 rename for example the movie to her 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.519
 uah 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.870
 and name 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.269
 own 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.729
 it depends on the edge 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.109
 what files can be written by data 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.689
 net divisions 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.689
 on this blank drive 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.429
 Further 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.860
 to enroll 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.029

 Yes 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.029
 e see it 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.879
 with him 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.149
 what we are and on what sites and characters 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.660
 transfer for download for records 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.469
 presently 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.289
 prime voters 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.189
 being films 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.189
 Pyatigorsk filimonov 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.209
 all she just drag 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.980
 states you will appear darpa if 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.089
 played baa1 movie king 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.169
 either end programs or caliber music 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.199
 in general, we have moved 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.319
 farther 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.269
 look to 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.150
 among countries 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
 information I want to write a network drive 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.889
 we will need to write down 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.009
 disk 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.859
 Further 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.279
 clamp on burn disc 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.150
 farther 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.529
 you will appear in 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.659
 continue the last sessions to create a new 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.009
 session record project 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.400
 we click on create new session 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.669
 by the way 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.080
 it rides 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.849
 before opening this program 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.580
 put 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.059
 sitting wire 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.469
 Children's Day Drive 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:44.689
 in the first division Lebedev 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.419
 that is, it depends 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.340
 and further housing 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.559
 enroll create a higher power 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.930
 write speed is indicated 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.930
 we live enroll 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:00.840
 Further 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.940
 wait a couple seconds per second 20 30 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.139
 and you have apt 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.139
 solders himself 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.419
 such a range chk with a percentage 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.500
 where percent will be replenished and she will have 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:19.680
 you time 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.240
 i.e 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.659
 write to this disc 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.659
 further fall out live this time 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.689
 after evaluation automatic 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.159
 will remain 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.479
 and all 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:35.909
 pull out indian and
