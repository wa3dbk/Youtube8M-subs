00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 marakasi you watch the transfer the best 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.110
 tanks on nominations this is our second 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.080
 part and the first tank that we have 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.360
 wins it top 2 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.119
 interesting very long car and she 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.930
 wins the tank nomination which 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.880
 attracts the most attention to itself 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.279
 once 2 gets into battle he immediately 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.070
 causes a lot of positive emotions of his 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.410
 players they start to consider it 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.110
 from all sides some are pushing him 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.149
 others are starting to write in chat type 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.969
 sausage 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.200
 limousine or something like that 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.129
 really attracts a tank 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.190
 attention is very slow 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 long and unusual for me personally this tank 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 very funny especially if 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.059
 look into its details, that's why 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 it was necessary to do these windows on the sides 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.710
 a tank can have it not a tank but just 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.199
 mobile kiosk with shawarma 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.260
 maybe it's just the british 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.140
 open there to look at the landscapes 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.210
 of and the fact that there is generally not clear 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 why dok2 should be done like this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.430
 long well maybe the british 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.310
 decided to make it comfortable and cozy there and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.830
 they have a bedroom and dining rooms where not tea 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.549
 drink and toilets and generally anything 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.470
 but in any case, current 2 is one 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.670
 tank which attracts to itself 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.890
 players attention gives them a positive but with 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.729
 other side like a tank he's pretty 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.619
 weak and the next car in ours 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.799
 the program is fv215b 183 this fri sau 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.680
 everyone is afraid and who is not afraid of that 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.810
 just still not getting to 1800 damage and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.490
 more and she wins the nomination by 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.799
 awesome car in the game you 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.409
 I really am terrified 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.990
 no one wants to ride it 1 because 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.450
 everyone understands that the average alpha strike 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.790
 explosive projectile at this car a thousand 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.039
 seven hundred and fifty units it's just 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.649
 unrealistic numbers most tanks 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.900
 lose a huge part of their strength 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.390
 or fly away at all van 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.730
 Gar probably many will say that high-explosive 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.829
 shells in our game does not act very 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.500
 effectively for example they can get into 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.110
 a caterpillar or screen and in this case 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.569
 they do not break through the goal and in general I 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.510
 I agree with this really flash drive is not 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.849
 always pierces the opponent but who will 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.599
 risk who will play Russian 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.629
 roulette wheel 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.760
 show this madman for sure such 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.150
 there are but i'm sure most 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.970
 players seeing this fri sau surely on 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.579
 she will not go on the contrary most likely they 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.310
 will drive back and hope 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.650
 that this car will not look at them 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.870
 and is not especially well to shoot them 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.060
 If she promazhet then this of course 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.980
 relief and opportunity over it 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.470
 shoot because recharge here 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.370
 very long yes and her accuracy is not 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.849
 very but nonetheless it does not interfere in 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.400
 215b 183 tear and randomly apply 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.069
 just an incredible amount of damage there 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.220
 vanshoty opponents right and left 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.160
 is this car really now 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.230
 terrorizes with random and frightens all not 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.680
 believe me open here is a replace and 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:32.010
 sort out there fighting for damage and see 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.319
 who will be in the first places but also oppression 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.530
 at its level kvass as a tank or as 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.120
 it is also called apt-1s and all thanks 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.069
 his instrument with a break of 175 and alpha 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.060
 390 with such indicators on your 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.310
 kvass level breaks everything in its path 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.530
 he is really afraid of kvass 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.919
 wins the nomination best tank for 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.139
 novice to bend and really this 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.349
 the tank is capable of showing good 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.840
 results even if you are a novice player 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.970
 but of course you will need 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.150
 some time to get used to it 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.120
 the tank still has almost no armor 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.760
 the gun is pretty slanting but it 's not all 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.599
 prevents of course kvass handing out accounts with 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.229
 the guard 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:22.169
 but, anyway, kvass is not the same 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.880
 tank which is the simplest though 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.590
 he is able to break 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.320
 even in the hands start 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.060
 i'm a player i mean i say 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.910
 class I am definitely an imba 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.040
 and at his level he punishes everyone but 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.590
 still need to get used to it because 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.620
 that the gun is so peculiar 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.949
 and cardboard armor but after some 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.880
 time on this tank can even bend 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.430
 newbie 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.190
