here I'm going to start with a layer of
sauce<00:01:02.800> spread<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:03.980> around

a layer of noodles I'm not cooking them
first<00:01:09.440> because<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.190> defeats<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.820> whole

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
first because that defeats the whole
