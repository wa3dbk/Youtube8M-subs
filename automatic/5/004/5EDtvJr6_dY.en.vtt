modes that we want to do is that we want
to<00:00:37.280> try<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.460> put<00:00:37.670> as<00:00:37.790> much<00:00:37.910> vitalization<00:00:38.690> in

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
to try and put as much vitalization in

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.770 
to try and put as much vitalization in
other<00:00:39.770> words<00:00:39.920> as<00:00:40.129> we<00:00:40.309> can<00:00:40.720> while<00:00:41.720> still

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
other words as we can while still

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.970 
other words as we can while still
getting<00:00:42.170> our<00:00:42.500> affinities<00:00:43.720> so<00:00:44.720> in<00:00:45.350> total<00:00:45.620> there

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
getting our affinities so in total there

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.450 
getting our affinities so in total there
is<00:00:46.100> for<00:00:46.760> yellow<00:00:47.379> to<00:00:48.379> red<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.830> two<00:00:49.220> blue

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
what we want to do with those mods so we

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.360 
what we want to do with those mods so we
want<00:01:11.000> two<00:01:11.180> tries<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:11.930> want<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.200> stick<00:01:12.409> in<00:01:12.620> pure

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
want two tries we want to stick in pure

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.180 
want two tries we want to stick in pure
vitalization<00:01:14.049> now<00:01:15.049> whatever<00:01:15.409> tear<00:01:15.830> your<00:01:15.979> gear

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
vitalization now whatever tear your gear

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.710 
vitalization now whatever tear your gear
is<00:01:16.370> 21<00:01:16.909> 22<00:01:17.299> 23<00:01:18.040> we're<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.130> between<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:20.479> want<00:01:20.659> to

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
is 21 22 23 we're in between you want to

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.680 
is 21 22 23 we're in between you want to
stick<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.020> irrelevant<00:01:21.670> tier<00:01:22.670> mode<00:01:22.909> in<00:01:23.180> your

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
stick the irrelevant tier mode in your

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.080 
stick the irrelevant tier mode in your
gear<00:01:23.870> since<00:01:24.410> I'm<00:01:24.590> tearful<00:01:25.010> i<00:01:25.190> use

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
gear since I'm tearful i use

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.080 
gear since I'm tearful i use
vitalization<00:01:26.870> for<00:01:27.320> which<00:01:28.280> is<00:01:28.430> increases<00:01:28.910> my

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
vitalization for which is increases my

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
vitalization for which is increases my
vitalization<00:01:29.740> by<00:01:30.740> 19

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.410 

so<00:01:35.370> I've<00:01:36.240> stuck<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.659> vitalization<00:01:37.970> for<00:01:38.970> my

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so I've stuck in vitalization for my

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.830 
so I've stuck in vitalization for my
back<00:01:39.650> waist<00:01:40.909> feet<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.299> hands

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.020 

okay<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.829> now<00:01:46.950> let's<00:01:46.979> move<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.909> blue

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
okay so now let's move on to the blue

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.990 
okay so now let's move on to the blue
socket<00:01:48.710> now<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:49.890> must<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.369> since<00:01:50.850> it's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
socket now for this must do since it's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.219 
socket now for this must do since it's
blue<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.659> still<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> put

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
blue but we still want to put

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.580 
blue but we still want to put
vitalization<00:01:53.179> somehow<00:01:54.179> into<00:01:54.569> the<00:01:54.659> mod<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
vitalization somehow into the mod the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.669 
vitalization somehow into the mod the
best<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.640> go<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.819> it<00:01:57.240> would<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:58.020> vitals<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
best one to go for it would be vitals a

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.850 
best one to go for it would be vitals a
shin<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.009> dominance<00:02:00.289> since<00:02:01.289> dominance<00:02:01.710> is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
shin and dominance since dominance is

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.230 
shin and dominance since dominance is
the<00:02:01.979> blue<00:02:02.159> color<00:02:04.459> we<00:02:05.459> want<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:05.819> we<00:02:05.850> want<00:02:06.179> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the blue color we want to go we want to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.550 
the blue color we want to go we want to
have<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.390> dominance<00:02:06.780> instead<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.350> health

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
have the dominance instead of the health

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
have the dominance instead of the health
so<00:02:08.549> we<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.119> vibration<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.019> dominance<00:02:10.580> because

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
so we go vibration in dominance because

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.309 
so we go vibration in dominance because
some<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> our<00:02:12.060> shields<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.080> quirk<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
some of our shields with a quirk of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.990 
some of our shields with a quirk of
extra<00:02:13.590> dominance<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.750> I'll<00:02:15.750> d<00:02:16.200> buffs<00:02:16.470> and

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
extra dominance and I'll d buffs and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.880 
extra dominance and I'll d buffs and
power<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.090> lime<00:02:18.269> last<00:02:18.510> longer<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.019> do<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.380> how

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
power of lime last longer to do with how

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.650 
power of lime last longer to do with how
much<00:02:20.010> done<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.579> as<00:02:20.670> well<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:24.030> for<00:02:24.569> both

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
much done as we have as well so for both

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.430 
much done as we have as well so for both
blue<00:02:25.019> sockets<00:02:26.750> we<00:02:27.750> both<00:02:27.930> put<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:28.410> put

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
blue sockets we both put we put

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.970 
blue sockets we both put we put
violation<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.250> dominance<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:30.560> which<00:02:31.560> will

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
violation and dominance in it which will

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.140 
violation and dominance in it which will
be<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.599> green<00:02:33.599> exabytes<00:02:34.549> which<00:02:35.549> is<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> mixture

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
be a green exabytes which is a mixture

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.110 
be a green exabytes which is a mixture
of<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.480> yellow<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.959> blue<00:02:37.049> together<00:02:38.120> so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
of the yellow and the blue together so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.700 
of the yellow and the blue together so
it<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.390> fit<00:02:39.420> straight<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> blue<00:02:40.650> socket

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.740 

okay<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.670> let's<00:02:44.850> go<00:02:45.000> straight<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.540> red

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
okay so let's go straight to the red

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.130 
okay so let's go straight to the red
circular<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.060> red<00:02:48.180> socket<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.690> have

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
circular and in the red socket I have

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.970 
circular and in the red socket I have
put<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.800> vitalization<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.880> precision<00:02:51.980> now

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
put in a vitalization and precision now

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.830 
put in a vitalization and precision now
like<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> blue<00:02:53.340> socket<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:54.150> can't<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.510> stick

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
like the blue socket we can't just stick

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
like the blue socket we can't just stick
a<00:02:55.020> pure<00:02:55.230> yellow<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.740> because<00:02:56.040> then<00:02:56.550> we

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
a pure yellow in it because then we

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.790 
a pure yellow in it because then we
wouldn't<00:02:56.880> get<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.630> affinity<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.410> do<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
wouldn't get the affinity to do of the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.460 
wouldn't get the affinity to do of the
armor<00:02:59.240> so<00:03:00.240> what<00:03:00.390> we<00:03:00.480> want<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.630> do<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.440> want

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
armor so what we want to do is we want

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.380 
armor so what we want to do is we want
to<00:03:01.620> put<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.800> Vice<00:03:01.950> citation<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.610> town<00:03:02.850> but

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
to put the Vice citation in a town but

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.280 
to put the Vice citation in a town but
we<00:03:03.480> still<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:03.960> try<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.350> find<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.710> way<00:03:04.860> of

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
we still have to try and find a way of

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.410 
we still have to try and find a way of
making<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.380> go<00:03:07.470> into<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.920> red<00:03:08.160> socket<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.270> get

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
making it go into a red socket so we get

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.700 
making it go into a red socket so we get
the<00:03:09.510> affinity<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.950> what<00:03:11.070> we<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.610> we<00:03:12.270> go<00:03:12.300> in<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
the affinity so what we do is we go in a

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.690 
the affinity so what we do is we go in a
vitalization<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.910> precision<00:03:16.640> now<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
vitalization and precision now the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.230 
vitalization and precision now the
reason<00:03:18.270> why<00:03:18.510> we<00:03:19.500> use<00:03:19.680> position<00:03:20.220> instead<00:03:21.000> of

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
reason why we use position instead of

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.200 
reason why we use position instead of
might<00:03:21.810> force<00:03:22.200> because<00:03:22.850> most<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:23.910> our<00:03:24.030> power

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
might force because most of our power

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.830 
might force because most of our power
regen<00:03:24.630> comes<00:03:25.170> from<00:03:25.410> our<00:03:25.500> weapon<00:03:25.770> combo<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.630> we

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
regen comes from our weapon combo and we

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.340 
regen comes from our weapon combo and we
most<00:03:28.110> only<00:03:28.560> only<00:03:29.370> time<00:03:29.610> we<00:03:29.760> ever<00:03:29.790> use<00:03:30.350> our

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
most only only time we ever use our

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.740 
most only only time we ever use our
powers<00:03:31.710> is<00:03:31.920> for<00:03:32.190> doing<00:03:32.310> power<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.670> time<00:03:32.910> or<00:03:33.690> for

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
powers is for doing power of time or for

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.020 
powers is for doing power of time or for
literally<00:03:34.380> debuff<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.310> we're<00:03:35.730> not<00:03:35.820> really

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
literally debuff it we're not really

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.660 
literally debuff it we're not really
there<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.210> do<00:03:36.420> damage<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> weapon<00:03:38.220> will

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
there to do damage so with a weapon will

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.060 
there to do damage so with a weapon will
be<00:03:38.700> regen<00:03:39.380> regenerating<00:03:40.380> which<00:03:40.740> will<00:03:40.860> be<00:03:40.950> done

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
be regen regenerating which will be done

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.670 
be regen regenerating which will be done
combos<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.550> regen<00:03:41.760> our<00:03:41.880> own<00:03:41.970> power<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.680> with

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
combos to regen our own power and with

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.840 
combos to regen our own power and with
the<00:03:43.770> more<00:03:43.920> position<00:03:44.220> we<00:03:44.310> have<00:03:44.430> will<00:03:44.610> be<00:03:44.700> able

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
the more position we have will be able

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.370 
the more position we have will be able
to<00:03:44.910> do<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.150> bit<00:03:45.330> more<00:03:45.480> damage<00:03:45.840> with<00:03:46.110> our

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
to do that bit more damage with our

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.180 
to do that bit more damage with our
weapon<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:48.720> that's<00:03:48.930> what<00:03:49.080> we<00:03:49.170> use<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.710> both<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
weapon so that's what we use in both the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.300 
weapon so that's what we use in both the
rest<00:03:50.340> sockets

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.020 

so<00:03:54.000> whatever<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:55.069> try<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.340> stick<00:03:56.580> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
so whatever you do try and stick the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.270 
so whatever you do try and stick the
correct<00:03:57.480> color<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:59.520> sockets<00:04:01.069> so<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.160> can

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
correct color in the sockets so you can

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.970 
correct color in the sockets so you can
use<00:04:02.459> all<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.760> correct<00:04:03.090> affinities<00:04:03.920> what<00:04:04.920> you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
use all the correct affinities what you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.470 
use all the correct affinities what you
do<00:04:05.069> not<00:04:05.190> want<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.459> do<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:05.849> you<00:04:05.880> do<00:04:06.060> not<00:04:06.090> want<00:04:06.450> to

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
do not want to do is you do not want to

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.729 
do not want to do is you do not want to
stick<00:04:06.810> pure<00:04:07.290> yellow<00:04:07.470> in<00:04:08.810> your<00:04:09.810> sock<00:04:10.019> in<00:04:10.230> all<00:04:10.560> of

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
stick pure yellow in your sock in all of

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.830 
stick pure yellow in your sock in all of
the<00:04:10.860> sockets<00:04:13.610> because<00:04:14.610> that<00:04:14.760> way<00:04:14.970> if<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.660> did

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
the sockets because that way if you did

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.289 
the sockets because that way if you did
that<00:04:15.870> you'd<00:04:16.829> be<00:04:17.010> missing<00:04:17.220> out<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:17.489> critical

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
that you'd be missing out on critical

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.770 
that you'd be missing out on critical
power<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.630> magnitude<00:04:19.109> critical<00:04:20.100> power<00:04:20.190> chance

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
power of magnitude critical power chance

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.510 
power of magnitude critical power chance
another<00:04:21.780> critical<00:04:22.109> power<00:04:22.320> magnitude<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
another critical power magnitude and

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.820 
another critical power magnitude and
another<00:04:24.480> critical<00:04:24.900> power<00:04:25.260> chance

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.610 

so<00:04:31.430> as<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.580> can<00:04:31.670> see<00:04:32.170> this<00:04:33.170> is<00:04:33.320> pretty<00:04:33.530> much

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
so as you can see this is pretty much

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.670 
so as you can see this is pretty much
how<00:04:34.190> I've<00:04:34.970> mode<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.210> my<00:04:35.330> gear<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:36.410> will

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
how I've mode of my gear and this will

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.370 
how I've mode of my gear and this will
allow<00:04:36.950> me<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:38.000> have<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.020> maximum<00:04:39.350> of

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
allow me to have the maximum of

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.060 
allow me to have the maximum of
isolation<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.280> have<00:04:41.890> for<00:04:42.890> my<00:04:43.010> gear<00:04:44.470> now<00:04:45.470> also<00:04:45.770> is

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
isolation I have for my gear now also is

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.020 
isolation I have for my gear now also is
always<00:04:46.340> handy<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.730> use<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:48.080> vitamin<00:04:48.860> soda<00:04:49.130> to

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
always handy to use a vitamin soda to

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.420 
always handy to use a vitamin soda to
increase<00:04:50.300> your<00:04:50.390> vitalization<00:04:51.310> just<00:04:52.310> so<00:04:52.370> you

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
increase your vitalization just so you

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.460 
increase your vitalization just so you
can<00:04:52.490> give<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:52.730> higher<00:04:53.210> much<00:04:53.540> parts<00:04:53.990> and

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
can give that higher much parts and

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.650 
can give that higher much parts and
regen<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:55.100> much<00:04:55.250> more<00:04:55.430> power<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:59.150> if<00:04:59.390> you<00:04:59.510> can

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
regen that much more power so if you can

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.100 
regen that much more power so if you can
always<00:05:00.200> try<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.500> use<00:05:00.710> vitamin<00:05:01.100> sodas<00:05:01.810> as<00:05:02.810> well
