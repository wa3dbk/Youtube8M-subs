garlic butter for the meat or is this

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.040 
garlic butter for the meat or is this
okay<00:01:59.740> yes<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.820> we<00:02:00.940> have<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.179> butter<00:02:01.390> melted

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.960 
okay yes so we have the butter melted
here<00:02:02.229> already<00:02:02.500> that's<00:02:03.310> actually<00:02:03.460> margarine

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
here already that's actually margarine

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.590 
here already that's actually margarine
and<00:02:04.179> then<00:02:04.750> when<00:02:05.590> veteran<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:07.060> it's<00:02:07.270> it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
and then when veteran it's it's it's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.830 
and then when veteran it's it's it's
it's<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.819> holds<00:02:10.000> better<00:02:10.300> at<00:02:10.690> the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
it's it it holds better at the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.809

restaurant<00:02:11.290> or<00:02:11.590> for<00:02:11.830> longer<00:02:11.950> periods<00:02:12.459> doesn't

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
restaurant or for longer periods doesn't

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.300 
restaurant or for longer periods doesn't
separate<00:02:13.209> okay<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.170> then<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:14.590> have<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.950> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
separate okay so then we have the the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.850 
separate okay so then we have the the
chopped<00:02:15.910> garlic<00:02:16.090> that's<00:02:17.050> pretty<00:02:17.200> simple<00:02:17.680> but

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
chopped garlic that's pretty simple but

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.580 
chopped garlic that's pretty simple but
don't<00:02:18.489> smell<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:18.880> that's<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.410> then

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
don't smell that that's it and then

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.890 
don't smell that that's it and then
don't<00:02:21.519> get<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.360> had<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.540> little<00:02:22.690> bit<00:02:22.870> of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
don't get it we had a little bit of

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.780 
don't get it we had a little bit of
vegetable<00:02:23.350> oil<00:02:23.440> which<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.370> meaning

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
vegetable oil which is a meaning

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.979 
vegetable oil which is a meaning
greeting<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.120> margarine<00:02:25.450> anyway<00:02:25.780> but

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
greeting in the margarine anyway but

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.440 
greeting in the margarine anyway but
that<00:02:26.140> keeps<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.610> liquid<00:02:27.610> at<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> lower

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
that keeps it liquid at a lower

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.020 
that keeps it liquid at a lower
temperature<00:02:28.799> ok<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.430> that's<00:02:30.610> pretty<00:02:30.790> simple

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
temperature ok so that's pretty simple

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.670 
temperature ok so that's pretty simple
it<00:02:31.239> doesn't<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.750> cook<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.230> else<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.620> need

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
it doesn't have to cook just else I need

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.199 
it doesn't have to cook just else I need
