cocktail machine but actually you find
that<00:02:35.090> your<00:02:35.209> hole<00:02:35.329> decides<00:02:35.719> like<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.170> and

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
that your hole decides like this and

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.789 
that your hole decides like this and
it's<00:02:36.680> fuzzy<00:02:36.859> to<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.189> Holdren<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.180> control

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
it's fuzzy to the Holdren and control

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.530 
it's fuzzy to the Holdren and control
using<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.829> ust<00:02:40.189> thumbs<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.969> the<00:02:41.030> vibe<00:02:41.209> under
