species<00:01:06.160> I<00:01:06.610> just<00:01:07.060> love<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.510> way<00:01:07.540> that<00:01:07.630> they

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
species I just love the way that they

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.440 
species I just love the way that they
are<00:01:08.440> able<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.920> passively<00:01:09.910> move<00:01:10.150> through<00:01:10.360> the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
are able to passively move through the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.520 
are able to passively move through the
water<00:01:10.600> are<00:01:11.380> they<00:01:11.530> dangerous<00:01:11.710> at<00:01:12.009> all

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
water are they dangerous at all

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.650 
water are they dangerous at all
technically<00:01:14.530> probably<00:01:15.100> not<00:01:15.399> but<00:01:15.729> I<00:01:16.270> think

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
technically probably not but I think

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.880 
technically probably not but I think
they<00:01:16.780> could<00:01:17.020> be<00:01:17.170> if<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.440> handle<00:01:17.770> them

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
they could be if you handle them

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.120 
they could be if you handle them
properly<00:01:18.130> or<00:01:18.550> you<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.960> ran<00:01:20.470> into<00:01:20.500> them<00:01:20.890> in<00:01:21.039> the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
properly or you you ran into them in the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.499 
properly or you you ran into them in the
wrong<00:01:21.250> circumstances<00:01:21.520> they<00:01:22.180> do<00:01:22.240> have

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
wrong circumstances they do have

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.389 
wrong circumstances they do have
stingers<00:01:23.080> on<00:01:23.320> their<00:01:23.470> tails<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.070> they<00:01:24.160> can

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
stingers on their tails and they can

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.950 
stingers on their tails and they can
potentially<00:01:24.850> sting<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.479> although<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.810> don't

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
potentially sting you although I don't

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.570 
potentially sting you although I don't
think<00:01:26.320> purposefully<00:01:26.950> they<00:01:27.100> would<00:01:27.250> do<00:01:27.399> that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
think purposefully they would do that

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.550 
think purposefully they would do that
plus<00:01:27.880> they<00:01:28.060> were<00:01:28.090> defending<00:01:28.570> themselves<00:01:28.720> so

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
plus they were defending themselves so

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.080 
plus they were defending themselves so
where<00:01:29.979> would<00:01:30.130> we<00:01:30.280> natively<00:01:30.610> find<00:01:30.940> these

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
where would we natively find these

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.210 
where would we natively find these
pieces<00:01:31.300> well<00:01:32.289> these<00:01:32.410> guys<00:01:32.590> are<00:01:32.770> Caribbean

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
a pretty pretty big area so I take it by

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.650 
a pretty pretty big area so I take it by
the<00:01:45.430> size<00:01:45.729> of<00:01:45.910> them<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.390> feed<00:01:46.599> him

in their diet these guys eat a lot of

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.800 
in their diet these guys eat a lot of
different<00:01:50.789> stuff<00:01:51.789> here<00:01:52.030> at<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.209> aquarium<00:01:52.420> we

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
different stuff here at the aquarium we

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.589 
different stuff here at the aquarium we
feed<00:01:52.990> them<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.200> mixture<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.709> shellfish<00:01:54.459> and<00:01:54.789> cut

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599

things<00:01:59.050> of<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.289> nature<00:01:59.319> whens<00:02:00.099> feeding<00:02:00.429> time

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
things of that nature whens feeding time

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.880 
things of that nature whens feeding time
I<00:02:00.670> think<00:02:00.819> I'd<00:02:00.910> like<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.090> show<00:02:01.330> up<00:02:01.509> they<00:02:02.500> get<00:02:02.649> fed

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
I think I'd like to show up they get fed

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.499 
I think I'd like to show up they get fed
three<00:02:03.130> times<00:02:03.340> actually<00:02:03.640> some<00:02:04.149> of<00:02:04.179> them<00:02:04.390> get

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
three times actually some of them get

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.389 
three times actually some of them get
fed<00:02:04.720> every<00:02:04.929> day<00:02:04.959> but<00:02:05.170> majority<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:06.009> them<00:02:06.220> get

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
fed every day but majority of them get

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.669
