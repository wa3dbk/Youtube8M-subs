00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
the way also the first thing I notice

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.380 
the way also the first thing I notice
about<00:00:17.710> these<00:00:17.860> clasps<00:00:18.189> was<00:00:18.490> his<00:00:18.640> cast<00:00:18.939> metal

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
about these clasps was his cast metal

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.390 
about these clasps was his cast metal
body<00:00:19.630> where<00:00:19.990> everybody<00:00:20.380> else<00:00:20.619> uses<00:00:20.920> a<00:00:21.130> piece

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
of stamped steel this body is way more

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.189 
of stamped steel this body is way more
rugged<00:00:24.789> plus<00:00:25.359> it<00:00:25.509> gives<00:00:25.630> them<00:00:25.840> some<00:00:26.019> options

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199

that you won't see on other lever clamps
an<00:00:28.660> important<00:00:29.650> feature<00:00:29.890> is<00:00:30.160> just<00:00:30.189> how<00:00:30.519> this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
an important feature is just how this

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.840 
an important feature is just how this

clamp locks into the T track it does use

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.880 
clamp locks into the T track it does use
the<00:00:34.000> t-bolt<00:00:34.240> and<00:00:34.690> you<00:00:35.170> put<00:00:35.350> these<00:00:35.530> screws<00:00:35.770> and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
the t-bolt and you put these screws and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
either side to the T track you just

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.020 
either side to the T track you just
insert<00:00:44.140> this<00:00:44.260> clamp<00:00:44.560> into<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.010> T<00:00:45.220> track<00:00:45.520> slide

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
insert this clamp into the T track slide

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.850 
insert this clamp into the T track slide
it<00:00:46.180> to<00:00:46.330> where<00:00:46.450> you<00:00:46.570> want<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:46.900> and<00:00:47.080> then<00:00:47.650> turn

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
it to where you want it and then turn

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.890 
it to where you want it and then turn
his<00:00:48.070> finger<00:00:48.400> dial<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:48.850> lock<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.240> t-bolt<00:00:49.690> into

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
his finger dial to lock the t-bolt into

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.860 
his finger dial to lock the t-bolt into
the<00:00:50.170> track<00:00:50.820> even<00:00:51.820> after<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.180> clamp<00:00:52.450> is<00:00:52.600> locked

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
the track even after the clamp is locked

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.990

into<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.290> T<00:00:53.500> track<00:00:53.860> you<00:00:54.310> still<00:00:54.520> have<00:00:54.700> a<00:00:54.790> lotta

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
into the T track you still have a lotta

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.970 
into the T track you still have a lotta
justement<00:00:55.600> because<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:56.050> steel<00:00:56.320> bar<00:00:56.650> can<00:00:56.950> be

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
justement because the steel bar can be

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.800 
justement because the steel bar can be
moved<00:00:57.310> frontwards<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:57.910> backwards<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.540> that

moved frontwards and backwards and that

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.860 
moved frontwards and backwards and that
has<00:00:58.990> no<00:00:59.260> effect<00:00:59.410> on<00:00:59.770> the<00:00:59.920> clamping<00:01:00.340> pressure

has no effect on the clamping pressure
you<00:01:01.870> turn<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.320> screw<00:01:02.650> to<00:01:02.800> control<00:01:03.190> how<00:01:03.370> much

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
you turn the screw to control how much

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.070 
you turn the screw to control how much

clamping pressure you want to apply you

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.599 
clamping pressure you want to apply you
can<00:01:08.200> put<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.530> hole<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.979> handles<00:01:09.399> you<00:01:09.460> can

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:09.609 
can put a hole in the handles you can

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.300 
can put a hole in the handles you can
get<00:01:09.789> at<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.090> screw<00:01:10.359> directly<00:01:10.979> when<00:01:11.979> satisfied

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
get at the screw directly when satisfied

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.219
