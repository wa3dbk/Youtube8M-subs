with<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.640> bet<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.420> else<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.780> think<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
with the bet what else do you think of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.990 
with the bet what else do you think of
Sri<00:00:34.290> Lanka's<00:00:34.620> problems<00:00:35.040> well<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.910> think

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
Sri Lanka's problems well I think

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.389 
Sri Lanka's problems well I think
technically<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.690> knew<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> struggle<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:38.070> far<00:00:38.309> as

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
technically we knew a struggle as far as

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.709 
technically we knew a struggle as far as
scoring<00:00:38.670> runs<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:38.969> concerned<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.510> these

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
scoring runs are concerned on these

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.180 
scoring runs are concerned on these
wickets<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.230> also<00:00:40.410> thought<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
wickets we also thought that the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
wickets we also thought that the
evolving<00:00:41.489> attack<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:42.320> pedestrian<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
evolving attack was pedestrian and I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.920 
evolving attack was pedestrian and I
would<00:00:43.829> not<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.399> also<00:00:44.640> Africa<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.300> twice<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
would not do also Africa out twice and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.330 
would not do also Africa out twice and
that's<00:00:46.230> exactly<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:46.829> happened<00:00:47.160> then

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that's exactly what happened then

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.250 
that's exactly what happened then
there's<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.059> much<00:00:48.270> pressure<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.840> kumar

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
there's so much pressure on kumar
