00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
think they don't care about that but

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.749 
think they don't care about that but
when<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.479> first<00:01:29.660> baby<00:01:29.899> comes<00:01:30.319> or<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.369> pet

when the first baby comes or the pet
gets<00:01:32.030> sick<00:01:32.330> or<00:01:32.690> they're<00:01:33.530> taking<00:01:33.709> care<00:01:34.039> of<00:01:34.069> the

mother-in-law<00:01:34.490> all<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.660> that<00:01:35.810> becomes<00:01:36.080> really

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
mother-in-law all of that becomes really

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.919 
mother-in-law all of that becomes really
important<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:37.130> would<00:01:37.640> describe<00:01:37.910> my<00:01:38.209> style<00:01:38.300> as

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
important I would describe my style as

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.919 
important I would describe my style as
classic<00:01:39.740> with<00:01:39.979> global<00:01:40.399> influence<00:01:40.910> first<00:01:41.720> and

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
classic with global influence first and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.020 
classic with global influence first and
foremost<00:01:42.349> the<00:01:42.649> spaces<00:01:43.099> we<00:01:43.220> design<00:01:43.580> need<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:43.910> be

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
foremost the spaces we design need to be

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.570 
foremost the spaces we design need to be
comfortable<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:45.319> I<00:01:45.349> also<00:01:45.649> think<00:01:46.069> that<00:01:46.130> each

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
comfortable but I also think that each

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.699 
comfortable but I also think that each
piece<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.390> space<00:01:47.599> has<00:01:47.929> to<00:01:47.959> have<00:01:48.200> meaning

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
piece in the space has to have meaning

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.949 
piece in the space has to have meaning
and<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:49.069> special<00:01:49.429> quality<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.149> as<00:01:50.300> well<00:01:50.479> we

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
and a special quality to it as well we

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.930 
and a special quality to it as well we
always<00:01:51.229> get<00:01:51.440> input<00:01:51.619> from<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.160> kids<00:01:52.399> from<00:01:52.880> the
