think they're all similar because I said

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.070 
think they're all similar because I said
this<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.850> first<00:02:17.090> one<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.390> had<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.870> play

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
this is the first one that I had to play

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.800 
this is the first one that I had to play
with<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:19.069> want<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> do<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.569> want<00:02:20.750> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
with you want to do this you want to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.680 
with you want to do this you want to
fool<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.680> when<00:02:22.489> take<00:02:22.700> his<00:02:22.850> legs<00:02:23.150> turn

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
fool like that when take his legs turn

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.259 
fool like that when take his legs turn
the<00:02:23.840> feet<00:02:24.080> around<00:02:24.489> sort<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.549> like<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.030> I

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
the feet around sort of like this I

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.259 
the feet around sort of like this I
think<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.560> then<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.610> think<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:28.880> put<00:02:29.060> them<00:02:29.150> like

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
think and then I think you put them like

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.740 
think and then I think you put them like
this<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.850> yet<00:02:31.850> tuck<00:02:32.090> them<00:02:33.430> maybe<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:35.329> tuck

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
this and yet tuck them maybe you tuck

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.350 
this and yet tuck them maybe you tuck
them<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.420> front<00:02:38.660> like<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:40.360> something

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
them up to the front like so something

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.030 
them up to the front like so something
like<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:45.260> ball<00:02:45.470> joints<00:02:45.739> are<00:02:45.859> kind

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
like this and the ball joints are kind

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.710 
like this and the ball joints are kind
of<00:02:46.070> rubberized<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.910> they're<00:02:47.060> kind<00:02:47.239> of<00:02:47.390> tight

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
of rubberized so they're kind of tight

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.319 
of rubberized so they're kind of tight
which<00:02:48.049> is<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.320> guess<00:02:48.350> good<00:02:48.739> for<00:02:48.950> playability

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
which is I guess good for playability

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.330 
which is I guess good for playability
you<00:02:50.329> know<00:02:50.450> me<00:02:50.660> my<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:51.109> stuff<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.769> sits<00:02:52.190> on

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
you know me my just stuff just sits on

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.440 
you know me my just stuff just sits on
the<00:02:52.400> Shelf<00:02:52.790> mostly<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.290> kind<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.590> do<00:02:54.739> that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the Shelf mostly so you kind of do that

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.539 
the Shelf mostly so you kind of do that
right<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:58.190> that's<00:02:58.370> kind<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.880> plane<00:02:59.269> mode

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
right and that's kind of the plane mode

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.400 
right and that's kind of the plane mode
fold<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:01.700> down<00:03:03.070> sort<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.160> like<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:05.410> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
fold this down sort of like this and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.030 
fold this down sort of like this and
then<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.340> take<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:07.970> rest<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:09.079> it<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.620> kind<00:03:09.920> of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
then you take the rest of it and kind of

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.210 
then you take the rest of it and kind of
pic<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.269> i<00:03:11.600> think<00:03:12.040> like<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:14.920> or<00:03:15.920> maybe

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
pic it in i think like this or maybe

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.530 
pic it in i think like this or maybe
like<00:03:16.489> this<00:03:16.760> yeah<00:03:17.530> into<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.709> peggle<00:03:19.700> here<00:03:20.239> you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
like this yeah into the peggle here you

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.360 
like this yeah into the peggle here you
can<00:03:20.720> kind<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:20.989> move<00:03:21.380> these<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.920> make<00:03:22.100> them<00:03:22.250> look

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
can kind of move these to make them look

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.920 
can kind of move these to make them look
like<00:03:23.829> jet<00:03:24.829> ports<00:03:25.250> or<00:03:25.400> something<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.600> as<00:03:26.810> you

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
like jet ports or something so as you

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.330 
like jet ports or something so as you
know<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.079> did<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.579> bionicle<00:03:28.579> miss<00:03:28.730> prime<00:03:29.180> our

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
know I did the bionicle miss prime our

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.960 
know I did the bionicle miss prime our
a<00:03:30.450> few<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.569> them<00:03:31.750> for<00:03:32.530> my<00:03:32.650> godson<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.220> because

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
a few of them for my godson and because

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.830 
a few of them for my godson and because
of<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.239> kind<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.599> stuff<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.660> can

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
of this kind of stuff and then you can

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.030 
of this kind of stuff and then you can
do<00:03:37.989> whatever<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.319> want<00:03:38.470> with<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.650> wings<00:03:38.860> I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
do whatever you want with the wings I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.100 
do whatever you want with the wings I
guess<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.640> can<00:03:39.790> become<00:03:40.450> like<00:03:40.660> this<00:03:40.840> or

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
guess so you can become like this or

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.720 
guess so you can become like this or
like<00:03:41.140> this<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.860> is<00:03:42.610> pretty<00:03:42.819> much<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:44.730> and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
like this so this is pretty much it and

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.690 
like this so this is pretty much it and
you<00:03:46.120> could<00:03:46.300> slap<00:03:46.569> on<00:03:46.810> these<00:03:47.590> cannons<00:03:48.310> wherever

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
you could slap on these cannons wherever

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.630 
you could slap on these cannons wherever
you<00:03:48.819> like<00:03:49.030> on<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.360> wings<00:03:49.599> or<00:03:50.459> things<00:03:51.459> like

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
you like on the wings or things like

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.420 
you like on the wings or things like
that<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:54.310> kind<00:03:54.580> of<00:03:54.670> like<00:03:54.819> that<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.920> what<00:03:57.280> do<00:03:57.370> I

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
that so kind of like that so what do I

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.949 
that so kind of like that so what do I
think<00:03:57.760> we<00:03:58.299> yeah<00:04:00.390> yeah<00:04:01.390> not<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.410> sure<00:04:02.620> anyway<00:04:03.310> um

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
think we yeah yeah not so sure anyway um

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.839 
think we yeah yeah not so sure anyway um
it's<00:04:04.959> about<00:04:05.230> 12<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.769> 15<00:04:05.890> bucks<00:04:06.340> depending<00:04:06.549> on

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
it's about 12 to 15 bucks depending on

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.699 
it's about 12 to 15 bucks depending on
where<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.090> are<00:04:07.239> in<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.420> world<00:04:07.450> if<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.530> want

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
where you are in the world if you want

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.900 
where you are in the world if you want
to<00:04:08.769> buy<00:04:08.950> one<00:04:08.980> knock<00:04:09.489> yourself<00:04:09.880> out<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:12.760> Lego

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
to buy one knock yourself out is it Lego

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.660 
to buy one knock yourself out is it Lego
compatible<00:04:13.569> or<00:04:13.720> Bionicle<00:04:14.319> compatible<00:04:14.890> the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
compatible or Bionicle compatible the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.250 
compatible or Bionicle compatible the
holes<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.479> stuff<00:04:16.630> seem<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.410> be<00:04:18.030> close<00:04:19.229> so<00:04:20.229> that

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
holes and stuff seem to be close so that

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.450 
holes and stuff seem to be close so that
might<00:04:20.590> work<00:04:20.829> in<00:04:21.040> some<00:04:21.389> some<00:04:22.389> way<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:24.220> kind<00:04:24.430> of

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
might work in some some way it kind of

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.969 
might work in some some way it kind of
does<00:04:24.669> so<00:04:25.120> that's<00:04:25.840> interesting<00:04:26.380> so<00:04:26.410> the

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
does so that's interesting so the

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.700 
does so that's interesting so the
technique<00:04:27.669> or<00:04:27.850> barnacle<00:04:28.300> pin<00:04:28.630> sizes<00:04:29.229> fit<00:04:29.530> in

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
technique or barnacle pin sizes fit in

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.409 
technique or barnacle pin sizes fit in
the<00:04:29.830> hole<00:04:30.039> so<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.400> guess<00:04:30.639> maybe<00:04:31.000> just<00:04:31.270> can

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
the hole so I guess maybe just can

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.790 
the hole so I guess maybe just can
paddle<00:04:31.600> with<00:04:31.750> your<00:04:31.810> Bionicle<00:04:32.350> maybe<00:04:32.620> that's

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
paddle with your Bionicle maybe that's

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.540 
paddle with your Bionicle maybe that's
their<00:04:33.010> plan<00:04:33.160> not<00:04:33.550> sure<00:04:33.840> anyway<00:04:34.840> guys<00:04:34.990> that's

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
their plan not sure anyway guys that's

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.409 
their plan not sure anyway guys that's
my<00:04:36.550> review<00:04:37.830> again<00:04:38.830> I'm<00:04:39.250> not<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:39.729> sure<00:04:39.760> I'd<00:04:40.090> buy

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
my review again I'm not so sure I'd buy

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.850 
my review again I'm not so sure I'd buy
another<00:04:40.690> one<00:04:40.870> but<00:04:41.080> as<00:04:41.200> i<00:04:41.289> said<00:04:41.320> i<00:04:41.530> didn't<00:04:41.740> pay
