00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
Saracens took one of the biggest

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.710 
Saracens took one of the biggest
differences<00:00:04.609> between<00:00:04.670> playing<00:00:05.210> off<00:00:05.510> to<00:00:05.660> us

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
differences between playing off to us

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.629 
differences between playing off to us
and<00:00:05.930> they're<00:00:06.019> playing<00:00:06.200> at<00:00:06.410> Saracen<00:00:06.859> Oh<00:00:07.160> first

and they're playing at Saracen Oh first
of<00:00:07.760> all<00:00:07.910> the<00:00:08.029> way<00:00:08.179> there<00:00:08.360> I<00:00:09.130> think<00:00:10.130> it's

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
of all the way there I think it's

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.270 
of all the way there I think it's
actually<00:00:11.210> we<00:00:11.990> actually<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.560> basics<00:00:13.010> is<00:00:13.160> so

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
actually we actually the basics is so

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.009 
actually we actually the basics is so
important<00:00:13.700> for<00:00:13.730> active<00:00:14.120> player<00:00:14.330> playing<00:00:14.690> and

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
important for active player playing and

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.660 
important for active player playing and
playing<00:00:15.349> in<00:00:15.500> England<00:00:15.830> where<00:00:16.070> you<00:00:16.280> go<00:00:16.460> through

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
playing in England where you go through

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.029 
playing in England where you go through
a<00:00:16.730> stage<00:00:17.000> where<00:00:17.470> everybody<00:00:18.470> is<00:00:18.590> as<00:00:18.710> quick<00:00:18.890> as

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
a stage where everybody is as quick as

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.220 
a stage where everybody is as quick as
an<00:00:19.160> x-ray<00:00:19.490> and<00:00:20.210> you're<00:00:20.420> playing<00:00:20.570> in<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.020> worst

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
an x-ray and you're playing in the worst

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.260 
an x-ray and you're playing in the worst
way<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:21.590> you<00:00:21.710> can<00:00:21.860> possibly<00:00:22.039> think<00:00:22.340> of<00:00:22.699> and<00:00:22.760> I

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
way that you can possibly think of and I

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.689 
way that you can possibly think of and I
think<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:23.900> as<00:00:24.050> a<00:00:24.080> player<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:24.740> just<00:00:24.949> get<00:00:25.130> molded

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
think it as a player you just get molded

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.760 
think it as a player you just get molded
in<00:00:25.850> a<00:00:25.940> way<00:00:26.090> that<00:00:26.330> you<00:00:26.480> actually<00:00:26.660> don't<00:00:27.590> just

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
in a way that you actually don't just

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.010 
in a way that you actually don't just
get<00:00:28.070> away<00:00:28.190> with<00:00:28.580> so<00:00:29.240> I<00:00:29.270> figure<00:00:29.600> the<00:00:29.689> guys<00:00:29.810> have

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
get away with so I figure the guys have

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.750 
get away with so I figure the guys have
massively<00:00:30.380> big<00:00:30.650> quick<00:00:31.250> and<00:00:31.460> they've<00:00:31.550> been<00:00:31.730> all

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
massively big quick and they've been all

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.319 
massively big quick and they've been all
fools<00:00:32.379> I<00:00:33.379> think<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.069> Blaine<00:00:35.030> there's<00:00:35.269> a

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
fools I think that Blaine there's a

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.759 
fools I think that Blaine there's a
rocky<00:00:35.539> place<00:00:35.809> now<00:00:36.109> so<00:00:36.379> there's<00:00:36.589> a<00:00:36.649> good

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
rocky place now so there's a good

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.619 
rocky place now so there's a good
experience<00:00:37.219> for<00:00:37.309> me<00:00:37.429> to<00:00:37.699> to<00:00:38.179> play<00:00:38.389> in<00:00:38.449> Europe

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
experience for me to to play in Europe

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.029 
experience for me to to play in Europe
for<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:38.989> bit<00:00:39.139> but<00:00:39.289> obviously<00:00:39.440> there's<00:00:40.179> pictures

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
for a bit but obviously there's pictures

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.489 
for a bit but obviously there's pictures
and<00:00:43.059> also<00:00:44.059> like<00:00:44.359> playing<00:00:44.780> with<00:00:44.960> out<00:00:45.109> of<00:00:45.170> theme

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
and also like playing with out of theme

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.860 
and also like playing with out of theme
children<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:46.370> would<00:00:46.579> get<00:00:47.089> the<00:00:47.239> goal<00:00:47.420> you

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
children so you would get the goal you

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.419 
children so you would get the goal you
get<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.199> penalty<00:00:48.499> you<00:00:48.829> get<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.069> conversion

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
get the penalty you get the conversion

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.439 
get the penalty you get the conversion
and<00:00:50.120> then<00:00:50.329> just<00:00:50.600> just<00:00:51.019> crowd<00:00:51.350> noise<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:52.449> don't
