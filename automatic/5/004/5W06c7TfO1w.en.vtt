and every stadium around Brazil we have

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.910 
and every stadium around Brazil we have
to<00:00:49.820> integrate<00:00:50.210> in<00:00:50.330> each<00:00:50.479> stadium<00:00:50.930> 14<00:00:51.530> cameras

to integrate in each stadium 14 cameras
and<00:00:52.670> for<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:52.970> we<00:00:53.210> have<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.540> bring<00:00:53.750> up<00:00:53.900> the

and for that we have to bring up the
cameras<00:00:54.379> on<00:00:54.650> catwalks<00:00:57.220> then<00:00:58.220> we<00:00:58.369> have<00:00:58.519> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.939 
cameras on catwalks then we have to
place<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.210> cameras<00:00:59.540> on<00:00:59.869> on<00:01:00.290> its<00:01:00.470> positions

which we have selected and we have to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.630 
which we have selected and we have to
focus<00:01:03.680> them<00:01:04.010> on<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.250> goals

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.270 

then<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.240> integrate<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.619> cables<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
then we have to integrate the cables to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
then we have to integrate the cables to
link<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.579> cables<00:01:11.939> from<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> camera<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.079> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
link the cables from the camera to the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.710 
link the cables from the camera to the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
calculate all image processing data the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.109 
calculate all image processing data the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
computers come plug and plays so we can

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
computers come plug and plays so we can
