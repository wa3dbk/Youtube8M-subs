exactly what I'm gonna be doing in the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.680 
exactly what I'm gonna be doing in the
workplace<00:01:51.040> rather<00:01:51.670> than<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.970> simulation<00:01:52.600> of

so<00:01:57.190> all<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.700> little<00:01:58.330> quirks<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:58.930> come

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
so all of the little quirks that come

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.470 
so all of the little quirks that come
with<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.440> hardware<00:01:59.740> the<00:02:00.280> little<00:02:00.520> things<00:02:01.360> you

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
with the hardware the little things you

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.240 
with the hardware the little things you
have<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.660> keep<00:02:01.900> an<00:02:01.990> eye<00:02:02.110> on<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.830> only<00:02:03.010> learn

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
have to keep an eye on you only learn

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.800 
have to keep an eye on you only learn
that<00:02:03.490> by<00:02:03.640> interacting<00:02:04.120> with<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.450> real<00:02:04.630> stuff

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
that by interacting with the real stuff

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.900 
that by interacting with the real stuff
so<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.710> was<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.950> main<00:02:06.370> reason<00:02:06.400> for<00:02:06.730> coming

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
so that was the main reason for coming

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.060 
so that was the main reason for coming
here<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.900> is<00:02:07.960> very<00:02:08.170> important<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.830> have

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
here and this is very important to have

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.820 
here and this is very important to have
to<00:02:09.670> access<00:02:09.850> your<00:02:10.269> real<00:02:10.450> equipment<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.320> all
