on<00:01:45.270> my<00:01:45.570> end<00:01:45.780> pure<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.409> total<00:01:46.950> speculation<00:01:47.340> but

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
on my end pure and total speculation but

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.690 
on my end pure and total speculation but
I<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.210> imagine<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.659> any<00:01:48.930> iphone<00:01:49.860> 5s<00:01:50.340> Apple

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
I would imagine that any iphone 5s Apple

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730 
I would imagine that any iphone 5s Apple
had<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.090> house<00:01:51.420> would<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.810> dismantled<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
had in house would be dismantled and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.859 
had in house would be dismantled and
repurposed<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> iphone<00:01:54.000> 5c<00:01:54.450> since<00:01:54.750> they

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
repurposed for the iphone 5c since they

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.179 
repurposed for the iphone 5c since they
have<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> same<00:01:55.320> guts<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> same

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
have the same guts in the same

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.740 
have the same guts in the same
dimensions<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> five<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.600> have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
dimensions of the five they just have

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
dimensions of the five they just have
that<00:01:57.899> polycarbonate<00:01:58.560> back<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.700> know

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that polycarbonate back I don't know

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.730 
that polycarbonate back I don't know
that<00:02:00.360> we'll<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.570> seeing<00:02:01.020> any<00:02:01.229> like

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that we'll be seeing any like

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740 
that we'll be seeing any like
third-party<00:02:02.399> retailers<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> fire

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
third-party retailers get like a fire

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.899 
third-party retailers get like a fire
sale<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.290> stock<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> iphone<00:02:05.280> 5<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.759> not

really<00:02:06.119> how<00:02:06.240> Apple<00:02:06.689> sort<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> functions<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
really how Apple sort of functions but I

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.240 
really how Apple sort of functions but I
do<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.899> still<00:02:10.289> at<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.009> time

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
do think that you are still at this time

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.440 
do think that you are still at this time
able<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> sort<00:02:12.060> of

Kevin Driscoll 13 says do you think

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.930 
Kevin Driscoll 13 says do you think
apples<00:02:24.420> ibeacon<00:02:24.989> will<00:02:25.410> overtake<00:02:25.860> NFC<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.730> do

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
apples ibeacon will overtake NFC or do

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
apples ibeacon will overtake NFC or do
you<00:02:27.030> think<00:02:27.060> it'll<00:02:27.390> fade<00:02:27.629> out<00:02:27.810> an<00:02:28.019> apple<00:02:28.440> will

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you think it'll fade out an apple will

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.979 
you think it'll fade out an apple will
support<00:02:29.010> NFC<00:02:29.370> later<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.360> actually<00:02:30.840> an

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
support NFC later this is actually an

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.979 
support NFC later this is actually an
awesome<00:02:31.860> question<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.660> certainly<00:02:33.660> this

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
awesome question because certainly this

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.620 
awesome question because certainly this
is<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> battle<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.489> know<00:02:35.640> different<00:02:35.970> near

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
is a battle of you know different near

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.979 
is a battle of you know different near
field<00:02:36.959> communication<00:02:38.269> projects<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.480> really

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
field communication projects I really

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.690 
field communication projects I really
think<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.650> going<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.099> be<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> case<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.430> who

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
think this is going to be a case of who

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.089 
think this is going to be a case of who
makes<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.120> killer<00:02:42.510> application<00:02:42.890> for<00:02:43.890> either

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
makes a killer application for either

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.640 
makes a killer application for either
tech<00:02:44.519> first<00:02:44.910> not<00:02:45.180> necessarily<00:02:45.810> an<00:02:45.930> app<00:02:46.170> but<00:02:46.560> an

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
tech first not necessarily an app but an

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.160 
tech first not necessarily an app but an
application<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.760> real-world<00:02:48.239> use<00:02:48.930> case

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
application so a real-world use case

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.949 
application so a real-world use case
that<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.560> amazing<00:02:50.340> super<00:02:51.209> compelling<00:02:51.569> and

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
that is amazing super compelling and

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.410 
that is amazing super compelling and
basically<00:02:52.920> makes<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.400> mandatory<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.180> have

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
basically makes it mandatory to have

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.569 
basically makes it mandatory to have
that<00:02:54.870> technology<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> phone<00:02:55.980> there's

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
that technology and a phone there's

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.970 
that technology and a phone there's
really<00:02:56.760> not<00:02:57.090> one<00:02:57.480> mega<00:02:57.989> reason<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.650> NFC

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
really not one mega reason to have NFC

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.490 
really not one mega reason to have NFC
right<00:02:59.310> now<00:02:59.459> or<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.700> beacon<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> first<00:03:00.900> OS

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
right now or I beacon and the first OS

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.620 
right now or I beacon and the first OS
to<00:03:01.769> utilize<00:03:02.220> their<00:03:02.519> respective<00:03:03.150> technology

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
to utilize their respective technology

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.839 
to utilize their respective technology
is<00:03:03.810> gonna<00:03:04.079> likely<00:03:04.500> dominate<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.040> think<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.730> it

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
is gonna likely dominate so think of it

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.600 
is gonna likely dominate so think of it
like<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.269> blu-ray<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.019> HD<00:03:07.140> DVD<00:03:07.920> war<00:03:08.190> at<00:03:08.340> some

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
like the blu-ray and HD DVD war at some

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.460 
like the blu-ray and HD DVD war at some
point<00:03:08.910> one<00:03:09.239> has<00:03:09.480> got<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.810> give<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.230> I

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
point one has got to give so I

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.289 
point one has got to give so I
definitely<00:03:10.980> think<00:03:11.220> at<00:03:11.430> some<00:03:11.640> point<00:03:11.700> we'll<00:03:12.060> see

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
definitely think at some point we'll see

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.080 
definitely think at some point we'll see
who<00:03:12.480> wins<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.930> war<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.620> think<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.610> beacon

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
who wins the war on it I think I beacon

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.130 
who wins the war on it I think I beacon
on<00:03:15.180> one<00:03:15.329> hand<00:03:15.510> has<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> lot<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.870> really

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
on one hand has a lot of really

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.020 
on one hand has a lot of really
interesting<00:03:16.290> potential<00:03:16.950> applications<00:03:17.790> but

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
interesting potential applications but

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.020 
interesting potential applications but
NFC<00:03:18.510> does<00:03:18.690> too<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.590> already<00:03:19.799> in<00:03:20.010> use<00:03:20.220> like

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
NFC does too and is already in use like

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.449 
NFC does too and is already in use like
relatively<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.959> it's<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:22.470> proprietary<00:03:22.950> or

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
relatively and it's not proprietary or

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.250 
relatively and it's not proprietary or
locked<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.120> Apple<00:03:24.420> devices<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.079> is<00:03:25.230> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
locked to just Apple devices so it is a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.729 
locked to just Apple devices so it is a
toss-up<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.150> don't<00:03:27.150> forget<00:03:27.420> apple<00:03:28.019> doesn't

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
toss-up and don't forget apple doesn't

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.620 
toss-up and don't forget apple doesn't

on<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.460> cusp<00:04:29.639> of<00:04:29.880> like<00:04:30.090> when<00:04:30.300> we<00:04:30.449> started

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
on the cusp of like when we started

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.960 
on the cusp of like when we started
getting<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.620> internet<00:04:32.009> when<00:04:32.400> we<00:04:32.580> started

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
getting the internet when we started

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.520 
getting the internet when we started
seeing<00:04:33.180> video<00:04:33.509> games<00:04:33.780> really<00:04:34.080> come<00:04:34.289> into<00:04:34.440> its

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
seeing video games really come into its

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.010 
seeing video games really come into its
own<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.699> just<00:04:35.910> sort<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.240> ended<00:04:36.660> up<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:36.930> the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
own so I just sort of ended up in the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.510 
own so I just sort of ended up in the
right<00:04:37.229> place<00:04:37.470> at<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.680> right<00:04:37.770> time<00:04:37.889> in<00:04:38.310> terms

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520
