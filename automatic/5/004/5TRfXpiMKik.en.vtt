00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
through that to create the same type of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.580 
through that to create the same type of
effect<00:01:05.750> interesting<00:01:06.750> how<00:01:06.869> technologies

effect interesting how technologies
change<00:01:07.979> things<00:01:08.280> now<00:01:08.490> let's<00:01:08.970> look<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.240> what<00:01:09.450> we

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
change things now let's look at what we

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
change things now let's look at what we
have<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.490> before<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> pin

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
have we have just like before a pin

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
have we have just like before a pin
okay<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.799> controls<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.520> focus<00:01:14.880> by<00:01:15.060> clicking

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
okay this controls the focus by clicking

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.249 
okay this controls the focus by clicking
and<00:01:15.570> dragging<00:01:19.850> we<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.060> move<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.450> by<00:01:21.990> clicking

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
and dragging we can move it by clicking

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.100 
and dragging we can move it by clicking
right<00:01:22.590> here

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.110 

the<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.620> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.250> by<00:01:26.400> clicking

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
the one if you want to just by clicking

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.540 
the one if you want to just by clicking
somewhere<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:28.080> won't<00:01:28.260> but<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
somewhere we won't but you can if you

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.160 
somewhere we won't but you can if you
need<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.880> than<00:01:29.940> one<00:01:30.060> you've<00:01:30.300> got<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.690> moving

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
need more than one you've got it moving

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.500 
need more than one you've got it moving
back<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.710> pin<00:01:32.070> right<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:33.120> have<00:01:33.300> these

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
back to the pin right here we have these

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.770 
back to the pin right here we have these
four<00:01:33.810> objects<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.800> two<00:01:35.310> three<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> four

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
four objects here one two three and four

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440 
four objects here one two three and four
and<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.080> control<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.860> amount<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.400> blur<00:01:38.820> from

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and they control the amount of blur from

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
and they control the amount of blur from
sharp<00:01:40.050> focus<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:41.190> where<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> begins<00:01:41.700> right

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
sharp focus to where it begins right

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.820 
sharp focus to where it begins right
here<00:01:42.330> so<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:43.080> get<00:01:43.410> here<00:01:43.620> and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
here so we can actually get here and

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.660 
here so we can actually get here and
decrease<00:01:44.580> that<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.410> well<00:01:46.950> increase<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
decrease that or we can well increase it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.230 
decrease that or we can well increase it
if<00:01:47.760> we<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.860> here's<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.950> trick<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.060> hold

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
if we want to here's a trick if you hold

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
if we want to here's a trick if you hold
down<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> Alt<00:01:51.510> key<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> option

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
down the Alt key and that's the option

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.070 
down the Alt key and that's the option
key<00:01:52.830> on<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> Mac<00:01:53.160> Alt<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.700> Windows<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.390> grab<00:01:54.780> one

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
key on a Mac Alt in Windows and grab one

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.900 
key on a Mac Alt in Windows and grab one
of<00:01:55.110> these<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:56.910> will<00:01:57.060> control<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:58.080> that<00:01:58.380> one

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
of these it will control just that one

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.080 
of these it will control just that one
so<00:01:59.910> maybe<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.540> want<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.170> little<00:02:01.470> less<00:02:01.890> blur<00:02:02.670> on

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so maybe we want a little less blur on

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.740 
so maybe we want a little less blur on
the<00:02:03.119> left<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> right<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:05.180> more<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.479> the

shift key you can stretch it in or out
without<00:02:38.310> rotating<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.299> up<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.930> of

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
without rotating it's up to you and of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.630 
without rotating it's up to you and of
course<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:41.010> up<00:02:41.130> here<00:02:41.190> would<00:02:41.430> do<00:02:41.519> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
course this one up here would do the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.150 
course this one up here would do the
same<00:02:41.790> thing<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:42.720> we<00:02:42.810> click<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:44.070> go

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
same thing if we click on it we can go

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.860 
same thing if we click on it we can go
up<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.519> down<00:02:44.700> holding<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.209> shift<00:02:45.450> key<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
up and down holding the shift key so it

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.570 
up and down holding the shift key so it
doesn't<00:02:46.110> rotate<00:02:46.260> or<00:02:46.650> not<00:02:46.920> hold<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.250> shift<00:02:47.430> key

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
doesn't rotate or not hold a shift key

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.940 
doesn't rotate or not hold a shift key
so<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.850> does<00:02:48.000> rotate<00:02:48.209> let<00:02:49.170> me<00:02:49.290> bring<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.620> in

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
so it does rotate let me bring that in

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.840 
so it does rotate let me bring that in
just<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.580> little<00:02:50.820> bit<00:02:50.940> more<00:02:51.209> on<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.570> sign

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
just a little bit more on the sign

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.240 
just a little bit more on the sign
saying<00:02:53.850> about<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.769> once<00:02:56.070> you've

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
saying about like that so once you've

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.030 
saying about like that so once you've
got<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> established<00:02:57.360> what<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.870> want<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.890> can

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
then come up here and change the blur

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.100 
then come up here and change the blur
you<00:03:01.080> can<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.320> over<00:03:01.440> here<00:03:01.650> too<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.700> can

you can do it over here too and we can

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.450 
you can do it over here too and we can
increase<00:03:04.110> our<00:03:04.820> blur

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
increase our blur

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.360 
increase our blur
soft<00:03:07.940> vignette<00:03:08.800> again<00:03:09.800> of<00:03:09.920> course<00:03:09.950> if<00:03:10.250> you

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
soft vignette again of course if you

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
like it you can save it but we have

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.330 
like it you can save it but we have
another<00:03:12.080> option<00:03:12.530> up<00:03:12.650> here<00:03:12.860> now<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:13.160> called

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
another option up here now it's called

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.640 
another option up here now it's called
focus<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:14.420> what<00:03:14.540> does<00:03:14.630> that<00:03:14.660> do<00:03:14.870> well<00:03:15.500> it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
focus and what does that do well it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.070 
focus and what does that do well it
changes<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.310> focus<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.030> sharp<00:03:17.300> area<00:03:17.660> so

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
changes the focus of the sharp area so

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.630 
changes the focus of the sharp area so
you<00:03:18.140> have<00:03:18.290> two<00:03:18.410> areas<00:03:18.740> now<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.190> got<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:19.430> one

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
you have two areas now you got this one

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.910 
you have two areas now you got this one
that's<00:03:19.790> out<00:03:19.880> focus<00:03:20.300> this<00:03:20.720> one's<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.200> focus<00:03:21.710> if

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
that's out focus this one's in focus if

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.100 
that's out focus this one's in focus if
you<00:03:22.430> want<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.700> change<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:25.960> now<00:03:26.960> give

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
you want to change that you can now give

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.340 
you want to change that you can now give
you<00:03:27.230> one<00:03:27.470> tip<00:03:27.770> if<00:03:28.010> you're<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.250> web<00:03:28.550> designer<00:03:29.350> if

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
you one tip if you're a web designer if

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.710 
you one tip if you're a web designer if
you<00:03:30.620> take<00:03:30.890> images<00:03:31.070> slightly<00:03:31.940> out<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.180> focus

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
you take images slightly out of focus

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.500 
you take images slightly out of focus
not<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.140> lot<00:03:33.500> but<00:03:33.950> just<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.250> little<00:03:34.400> bit<00:03:34.550> and<00:03:35.390> you

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
not a lot but just a little bit and you

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.840 
not a lot but just a little bit and you
save<00:03:35.780> them<00:03:35.930> as<00:03:36.080> JPEGs<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:37.010> can<00:03:37.220> save<00:03:37.490> them<00:03:37.640> in

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
save them as JPEGs you can save them in

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.120 
save them as JPEGs you can save them in
a<00:03:38.090> smaller<00:03:38.420> file<00:03:38.690> size<00:03:38.930> then<00:03:39.590> things<00:03:39.860> that<00:03:39.950> are

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
a smaller file size then things that are
