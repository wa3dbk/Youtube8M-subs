ride on them and we can go into war path
now<00:02:07.050> kind<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.140> counter<00:02:08.530> his<00:02:08.679> right<00:02:08.890> on<00:02:09.040> his

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
now kind of counter his right on his

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.850 
now kind of counter his right on his
accuracy<00:02:10.240> sucks<00:02:10.660> now<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.050> he<00:02:11.170> might<00:02:11.320> miss<00:02:11.560> but

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
accuracy sucks now so he might miss but

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.320 
accuracy sucks now so he might miss but
he<00:02:11.890> didn't<00:02:12.220> he<00:02:12.310> come<00:02:12.459> matchbox<00:02:12.670> laid<00:02:13.090> off<00:02:13.240> from

he didn't he come matchbox laid off from

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.510 
he didn't he come matchbox laid off from
my<00:02:13.420> warpath<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.080> he'll<00:02:14.800> probably<00:02:15.040> switch

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
my warpath and he'll probably switch
