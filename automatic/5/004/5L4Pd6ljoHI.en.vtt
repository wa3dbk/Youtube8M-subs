 in addition to the main causes of the accident 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 by then 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.010
 it will be next to the Catholics

 sooner this weaker body makes you want to the day 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.110
 from first to first reading we can say that the defense has 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.360
 worked and I had to set it to music and start a little at the very 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.720
 very careful in trichet 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.240
 to an innate talent for reading such results I could add a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.869
 thing 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.160

 only this 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.200
 from what I saw this misunderstanding to permira 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.939

 he lacks individual control 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.319

 just miss completely lack of efficiency another opportunity
