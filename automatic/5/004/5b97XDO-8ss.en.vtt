demo of the Nokia Maps application and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.470 
demo of the Nokia Maps application and
also<00:00:09.929> check<00:00:10.200> out<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.679> GPS<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.090> specific

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
also check out the GPS on this specific

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.390 
also check out the GPS on this specific
smartphone<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> Nokia<00:00:14.309> Maps

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
smartphone so here is a Nokia Maps

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.000 
smartphone so here is a Nokia Maps
application<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.389> location<00:00:15.809> settings<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.500> on

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
application the location settings are on

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.320 
application the location settings are on
which<00:00:17.940> means<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> maps<00:00:18.750> would<00:00:18.960> actually

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
which means that the maps would actually

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.720 
which means that the maps would actually
use<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.539> GPS<00:00:21.930> feature<00:00:22.109> let<00:00:23.070> me<00:00:23.189> escape<00:00:23.310> onto

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
use the GPS feature let me escape onto

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.390 
use the GPS feature let me escape onto
the<00:00:23.850> current<00:00:24.060> location<00:00:24.449> feature<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.439> let's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the current location feature and let's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.099 
the current location feature and let's
see<00:00:26.580> how<00:00:26.730> long<00:00:26.910> does<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.180> take<00:00:27.449> per<00:00:27.570> device<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
see how long does it take per device to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:46.639 
see how long does it take per device to
locate<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.650> current<00:00:28.920> location<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> here

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.080 

so<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> location<00:00:47.789> which<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.449> map<00:00:48.690> shows<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
so the location which this map shows is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
so the location which this map shows is
perfect<00:00:51.090> its<00:00:51.440> exact<00:00:52.440> location<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:53.070> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
perfect its exact location which is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.670 
perfect its exact location which is
being<00:00:53.399> shown<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.469> using

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
being shown up here and this is using

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
being shown up here and this is using
the<00:00:56.010> Nokia<00:00:56.699> Maps<00:00:56.879> service<00:00:59.210> let<00:01:00.210> me<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.570> try

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the Nokia Maps service let me just try

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.899 
the Nokia Maps service let me just try
to<00:01:00.780> search<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.379> nearby<00:01:01.680> location<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.729> if

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
to search a nearby location and see if

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:12.510 
to search a nearby location and see if
it<00:01:03.149> works

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.750 

let's<00:01:13.520> go<00:01:13.700> forget<00:01:14.150> directions<00:01:18.610> so<00:01:19.610> it's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
let's go forget directions so it's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.270 
let's go forget directions so it's
perfectly<00:01:20.150> showing<00:01:20.510> up<00:01:20.720> these<00:01:21.230> details<00:01:21.620> we

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
perfectly showing up these details we

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.570 
perfectly showing up these details we
also<00:01:22.490> have<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:22.850> option<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.950> navigation<00:01:24.950> which

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
also have a option of navigation which

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.310 
also have a option of navigation which
actually<00:01:26.030> should<00:01:26.300> be<00:01:26.330> covered<00:01:26.930> that's<00:01:27.200> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
actually should be covered that's the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.720 
actually should be covered that's the
specific<00:01:27.530> different<00:01:27.980> application<00:01:28.400> which<00:01:28.550> has

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
specific different application which has

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.400 
specific different application which has
to<00:01:28.880> be<00:01:28.970> downloaded<00:01:29.230> following<00:01:30.230> which<00:01:30.380> the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
to be downloaded following which the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.190 
to be downloaded following which the
navigations<00:01:31.600> service<00:01:32.600> would<00:01:32.780> show<00:01:33.140> perfectly

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
navigations service would show perfectly

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.080 
navigations service would show perfectly
so<00:01:36.200> once<00:01:36.440> installation<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:37.010> done<00:01:37.100> we<00:01:38.060> can
