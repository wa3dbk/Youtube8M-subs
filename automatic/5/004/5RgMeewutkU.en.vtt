to<00:00:34.920> upgrade<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> prime<00:00:36.170> can't

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
to upgrade it to the prime can't

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.959 
to upgrade it to the prime can't
remember<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.469> much<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.649> costs<00:00:38.309> under<00:00:38.760> five

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.200 
remember how much it costs under five
bucks<00:00:39.270> though<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:41.059> basically<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
bucks though but and basically the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.540 
bucks though but and basically the
concept<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.800> customize<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
concept is that you can customize the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.660 
concept is that you can customize the
entire<00:00:45.140> operating<00:00:46.140> system<00:00:46.289> again<00:00:47.160> without

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
entire operating system again without

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.000 
entire operating system again without
rooting<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.730> it's<00:00:50.730> stuff<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:52.010> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
rooting it and it's stuff that you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.260 
rooting it and it's stuff that you
wouldn't<00:00:53.280> even<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.940> would<00:00:54.090> need

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
wouldn't even think that you would need

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.889 
wouldn't even think that you would need
until<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.020> try<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.770> quite<00:00:56.899> amazing
