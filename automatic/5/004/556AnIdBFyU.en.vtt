00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
and now we'll take the next signature

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.010 
and now we'll take the next signature
put<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.270> in<00:00:03.449> place<00:00:05.390> line<00:00:06.390> it<00:00:06.509> up<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.810> head

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
put this in place line it up to the head

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.990 
put this in place line it up to the head
and<00:00:07.760> I'll<00:00:08.760> punch<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:10.260> holes<00:00:10.500> from<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.639> inside

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
and I'll punch the holes from the inside

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.870 
and I'll punch the holes from the inside
out<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:13.200> my<00:00:13.410> little<00:00:14.480> pin<00:00:15.480> here<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:19.880> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
out with my little pin here and the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.580 
out with my little pin here and the
thread<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.240> kind<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> short<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:21.990> I'm<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
thread is kind of short so I'm going to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
thread is kind of short so I'm going to
tie<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> knot<00:00:23.130> inside<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.939> I'll<00:00:24.000> show<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.330> how

tie a knot inside and I'll show you how

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.060 
tie a knot inside and I'll show you how
we<00:00:24.630> do<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:26.430> open<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> book<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:30.890> take<00:00:31.890> my

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
we do that so open the book up take my

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.930 
we do that so open the book up take my
scissors<00:00:32.360> clip<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> string<00:00:37.700> take<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> new

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
scissors clip the string take a new

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.139 
scissors clip the string take a new
piece<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.329> thread<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.550> thread<00:00:41.910> I'm

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
piece of thread and with this thread I'm

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.430 
piece of thread and with this thread I'm
going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> make<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> loop<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:45.870> little<00:00:46.170> tail

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
going to make a loop with a little tail

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.459 
going to make a loop with a little tail
sticking<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:48.180> want<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> loop<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.440> be

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
sticking up and I want the loop to be

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
sticking up and I want the loop to be
formed<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> tail<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.149> underneath

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
formed so that the tail is underneath

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.860 
formed so that the tail is underneath
the<00:00:52.289> thread<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.280> sticks<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.760> then<00:00:54.750> I'll

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the thread and it sticks up then I'll

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
the thread and it sticks up then I'll
take<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> old<00:00:55.440> thread<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> book

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
take the old thread that's in the book

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.490 
take the old thread that's in the book
and<00:00:57.149> make<00:00:58.020> another<00:00:58.230> loop<00:00:59.539> I'm<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.780> stick

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and make another loop I'm going to stick

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.850 
and make another loop I'm going to stick
that<00:01:01.530> through<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> hole<00:01:02.239> wrap<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.480> loop

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
that through the hole wrap this loop

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.899 
that through the hole wrap this loop
over<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.939> tail<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.510> sticks<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
over that little tail that sticks up and

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.550 
over that little tail that sticks up and
then<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.240> take<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:09.840> tail<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
then you just take that little tail and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.030 
then you just take that little tail and
you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.369> pull<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> knot<00:01:12.590> where<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you can pull the knot where you want it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.289 
you can pull the knot where you want it
to<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.310> inside<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> book<00:01:16.040> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.299> bowline

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
to be inside the book this is a bowline

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
to be inside the book this is a bowline
knot<00:01:20.750> now<00:01:21.750> I'll<00:01:21.960> take<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.530> couple<00:01:23.220> lengths<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
knot now I'll take a couple lengths of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:35.569 
knot now I'll take a couple lengths of
thread<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:34.320> I'll<00:01:34.590> release<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> tension<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
thread and I'll release the tension of

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
thread and I'll release the tension of
the<00:01:35.640> thread<00:01:35.700> by<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.390> pulling<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.780> lightly

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the thread by just pulling it lightly

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.170 
the thread by just pulling it lightly
between<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.530> fingers<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> should<00:01:39.030> always

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
between my fingers and you should always

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
between my fingers and you should always
do<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.140> know<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> new<00:01:40.530> piece<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
do this you know for a new piece of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.429 
do this you know for a new piece of
thread<00:01:41.130> especially<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:41.790> thin<00:01:42.060> ones

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
thread especially these thin ones

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
thread especially these thin ones
because<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.649> don't<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> it'll<00:01:44.460> knot<00:01:44.759> up

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
because if you don't do it it'll knot up

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.880 
because if you don't do it it'll knot up
when<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.630> put<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> see<00:01:46.200> how<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> knots<00:01:46.590> there

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
when you put it see how it knots there

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.760 
when you put it see how it knots there
it'll<00:01:47.399> knot<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.530> right<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.649> your

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it'll knot up like that right in your

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
it'll knot up like that right in your
book<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.250> won't<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.759> able<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.119> get

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
book and you won't be able to like get

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
book and you won't be able to like get
it<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.509> very<00:01:51.750> easily<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it out very easily so I do this like you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.359 
it out very easily so I do this like you
know<00:01:53.610> twice<00:01:54.000> once<00:01:54.659> very<00:01:55.200> loosely<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
know twice once very loosely and then a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.609 
know twice once very loosely and then a
little<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:56.939> more<00:01:57.149> pressure<00:01:57.659> between<00:01:58.259> my

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
little bit more pressure between my

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.639 
little bit more pressure between my
fingernail<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:01.079> finger<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
fingernail and the and the finger to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.940 
fingernail and the and the finger to
release<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> tension<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> thread

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.120 

now<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.010> rethread<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.610> needle<00:02:15.980> push<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
now to rethread the needle push the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.240 
now to rethread the needle push the
thread<00:02:17.400> through<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.820> eye<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:19.130> then<00:02:20.130> I'm

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
thread through the eye and then I'm

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.990 
thread through the eye and then I'm
going<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.730> flatten<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.050> thread<00:02:22.380> slightly

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
going to flatten the thread slightly

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.370 
going to flatten the thread slightly
like<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.570> then<00:02:24.720> push<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.170> needle

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
like this and then push the needle

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
like this and then push the needle
through<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.280> thread<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:28.910> then<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.000> can<00:02:30.120> just

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
through the thread and then you can just

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.900 
through the thread and then you can just
pull<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.630> down<00:02:30.710> like<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.670> goes

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
pull this down like that and this goes

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.880 
pull this down like that and this goes
around<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.330> end<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> thread<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.710> right

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
around the end of the thread the right

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.430 
around the end of the thread the right
end<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.220> needle<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.760> stays<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.290> now

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
end of the needle and it stays on so now

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:56.390 
end of the needle and it stays on so now
we<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.680> continue<00:02:43.860> sewing<00:02:44.370> all<00:02:44.670> along

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.750 

and<00:02:57.080> when<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.170> pull<00:02:58.379> always<00:02:58.830> pull<00:02:59.129> along<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
and when you pull always pull along the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.940 
and when you pull always pull along the
spine<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.379> tend<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.620> pull<00:03:01.799> like

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
spine like this if you tend to pull like

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.949 
spine like this if you tend to pull like
this<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.370> may<00:03:02.549> rip<00:03:03.330> your<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.870> know

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
this you may rip your you know

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.449 
this you may rip your you know
signatures<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.920> pulled<00:03:05.159> this<00:03:05.280> way

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
signatures but like you pulled this way

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.910 
signatures but like you pulled this way
you'll<00:03:06.090> always<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.260> know<00:03:07.409> your<00:03:07.650> your

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you'll always have you know your your

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:18.800 
you'll always have you know your your
proper<00:03:08.280> tension<00:03:16.129> okay<00:03:17.299> getting<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.659> end

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
proper tension okay getting to the end

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.780 
proper tension okay getting to the end
of<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.099> make<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> kettle

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
of this and now to make the kettle

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
of this and now to make the kettle
stitch<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:22.250> set<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.340> needle<00:03:23.640> between<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.629> last

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
stitch I set the needle between the last

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.649 
stitch I set the needle between the last
two<00:03:25.049> some<00:03:25.409> join<00:03:25.950> signatures<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.730> then<00:03:27.420> push

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
two some join signatures and then push

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.490 
two some join signatures and then push
that<00:03:27.840> up<00:03:28.110> through<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.500> loop<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.010> pull<00:03:30.500> this

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
that up through the loop and pull this

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.869 
that up through the loop and pull this
thread<00:03:31.829> up<00:03:32.010> pulling<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.489> little<00:03:32.640> bit<00:03:32.730> of

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
thread up pulling a little bit of

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.180 
thread up pulling a little bit of
pressure<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.739> book<00:03:34.920> itself<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
pressure on the on the book itself and

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.410 
pressure on the on the book itself and
that's<00:03:38.190> all<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.549> need<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:39.000> little<00:03:39.209> bit<00:03:39.329> of

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
that's all you need just a little bit of

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.170 
that's all you need just a little bit of
firm<00:03:39.629> pressure<00:03:40.220> with<00:03:41.220> these<00:03:41.370> thin<00:03:41.609> threads<00:03:42.000> if

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
firm pressure with these thin threads if

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.140 
firm pressure with these thin threads if
you<00:03:42.269> pull<00:03:42.540> too<00:03:42.720> hard<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.409> break<00:03:43.650> them<00:03:44.150> so

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
you pull too hard you can break them so

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.330 
you pull too hard you can break them so
now<00:03:45.329> we'll<00:03:45.510> start<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.870> next<00:03:46.049> signature<00:03:47.040> and

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
now we'll start the next signature and

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.949 
now we'll start the next signature and
I'll<00:03:47.489> sell<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.879> long<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.269> show<00:03:48.480> your<00:03:48.629> kettle

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
I'll sell this long and show your kettle

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.569 
I'll sell this long and show your kettle
at<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.140> other<00:03:49.260> end<00:03:49.530> which<00:03:50.099> is<00:03:50.250> really<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
at the other end which is really the

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:57.860 
at the other end which is really the
same<00:03:50.760> thing<00:03:53.720> pre<00:03:54.720> punching<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:57.180> makes<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.690> a

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
same thing pre punching this makes it a

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:25.670 
same thing pre punching this makes it a
lot<00:03:58.019> easier<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:59.510> sew<00:04:00.510> quickly

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.430 

and<00:04:26.190> again<00:04:26.550> always<00:04:26.850> pull<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.660> thread<00:04:27.990> along

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
and again always pull the thread along

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.320 
and again always pull the thread along
the<00:04:28.860> spine<00:04:30.199> that<00:04:31.699> put<00:04:32.699> this<00:04:32.850> down<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.180> little

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
the spine that put this down a little

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:42.010 
the spine that put this down a little
bit<00:04:33.479> more<00:04:33.750> pressure<00:04:34.320> here

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:51.610 

the<00:04:43.009> next<00:04:43.280> one<00:04:44.259> here<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:49.690> then<00:04:50.690> push<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
the next one here and then push the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.170 
the next one here and then push the
needle<00:04:51.860> between<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.160> last<00:04:52.430> two<00:04:52.759> joined

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
needle between the last two joined

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.909 
needle between the last two joined
signatures<00:04:54.280> out<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.639> tail<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.560> up<00:04:57.560> through

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
signatures out the tail and up through

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.460 
signatures out the tail and up through
the<00:04:58.009> loop<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.750> you<00:04:59.750> notice<00:04:59.990> I'm<00:05:00.110> holding<00:05:00.410> this

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
the loop and you notice I'm holding this

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.770 
the loop and you notice I'm holding this
down<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.009> then<00:05:01.340> tight<00:05:01.729> there's<00:05:02.389> our<00:05:02.599> finished

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
down and then tight there's our finished

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.070 
down and then tight there's our finished
kettle<00:05:03.259> stitch<00:05:07.330> I'm<00:05:08.330> going<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.599> show<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:08.840> the

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
kettle stitch I'm going to show you the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.860 
kettle stitch I'm going to show you the
knot<00:05:09.199> now<00:05:09.470> with<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:09.740> piece<00:05:10.069> of<00:05:10.250> graph<00:05:10.580> hem<00:05:11.449> cord

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
knot now with a piece of graph hem cord

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.689 
knot now with a piece of graph hem cord
because<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:12.800> weren't<00:05:13.039> able<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.310> see<00:05:13.550> that

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
because you weren't able to see that

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.370 
because you weren't able to see that
very<00:05:14.000> clearly<00:05:14.210> in<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.599> last<00:05:14.810> part<00:05:15.199> of<00:05:15.320> the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
very clearly in the last part of the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.710 
very clearly in the last part of the
video<00:05:15.610> so<00:05:16.610> what<00:05:16.759> you're<00:05:16.880> going<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.090> do<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.479> take

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
video so what you're going to do is take

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.469 
video so what you're going to do is take
your<00:05:17.900> old<00:05:18.410> piece<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:18.889> or<00:05:19.639> the<00:05:19.820> pieces<00:05:20.150> actually

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
your old piece of or the pieces actually

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.900 
your old piece of or the pieces actually
in<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.720> book<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.139> make<00:05:21.770> a<00:05:21.800> loop<00:05:22.130> with<00:05:22.370> the

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
in the book and make a loop with the

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.850 
in the book and make a loop with the
tail<00:05:23.180> like<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:24.229> make<00:05:24.440> sure<00:05:24.590> that<00:05:24.710> the

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
tail like this and make sure that the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.270 
tail like this and make sure that the
tail<00:05:25.099> is<00:05:25.310> underneath<00:05:25.789> the<00:05:26.120> main<00:05:26.300> part<00:05:26.660> of<00:05:26.780> the

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
tail is underneath the main part of the

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.860 
tail is underneath the main part of the
of<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.849> cord<00:05:29.259> then<00:05:30.259> with<00:05:30.440> your<00:05:30.560> new<00:05:30.740> thread

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
of the cord then with your new thread

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.010 
of the cord then with your new thread
you'll<00:05:32.870> make<00:05:33.050> another<00:05:33.289> loop<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:34.750> you'll<00:05:35.750> push

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
you'll make another loop and you'll push

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.999 
you'll make another loop and you'll push
this<00:05:36.259> through<00:05:36.590> and<00:05:36.979> over<00:05:37.940> that<00:05:38.419> tail<00:05:38.860> then<00:05:39.860> all

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
this through and over that tail then all

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.100 
this through and over that tail then all
you<00:05:40.130> do<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.400> grab<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.759> tail<00:05:40.970> and<00:05:41.000> pull<00:05:41.270> and

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
you do is grab the tail and pull and

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.920 
you do is grab the tail and pull and
this<00:05:42.800> puts<00:05:43.280> you<00:05:43.430> not<00:05:43.639> exactly<00:05:44.419> where<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.720> want

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
this puts you not exactly where you want

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.040 
this puts you not exactly where you want
it<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.110> go<00:05:45.289> into<00:05:45.909> into<00:05:46.909> the<00:05:47.000> book<00:05:47.210> and<00:05:47.479> you'll

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
it to go into into the book and you'll

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.800 
it to go into into the book and you'll
trim<00:05:48.320> these<00:05:48.500> edges<00:05:49.060> you<00:05:50.060> know<00:05:50.180> make<00:05:50.659> them

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
trim these edges you know make them

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.529 
trim these edges you know make them
shorter<00:05:53.080> now<00:05:54.080> I'll<00:05:54.380> do<00:05:54.590> that<00:05:54.710> again<00:05:55.509> take<00:05:56.509> your

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
shorter now I'll do that again take your

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.950 
shorter now I'll do that again take your
old<00:05:56.840> piece<00:05:57.080> of<00:05:57.110> thread<00:05:58.419> make<00:05:59.419> a<00:05:59.449> loop<00:05:59.719> so<00:05:59.930> that

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
old piece of thread make a loop so that

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.100 
old piece of thread make a loop so that
the<00:06:00.199> tail<00:06:00.440> is<00:06:00.620> underneath<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.340> main<00:06:01.550> part<00:06:01.880> and

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
the tail is underneath the main part and

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.230 
the tail is underneath the main part and
stands<00:06:03.110> up<00:06:03.409> like<00:06:04.340> this<00:06:05.320> take<00:06:06.320> your<00:06:06.440> new<00:06:06.650> thread

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
stands up like this take your new thread

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.540 
stands up like this take your new thread
make<00:06:08.240> a<00:06:08.270> loop<00:06:08.599> you<00:06:09.560> make<00:06:09.770> a<00:06:09.800> long<00:06:10.070> loop<00:06:10.310> and

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
make a loop you make a long loop and

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.230 
make a loop you make a long loop and
then<00:06:11.979> push<00:06:12.979> it<00:06:13.159> through<00:06:13.370> and<00:06:14.590> over<00:06:15.880> that<00:06:16.880> piece

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
then push it through and over that piece

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.110 
then push it through and over that piece
grab<00:06:17.780> it<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.050> pull<00:06:18.560> and<00:06:18.860> there<00:06:19.699> you<00:06:19.849> have<00:06:20.090> your

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
grab it and pull and there you have your

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.459 
grab it and pull and there you have your
knot

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.639 

and<00:06:27.999> this<00:06:28.999> is<00:06:29.149> how<00:06:29.300> we<00:06:29.360> finish<00:06:29.899> the<00:06:29.929> the<00:06:30.469> last

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:30.649 
and this is how we finish the the last

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.889 
and this is how we finish the the last
stitch<00:06:30.919> off<00:06:31.219> I've<00:06:31.699> sewn<00:06:32.089> the<00:06:32.240> last<00:06:32.389> signature

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:32.899 
stitch off I've sewn the last signature

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:34.959 
stitch off I've sewn the last signature
on<00:06:33.050> and<00:06:33.349> I'm<00:06:33.889> going<00:06:34.129> to<00:06:34.219> do<00:06:34.339> the<00:06:34.459> cattle<00:06:34.759> in<00:06:34.849> the

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
on and I'm going to do the cattle in the

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:37.299 
on and I'm going to do the cattle in the
traditional<00:06:35.479> way<00:06:35.619> which<00:06:36.619> is<00:06:36.800> to<00:06:36.889> put<00:06:37.099> it<00:06:37.189> out

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:37.309 
traditional way which is to put it out

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.339 
traditional way which is to put it out
through<00:06:37.699> here<00:06:37.969> and<00:06:38.179> then<00:06:38.929> bring<00:06:39.110> it<00:06:39.139> up

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
through here and then bring it up

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.909 
through here and then bring it up
through<00:06:39.649> the<00:06:39.770> loop<00:06:39.979> and<00:06:41.349> hold<00:06:42.349> the<00:06:42.499> tension

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
through the loop and hold the tension

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.649 
through the loop and hold the tension
and<00:06:43.069> then<00:06:43.610> we'll<00:06:43.729> do<00:06:43.849> one<00:06:44.059> more<00:06:44.089> cattle

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
and then we'll do one more cattle

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:50.350 
and then we'll do one more cattle
between<00:06:45.020> the<00:06:45.800> last<00:06:46.009> two<00:06:46.249> signatures<00:06:47.319> and<00:06:49.360> this

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
between the last two signatures and this

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.369 
between the last two signatures and this
is<00:06:50.509> all<00:06:50.659> you<00:06:50.779> need<00:06:50.899> to<00:06:51.110> finish<00:06:51.259> off<00:06:51.589> the<00:06:51.969> sewing

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:53.379 
is all you need to finish off the sewing

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.260 
is all you need to finish off the sewing
so<00:06:54.379> I'll<00:06:54.439> cut<00:06:54.770> this<00:06:54.919> with<00:06:55.129> Vata<00:06:55.429> an<00:06:55.669> inch<00:06:55.999> left

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
so I'll cut this with Vata an inch left

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.329 
so I'll cut this with Vata an inch left
and<00:06:56.509> when<00:06:56.899> we<00:06:57.050> glue<00:06:57.229> this<00:06:57.379> down<00:06:57.439> that<00:06:58.039> will<00:06:58.189> go

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:58.339 
and when we glue this down that will go

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:00.279 
and when we glue this down that will go
in<00:06:58.519> between<00:06:58.550> you<00:06:59.389> know<00:06:59.419> the<00:06:59.629> signatures<00:07:00.080> like

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
in between you know the signatures like

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.559 
in between you know the signatures like
that
