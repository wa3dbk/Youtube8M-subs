00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.750
 here we are back on the pc 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.019
 we will do a data transfer from 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.389
 the device evolves on the computer 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.469
 so new we chose we saw it on 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.610
 the ground just now a pass 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.500
 parallel that is to say that we can 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.029
 zigzag back or forth 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.490
 parallels that much more accurate 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.099
 with a number of passengers the impulse 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:30.630
 of 10 we tell him ok and he will transfer 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 automatically through bluetooth through there 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.550
 top whose usb key automatically this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.750
 that we have in the central unit of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.129
 knockaÃ«rt evolution on the pc so he 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.910
 need some connection time 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.170
 So here we are 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.260
 log on 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.089
 at the computer we will let him do it 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.949
 so that's the system we see 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.280
 there the screen these systems so of 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.690
 visualization of oca an evolution on 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.690
 can meanwhile there look 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.750
 some examples we will take by 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.210
 example 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.000
 so that's an example on the ground 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.569
 with here we can see it on the screen 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.409
 with precisely down a cache so a 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.780
 transversal box that gives it will have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.860
 of course we can move 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.840
 the example in every way it's not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.170
 it's not a support 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.190
 yeah that gives this is so there we have 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.409
 two potentially interesting targets 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.119
 so there it is for an object that has been 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.209
 which is in the ground one can also 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.360
 as it is a ground radar look through 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.560
 example a gallery so there it is very 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.770
 typical in a gallery 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.289
 we can see it here a top so the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.979
 radar crossing 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.659
 maybe that's a little bit more 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.350
 speaking like this so here we can 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.350
 determine which gallery is here 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.000
 here we are going to let the transfer 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.000
 connected to the computer
