general and I'll tell you why about that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.260 
general and I'll tell you why about that
in<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> second<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.520> other<00:01:35.640> aspect<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.150> this

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
in a second so the other aspect of this

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.179 
in a second so the other aspect of this
device<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.470> dual<00:01:37.799> SIM<00:01:38.159> device

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
device I like it it's a dual SIM device

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.700 
device I like it it's a dual SIM device
you've<00:01:38.759> got<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.180> two<00:01:39.509> SIM<00:01:40.079> card<00:01:40.320> slot<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you've got one two SIM card slot it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.609 
you've got one two SIM card slot it
takes<00:01:40.890> full-size<00:01:41.549> Sims<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.750> nano<00:01:42.990> sim<00:01:43.350> Stone

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
takes full-size Sims not nano sim Stone

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.340 
takes full-size Sims not nano sim Stone
magazine<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> actually<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.420> micro

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
magazine so I actually have a a micro

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.840 
magazine so I actually have a a micro
sim<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.280> doesn't<00:01:47.579> work<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
sim in there and it doesn't work it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.910 
sim in there and it doesn't work it
needs<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.149> full<00:01:48.420> size<00:01:48.720> SIM<00:01:49.049> card<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.740> either

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
needs a full size SIM card so you either

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460 
needs a full size SIM card so you either
get<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> sim<00:01:50.460> adapter<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> use<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.509> device

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
get a sim adapter to use this device

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
get a sim adapter to use this device
here<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> also<00:01:53.399> has<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> micro<00:01:54.119> SD<00:01:54.540> card

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
here and it also has a micro SD card

so you have Windows 8.1 you have Cortana
you<00:02:16.379> can<00:02:16.530> actually<00:02:16.680> use<00:02:17.040> Cortana<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
you can actually use Cortana here and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.910 
you can actually use Cortana here and
you<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:20.010> also<00:02:20.159> ask<00:02:20.370> Cortana<00:02:20.670> questions<00:02:21.239> like

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
you can also ask Cortana questions like

system and it runs fairly well I really

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.589 
system and it runs fairly well I really
like<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.340> fact<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.790> functions<00:02:51.030> or<00:02:51.420> runs

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
like the fact that it functions or runs

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.039 
like the fact that it functions or runs
well

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049

system<00:03:22.019> now<00:03:22.560> like<00:03:22.889> I<00:03:23.010> mentioned<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.730> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
system now like I mentioned this is a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.520 
system now like I mentioned this is a
dual<00:03:24.060> SIM<00:03:24.389> device<00:03:24.419> so<00:03:24.959> if<00:03:25.049> actually<00:03:25.380> bring

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
dual SIM device so if actually bring

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.949 
dual SIM device so if actually bring
this<00:03:25.680> closer<00:03:25.919> they<00:03:26.609> actually<00:03:27.060> ways<00:03:27.299> my<00:03:27.750> SIM

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
this closer they actually ways my SIM

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.300 
this closer they actually ways my SIM
card<00:03:28.200> doesn't<00:03:28.380> work<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.889> you're<00:03:29.010> going<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> get

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
card doesn't work so you're going to get

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.370 
card doesn't work so you're going to get
that<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:30.060> they<00:03:30.180> actually<00:03:30.329> ways<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.989> actually

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
that but they actually ways of actually

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.229 
that but they actually ways of actually
functioning<00:03:32.130> between<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> two<00:03:32.669> SIM<00:03:32.910> cards

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
functioning between the two SIM cards

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.210 
functioning between the two SIM cards
are<00:03:33.389> very<00:03:33.599> simple<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.470> go<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> your<00:03:34.829> dialer

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
are very simple if you go to your dialer

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.920 
are very simple if you go to your dialer
you<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.579> option<00:03:35.849> between<00:03:35.970> choosing<00:03:36.750> the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
you have the option between choosing the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.860 
you have the option between choosing the
same<00:03:37.079> one<00:03:37.349> or<00:03:38.099> sim<00:03:38.880> two<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.510> can<00:03:39.630> switch

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
same one or sim two you can switch

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.839 
same one or sim two you can switch
between<00:03:39.989> SIM<00:03:40.349> cards<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.859> make<00:03:40.980> calls<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.579> if

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
between SIM cards and make calls so if

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.759 
between SIM cards and make calls so if
you're<00:03:42.299> traveling<00:03:42.690> internationally<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.620> you
