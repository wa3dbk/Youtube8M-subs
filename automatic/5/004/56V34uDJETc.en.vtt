00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello dear friends again with you zombies 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.700
 rus today I want to talk about weapons 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 from battlefield hardline beta 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 or rather the subject of one of the barrel which is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.949
 my mind should be poner finn k 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.080
 release 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.539
 in battlefield hardline family a to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.430
 represented by cream ak m 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.110
 This is a modified version of ak-47 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.800
 which was adopted 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.710
 the Soviet army in 1959 according to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.890
 visas roll games such weapons can be found 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.079
 in the black market of the united states if 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.819
 it is possible to evaluate this trunk 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.120
 feel free to state that ak m 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:44.429
 This is a monster that requires nerf and then 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.749
 there are three reasons first and cream on 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.519
 the most powerful moment 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.799
 hit guns 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.249
 maximum damage 43 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.780
 a minimum of 34 such high damage is not 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.809
 was in the battlefield games 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.359
 let's say in battlefield 2, uaa 101 and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.320
 ak-47 which uses the same cartridge 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.930
 how am i campbell damage in 38 units and this 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.090
 was the highest figure for assault 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
 rifles in the history of battlefield games 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.770
 and honestly scares me like that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.110
 the trend seems to wetherall games 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.020
 there to present a completely different balance 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 weapons and damage system in second rate 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.190
 shooting at 600 rounds per minute 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.100
 allows this to be very effective 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.930
 at most distances pre magic 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.120
 cream and you are just impossible 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670
 shoot melee on medium 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.990
 distances he is ideal on his distant 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.600
 difficult to control 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.520
 from that he gets a little oblique but 3 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.220
 crazy bullets kill anyway 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.510
 opponent third on the subject as in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.270
 real life can put 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.909
 extended magazine for 40 rounds that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.840
 solves the problem of frequent recharges though 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.600
 at a cream 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.210
 she is not so long the only negative 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.430
 which can be noticed is the return from us 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.130
 there is a high vertical well how are you 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.900
 understand it is easy to control 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.820
 horizontal is also high but we 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.729
 compensator installed initially 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.740
 which solves this problem so two 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.610
 of the three types of manifestation recoil mun 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.069
 Jade flogged 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.409
 the initial one remains, that is, at the first 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.930
 shot yes she is very tall 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.049
 even a corner handle sometimes does not save and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.790
 it turns out that the uber trunk which 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.340
 dominates almost any 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.980
 distances to minus can be written only 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.439
 the initial returns of the games 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.629
 do not do this 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.849
 the moment to be and this is the most variable 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.799
 the barrel with him is not a guard find melee with 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.829
 so home you can only be afraid 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.959
 crop owners at medium distances 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.569
 This is the perfect gun that is suitable for 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.299
 hold position cover bratyun by 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.730
 the team at long distances as before 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.609
 he said bad but anyway 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.680
 The chance to kill is very high even with 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.870
 combat non armored vehicles he 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.659
 show yourself better than lpg to you 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.120
 one store and one enemy 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.129
 the car just won't be either ak m 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.450
 becomes more dangerous when used 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.849
 the author in his 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.409
 what turns you into a monster cats 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.659
 firstly impossible to stop 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.999
 impossible to shoot and impossible 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.249
 kill you can kill just like 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.439
 it was said before either the owner was cut off 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.700
 bass far sniper who sits on 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.029
 roof of a skyscraper 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.669
 here's how to ponerfat cream on my 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:25.769
 glance just first need to be removed from 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.959
 list of its modules increased store 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.809
 second, a little increase speed 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.269
 recharge in third make smaller 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.709
 damage reduce it to the level of soon 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.439
 battlefield 4 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.620
 Well, to tsiferki accounted for 34 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.809
 maximum and 25 minimum then cream 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.459
 will become more adequate gun which 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.809
 maybe save all your 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.409
 variability but it will not 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:50.549
 cloud bucher players and 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.159
 representatives of the community because a 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.019
 before days loved for blood and with balance 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.659
 we created some new guns 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.090
 for example dow 12 from second addition 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.519
 assault which caused damage to 150 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.260
 units up to 50 meters with needle 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.989
 ammunition thank goodness they sweat 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.480
 made a patch that removed this chip 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.909
 so kind of shitty games think about 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.249
 Dear friends about me by the way 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.650
 I am interested in your opinion about a cream 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:20.150
 Is it worth it to do it? 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.610
 and how it should poner write koment 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.040
 a nut under this video but I think that's all 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.479
 thanks for watching subscribe 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.479
 comment see you on the battlefield bye
