00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
literally is it happen I think feeling

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.240 
literally is it happen I think feeling
best<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> doing<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.899> shot<00:01:01.530> actually

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
best way of doing this shot actually

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.980 
best way of doing this shot actually
scored<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:03.780> probably<00:01:04.439> doing<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.720> trump

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
scored is probably doing a you can trump

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.130 
scored is probably doing a you can trump
in<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> goal<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:08.310> i'll<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> trump<00:01:09.299> now
