00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630 
latch system so we know that model year
2003<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.500> beyond<00:01:43.829> I'll<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> latch

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
2003 and beyond I'll have the latch

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490 
2003 and beyond I'll have the latch
system<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.270> even<00:01:45.509> beyond<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.750> most

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
that a lot of these seats are equipped

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.870 
that a lot of these seats are equipped
to<00:03:12.600> connect<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.440> latch<00:03:13.680> system<00:03:14.310> tell<00:03:14.700> us<00:03:14.819> a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
to connect to the latch system tell us a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.880 
to connect to the latch system tell us a
little<00:03:15.000> bit<00:03:15.120> more<00:03:15.390> about<00:03:15.450> what<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.140> latch

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
little bit more about what that is latch

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.370 
little bit more about what that is latch

for children and beginning a no to all

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.289 
for children and beginning a no to all
the<00:03:23.280> vehicles<00:03:23.640> were<00:03:23.730> equipped<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.090> latch

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
the vehicles were equipped with latch

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.430 
the vehicles were equipped with latch
you'll<00:03:24.540> notice<00:03:24.720> little<00:03:24.930> bars<00:03:25.109> in<00:03:25.320> your

you'll notice little bars in your

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.470 
you'll notice little bars in your
vehicle<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.519> each<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.030> seats<00:03:27.269> both

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
vehicle and so each of the seats both

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.970 
vehicle and so each of the seats both
rear<00:03:27.720> facing<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.230> forward-facing<00:03:28.530> are

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
rear facing and forward-facing are

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.800 
rear facing and forward-facing are
required<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.459> have<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:29.730> latch<00:03:30.000> system<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.660> in

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
required to have this latch system so in

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.599 
required to have this latch system so in
this<00:03:30.930> case<00:03:31.140> they<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.920> put<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.250> push<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.549> a

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
this case they you put the push of a

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.120 
this case they you put the push of a
button<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:33.510> comes<00:03:33.780> out<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.290> then<00:03:34.799> once<00:03:34.980> your

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
button it comes out and then once your

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.949 
button it comes out and then once your
release<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.760> automatically<00:03:36.299> retreats<00:03:36.780> back

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
release it automatically retreats back

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.140 
release it automatically retreats back
in<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:38.040> know<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.579> lot<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.850> times<00:03:39.060> you're

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
in and so you know a lot of times you're

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.759 
in and so you know a lot of times you're
in<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.420> seat<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.810> trying<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.230> pull<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
in that seat and trying to pull the

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.840 
in that seat and trying to pull the
strap<00:03:41.010> while<00:03:41.220> you're<00:03:41.310> pushing<00:03:41.459> down<00:03:41.700> this

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
strap while you're pushing down this

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.430 
strap while you're pushing down this
case<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.299> just<00:03:42.329> push<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.780> seat<00:03:42.959> down<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.320> it

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
case you just push the seat down in it

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.870 
case you just push the seat down in it
and<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.769> latches<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.280> place<00:03:44.489> right<00:03:44.700> as<00:03:44.790> you

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
and it latches in place right as you

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.039 
and it latches in place right as you
push<00:03:45.030> into<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.299> seat<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.630> think<00:03:45.810> we're<00:03:45.959> going

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
push into the seat you think we're going

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.009 
push into the seat you think we're going
to<00:03:46.140> start<00:03:46.320> seeing<00:03:46.560> more<00:03:47.570> systems<00:03:48.570> like<00:03:48.750> that

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
to start seeing more systems like that

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.349 
to start seeing more systems like that
to<00:03:49.260> make<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.769> adjustment<00:03:49.950> easier<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.880> think

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
to make that adjustment easier I think

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.699 
to make that adjustment easier I think
so<00:03:51.510> especially<00:03:51.600> as<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.049> price<00:03:52.230> points<00:03:52.560> come

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
so especially as the price points come

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.990 
so especially as the price points come
down<00:03:52.859> from<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.100> hardware<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.579> think<00:03:53.850> we'll

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
down from that hardware I think we'll

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.910 
down from that hardware I think we'll
we'll<00:03:54.450> see<00:03:54.480> more<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:54.989> more<00:03:55.049> seats<00:03:55.410> offering

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
we'll see more and more seats offering

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.440 
we'll see more and more seats offering
those<00:03:56.040> kinds<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.340> features<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:57.239> course

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
those kinds of features and of course

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.300 
those kinds of features and of course
each<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.750> these<00:03:57.840> features<00:03:58.019> also<00:03:58.350> has<00:03:59.160> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
each of these features also has the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.009 
each of these features also has the
tether<00:03:59.549> strap<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.090> goes<00:04:00.239> behind<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.750> seat

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
tether strap that goes behind the seat

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.420 
tether strap that goes behind the seat
and<00:04:01.049> anchors<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.680> point<00:04:01.920> behind<00:04:02.100> the
