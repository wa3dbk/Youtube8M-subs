00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
like first I did it I did it like really

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.710 
like first I did it I did it like really
fast<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.610> took<00:01:56.790> me<00:01:56.910> like<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.119> least<00:01:57.180> 10<00:01:57.450> tries

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
fast and took me like at least 10 tries

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.080 
fast and took me like at least 10 tries
to<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.890> first<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.220> off<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> then

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
to get get the first one off and then

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.430 
to get get the first one off and then
after<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:00.360> kept<00:02:00.570> doing<00:02:00.660> slow<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.200> actually

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
after I kept doing slow and it actually

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.070 
after I kept doing slow and it actually
worked<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.190> just<00:02:02.790> keep<00:02:02.970> try<00:02:03.450> them<00:02:03.630> both<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
worked so just keep try them both and

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.499 
worked so just keep try them both and
you<00:02:04.229> might<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.530> might<00:02:04.680> work<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.420> gonna

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you might it might work so it's gonna

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.469 
you might it might work so it's gonna
take<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.690> pretty<00:02:06.780> long<00:02:07.110> time<00:02:07.410> so<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.310> don't<00:02:08.580> if
