00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.250 
of get to develop a go-to move which I
find<00:03:15.220> really<00:03:15.549> interesting<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.359> really<00:03:16.419> cool

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
find really interesting and really cool

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.990 
find really interesting and really cool
I<00:03:17.500> sort<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.069> had<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.220> go-to<00:03:18.459> move<00:03:18.729> if<00:03:18.879> you've

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
I sort of had a go-to move if you've

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.550 
I sort of had a go-to move if you've
seen<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.299> my<00:03:19.449> player<00:03:19.720> videos<00:03:20.109> and<00:03:20.319> so<00:03:20.409> did

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
seen the my player videos and so did

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.960 
seen the my player videos and so did
bill<00:03:20.739> called<00:03:21.010> cross<00:03:21.250> spin<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:21.819> was<00:03:21.940> a

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
bill called cross spin it was a

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.360 
bill called cross spin it was a
signature<00:03:22.479> gather<00:03:22.810> maybe<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:23.859> year<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.129> can

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
signature gather maybe this year you can

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.490 
signature gather maybe this year you can
just<00:03:24.549> up<00:03:24.699> your<00:03:24.849> cross<00:03:25.060> spin<00:03:25.449> attribute<00:03:26.319> there

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
just up your cross spin attribute there

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.719 
just up your cross spin attribute there
you<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.859> skill<00:03:27.190> points<00:03:27.519> right<00:03:27.699> there

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:27.729 
you see the skill points right there

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.189 
you see the skill points right there
they<00:03:28.599> are<00:03:29.220> expensive<00:03:30.220> pause<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.269> video<00:03:31.389> take

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
they are expensive pause the video take

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.619 
they are expensive pause the video take
a<00:03:32.229> look<00:03:32.500> that's<00:03:33.010> almost<00:03:33.190> 17,000<00:03:34.150> skill<00:03:34.329> points

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
a look that's almost 17,000 skill points

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.899 
a look that's almost 17,000 skill points
you're<00:03:34.750> looking<00:03:34.989> at<00:03:35.079> to<00:03:35.229> upgrade<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.799> but<00:03:36.729> to

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
you're looking at to upgrade that but to

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.899 
you're looking at to upgrade that but to
compensate<00:03:37.120> for<00:03:37.629> that<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:39.370> will<00:03:39.519> see<00:03:39.699> more

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
compensate for that you will see more

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.119 
compensate for that you will see more
about<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.329> in<00:03:40.479> a<00:03:40.540> little<00:03:40.659> bit<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:42.010> to

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
about that in a little bit but to

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.789 
about that in a little bit but to
compensate<00:03:42.310> for<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.819> they've<00:03:43.120> actually<00:03:43.799> up

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
compensate for that they've actually up

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.530 
compensate for that they've actually up
to<00:03:45.099> your<00:03:45.250> number<00:03:45.549> of<00:03:45.639> milestones<00:03:46.150> more<00:03:46.419> on

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
to your number of milestones more on

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.229 
to your number of milestones more on
that<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.870> little<00:03:46.959> bit<00:03:47.340> now<00:03:48.340> we<00:03:48.879> are<00:03:49.000> looking

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
that in a little bit now we are looking

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.379 
that in a little bit now we are looking
at<00:03:49.389> the<00:03:50.229> next<00:03:50.769> slide<00:03:51.159> here<00:03:51.190> in<00:03:51.579> just<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.909> second

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
at the next slide here in just a second

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.189 
at the next slide here in just a second
I<00:03:53.669> am<00:03:54.669> going<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.120> try<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.389> develop<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.959> cross

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
I am going to try and develop a cross

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.839 
I am going to try and develop a cross
spin<00:03:56.590> go<00:03:56.859> to<00:03:56.919> move<00:03:57.220> or<00:03:57.370> something<00:03:57.669> like<00:03:57.790> that

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
spin go to move or something like that

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.050 
spin go to move or something like that
looking<00:03:58.510> at<00:03:58.599> these<00:03:58.750> but<00:03:59.079> we'll<00:03:59.829> see<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.879> have

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
looking at these but we'll see you have

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.059 
looking at these but we'll see you have
dynamic<00:04:01.329> goals<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.109> is<00:04:02.319> this<00:04:02.620> reminded<00:04:03.010> me

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
dynamic goals this is this reminded me

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.159 
dynamic goals this is this reminded me
right<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.340> way<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.489> MLB<00:04:04.090> 2k10<00:04:04.659> I<00:04:04.720> have<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:04.989> video

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
right of way of MLB 2k10 I have a video

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.140 
right of way of MLB 2k10 I have a video
up<00:04:05.409> on<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.650> channel<00:04:05.949> of<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.459> is

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
up on the channel of that it is

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.969 
up on the channel of that it is
situational<00:04:08.079> so<00:04:08.290> if<00:04:08.379> you<00:04:08.470> miss<00:04:08.680> your<00:04:08.799> first

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
situational so if you miss your first

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.369 
situational so if you miss your first
two<00:04:09.220> shots<00:04:09.400> in<00:04:09.609> a<00:04:09.669> game<00:04:09.879> you<00:04:10.629> might<00:04:10.810> be<00:04:10.870> able<00:04:11.199> to

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
two shots in a game you might be able to

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.349 
two shots in a game you might be able to
come<00:04:12.189> up<00:04:12.250> with<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.489> dynamic<00:04:12.909> goal<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.209> says

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
come up with a dynamic goal that says

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.939 
come up with a dynamic goal that says
hey<00:04:13.509> make<00:04:13.810> your<00:04:13.959> next<00:04:14.139> two<00:04:14.290> shots<00:04:14.560> in<00:04:14.799> other

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
hey make your next two shots in other

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.069 
hey make your next two shots in other
words<00:04:15.159> get<00:04:15.310> your<00:04:15.459> crap<00:04:15.639> together<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:16.180> find<00:04:16.930> that

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
words get your crap together I find that

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.870 
words get your crap together I find that
really<00:04:17.289> cool<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.859> think<00:04:18.340> it'll<00:04:18.459> make<00:04:18.639> things

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
really cool I think it'll make things

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.940 
really cool I think it'll make things
more<00:04:19.120> exciting<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:20.320> know<00:04:20.440> maybe<00:04:20.620> your<00:04:20.829> guy

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
more exciting you know maybe your guy

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.620 
more exciting you know maybe your guy
scores<00:04:21.340> on<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.060> need<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.300> shut<00:04:22.510> him

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
scores on you and you need to shut him

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.180 
scores on you and you need to shut him
down<00:04:22.659> the<00:04:22.960> next<00:04:23.169> play<00:04:23.320> as<00:04:23.469> a<00:04:23.500> dynamic<00:04:23.740> goal

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
down the next play as a dynamic goal

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.670 
down the next play as a dynamic goal
stuff<00:04:24.520> like<00:04:24.729> that<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:25.270> that's<00:04:25.960> really<00:04:26.169> cool

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
stuff like that so that's really cool

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.770 
stuff like that so that's really cool
I<00:04:26.770> think<00:04:27.190> that's<00:04:27.340> much<00:04:27.580> needed<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.120> will

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
I think that's much needed and will

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.810 
I think that's much needed and will
spice<00:04:28.960> things<00:04:29.229> up<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:29.680> really<00:04:30.370> cool<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.669> see

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
spice things up so really cool to see

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.450 
spice things up so really cool to see
that<00:04:31.320> new<00:04:32.320> drills<00:04:32.680> for<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:32.979> game<00:04:33.130> as<00:04:33.310> well

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
that new drills for the game as well

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.460 
that new drills for the game as well
they're<00:04:34.330> more<00:04:34.479> realistic<00:04:34.990> there's<00:04:35.199> games

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
they're more realistic there's games

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.520 
they're more realistic there's games
like<00:04:35.680> knock<00:04:35.889> out<00:04:36.160> 21<00:04:36.610> i<00:04:36.759> think<00:04:37.289> maybe<00:04:38.289> just

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
like knock out 21 i think maybe just

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.439 
like knock out 21 i think maybe just
knock<00:04:38.710> out<00:04:38.919> but<00:04:39.100> either<00:04:39.190> way<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:40.180> shooting

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
knock out but either way the shooting

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.969 
knock out but either way the shooting
drill<00:04:40.600> will<00:04:40.780> return<00:04:41.050> so<00:04:41.320> that's<00:04:41.500> all<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.650> really

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
drill will return so that's all I really

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.560 
drill will return so that's all I really
care<00:04:42.009> about<00:04:42.190> their<00:04:42.550> they<00:04:43.150> make<00:04:43.300> them<00:04:43.449> sound

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
care about their they make them sound

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.939 
care about their they make them sound
cool<00:04:43.840> though<00:04:44.020> we'll<00:04:44.199> see<00:04:44.350> how<00:04:44.440> they<00:04:44.560> work<00:04:44.710> out

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
cool though we'll see how they work out

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.189 
cool though we'll see how they work out
now<00:04:45.789> we<00:04:45.850> move<00:04:46.150> on<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.570> press<00:04:46.840> conference

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
now we move on to the press conference

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.600 
now we move on to the press conference
this<00:04:47.380> is<00:04:47.530> one<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.710> my<00:04:47.830> favorite<00:04:48.190> things<00:04:48.400> there

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
this is one of my favorite things there

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.420 
this is one of my favorite things there
are<00:04:48.729> four<00:04:49.030> times<00:04:49.060> as<00:04:49.660> many<00:04:50.250> questions<00:04:51.250> and
