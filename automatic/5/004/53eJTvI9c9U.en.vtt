00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.049
 hello some vegetables have seeds 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.760
 very small and delicate so at 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.549
 time to sow we should lend them 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.379
 special attention for this we sow 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.840
 in small spaces or in containers 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.000
 that are called 'the massive today we will 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.000
 seedlings from egg shells 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.300
 first we take an egg and we break it 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.520
 the tip with a spoon we take the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.320
 content and expand the hole up 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.710
 eliminate about a third of the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.710
 shell 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.010
 We're very careful not to break it 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.200
 the shell then with a needle 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.280
 we drill the base and that hole we 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.280
 will serve for drainage 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.070
 as a substrate we will put a small layer 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.670
 sand and fill the rest 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.670
 with together 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.920
 we must put at most 3 seeds per 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.870
 egg because if we put more these 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.600
 products are well developed lack 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.369
 of space when placing them is 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.500
 important to bury them to a 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.530
 approximate depth of 2 times its 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.530
 size 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.320
 if we have our children's souls at 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.690
 inside is important here to kill them 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.000
 before transplanting them for that we're going 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.130
 to put them abroad for periods every 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.250
 longer times entering not always by 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.250
 the night 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.850
 when three to four leaves appear 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.770
 true is the time to plant what 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.140
 what will we do with the shell that I eat 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.400
 it takes to biodegrade we will help the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.400
 roots breaking the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.630
 in that he wrote us asking for his 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.060
 roses which have a growth 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.610
 very slow and almost we generate flowers and he 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.350
 wants to know what is happening to him in the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.970
 sun and most likely your roses 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.430
 are not receiving the amount of light 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.800
 adequate which is fundamental for the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.990
 development of more floral what you can 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.790
 do if this is the case is to transplant 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.790
 to a place where they receive more light 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.560
 Do not forget to identify which seeds are 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.780
 so as not to get confused and check all the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.660
 days the substrates since this one should not 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.400
 drying out if you have any doubts 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.319
 go back to see this program in do it 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.150
 yourself point cl and share it in 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.150
 the social networks been that well
