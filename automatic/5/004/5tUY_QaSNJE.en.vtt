 high-end phones presented by 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.710
 wifo I love you we present as a 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.340
 video the stadium so always in this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.550
 other model 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 we are on a phone of 48 inches 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.789
 with a definition bought to do this 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.009
 that I mean I'm here a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.410
 protection gorilla glass 3 a processor 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.870
 qualcomm snapdragon 2 4 timed hearts 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.879
 as of yesterday, all supported by two 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.190
 gigas of ram 16 GB of internal storage 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.219
 a front camera that they found 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 here from megapixel singrist on the back 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.629
 we have an 8 megapixel camera with his 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.289
 led flash and a back here towards eric 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.410
 as is the case on galaxy 6 or 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.360
 still the xperia ray 3 1 doel antwerp 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130
 so 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.460
 we must really propose a mobile 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.410
 Spanish the design is quite successful and 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.049
 especially on the finesse of the product so 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.990
 we are sure 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.969
 one of the products 4g the earthquake the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 chicks it may be the 4g phone 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:20.280
 the next game by stupidity 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.560
 but here we are at 5.5 mm thick 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.590
 the extremely product finally he is very 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.140
 also light that makes that 99 g so with 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.759
 its 4 8 inches format for 98 drama 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.790
 it's really nice to take in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.790
 hand 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.190
 as you see on the slice c of 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.920
 aluminum so what to make the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.470
 good solid mobile and there is never 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.730
 unfortunately you sit on it or that's it 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.310
 do not worry those caresses someone 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.020
 which is not solid the design is 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.840
 really good good it always works 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.510
 the raised fingers looks like it's on 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.870
 this right slice we have the button 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.220
 power up life if the strong for 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.120
 the map 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.310
 the anoci mi6 a shot over 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.920
 simply the microphone for the reduction of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.390
 active noise on the left side of 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.710
 buttons that will increase or decrease 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.630
 volume 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.860
 and finally below it 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.430
 the 3 5 mm jack with the microphone and the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.920
 port microusb 2.0 obviously that 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.430
 so here we are on a mobile that is 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.859
 really really premium what we can 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.560
 blame him on the other hand and that's 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.150
 the lack of version take two gigas 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.380
 and soils khady diop and but especially 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.250
 the absence of 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.160
 microsd to extend the memory of 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.010
 storage so here we are on a 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.660
 very classy phone very fine very 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.220
 design 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.900
 but the problem is with this gigabyte 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.500
 byte certain meaning may be a 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.440
 little cramped 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.760
 that's if you consume a lot of 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.750
 two videos for example 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.670
 it will be 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.340
 that's going to be pretty complicated with 16 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.650
 gigabytes storage for the rest we have 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.780
 always the interface of chirico the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.940
 new chirico interface that you 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.240
 can disable to set android 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.220
 store sarko is still on hard of 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.020
 4.424 you can see him with his 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.450
 buttons that are the orders directly 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.380
 on the screen 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.440
 here we love or we do not like this 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.450
 interface this is flat week brought 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.209
 some software improvements that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.830
 still quite light and so you can 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.610
 go back to a stock version 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.220
