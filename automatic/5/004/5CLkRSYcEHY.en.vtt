Mayer has recently done a version of
this<00:01:28.289> I<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:29.069> it's<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> his<00:01:29.729> CDs<00:01:30.149> I

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this I think it's on one of his CDs I

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.749 
this I think it's on one of his CDs I
assume<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.200> know<00:01:31.229> I've<00:01:31.499> seen<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.770> live<00:01:32.369> on

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
assume I know I've seen it live on

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.410 
assume I know I've seen it live on
YouTube<00:01:33.179> and<00:01:33.389> stuff<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:34.499> just<00:01:34.829> excellent

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
kills and so you know the song has got a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.149 
kills and so you know the song has got a
great<00:01:47.490> backbeat<00:01:48.209> it's<00:01:49.170> really<00:01:49.619> mean<00:01:51.409> c7<00:01:52.409> is

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
great backbeat it's really mean c7 is

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.809 
great backbeat it's really mean c7 is
you<00:01:53.819> know<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.359> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> tune<00:01:55.549> it<00:01:56.549> does

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
you know it's kind of the tune it does

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:03.030 
you know it's kind of the tune it does
go<00:01:59.329> when<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.479> does<00:02:00.659> this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.630 

that<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.400> kind<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.730> B<00:02:04.390> flat<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.990> F<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:06.430> there

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
that is kind of B flat and F in there

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.250 
that is kind of B flat and F in there
too<00:02:06.910> but<00:02:07.240> really<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:08.320> soloing<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.100> over<00:02:09.700> c7<00:02:10.690> so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
too but really the soloing is over c7 so

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.360 
too but really the soloing is over c7 so
it's<00:02:11.410> one<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.740> those<00:02:11.890> songs<00:02:12.250> where<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.920> court

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
it's one of those songs where the court

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.940 
it's one of those songs where the court
does<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.570> corn<00:02:16.840> progression<00:02:17.410> doesn't<00:02:17.740> go

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
does the corn progression doesn't go

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.980 
does the corn progression doesn't go
anywhere<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.450> come<00:02:19.630> up<00:02:19.780> with

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
anywhere so you have to come up with

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.680 
anywhere so you have to come up with
different<00:02:20.370> ideas<00:02:21.370> over<00:02:22.030> something<00:02:22.510> that's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
different ideas over something that's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.770 
different ideas over something that's
very<00:02:22.930> horizontal<00:02:23.910> which<00:02:24.910> can<00:02:25.120> be<00:02:25.240> challenging

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
very horizontal which can be challenging

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.550 
very horizontal which can be challenging
but<00:02:25.900> also<00:02:26.080> can<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.640> extremely<00:02:27.640> fun<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.150> do<00:02:28.560> so

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
but also can be extremely fun to do so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.830 
but also can be extremely fun to do so
anyway<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:31.210> basic<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:33.360> section<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.600> tune

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
anyway the basic a section of the tune

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:43.320 
anyway the basic a section of the tune
goes<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.370> that's<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.120> eighth

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
goes like this this is that's the eighth

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.380 
goes like this this is that's the eighth
fret<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.370> that's<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.580> c7<00:02:46.180> chord<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:49.150> let<00:02:49.300> me

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
fret and that's a c7 chord and let me

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.080 
fret and that's a c7 chord and let me
turn<00:02:49.570> off<00:02:49.630> my<00:02:49.990> echo<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.920> second

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.870 

so<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.480> section<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.470> tune<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.980> starts

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
so the a section of the tune is starts

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.250 
so the a section of the tune is starts
on<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> tenth<00:03:01.420> fret<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.870> fourth<00:03:02.200> string

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
on the tenth fret of the fourth string

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.170 
on the tenth fret of the fourth string
with<00:03:02.860> your<00:03:02.890> ring<00:03:03.280> finger<00:03:07.019> very<00:03:08.820> C<00:03:09.820> minor

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
with your ring finger very C minor

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.710 
with your ring finger very C minor
pentatonic<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:11.380> nature<00:03:11.890> right<00:03:12.130> there<00:03:13.950> 10<00:03:14.950> 8<00:03:15.340> 10

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
pentatonic in nature right there 10 8 10

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.270 
pentatonic in nature right there 10 8 10
and<00:03:16.720> then<00:03:16.959> 11<00:03:17.320> on<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:18.010> low<00:03:18.190> E<00:03:18.549> string<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:21.010> bend

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
and then 11 on the low E string you bend

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.520 
and then 11 on the low E string you bend
it<00:03:21.459> up<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.970> little<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.540> know<00:03:22.570> hair<00:03:23.049> like<00:03:23.500> a

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
quarter bend to 8 and then 6/8 twice you

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.000 
quarter bend to 8 and then 6/8 twice you
slide<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.540> or<00:03:32.410> at<00:03:32.530> least<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.830> do

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.530 

and<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:38.159> little<00:03:39.159> triad<00:03:39.760> Phil<00:03:40.000> here<00:03:40.329> is

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:03.720 

12<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.510> 11<00:03:59.129> so<00:04:00.129> you<00:04:00.189> play<00:04:00.519> that<00:04:02.670> play<00:04:03.670> two

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
same spot that's just 10 8 and 10

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:01.730 
same spot that's just 10 8 and 10
starting<00:04:53.310> out<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.490> 4th<00:04:53.760> string<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:01.620> you

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
starting out of the 4th string and you

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:25.070 
starting out of the 4th string and you
land<00:05:01.980> on<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.520> 6th<00:05:02.880> string<00:05:02.910> 8th<00:05:03.390> fret<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:25.020> it

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
land on the 6th string 8th fret so it

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.720

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
into the ocean a section that's

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.890
