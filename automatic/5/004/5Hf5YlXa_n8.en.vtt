00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.920
 a giant monkey that kidnapped a blonde 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.420
 and terrorized an entire city and then 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.220

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.750

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.650
 today in movies that make us say 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.540
 what the fuck are we going to be talking about 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.540
 the great American Korean production 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.290
 there are movies that are bad there are other 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.390
 that are so bad that they end up being 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.640
 good but there are others that are so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.190
 incredibly marc and good that the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 people do not believe me that there are why 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.360
 today I bring you this program here 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.280
 we will see movies that is not necessary 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.920
 to hate those so that they give thanks for 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.530
 that of the darkest side of the galaxy 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.400
 today I bring you movies that make me 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.380
 say water 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.420
 the movie starts on a boat where 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.309
 they have captured a giant monkey the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.410
 monkey will be exhibited in Disneyland and not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.650
 I'm really fucking that says it 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.650
 here 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.630
 by the way I love the emotion that 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.360
 has the captain's assistant at 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.960
 listen to the history we go theory 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.960
 shakespeare 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.100
 unfortunately for them the monkey is 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.990
 escapes and destroys the boat this attracts a 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.789
 shark that was close and they have 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.909
 a battle full of emotion and effects 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.909
 special 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.689
 once the monkey kills the shark this 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.860
 nothing until you get to Korea where it starts 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.810
 to destroy cardboard houses 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.939
 the next day an artist comes to korea 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.890
 American named Marilyn and her boyfriend the 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.539
 which is a mare link reporter traveled to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.250
 Korea to shoot a large production 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.200
 American of which I will speak a 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.119
 little at the end of the video during one of 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.890
 their films monkey abducts 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.840
 mother lynn and takes her to a mountain 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.329
 where the usual thing happens in these 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.819
 movies the monkey kidnaps the girl 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.590
 boyfriend rescued the girl the monkey goes 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.390
 to the city ​​following the girl the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.130
 monkey destroys the city to recover 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.110
 the girl and take her back 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.000
 fighting the monkey is the boyfriend of the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.099
 actress who joins the captain of the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.750
 army of Korea and a colonel who gets the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.120
 spend the whole movie talking about 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.519
 phone and I'm not relaxing the speech 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.290
 by phone the whole damn movie the 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.269
 color is only what from time to time 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.069
 to mistreat her out and it's a bit 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.019
 funny how cruel it is with the corporal without 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.489
 no reason whatsoever sad that 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.020
 these are the two most 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.610
 interesting of the movie 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.470
 there is only one scene that does not speak for 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.540
 phone the scene where he knows the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.310
 captain of the Korean army he says that 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.950
 he wants a cigarette and sincerely 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.170
 when I saw this scene I thought oh here 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.420
 another shameless promotion comes but not 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.890
 the general is only smoked 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.890
 scene does not even have a reason why 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.260
 Andrei Montes gadgets heal 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.000
 ok then enjoy it another thing that I gave 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.190
 account watching this movie is that the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.260
 Koreans have a terrible sight like this 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.060
 kind for example how the fuck did not see the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.950
 wall from a distance and this does not happen 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.930
 only that there is a children's scene 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.260
 playing is that the same thing also happens or 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.000
 they are blind or the mont is ninja and is more 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.330
 I think I have the best way to do 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.760
 this movie 'the low and far from fucking you 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.220
 I have a very important news there is a 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.370
 link to next attacking cole a 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.490
 giant line attacking korea if plank and 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.010
 the worst of all is that he is disguised 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.980
 from a world that there is a giant line 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.709
 attacking korea and killing people and they 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.900
 Disguise as a Moor I can forgive you 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.990
 destroy the city and that I killed children 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.100
 innocent but I will never forgive him that he 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.380
 disguises monkey and good something like that 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.020
 I would have done it at the end of the movie 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.970
 the army to heal the wall to kill him 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.370
 the scene takes a long time because the forces 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.410
 armed are not well organized and as 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.209
 I know this you will ask me why 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.100
 the fucking colonel installing by phone 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.890
 instead of organizing their 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.110
 in the end the army manages to kill the monkey 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.670
 finally or at least I assume that because 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.830
 they never actually present him dead 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.630
 as such if the movie ends with the 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.240
 reporter saying he was too 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.580
 great for our little world and the 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.500
 monkey dying off camera that well 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.390
 for them this movie is a 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.580
 Korean and American co-production and 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.920
 originally I was going to be called the 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.780
 quinton counterattack but when there's 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.940
 that this universe to study they found out 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.380
 they threatened to sue so 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.910
 the producers of this movie will 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.120
 changed the name of the movie to 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.770
 simply the cinema in Spanish equal the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.100
 producers of the film would be thrown away 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.990
 a few jokes of 5-5 in korea 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.670
 this movie was between d and that's why 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.160
 we see some camera shots like 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.210
 this one this movie is horrible and it ends 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.790
 leaving me from her 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.470
 ironically according to wikipedia the movie 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.820
 It was made in this way on purpose 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.650
 because they wanted it to be a 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.960
 parody of king kong not a copy like 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.330
 so if that was really the idea 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.800
 Well, it worked because if I laughed a lot 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.840
 made the world look like a black sheep 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.960
 giant there's a part where you 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.850
 pulls the single finger but 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.860
 if this definitely has to be 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.750
 a parody I recommend only see 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.069
 this movie if he leaves now nor with a 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.380
 group of friends who like 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.569

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.169
 movie gives grace is bad that you have 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.900
 what to see 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.210
 I recommend seeing it with beer and before 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.009
 go as promised, let's see that the 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.250
 Americans were filming here in this 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.250
 movie 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.710

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.650

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.800
 but what the fuck are filming is more 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.300
 sincerely hope that the film Fuck 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.920
 there they should have done this 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.050

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.790
 is more curious who knows there is so much 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.130
 scene of rape that this could have 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.100
