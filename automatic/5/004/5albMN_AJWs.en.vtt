from truck to robot he has an energized
equipment<00:00:20.699> here<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.500> also<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
equipment here and we also are going to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.310

open in a separate video be sure to stay

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.279 
open in a separate video be sure to stay
tuned<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:26.119> we're<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.510> open<00:00:27.689> chase

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
tuned for it we're going to open chase

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.710 
tuned for it we're going to open chase
the<00:00:28.650> police<00:00:28.980> bot<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.670> he<00:00:29.820> converts<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the police bot and he converts from a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.410 
the police bot and he converts from a
car<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.289> robot<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.189> he<00:00:32.730> also<00:00:32.910> has<00:00:33.270> an

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
car to robot and he also has an

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.680 
car to robot and he also has an
energized<00:00:34.700> 12<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> he<00:00:38.309> waved<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> firebot<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
energized 12 so he waved the firebot is

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
energized 12 so he waved the firebot is
really<00:00:40.140> fun<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.590> at<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.219> attach<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
really fun look at this you attach the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.920 
really fun look at this you attach the
water<00:00:42.239> cannon<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> energizer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
water cannon to it so that energizer

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.220 
water cannon to it so that energizer
really<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> water<00:00:46.530> canyon<00:00:47.600> he<00:00:48.600> has<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> ladder

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
really is a water canyon he has a ladder

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.410 
really is a water canyon he has a ladder
attached<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> his<00:00:50.250> fire<00:00:50.489> truck<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.180> he

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
attached to his fire truck and then he

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.419 
attached to his fire truck and then he
converts<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.260> robot<00:00:52.649> mode

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:06.679 

so<00:01:00.429> let's<00:01:00.850> see<00:01:01.149> Huy<00:01:01.589> transform<00:01:05.400> robot

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
so let's see Huy transform robot

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.410 
so let's see Huy transform robot
transport

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:46.730 

he<00:01:12.049> way<00:01:12.340> transform

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.580 

-<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.340> latter<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.760> transforms<00:01:48.420> him<00:01:48.930> so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
- the latter is what transforms him so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.760 
- the latter is what transforms him so
first<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.190> pull<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> ladder<00:01:51.770> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
first you have to pull the ladder and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.390 
first you have to pull the ladder and
then<00:01:52.920> tucking<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> line<00:01:55.550> there<00:01:56.550> you<00:01:56.760> haven't

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
then tucking the line there you haven't

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.969 
then tucking the line there you haven't
the<00:01:59.400> under<00:01:59.700> John<00:01:59.909> fits<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.450> either<00:02:00.690> side

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:20.760 

he's<00:02:05.549> ready<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> roll

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:31.100 

let's<00:02:21.130> see<00:02:21.340> him<00:02:21.520> from<00:02:21.700> all<00:02:21.910> angles

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.030 

the<00:02:31.440> transform<00:02:32.120> remove<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.240> Energon<00:02:34.040> fold

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the transform remove the Energon fold

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.140 
the transform remove the Energon fold
the<00:02:35.220> ladder

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.839 

to<00:02:43.150> transform<00:02:43.599> him<00:02:43.840> back<00:02:43.870> for<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.470> letter

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
to transform him back for the letter

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.300 
to transform him back for the letter
again<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.120> then<00:02:46.209> just<00:02:46.420> tuck<00:02:46.690> him<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:47.310> he's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
again and then just tuck him in he's

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.540 
again and then just tuck him in he's
done<00:02:48.810> well<00:02:49.810> that's<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.470> us<00:02:50.500> guys<00:02:50.920> thanks
