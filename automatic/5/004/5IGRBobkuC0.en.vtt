from<00:00:03.110> a<00:00:03.200> health<00:00:03.380> perspective<00:00:03.880> calcium<00:00:04.880> and

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
from a health perspective calcium and

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.560 
from a health perspective calcium and
magnesium<00:00:05.150> are<00:00:05.990> good<00:00:06.470> for<00:00:06.710> us<00:00:06.859> my<00:00:07.850> fixtures

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
magnesium are good for us my fixtures

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.959 
magnesium are good for us my fixtures
don't<00:00:08.930> like<00:00:09.110> calcium<00:00:10.040> I<00:00:10.190> don't<00:00:10.340> know<00:00:10.460> how<00:00:10.639> they

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
don't like calcium I don't know how they

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.299 
don't like calcium I don't know how they
react<00:00:11.299> to<00:00:11.389> magnesium<00:00:11.960> yeah<00:00:12.230> well<00:00:12.950> they<00:00:13.070> show

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
react to magnesium yeah well they show

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.940 
react to magnesium yeah well they show
up<00:00:13.490> more<00:00:13.790> than<00:00:14.120> other<00:00:14.570> minerals<00:00:15.169> that's<00:00:15.499> the

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
up more than other minerals that's the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.450 
up more than other minerals that's the
white<00:00:16.430> residue<00:00:17.240> that<00:00:17.539> you<00:00:17.750> see<00:00:18.020> that's<00:00:18.460> mainly

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
white residue that you see that's mainly

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.010 
white residue that you see that's mainly
the<00:00:19.580> hardness<00:00:20.060> or<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:20.390> calcium<00:00:20.600> magnesium

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
the hardness or the calcium magnesium

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.840 
the hardness or the calcium magnesium
there's<00:00:21.560> other<00:00:21.770> things<00:00:22.100> there<00:00:22.340> but<00:00:22.370> they<00:00:22.640> show

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
there's other things there but they show

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.060 
there's other things there but they show
up<00:00:23.030> quickest<00:00:23.660> can<00:00:24.470> you<00:00:24.560> can<00:00:24.740> you<00:00:24.830> tell<00:00:24.980> me

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
up quickest can you can you tell me

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.220 
up quickest can you can you tell me
about<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.430> life<00:00:25.640> of<00:00:25.880> calcium<00:00:26.660> first<00:00:26.930> of<00:00:27.080> all

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
about the life of calcium first of all

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.470 
about the life of calcium first of all
in<00:00:27.560> in<00:00:28.040> the<00:00:28.370> water

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
in in the water

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.380 
in in the water
I<00:00:29.510> would<00:00:30.140> think<00:00:30.350> in<00:00:30.620> most<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:31.280> the<00:00:31.940> United

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
I would think in most of the United

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.170 
I would think in most of the United
States<00:00:32.719> because<00:00:33.260> most<00:00:34.040> of<00:00:34.160> our<00:00:34.280> aquifers<00:00:34.850> are

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
States because most of our aquifers are

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.090 
States because most of our aquifers are
underground<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:38.290> surrounded<00:00:39.290> by<00:00:39.410> calcium

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
underground and surrounded by calcium

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.850 
underground and surrounded by calcium
carbonate<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.630> water<00:00:41.840> has<00:00:42.380> to<00:00:42.410> pick<00:00:42.829> up

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
carbonate that the water has to pick up

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.130 
carbonate that the water has to pick up
some<00:00:43.190> of<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:43.310> calcium<00:00:43.910> in<00:00:44.210> solution<00:00:44.870> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
some of that calcium in solution and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.310 
some of that calcium in solution and
then<00:00:45.320> hence<00:00:45.950> we<00:00:46.220> get<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:46.610> in<00:00:46.970> our<00:00:47.420> fixtures<00:00:47.989> and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
then hence we get it in our fixtures and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.950 
then hence we get it in our fixtures and
we<00:00:48.410> get<00:00:48.590> it<00:00:48.739> in<00:00:48.920> our<00:00:49.040> water<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.150> what<00:00:50.510> does<00:00:50.840> it

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
we get it in our water but what does it

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.960 
we get it in our water but what does it
look<00:00:51.079> like<00:00:51.140> was<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:51.650> what<00:00:51.890> does<00:00:51.950> it<00:00:52.010> do<00:00:52.280> well<00:00:52.880> as

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
look like was it what does it do well as

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.350 
look like was it what does it do well as
far<00:00:53.210> as<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.450> life<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:54.020> it<00:00:54.170> naturally<00:00:54.710> rain<00:00:55.070> is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
far as the life of it naturally rain is

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.540 
far as the life of it naturally rain is
somewhat<00:00:56.360> acidic<00:00:56.750> so<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.380> goes<00:00:57.620> down<00:00:57.890> over<00:00:58.430> the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
somewhat acidic so it goes down over the

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.299 
somewhat acidic so it goes down over the
rock<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:59.239> even<00:00:59.810> water<00:01:00.559> flowing<00:01:01.070> down<00:01:01.280> a

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
rock and even water flowing down a

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.479 
rock and even water flowing down a
stream<00:01:01.760> over<00:01:01.970> rock<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.660> water<00:01:03.380> is<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.739> solvent

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
stream over rock and water is a solvent

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.090 
stream over rock and water is a solvent
so<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.239> dissolves<00:01:05.600> things<00:01:06.079> that<00:01:06.499> takes<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
so it dissolves things that takes the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.499 
so it dissolves things that takes the
calcium<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:07.789> magnesium<00:01:07.929> into<00:01:08.929> the<00:01:09.109> water<00:01:10.509> and

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
calcium and magnesium into the water and

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.300 
calcium and magnesium into the water and
I<00:01:11.869> think<00:01:12.020> God<00:01:12.200> kind<00:01:12.499> of<00:01:12.619> made<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:12.829> that<00:01:13.100> way

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
I think God kind of made it that way

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.429 
I think God kind of made it that way
because<00:01:13.520> he<00:01:13.909> knew<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:14.299> we<00:01:14.539> needed<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:15.139> so

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
because he knew that we needed it so

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.239 
because he knew that we needed it so
most<00:01:15.950> any<00:01:16.429> water<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.329> either<00:01:18.170> if<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.159> a

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
most any water that either if it's in a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:22.149 
most any water that either if it's in a
stream<00:01:19.609> or<00:01:19.969> in<00:01:20.329> a<00:01:20.479> well<00:01:20.749> has<00:01:21.469> a<00:01:21.499> certain<00:01:22.069> amount

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
stream or in a well has a certain amount

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.090 
stream or in a well has a certain amount
of<00:01:22.429> these<00:01:22.609> minerals<00:01:23.209> trace<00:01:23.719> minerals<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.770> all

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
of these minerals trace minerals of all

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.370 
of these minerals trace minerals of all
kinds<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.579> things<00:01:25.819> and<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.420> lot<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.810> calcium<00:01:27.020> and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
kinds of things and a lot of calcium and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.989 
kinds of things and a lot of calcium and
magnesium<00:01:27.499> does<00:01:28.219> it<00:01:28.310> does<00:01:28.459> it<00:01:28.549> make<00:01:28.639> sense<00:01:28.880> to

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
magnesium does it does it make sense to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.929 
magnesium does it does it make sense to
you<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.149> what<00:01:29.420> what<00:01:30.200> was<00:01:30.409> once<00:01:30.709> rock<00:01:31.069> is<00:01:31.429> is

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
you that what what was once rock is is

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.449 
you that what what was once rock is is
now<00:01:32.209> in<00:01:32.539> solution<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.439> inner<00:01:33.799> water<00:01:34.069> and<00:01:34.369> then

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
now in solution and inner water and then

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.459 
now in solution and inner water and then
by<00:01:34.609> the<00:01:34.670> way<00:01:34.939> doesn't<00:01:35.749> it<00:01:35.959> want<00:01:36.079> to<00:01:36.200> become<00:01:36.439> a

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
by the way doesn't it want to become a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.190 
by the way doesn't it want to become a
rocket<00:01:36.770> yeah<00:01:37.100> that's<00:01:37.459> exactly<00:01:38.119> when<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.899> sees

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
rocket yeah that's exactly when it sees

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.590 
rocket yeah that's exactly when it sees
heat<00:01:39.649> or<00:01:39.920> turbulence<00:01:40.789> or<00:01:41.029> whatever<00:01:41.359> that's

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
heat or turbulence or whatever that's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.840 
heat or turbulence or whatever that's
exactly<00:01:42.109> right<00:01:42.139> it's<00:01:42.499> in<00:01:42.770> there<00:01:43.009> it's

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
exactly right it's in there it's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.839 
exactly right it's in there it's
dissolved<00:01:44.779> in<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.469> water<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:46.099> then<00:01:46.369> when<00:01:46.729> it

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:46.849 
dissolved in the water and then when it

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.139 
dissolved in the water and then when it
sees<00:01:47.229> heat<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.469> turbulence<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:49.670> on<00:01:49.849> and

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
sees heat in turbulence and so on and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.469 
sees heat in turbulence and so on and
the<00:01:50.779> water<00:01:51.049> can't<00:01:51.469> hold<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:52.009> okay<00:01:52.729> dissolved

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the water can't hold it okay dissolved

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.269 
the water can't hold it okay dissolved
it<00:01:53.630> can't<00:01:54.079> stay<00:01:54.349> dissolved<00:01:54.920> any<00:01:55.069> more

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
it can't stay dissolved any more

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:58.269 
it can't stay dissolved any more
especially<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.789> hotter<00:01:56.209> the<00:01:56.479> water<00:01:56.509> gets<00:01:57.279> the

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279 
especially the hotter the water gets the

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.580 
especially the hotter the water gets the
less<00:01:58.549> can<00:01:58.819> stay<00:01:59.060> dissolved<00:01:59.539> in<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.689> water<00:01:59.869> so

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
less can stay dissolved in the water so

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.059 
less can stay dissolved in the water so
it<00:02:00.679> comes<00:02:00.950> out<00:02:01.249> it<00:02:02.119> has<00:02:02.419> a<00:02:02.450> charge<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.770> it

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
it comes out it has a charge to it it

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.489 
it comes out it has a charge to it it
kind<00:02:04.549> of<00:02:04.609> like<00:02:04.789> you<00:02:05.630> know<00:02:05.659> electrostatic

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
kind of like you know electrostatic

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.770 
kind of like you know electrostatic
charge<00:02:06.770> like<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.520> little<00:02:07.819> ridiculous<00:02:08.300> pieces

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
charge like the little ridiculous pieces

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.300 
charge like the little ridiculous pieces
of<00:02:08.899> paper<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.229> stick<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.709> your<00:02:09.860> hand<00:02:10.099> you

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
of paper that stick to your hand you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.649 
of paper that stick to your hand you
know<00:02:10.369> static<00:02:10.759> electricity<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.480> then<00:02:11.569> it

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
know static electricity and then it

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:19.230 
know static electricity and then it
wants<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.900> stick<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.409> something

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.300
