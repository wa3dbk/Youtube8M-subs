nice that looks well I wish there was
more<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:43.070> it<00:05:43.100> but<00:05:43.430> there's<00:05:43.700> not<00:05:44.060> actually<00:05:44.770> it

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
more to it but there's not actually it

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.660 
more to it but there's not actually it
is<00:05:45.980> a<00:05:46.130> very<00:05:46.490> simple<00:05:47.030> one<00:05:47.240> to<00:05:47.630> get<00:05:48.070> it's<00:05:49.070> got<00:05:49.250> one

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
is a very simple one to get it's got one

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.970 
is a very simple one to get it's got one
augmentation<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:50.840> that's<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.260> only<00:05:51.710> one<00:05:51.860> you

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
augmentation and that's the only one you

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.220 
augmentation and that's the only one you
can<00:05:52.130> put<00:05:52.310> on<00:05:52.460> it<00:05:52.660> but<00:05:53.660> that<00:05:53.810> doesn't<00:05:54.110> really

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
can put on it but that doesn't really

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.990 
can put on it but that doesn't really
matter<00:05:54.410> because<00:05:54.620> it's<00:05:55.400> just<00:05:55.550> that<00:05:55.640> awesome
