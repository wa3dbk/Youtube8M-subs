to type in google as you can see here's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.629 
to type in google as you can see here's

the keyboard so lovely little device and

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:10.449 
the keyboard so lovely little device and
I<00:02:07.639> very<00:02:07.909> slow<00:02:08.149> internet<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:08.920> yeah<00:02:09.920> it's<00:02:10.250> still

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
a great device and you can see the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.590 
a great device and you can see the
screen<00:02:12.230> quality<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.770> lovely<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:14.000> very<00:02:14.390> nice

screen quality is lovely it's very nice
device

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
device

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.839 
device
and<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.069> talk<00:02:17.189> about<00:02:17.280> processor

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
and now we can talk about processor

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.479 
and now we can talk about processor
because<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.390> speed<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:18.900> general<00:02:19.409> it's<00:02:19.980> just

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
because of speed in general it's just

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.240 
because of speed in general it's just
it's<00:02:21.030> Swift<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.079> does<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.409> job<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.890> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
it's Swift and it does the job and you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's Swift and it does the job and you
can't<00:02:23.459> really<00:02:23.579> ask<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:23.879> anything<00:02:24.120> quicker

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
can't really ask for anything quicker

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.839 
can't really ask for anything quicker
because<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:25.170> does<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.769> so<00:02:25.920> well<00:02:26.129> but<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.640> has

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
because it does it so well but it has

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.690 
because it does it so well but it has
got<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.420> I've<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.500> got<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:28.890> my<00:02:29.040> notes<00:02:29.280> let

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
got a I've just got it here my notes let

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.539 
got a I've just got it here my notes let
me<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:29.970> check<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.959> 1.2<00:02:31.560> gigahertz<00:02:31.890> janna

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
me just check it's a 1.2 gigahertz janna

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.630 
me just check it's a 1.2 gigahertz janna
video<00:02:32.819> Tegra<00:02:33.750> 3<00:02:33.780> quad-core<00:02:34.409> processor<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
video Tegra 3 quad-core processor and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.130 
video Tegra 3 quad-core processor and
it's<00:02:35.939> one<00:02:36.060> particular<00:02:36.569> hurt<00:02:36.689> so<00:02:36.870> that's<00:02:37.019> a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
it's one particular hurt so that's a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.679 
it's one particular hurt so that's a
great<00:02:37.370> processor<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.670> that'll<00:02:39.150> get<00:02:39.359> things

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
great processor and that'll get things

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.520 
great processor and that'll get things
done<00:02:40.129> and<00:02:41.129> see<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.790> works<00:02:42.060> pretty<00:02:42.299> smoothly<00:02:42.689> it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
done and see it works pretty smoothly it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.539 
done and see it works pretty smoothly it
snow<00:02:43.769> like<00:02:43.950> lag<00:02:44.489> or<00:02:44.700> anything<00:02:46.549> everything

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
snow like lag or anything everything

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.080 
snow like lag or anything everything
works<00:02:47.730> very<00:02:48.090> well<00:02:48.349> and<00:02:49.349> we<00:02:50.159> can<00:02:50.340> do<00:02:50.670> swift

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
works very well and we can do swift

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.490 
works very well and we can do swift
movements<00:02:51.750> pull<00:02:51.989> down<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.349> they've

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
movements pull down and they've

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.740 
movements pull down and they've
everything<00:02:53.370> works<00:02:53.639> really<00:02:53.909> fast<00:02:54.209> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
everything works really fast and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.369 
everything works really fast and
thoroughly<00:02:56.030> look-wise<00:02:57.030> i<00:02:57.060> think<00:02:58.019> that

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
thoroughly look-wise i think that

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.349 
thoroughly look-wise i think that
they've<00:02:59.010> done<00:02:59.159> a<00:02:59.220> good<00:02:59.370> job<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.940> in

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
they've done a good job because it's in

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.910 
they've done a good job because it's in
between<00:03:00.599> obviously<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.349> wanted<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.709> keep<00:03:01.829> it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
between obviously they wanted to keep it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.770 
between obviously they wanted to keep it
cheap<00:03:02.129> so<00:03:02.310> they've<00:03:02.459> not<00:03:02.639> done<00:03:02.670> really<00:03:03.659> nice

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
cheap so they've not done really nice

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.899 
cheap so they've not done really nice
backing<00:03:04.409> and<00:03:04.560> stuff<00:03:04.709> but<00:03:04.950> still<00:03:05.459> looks<00:03:05.670> good

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
backing and stuff but still looks good

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.119 
backing and stuff but still looks good
and<00:03:06.090> i<00:03:06.329> think<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:06.689> a<00:03:06.840> good<00:03:07.019> line<00:03:07.829> between

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
and i think it's a good line between

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.550 
and i think it's a good line between
cheap-looking<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.510> expensive<00:03:10.290> looking

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
cheap-looking and expensive looking

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.979 
cheap-looking and expensive looking
because<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:11.099> looks<00:03:11.340> good<00:03:12.150> enough<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
because it looks good enough for the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.289 
because it looks good enough for the
price<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:14.069> feels<00:03:14.310> great<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:14.909> the<00:03:15.060> weight

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
price and it feels great and the weight

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.780 
price and it feels great and the weight
is<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.689> syringe<00:03:16.470> with<00:03:16.650> photographs<00:03:17.040> oh<00:03:17.280> it's

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
is a syringe with photographs oh it's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.369 
is a syringe with photographs oh it's
bit<00:03:17.939> more<00:03:18.090> than<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.269> ipad<00:03:18.510> mini<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.260> know

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
bit more than the ipad mini if you know

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.990 
bit more than the ipad mini if you know
how<00:03:19.620> much<00:03:19.769> dope<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.160> many<00:03:20.280> things<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:20.609> but

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
how much dope in many things like but

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.759 
how much dope in many things like but
it's<00:03:21.090> about<00:03:21.180> half<00:03:21.510> an<00:03:21.660> ipad<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.349> it's<00:03:22.590> pretty

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
it's about half an ipad so it's pretty

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.189 
it's about half an ipad so it's pretty
good<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:24.180> think<00:03:24.389> it's<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.629> really<00:03:24.660> well<00:03:25.169> made

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
good and I think it's a really well made

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.949 
good and I think it's a really well made
and<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:26.220> quite<00:03:26.459> stable<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.329> doesn't<00:03:27.870> look

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
and it's quite stable and doesn't look

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.710 
and it's quite stable and doesn't look
like<00:03:28.109> it's<00:03:28.260> going<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.470> break<00:03:28.650> at<00:03:28.859> all<00:03:29.720> overall

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
like it's going to break at all overall

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.750 
like it's going to break at all overall
this<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.049> great<00:03:31.530> little<00:03:31.680> device<00:03:32.159> it<00:03:32.430> does<00:03:32.730> a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
this is a great little device it does a

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.270 
this is a great little device it does a
job<00:03:33.120> very<00:03:33.659> cheap<00:03:34.019> definitely<00:03:34.980> worth<00:03:35.069> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
job very cheap definitely worth the
