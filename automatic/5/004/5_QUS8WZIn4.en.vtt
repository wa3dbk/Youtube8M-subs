give you just a real high-level overview
of<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> different<00:00:15.059> Intel<00:00:15.929> parallel

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
of what the different Intel parallel

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
of what the different Intel parallel
studio<00:00:16.590> tools<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> how<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> find<00:00:18.300> them

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
studio tools do and how to find them

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.050

this<00:00:19.170> isn't<00:00:19.380> meant<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.890> an<00:00:20.100> instruction<00:00:20.880> in

using each and every tool in detail

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.029 
using each and every tool in detail
rather<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.480> how<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.109> them<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.619> get

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
rather just how to get to them and get

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.890 
rather just how to get to them and get
them<00:00:26.130> going<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:27.090> future<00:00:27.300> videos<00:00:27.420> we'll

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
them going and in future videos we'll

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900 
them going and in future videos we'll
walk<00:00:28.170> through<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.560> steps<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.400> actually<00:00:29.550> using

unzipped that and opened it and this is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.030 
unzipped that and opened it and this is
what<00:00:43.200> we've<00:00:43.320> got

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
what we've got

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.529 
what we've got
the<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.489> project<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> serial

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the first project here is a serial

the first project here is a serial
version<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.469> program<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> big

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
version of this program it's just a big

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.340 
version of this program it's just a big
demonstration<00:00:48.539> program<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.110> does<00:00:49.230> some

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
demonstration program it does some

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.880 
demonstration program it does some
graphics<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> whatnot<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.620> go<00:00:52.620> ahead<00:00:52.710> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
run it end up with a big chart here

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.280 
run it end up with a big chart here
which<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> breakdown<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.420> code<00:01:21.840> and

parallelized version of your code then

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.399 
parallelized version of your code then
after<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:45.149> want<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.570> move<00:01:45.750> forward<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
after that you want to move forward to

do some profiling on your code find out

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
do some profiling on your code find out
if<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.530> parallelization<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:50.939> helped

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
if the parallelization actually helped

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170

only<00:03:12.370> mentioned<00:03:12.850> three<00:03:13.120> tools<00:03:13.360> so<00:03:13.600> far<00:03:13.840> that's

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
only mentioned three tools so far that's

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.290 
only mentioned three tools so far that's
