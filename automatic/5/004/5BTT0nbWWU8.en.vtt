00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello, I'm a movie nose and welcome 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.500
 to my channel 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.719
 in this master class I will show you how 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.990
 perform pendant using the fillet technique 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.190
 the edge that allows you to create graceful 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.000
 Detailed polymer jewelry 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.070
 clay 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 the very word filigree from latin 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.990
 means thread and grain and work in this 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.840
 technique requires much attention so 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.640
 how very tiny as I didn't know 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.160
 what color do i need in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.650
 I decided to take a big job right away 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
 polymer clay set in me 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.410
 need a tool for modeling 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.290
 blade to cut the plastic gel 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.329
 liquid plastic frame which can 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.700
 be both metal and met 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.800
 from polymer clay 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.750
 assembly tools and fittings i 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.550
 I take a piece of bright red plastic 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.989
 I select the size suitable for the frame 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.449
 I put on the frame the gel liquid plastic 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.960
 which will function here 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.600
 glue 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.510
 put a red piece on top and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.799
 smoothing it pranked smooth 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.420
 fingers to leave no fingerprints 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.340
 I put the main points with a sharp needle 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.700
 elements of the picture that I want 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700
 perform 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.040
 I roll a thin sausage and cut it into 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.610
 equal parts 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.060
 each of the parts I roll into a ball and each 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.210
 ball 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.780
 a little bit of these droplets and will be elements 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.780
 filigree 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.970
 modeling tool pick up 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.640
 a little bit 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.890
 and placed on the surface of the pendant this 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.500
 there will be petals flower pay 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.570
 attention exactly how I fix on 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.369
 pendant 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.829
 after that i take beige plastic 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.520
 I roll a thin sausage and cut into 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.330
 parts smaller each of the parts roll 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.930
 a ball and then a bit 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.340
 and these droplets are a modeling tool 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.180
 I place on the pendant 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.580
 This will be the second row of sv. then take 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.640
 a small piece of gold color kata 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.729
 thin thin sausage less often its on 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.250
 identical parts are quite small each 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.990
 I roll this piece into a ball 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.560
 tiny little bit and place the third 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.560
 layer of petals 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.010
 tweezers take glue straszinku 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.890
 and placing it in the center of the flower it will be it 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.230
 the middle glue rhinestones are good because 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.390
 under the influence of temperature they themselves 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.390
 stick to the surface will not need 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.550
 get them and glue I performed 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.430
 flower now I want to make a small 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.770
 twig and leaves for this I took 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.400
 green mixed with white and a piece 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.800
 gold 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.370
 I rolled out of these two colors long 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.680
 sausages and cut into small pieces 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.700
 I roll each of the pieces first 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.010
 then a bit 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.620
 and these droplets I fix in the form 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.959
 sprigs the arrangement of this sprig i 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.680
 drew originally with a sharp end 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.269
 Needles now I want to perform 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.370
 bigger leaves 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.130
 I take a bigger piece of gold 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.680
 I roll it into a ball into a droplet 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.350
 and this bit flatten out on the pad 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.840
 finger I get the shape of a leaflet 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.019
 on which side of the blade I 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.800
 I draw veins modeling tool 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.020
 I place a leaf on the pendant 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.360
 then I perform the second leaf and 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.940
 I place next to the work looked 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.670
 more detailed more volumetric i 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.910
 I make a few more leaves around the edges 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.910
 St. 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.480
 and posting some more white ones 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.209
 petals and then the frame with 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.590
 ready to bake 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.810
 temperature and long baking 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.510
 look at the polymer clay packaging from 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.540
 which you sculpt after the pendant 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.150
 baked it needs to be assembled for fastening 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.129
 I chose the base for hanging 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.379
 silver I fix it at 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.199
 help tools on the ring top 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.410
 pendant and bottom I want to fix the beads 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.630
 For this, I collect them on the pin 1 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.470
 pin three beads 2 white and one 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:32.490
 red and then everything and fasten down below 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:35.330
 pendant on a ring thread chain pendant 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.400
 ready and I got the original 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.260
 elegant detailed pendant in this 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.350
 technology can do the work of any 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.169
 difficulty to choose any shades and 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.389
 color combinations it all depends on 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.699
 your fantasy after i 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.680
 fulfilled this pendant did not want 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.950
 do the same but in more gentle 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.039
 shades result you see yourself wish 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.810
