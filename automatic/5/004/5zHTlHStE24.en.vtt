00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
as far as Kingaroy is concerned only a

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.270 
as far as Kingaroy is concerned only a

Israeli and they're still growing it is
a<00:03:12.290> wonderful<00:03:12.650> town<00:03:12.860> today<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.640> think<00:03:14.120> the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
a wonderful town today I think the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.339 
a wonderful town today I think the
population<00:03:14.569> would<00:03:15.200> be<00:03:15.280> about<00:03:16.280> 5,000<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.480> it's

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
population would be about 5,000 and it's

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.330 
population would be about 5,000 and it's
the<00:03:19.130> center<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.819> Kingaroy<00:03:20.239> Shire<00:03:21.220> with<00:03:22.220> a

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
the center of the Kingaroy Shire with a

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.839 
the center of the Kingaroy Shire with a
population<00:03:22.849> of<00:03:23.120> over<00:03:23.560> 8,000<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.739> very<00:03:25.610> good

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
population of over 8,000 a very good

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.410 
population of over 8,000 a very good
climate<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.959> think<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:28.299> multitude<00:03:29.299> or

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
climate I think the multitude or

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.300 
climate I think the multitude or
something<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.900> fourteen<00:03:30.319> hundred<00:03:30.650> odd<00:03:30.980> feet

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
something like fourteen hundred odd feet

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.089 
something like fourteen hundred odd feet
and<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:33.140> would<00:03:33.620> say<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.670> Kingaroy<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:36.739> most

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
and I would say that Kingaroy is most

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.470 
and I would say that Kingaroy is most
fortunate<00:03:38.049> being<00:03:39.049> surrounded
