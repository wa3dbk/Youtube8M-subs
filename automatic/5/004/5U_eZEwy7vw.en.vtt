point six percent he could do better in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.179 
point six percent he could do better in
that<00:01:49.560> department

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
that department

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.910

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
what if LeBron got up to 85 percent plus

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
what if LeBron got up to 85 percent plus

there is no I mean of course there's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.830 
there is no I mean of course there's
room<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:58.920> improvement<00:01:59.299> because<00:02:00.299> he's<00:02:00.659> not

very clear about this when we're at the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.530 
very clear about this when we're at the
finals<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.400> didn't<00:03:11.400> see<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.880> LeBron<00:03:12.240> I've

Battier out on the perimeter where they

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.230 
Battier out on the perimeter where they

can drain three after three after three

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.600 
can drain three after three after three
as<00:03:45.720> we<00:03:46.200> saw<00:03:46.380> in<00:03:46.530> games<00:03:46.770> 3<00:03:46.980> 4<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.370> 5

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
as we saw in games 3 4 and 5

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.180 
as we saw in games 3 4 and 5
that<00:03:48.480> was<00:03:48.690> beautiful<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.590> watch<00:03:49.770> but<00:03:50.160> I

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
that was beautiful to watch but I

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.190 
that was beautiful to watch but I
haven't<00:03:50.610> gotten<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.970> see<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.450> before<00:03:51.690> and

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
haven't gotten to see that before and

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.040 
haven't gotten to see that before and
I'm<00:03:52.470> gonna<00:03:52.560> say<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:52.830> one<00:03:52.920> last<00:03:53.280> time<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:54.050> think

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
I'm gonna say it one last time I think

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.410 
I'm gonna say it one last time I think
LeBron<00:03:55.550> eventually<00:03:56.550> can<00:03:56.760> get<00:03:56.940> comfortable

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
LeBron eventually can get comfortable

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.949 
LeBron eventually can get comfortable
with<00:03:58.080> being<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.950> first<00:03:59.340> option<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.120> last<00:04:00.660> shot

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
with being the first option in last shot

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.840 
with being the first option in last shot
situations<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.860> he<00:04:02.010> has<00:04:02.100> never<00:04:02.310> been<00:04:02.550> in<00:04:02.730> his

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
situations that he has never been in his

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.520 
situations that he has never been in his
career<00:04:03.180> especially<00:04:03.660> now<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.230> he's<00:04:04.320> with

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
career especially now that he's with

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.770 
career especially now that he's with
Dwyane<00:04:04.800> Wade<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.730> think<00:04:06.060> at<00:04:06.180> some<00:04:06.360> point<00:04:06.420> he

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
Dwyane Wade but I think at some point he

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.570 
Dwyane Wade but I think at some point he

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.300 
can get comfortable with Dwayne's help
that<00:04:09.209> he<00:04:09.720> can<00:04:09.930> shoot<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.470> last<00:04:10.739> shot<00:04:11.040> and

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
that he can shoot that last shot and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.620 
that he can shoot that last shot and
make<00:04:11.580> them<00:04:11.790> because<00:04:12.030> last<00:04:12.239> year<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.540> the
