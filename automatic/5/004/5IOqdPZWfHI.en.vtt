00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
spread the fingers it's too much tension

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.860 
spread the fingers it's too much tension
or<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:44.129> more<00:00:44.250> tension<00:00:44.670> than<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.840> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
or a little more tension than that I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
or a little more tension than that I
want<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> very<00:00:46.770> relaxed<00:00:47.309> relaxed

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
want and this is a very relaxed relaxed

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.220 
want and this is a very relaxed relaxed
way<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.090> holding<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:49.280> I<00:00:50.539> take<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> string<00:00:51.870> here

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
way of holding in I take the string here

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560 
way of holding in I take the string here
right<00:00:52.500> about<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> middle<00:00:53.270> where<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> think

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
right about the middle where I think

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.889 
right about the middle where I think
it's<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> best<00:00:54.960> tone<00:00:55.520> because<00:00:56.660> if<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.750> go

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it's the best tone because if we go

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.450 
it's the best tone because if we go
towards<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> bridge<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.949> getting<00:00:59.219> harsher

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
towards the bridge it's getting harsher

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
towards the bridge it's getting harsher
and<00:00:59.879> never<00:01:00.300> go<00:01:00.480> towards<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.109> neck<00:01:01.440> it's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and never go towards the neck it's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.910 
and never go towards the neck it's
getting<00:01:01.890> mellow<00:01:02.100> which<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.670> nice<00:01:03.149> effects

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
getting mellow which are nice effects

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.160 
getting mellow which are nice effects
but<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> general<00:01:05.610> playing<00:01:06.210> our<00:01:06.450> tend<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
but for the general playing our tend to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.399 
but for the general playing our tend to
use<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.310> area<00:01:08.700> also<00:01:09.299> i<00:01:09.890> anchor<00:01:10.890> my<00:01:10.920> hand<00:01:11.580> here

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
use this area also i anchor my hand here

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.880 
use this area also i anchor my hand here
on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> bridge<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> palm<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.890> anchor

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
on the bridge with a palm I don't anchor

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
on the bridge with a palm I don't anchor
it<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.159> finger<00:01:17.549> or<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.540> pickguard<00:01:18.780> or

it with a finger or on the pickguard or
on<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> strings<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> string

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
on the strings and I take the string

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.280 
on the strings and I take the string
here<00:01:23.340> at<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> 30<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.060> 45<00:01:24.479> degree<00:01:24.900> angle

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
here at a 30 to 45 degree angle

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.330 
here at a 30 to 45 degree angle
depending<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.070> tone<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
depending on the kind of tone and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.510 
depending on the kind of tone and
definition<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.860> kind<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.189> change

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
definition I want and I kind of change

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.249 
definition I want and I kind of change
the<00:01:29.790> angle<00:01:30.600> slightly<00:01:31.460> as<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.990> across<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the angle slightly as I go across the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.899 
the angle slightly as I go across the
strings<00:01:34.759> when<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.820> play<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.810> bass<00:01:37.200> strings

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
strings when I play on the bass strings

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.219 
strings when I play on the bass strings
especially<00:01:38.909> rhythm<00:01:39.180> guitar<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> usually<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
especially rhythm guitar I usually go a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.830 
especially rhythm guitar I usually go a
little<00:01:40.470> flatter<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> lip<00:01:41.970> pick<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:42.570> at

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
little flatter with a lip pick not at

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.710 
little flatter with a lip pick not at
the<00:01:43.020> 45<00:01:44.009> degree<00:01:44.130> angle<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.610> something<00:01:44.970> because

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the 45 degree angle or something because

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.749 
the 45 degree angle or something because
the<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.350> angling<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> bass<00:01:47.369> strings

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the more angling on the bass strings

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.670 
the more angling on the bass strings
them<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.329> stretchy<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> sound<00:01:49.140> gets<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
them the stretchy of the sound gets and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
them the stretchy of the sound gets and
that<00:01:50.490> may<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.670> cool<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.210> some<00:01:51.570> leaky<00:01:52.049> hair

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
that may be cool for some leaky hair

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.870 
that may be cool for some leaky hair
stuff<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.950> rhythm<00:01:53.159> guitar<00:01:53.430> stuff<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
stuff but for rhythm guitar stuff I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429 
stuff but for rhythm guitar stuff I
personally<00:01:54.570> don't<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.290> too<00:01:55.409> much

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
personally don't like it too much

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.380 
personally don't like it too much
specially<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.189> heavier<00:01:56.820> rhythm<00:01:57.119> guitar

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
specially if it's heavier rhythm guitar

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.069 
specially if it's heavier rhythm guitar
stuff<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> gets<00:01:58.890> doubled<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.090> tend<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
stuff or if it gets doubled so I tend to

go a bit flatter or the the pic
no<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.440> actual<00:02:06.590> picking<00:02:07.010> motion<00:02:07.340> is

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
no and the the actual picking motion is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.880 
no and the the actual picking motion is
as<00:02:07.640> small<00:02:07.940> as<00:02:08.090> possible<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:09.229> don't<00:02:09.709> want<00:02:09.830> to

as small as possible I don't want to
waste<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.130> lot<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.340> energy<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.540> time<00:02:12.170> by<00:02:12.500> making

big<00:02:13.250> movements<00:02:14.140> per<00:02:15.140> se<00:02:15.410> although<00:02:15.620> they<00:02:16.100> can

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
big movements per se although they can

big movements per se although they can
be<00:02:16.370> cool<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.880> sometimes<00:02:17.870> do<00:02:18.160> have<00:02:19.160> extreme

big<00:02:20.660> motions<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.680> know<00:02:21.770> big<00:02:22.069> means

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
big motions just you know big means

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.190 
big motions just you know big means
better<00:02:22.790> means<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.239> lot<00:02:23.390> i<00:02:23.420> means<00:02:23.720> rock<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.930> roll

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
better means a lot i means rock a roll

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.770 
better means a lot i means rock a roll
right<00:02:24.760> but<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.910> majority<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.450> times

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
right but the majority of times

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.780 
right but the majority of times
especially<00:02:26.900> were<00:02:27.230> playing<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.560> bit<00:02:27.709> faster<00:02:28.130> I

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
especially were playing a bit faster I

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.820 
especially were playing a bit faster I
tend<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.270> stay<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:29.840> close<00:02:30.020> as<00:02:30.260> possible<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
tend to stay as close as possible to the

string and that is my little tip on how
to<00:02:43.510> help<00:02:44.510> pick<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.050> how<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.350> get<00:02:45.500> up<00:02:45.739> some

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
to help pick and how to get up some

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.360 
to help pick and how to get up some
optimum<00:02:46.430> tone<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.390> hope<00:02:47.600> you<00:02:47.690> like<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:48.050> and

optimum tone and I hope you like it and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.480
