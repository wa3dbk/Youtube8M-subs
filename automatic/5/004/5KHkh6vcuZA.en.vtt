00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
update on the plan now to do it a little

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.250 
update on the plan now to do it a little
bit<00:00:49.680> quicker<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.239> info<00:00:51.570> box<00:00:51.780> now

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
go here and change the number now there
is<00:01:53.250> an<00:01:53.549> even<00:01:53.850> faster<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:55.049> this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
is an even faster way to do this

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.749 
is an even faster way to do this
particularly<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.640> be

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
particularly if you're going to be

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.389 
particularly if you're going to be
remembering<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.450> whole<00:01:57.630> lot<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.110> them<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:59.219> need

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
remembering a whole lot of them you need

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
remembering a whole lot of them you need
to<00:01:59.520> select<00:01:59.790> them<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.689> order<00:02:01.020> you'd<00:02:01.290> like

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to select them in the order you'd like

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.330 
to select them in the order you'd like
to<00:02:01.710> number<00:02:02.009> them

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
to number them

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
to number them
so<00:02:02.670> I'm<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> select<00:02:03.090> first<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.659> one

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
so I'm going to select first this one

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.639 
so I'm going to select first this one
then<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.450> third<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:07.049> 4th<00:02:07.439> one

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
then that one is third one is 4th one

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.490 
then that one is third one is 4th one
and<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.250> many<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.819> wish<00:02:09.500> then

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and you can do as many as you wish then

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.760 
and you can do as many as you wish then
go<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.009> document<00:02:11.550> menu

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
you'll see that there are four windows

made sure that it says unique ID for

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
simple case we're not going to use the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.840 
simple case we're not going to use the
first<00:02:49.680> two<00:02:49.800> we're<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.250> use<00:02:50.400> just<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
first two we're going to use just the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.200 
first two we're going to use just the
w-4<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.290> text<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> counter<00:02:53.910> here

w-4 the text and have a counter here
let's<00:02:55.110> say<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.410> wanted<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.740> start<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.190> at

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
let's say that I wanted to start this at

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.070 
let's say that I wanted to start this at
number<00:02:57.900> four<00:02:58.820> now<00:02:59.820> noticing<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.960> is

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
number four now noticing that this is

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.870 
number four now noticing that this is
not<00:03:01.260> working<00:03:01.530> right<00:03:02.070> now<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.610> I'm<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:02.850> to

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
not working right now so I'm going to

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.790 
not working right now so I'm going to
have<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.150> save<00:03:03.480> settings<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.140> close<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.770> then

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
have to save settings and close and then

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.400 
have to save settings and close and then
go<00:03:05.610> back<00:03:05.820> in<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.360> seems<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> little<00:03:07.080> bit

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
go back in this seems to be a little bit

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.160 
go back in this seems to be a little bit
finicky<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.790> I'll<00:03:08.910> go<00:03:09.060> back<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.480> schedules<00:03:10.080> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
finicky so I'll go back in schedules the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.280 
finicky so I'll go back in schedules the
list<00:03:10.380> element<00:03:10.830> ID<00:03:10.980> manager<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.840> go<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> ID

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
list element ID manager and go to the ID

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.620 
list element ID manager and go to the ID
format<00:03:13.890> again<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.460> you<00:03:15.210> can<00:03:15.330> see<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.570> it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
format again and you can see that it

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.360 
format again and you can see that it
actually<00:03:15.750> recorded<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.500> number<00:03:16.620> four<00:03:17.010> here

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
actually recorded the number four here

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.300 
actually recorded the number four here
let's<00:03:17.850> say<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.270> wanted<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.570> start<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.990> at

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
let's say that we wanted to start it at

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.540 
let's say that we wanted to start it at
twelve

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550

you see immediately on the plan twelve
thirteen<00:03:34.140> fourteen<00:03:34.170> fifteen<00:03:34.770> let's<00:03:35.760> say<00:03:35.910> I

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
thirteen fourteen fifteen let's say I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.490 
thirteen fourteen fifteen let's say I
wanted<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.270> do<00:03:36.390> them<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.720> reverse<00:03:36.990> order<00:03:37.230> I

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
wanted to do them in the reverse order I

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.320 
wanted to do them in the reverse order I
can<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.890> go<00:03:38.990> here<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:41.550> depends<00:03:41.940> upon<00:03:42.060> which
