a lot of problems next is a little bit
better<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.479> does<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:16.020> heavy-duty

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
better this can does have heavy-duty

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.260 
better this can does have heavy-duty
steel<00:01:16.799> wraps<00:01:17.280> around<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.670> exterior<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
steel wraps around the exterior of the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.370 
steel wraps around the exterior of the
can<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.880> it's<00:01:20.880> got<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:23.990> problem<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.229> this

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
can and it's got a problem with this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.020 
can and it's got a problem with this
it's<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.850> spring-loaded

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it's not really spring-loaded

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.270 
it's not really spring-loaded
and<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.420> doesn't<00:01:27.720> set<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> cam<00:01:28.530> back<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.009> place

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and it doesn't set the cam back in place

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
and it doesn't set the cam back in place
the<00:01:31.640> handle<00:01:36.560> will<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.770> sell<00:01:38.430> clothes<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.060> think

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the handle will not sell clothes I think

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.300 
the handle will not sell clothes I think
that's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.380> important<00:01:40.860> feature<00:01:40.979> you've

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that's a very important feature you've

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.420 
that's a very important feature you've
got<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> remember<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.810> turn<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> turn<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.920> back

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.190 

so<00:01:50.430> I'd<00:01:50.729> rather<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.540> completely

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so I'd rather have a can that completely

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.950 
so I'd rather have a can that completely
self<00:01:52.439> closes<00:01:52.860> when<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.040> lid<00:01:53.250> falls<00:01:53.490> down<00:01:53.960> our

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
self closes when the lid falls down our

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.480 
self closes when the lid falls down our
next<00:01:55.229> hand<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.710> say

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.600 

my<00:02:00.490> biggest<00:02:00.730> complaint<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.360> probably<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
my biggest complaint is probably the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.520 
my biggest complaint is probably the
bulky<00:02:04.090> metal<00:02:04.450> around<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.900> exterior<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.380> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
bulky metal around the exterior of the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.570 
bulky metal around the exterior of the
can<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:06.040> prefer<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.970> have<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.150> can<00:02:07.480> that's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
can I prefer to have a can that's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.620 
can I prefer to have a can that's
minimizes<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.790> amount<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:10.119> metal<00:02:10.330> on<00:02:10.540> the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
minimizes the amount of metal on the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.230 
minimizes the amount of metal on the
exterior<00:02:10.990> I<00:02:11.170> think<00:02:11.410> it's<00:02:12.280> when<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.210> a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
exterior I think it's when you have a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.700 
exterior I think it's when you have a
lot<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.480> metal<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:13.900> invites<00:02:14.260> people<00:02:14.530> to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
lot of metal and invites people to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.290 
lot of metal and invites people to
possibly<00:02:15.160> take<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.580> candy<00:02:15.940> because<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.210> do

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
possibly take the candy because this do

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.820 
possibly take the candy because this do
you<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.570> beer<00:02:16.810> problem<00:02:17.230> they<00:02:17.500> probably

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
you have a beer problem they probably

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.520
