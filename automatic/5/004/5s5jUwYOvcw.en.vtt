00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the overload it's kind of make your

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.730 
the overload it's kind of make your
choice<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.360> now

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.499 

but<00:01:25.340> she's<00:01:25.520> probably<00:01:25.759> not<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.060> be<00:01:26.150> making<00:01:26.450> the

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
but she's probably not to be making the

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.200 
but she's probably not to be making the
same<00:01:26.570> mistake<00:01:27.049> again<00:01:27.079> get<00:01:27.799> near<00:01:28.070> me<00:01:31.210> but

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.780 

and<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.480> took<00:01:38.600> about<00:01:38.720> half<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:39.110> like<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:40.340> I

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
and it took about half is like and I

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:53.220 
and it took about half is like and I
didn't<00:01:41.000> get<00:01:41.090> touched

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:07.570
