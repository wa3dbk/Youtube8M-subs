00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
that's a little bit bigger than the size

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.890 
that's a little bit bigger than the size
between<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:09.340> edge<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.090> case<00:03:10.329> in<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.750> edge

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
between the edge of the case in the edge

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900 
between the edge of the case in the edge
of<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.260> phone<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.970> keep<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:13.299> mind

what<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> like<00:03:16.180> about<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.450> detail<00:03:17.169> here

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
what I like about this detail here

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.879 
what I like about this detail here
you're<00:03:18.280> going<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.459> see<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.690> cutouts<00:03:20.139> are

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
you're going to see that the cutouts are

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.699 
you're going to see that the cutouts are
pretty<00:03:21.250> accurate<00:03:21.849> there's<00:03:22.239> not<00:03:22.450> much<00:03:22.720> space

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
pretty accurate there's not much space

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.860 
pretty accurate there's not much space
you<00:03:23.769> can't<00:03:24.129> see<00:03:24.250> too<00:03:24.430> much<00:03:24.549> white<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.660> like

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
you can't see too much white and I like

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.409 
you can't see too much white and I like
that<00:03:26.139> it<00:03:26.919> just<00:03:27.099> adds<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.700> nice<00:03:27.819> detail<00:03:28.269> and

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
that it just adds a nice detail and

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.990 
that it just adds a nice detail and
quality<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.109> it's<00:03:29.859> the<00:03:30.010> same<00:03:30.220> for<00:03:30.639> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
quality to it it's the same for the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.490 
quality to it it's the same for the
volume<00:03:31.599> rocker<00:03:32.579> now<00:03:33.579> as<00:03:33.879> you<00:03:33.910> go<00:03:34.180> around

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
volume rocker now as you go around

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.599 
volume rocker now as you go around
you're<00:03:35.500> going<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.709> notice<00:03:35.859> that<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
you're going to notice that on the

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.210 
you're going to notice that on the
bottom<00:03:37.000> here<00:03:37.299> is<00:03:37.480> full<00:03:38.349> access<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.280> bottom

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
bottom here is full access to the bottom

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.890 
bottom here is full access to the bottom
so<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.250> got<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.519> little<00:03:42.669> bit<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.000> exposure<00:03:43.389> here

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
so you got a little bit of exposure here

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.409 
so you got a little bit of exposure here
towards<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.590> bottom<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.910> same<00:03:46.120> on<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
towards the bottom and the same on the

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.900 
towards the bottom and the same on the
flip<00:03:46.629> side<00:03:46.660> on<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.199> top<00:03:47.699> you're<00:03:48.699> going<00:03:48.819> to

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
flip side on the top you're going to

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.369 
flip side on the top you're going to
have<00:03:49.000> some<00:03:49.180> exposure<00:03:49.599> so<00:03:50.079> you're<00:03:50.260> not

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
have some exposure so you're not

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.800 
have some exposure so you're not
completely<00:03:50.620> protected<00:03:51.549> on<00:03:51.699> the<00:03:51.819> edges<00:03:52.239> but

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
completely protected on the edges but

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.750 
completely protected on the edges but
you<00:03:52.989> are<00:03:53.109> protected<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.340> left<00:03:54.579> and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
the right of the device and it's still

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.420 
the right of the device and it's still
going<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.620> protect<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.519> phone<00:04:01.230> directly

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
going to protect the phone directly

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.830 
going to protect the phone directly

when you put the phone in put it in what
we<00:06:27.860> would<00:06:28.010> consider<00:06:28.100> upside<00:06:28.790> down<00:06:29.090> if<00:06:29.990> you

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
we would consider upside down if you

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.250 
we would consider upside down if you
have<00:06:30.650> this<00:06:30.830> clip<00:06:31.220> to<00:06:31.520> your<00:06:31.669> belt<00:06:31.940> or<00:06:32.720> pocket

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.390 
and so forth reason why i say

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.720 
and so forth reason why i say

it is because when you pull the phone
out<00:06:37.790> it's<00:06:38.330> going<00:06:38.420> to<00:06:38.540> be<00:06:38.600> a<00:06:38.630> natural<00:06:39.380> pull<00:06:39.890> out

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
over it just tends to be a little more

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.110 
over it just tends to be a little more
of<00:06:49.910> a<00:06:50.000> natural<00:06:50.180> pool<00:06:50.630> from<00:06:50.930> the<00:06:51.140> holster<00:06:52.120> again
