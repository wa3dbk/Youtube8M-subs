00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and it just seems like a very peculiar

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.549

you thought that putting the SD card

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.149 
you thought that putting the SD card
slot<00:05:32.880> behind<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:33.990> backplate<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:34.740> has<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.039> be

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
slot behind a backplate that has to be

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.279 
slot behind a backplate that has to be
unscrewed<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:35.880> get<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.270> I<00:05:36.479> don't<00:05:36.780> know<00:05:37.110> who

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
unscrewed to get you I don't know who

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.080 
unscrewed to get you I don't know who
thought<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:37.800> was<00:05:37.949> a<00:05:37.979> good<00:05:38.190> idea<00:05:38.490> but<00:05:38.729> it<00:05:38.969> was

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
thought that was a good idea but it was

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.909 
thought that was a good idea but it was
the<00:05:39.270> exact<00:05:39.599> opposite<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.169> a<00:05:40.229> good<00:05:40.259> idea<00:05:40.650> was<00:05:40.889> a

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
the exact opposite of a good idea was a

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:41.990 
the exact opposite of a good idea was a
terrible<00:05:41.460> idea

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
terrible idea

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.730 
terrible idea
I<00:05:42.030> don't<00:05:42.300> know<00:05:42.419> like<00:05:42.659> I<00:05:42.870> said<00:05:43.110> I'm<00:05:43.229> not<00:05:43.380> telling

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
I don't know like I said I'm not telling

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.249 
I don't know like I said I'm not telling
anyone<00:05:43.949> to<00:05:44.250> avoid<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.849> new<00:05:45.030> 3ds<00:05:45.479> because<00:05:46.080> of

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
anyone to avoid the new 3ds because of

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.439 
anyone to avoid the new 3ds because of
this<00:05:46.409> but<00:05:46.710> it's<00:05:47.580> just<00:05:47.880> such<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.120> typical

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
this but it's just such a typical

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.920 
this but it's just such a typical
Nintendo<00:05:49.380> thing<00:05:49.949> to<00:05:50.099> do<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.969> SD<00:05:51.300> card<00:05:51.599> slot

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
Nintendo thing to do the SD card slot

Nintendo thing to do the SD card slot
yeah<00:05:52.620> I<00:05:52.650> guess<00:05:53.250> people<00:05:53.460> are<00:05:53.699> gonna<00:05:53.880> argue<00:05:54.090> that

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
yeah I guess people are gonna argue that

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.270 
yeah I guess people are gonna argue that
you<00:05:54.630> don't<00:05:54.780> need<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:55.110> access<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:55.680> SD<00:05:56.009> card

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
you don't need to access the SD card

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.540 
you don't need to access the SD card
slot<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.789> much<00:05:57.060> on<00:05:57.389> the<00:05:57.870> 3ds<00:05:58.229> but<00:05:58.770> there's

slot that much on the 3ds but there's

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.339 
slot that much on the 3ds but there's

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
in her other 3ds and now it's gonna be a

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.589 
in her other 3ds and now it's gonna be a
pain<00:06:07.949> in<00:06:08.099> the<00:06:08.130> ass<00:06:08.340> to<00:06:08.490> access<00:06:08.909> it<00:06:09.090> so<00:06:09.210> I'm<00:06:09.360> sure
