got an MP nine secondary that he uses

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.549 
got an MP nine secondary that he uses
occasionally<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:36.750> he's<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.050> close-range

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.530 
occasionally when he's in a close-range
gunfight<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.460> I'd<00:00:38.579> say<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> majority<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
gunfight but I'd say for the majority of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.750 
gunfight but I'd say for the majority of
his<00:00:39.690> kills<00:00:39.899> he<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.200> using<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.770> bear<00:00:41.250> 50<00:00:41.550> Cal<00:00:41.730> so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
his kills he is using the bear 50 Cal so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
his kills he is using the bear 50 Cal so

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
in my mind this is an incredible

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.380

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
stories that I've been talking about

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.530 
stories that I've been talking about
during<00:02:49.710> my<00:02:49.800> doom<00:02:50.010> clan<00:02:50.340> channel<00:02:50.730> uploads<00:02:51.360> I

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
during my doom clan channel uploads I

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.730 
during my doom clan channel uploads I
figured<00:02:51.959> I'd<00:02:52.050> tell<00:02:52.230> another<00:02:52.380> one<00:02:52.590> today

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
figured I'd tell another one today

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.440 
figured I'd tell another one today
because<00:02:52.980> my<00:02:53.160> story<00:02:53.580> today<00:02:53.760> actually<00:02:54.030> has<00:02:54.330> to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
because my story today actually has to

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.240 
because my story today actually has to
do<00:02:54.570> with<00:02:54.690> Halloween<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.260> since<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:56.040> that

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
do with Halloween and since that is that

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.610 
do with Halloween and since that is that
time<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.640> year<00:02:56.670> again<00:02:56.850> around<00:02:57.660> now<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.230> figure

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
time of year again around now I figure

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.290 
time of year again around now I figure
I'd<00:02:58.740> tell<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.130> story<00:02:59.250> because<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.060> it's

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
I'd tell this story because I think it's

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.760 
I'd tell this story because I think it's
pretty<00:03:00.450> neat<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.959> don't<00:03:01.320> really<00:03:01.440> know<00:03:01.620> whether

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
pretty neat I don't really know whether

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.830 
pretty neat I don't really know whether
to<00:03:01.950> classify<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.490> as<00:03:02.550> funny<00:03:03.030> or<00:03:03.120> scary<00:03:03.450> or<00:03:03.660> what

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
to classify it as funny or scary or what

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.820
