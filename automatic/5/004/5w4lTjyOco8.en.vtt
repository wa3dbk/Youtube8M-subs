00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.510
 Y 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:20.619
 ok let's start by riding the cream 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:24.610
 the milk cream here is very hot and 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.690
 I have a very cold one from the fridge 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.690
 so that the other blows 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:40.940
 and as you can see I put under a bowl with ice 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.690
 and water to keep it cool by 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.690
 prevent it from being cut 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.469
 i 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.020
 let's beat until we have a 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.020
 little thick 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.880
 more 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.979
 Y 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.700
 once it has already been a little 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.970
 thick and creamy let's add the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.970
 sugar 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.510
 ah 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.479
 we add the condensed milk 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.320
 and we keep beating 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.310
 ah 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.289
 let's add a little trickle of essence 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.289
 vanilla 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.010
 like a teaspoon more or less 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.079
 well now what we are going to do is cover 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.069
 take them to the freezer during a 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.069
 hour and a half 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.160
 do not 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.450
 ok while it's freezing the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.240
 frozen 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.590
 I have on one side oreo cookies 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.140
 that are everywhere 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:55.080
 on the other hand the house or manel and 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.110
 another side removes the one that is a one wafer 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.460
 stuffed with cocoa butter and chocolate 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.460
 and we are going to make them 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.710
 place in a bag 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.710
 a clean criteria bag 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.530
 like when we passed the cookies for the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.530
 Cheesecake let's do the same 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.430
 we are going to crush the 4 to the newspaper 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.610
 ah 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.880
 ah 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.780
 I already have it crushed I prefer 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.580
 leave a little bit the cookie 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.060
 I like it very crushed but you do it 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.790
 how do you like it 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.819
 on the other hand we do the same with 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.910
 the red ones only lacasitos with 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.800
 the pinches and I also have syrup 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.410
 Chocolate chocolate cream is that 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.830
 We are also going to decorate with cream 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.830
 chocolate 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.950
 well we already have everything we need 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.130
 we have a consistency of ice cream that 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.310
 It's not hard at all if you see that you 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.380
 harden too much you take half an hour or 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.799
 40 minutes before the freezer for 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.480
 can serve not because it hardens a lot 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.710
 then what we are going to do is 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.710
 place it in a small cup 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.870
 we put ourselves 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.910
 excel always a little more or 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.570
 least to make the invitation to 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.570
 mcdonald's 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.290
 and we are going to put 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.290
 for example the various cookies 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.090
 A) Yes 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.090
 on the sides well 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.370
 I'm not going to move it but if you 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.980
 like that everything is well united in the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.410
 side you can move it to me I like 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.410
 put it as a top and if to the sides 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.650
 A) Yes 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.050
 we are going to put the syrup 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.190
 of chocolate that everything falls well for the 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.190
 lateral well fine well 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.830
 some cookies 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.200
 whole to decorate it and put it on 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.390
 above without this suitcase 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.760
 we have one of the most logical and 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.650
 With everyone 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.840
 or we can not put these wines on 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.750
 our first 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.720
 It is a very simple recipe as you see it 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.660
 the best recipe I found 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.340
 I have done and I liked how it has been 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.360
 so nothing to enjoy to taste and 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.979
 I hope it is 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.979
