good for a beginner to do this because

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.010 
good for a beginner to do this because
it<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:27.149> you<00:01:28.149> know<00:01:28.240> it's<00:01:28.360> one<00:01:28.509> thing<00:01:28.539> to<00:01:28.750> be<00:01:28.930> able

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
it it you know it's one thing to be able

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.779 
it it you know it's one thing to be able
to<00:01:29.110> play<00:01:29.289> a<00:01:29.320> drum<00:01:29.590> beat<00:01:29.800> just<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.369> measure<00:01:30.580> at<00:01:30.729> a

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
to play a drum beat just a measure at a

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.460 
to play a drum beat just a measure at a
time<00:01:30.970> all<00:01:31.119> by<00:01:31.270> itself<00:01:31.600> but<00:01:31.899> when<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.170> put<00:01:32.380> it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
time all by itself but when you put it

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.130 
time all by itself but when you put it
in<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.619> context<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.399> whole<00:01:33.550> song<00:01:33.819> it<00:01:34.209> really

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
in the context of a whole song it really

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.620 
in the context of a whole song it really
requires<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.709> lot<00:01:35.950> more<00:01:36.130> thinking<00:01:36.970> so<00:01:37.450> let's

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
requires a lot more thinking so let's

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.630 
requires a lot more thinking so let's
start<00:01:37.810> with<00:01:37.869> measure<00:01:38.110> 1<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.890> beat<00:01:39.160> sounds

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
start with measure 1 the beat sounds

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.670 
start with measure 1 the beat sounds
like<00:01:39.789> this

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.750 

in<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.960> counted<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.770> crash<00:01:48.010> on<00:01:48.220> one<00:01:48.400> one

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
in that counted is the crash on one one

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.390 
in that counted is the crash on one one
and<00:01:49.000> two<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.570> three<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.050> four<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:50.830> one<00:01:50.890> and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
and two and three and four and one and

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.230 
and two and three and four and one and
two<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:53.260> basic<00:01:53.650> beat<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.850> makes<00:01:55.060> it

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
two the basic beat what makes it

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.690 
two the basic beat what makes it
difficult<00:01:55.870> is<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.440> it's<00:01:57.010> at<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.190> fast<00:01:57.490> tempo

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
difficult is that it's at a fast tempo

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.790 
difficult is that it's at a fast tempo
also<00:01:58.510> make<00:01:58.690> sure<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.080> hi-hat<00:01:59.440> is<00:01:59.560> played

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
also make sure that the hi-hat is played

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.570 
also make sure that the hi-hat is played
too<00:01:59.979> loose<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:00.490> don't<00:02:00.610> want<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.910> real<00:02:01.060> tight

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
too loose you don't want it real tight

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.370 
too loose you don't want it real tight
