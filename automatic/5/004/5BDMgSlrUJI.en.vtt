00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.700

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.480
 For those who do not know the game I will 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 explain here to kill mind how it works 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.030
 The first villain story of the game is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.829
 android 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.009
 I want to fucking destroy the whole thing 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.350
 every electronic fox team has to 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.389
 help god avoid fucking and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.659
 team it is composed so opted 

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:17.670
 tip is the mechanical sap that is 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.289
 the times I had to play I had 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.359
 that saving him is because he's daughter 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.100
 bitch did not have to save herself on 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.529
 lombardi stage is the main character 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.569
 the series that I like the most 

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:29.729
 c this series is very crazy and even more 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.399
 took place in super smash bros on and by 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.499
 last is the creator of internet cancer 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.609
 is Pepe and the king with his famous phrase 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.609
 of the uol 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:50.990
 it's a great 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 hello 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.820
 the game was in the arcade style so much that in 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.920
 his campaign was no more than an hour 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.930
 most of the time but without 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.810
 game you control a ship that you 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.970
 You can take rays and bombs and also have 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 save your friends with a 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.920
 artificial intelligence of you there 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.050
 follows several faces that are not 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.760
 she does have a different way gives a 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.440
 another alternative route that is releasing 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.040
 other phases to reach the goal 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.739
 Last 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.320
 that is, if the leaf tries for the three 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.480
 paths gives a total there about three hours 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.519
 Is it something you 're training from? 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.010
 thing to carry in a game in which the hour 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.500
 in which is bad this is because game time 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.630
 It's a lot of fun to have icera several times 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.459
 does not count with a ranking that is 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.080
 shown your score so you 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.720
 you can find your video friends that you 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.269
 was more than 8,000 points in that bagasse 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.209
 The graphic of that game was beautiful. 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.920
 time full of glitters selected 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.060
 very crazy so that the music 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.280
 aperture closely resembles the 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.019
 opening of Jurassic Park film and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.180
 playing and having fun on more because he 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.310
 had a multiplayer had their fight 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.860
 at the time I played like I've never had 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.180
 I understand city was sad because I 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.340
 I always played when I was going on vacation. 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.530
 in the house of my cousins ​​who are several 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.049
 then the games multiplayer is divided into 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.850
 four screens and were formaldehyde each with 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.920
 fucking a square of earth the size 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.930
 of a family is you try to kill the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.790
 his friends would not pick up a ship but 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.070
 made a point of taking the control that 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.200
 I was with falco because at the time in the 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.000
 schiphol who are better than the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.170
 Game players and my opinion 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.030
 milk with that hug 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.650
 but just one thing that got me pissed off more 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.810
 one with the game at that time in 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.310
 even today because who has 13 already 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.940
 it is known that there is a limit to the 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.000
 same kind play nice is a limit 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.480
 keep the pattern is more up to standard 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.370
 huh 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.010
 why not put online multiplayer 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.960
 the game is short and made a 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.570
 email as illegal since they charge a 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.690
 new game pole price launch 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.480
 I understand the apodi frog online on this shit. 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.820
 to play five hours of the campaign and 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.170
 then play there once a year 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.540
 israel does not play the epic game 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.700
 borrowed and sometimes my friend 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.410
 but it was not 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.970
 they put themselves online was the excuse 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.840
 that they used to not have placed 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.430
 online 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.700
 they said it was going to take a while 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.680
 to launch and back sales do not know the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.580
 that everyone does a right thing right 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.110
 dude face 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.820
 I would sell a lot more if I had one there 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.799
 I'm sure of it or at least 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.500
 low price this piece does not put a 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.420
 tower launch price is fuck 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.990
 it's a joke right? 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.880
 This is fox if it is a very crazy game. 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.800
 crazy gameplay and graphics and tracks 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.420
 sound that gives charm to the game 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.640
 the last one is that it's really fun to fuck 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.190
 When you play with your friends, you only have one 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.130
 but it is not by the game itself it is not anymore 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.110
 by the franchise she walks a thousand right 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.480
 taking that medium and finally playing it 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.090
 saw was was on gamecube 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.610
 a video of a game for the wii I hope 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.260
 that they do not retire the franchise 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.510
 I really want them to make star fox 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.030
 however the guy or to be pretty crazy good 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.780
 see that big n is saving us 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.780
 it does not cost to wait 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.960
 so this is personal and your video is easy 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.789
 I do not know if it was the short I do not know why 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.580
 the test time is the other week 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.940

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.810
 of time do not know taétz liked it 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.629

 If you want to see more content comes from 20 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.659

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.659
 next spoke 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.860
