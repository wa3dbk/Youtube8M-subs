 Hi, I'm wake waiting for the sea on the banks of 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.900
 I'm going to give you some advice about 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.670
 the preservation of bread what makes 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.980
 a bread will retain more its own time 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.810
 humidity and this one concentrates almost on its 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.970
 whole in the crumb 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.679
 that's why a bread that has more crumbs goes 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.570
 to last longer than one that has 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.699
 less crumb the crust always dries 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.240
 before where we have to keep a bread 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.130
 it is best to keep it in a bag 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.010
 of cotton from the whole cloth 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.390
 life because the bread needs to breathe what 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.340
 we keep in the bag it will last us 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.130
 much more time if we keep it in a 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.380
 plastic bag the bread we are not going to 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.240
 let breathe and what is going to happen is 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.860
 that is going to soften us we're going 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.660
 to find the next day as a 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.090
 rubber like when we say that we have been 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.760
 it was like a chewing gum the best way to 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 preservation of a bread is freezing 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.940
 I always advise you freeze it 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.230
 why 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.929
 we freeze recent we will recover 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.450
 recent I recommend doing rations 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.030
 chop it up and wrap it in paper 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.640
 aluminum we freeze it and to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.040
 get it back just take it out 20-30 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 minutes at room temperature and what 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.690
 we have perfect to consume what happens 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.259
 if a bread is hard for 23 days 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.600
 what can we do to get it back 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.840
 Preheat oven to 180 degrees as 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.340
 we bake 57 minutes at that temperature and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.530
 we have it perfect to consume it in 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.280
 the moment we can do with the bread 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.290
 that is hard for us 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.049
 we can make breadcrumbs with a 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.549
 grater this bread we will be a 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.830
 little bit thicker than the one we usually 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.259
 have in store but also the breaded 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.600
 it will be more crispy too 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.790
 we can make desserts torrijas the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.530
 party has many uses for 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.790
 Any questions that you have, you know 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.920

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.729
