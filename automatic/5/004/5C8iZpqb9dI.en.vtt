00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
printed it so so after printing it out I
just<00:01:59.340> bring<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.999> PowerPoint<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.659> class<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
just bring the PowerPoint to class and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.260 
just bring the PowerPoint to class and
then<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.799> highlight<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.670> stuff<00:02:02.939> that's

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
then I just highlight this stuff that's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.510 
then I just highlight this stuff that's
important<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.929> she<00:02:04.229> or<00:02:04.439> he<00:02:04.740> mentions<00:02:05.249> in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
important that is she or he mentions in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.910 
important that is she or he mentions in
the<00:02:05.670> class<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.179> then<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.689> use<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> pencil

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the class and then I just use a pencil

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.370 
the class and then I just use a pencil
to<00:02:08.130> write<00:02:08.369> notes<00:02:08.850> around<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.200> says

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
to write notes around it so if it says

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.240 
to write notes around it so if it says
more<00:02:10.679> stuff<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.130> just<00:02:11.340> read<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.640> down

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.320 

the<00:02:15.250> second<00:02:15.580> method<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.880> pretty

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
the second method is pretty

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.320 
the second method is pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:17.130> basically<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:19.030> use

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
self-explanatory basically I just use

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.350 
self-explanatory basically I just use
outline<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.530> did<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.250> book<00:02:21.360> which

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
outline that I did for the book which

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.860 
outline that I did for the book which
can<00:02:22.540> be<00:02:22.690> handwritten<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:24.600> printed<00:02:25.600> and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
can be handwritten or printed and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.080 
can be handwritten or printed and
basically<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.770> write<00:02:27.100> stuff<00:02:27.490> around<00:02:27.880> it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
basically I just write stuff around it

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.910 
basically I just write stuff around it
if<00:02:28.270> there's<00:02:28.480> extra<00:02:28.930> stuff<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.200> need<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.470> add<00:02:29.620> to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
if there's extra stuff I need to add to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.450 
if there's extra stuff I need to add to
it<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.720> finally<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.590> last<00:02:32.800> method<00:02:33.070> I'm<00:02:33.310> going

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
it and finally the last method I'm going

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.980 
it and finally the last method I'm going
to<00:02:33.520> talk<00:02:33.640> about<00:02:33.760> today<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.270> with<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.810> notebook

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
to talk about today is with a notebook

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.870 
to talk about today is with a notebook
as<00:02:35.350> well<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.770> basically<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.850> your

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
as well and basically you just have your

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.060 
as well and basically you just have your
book<00:02:37.240> outline<00:02:37.660> close<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:39.040> just

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
book outline close to you and you just

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.430 
book outline close to you and you just
write<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.970> extra<00:02:40.300> step<00:02:40.540> down<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.140> notebook

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
write the extra step down on a notebook

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.880 
write the extra step down on a notebook
in<00:02:42.280> point<00:02:42.760> form<00:02:43.060> instead<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.560> outline

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
in point form instead of on the outline

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.180 
in point form instead of on the outline
itself<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:46.930> know<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.440> was<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.950> quick

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
itself so I know this was really quick

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.180 
itself so I know this was really quick
but<00:02:48.490> like<00:02:49.210> there's<00:02:49.570> not<00:02:49.720> many<00:02:50.050> like<00:02:50.650> things<00:02:50.980> to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
but like there's not many like things to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.800 
but like there's not many like things to
say<00:02:51.340> about<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.580> basically<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:52.660> do

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
say about that basically you just do

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.780 
say about that basically you just do
what's<00:02:53.110> best<00:02:53.200> for<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.550> think

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.330 
what's best for you and what you think
is<00:02:54.940> easier<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:55.690> yeah<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.440> finally<00:02:56.950> before<00:02:57.130> I

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
is easier but yeah and finally before I
