00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.490
 respite 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.780
 how about friends here rooms and welcome 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.460
 to a new video of 4000 gta 5 what 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.189
 happens is that I find myself playing in the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.660
 remake of the map of mind before 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.220
 I do not want to thank all those who 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.779
 they could go play with me in this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.910
 I did not have time to make an opel 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.860
 I saw him nothing else was that he invited 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.900
 some people who send them or me 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.970
 they sent messages to me on facebook because the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.250
 notification friends I'll be playing 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.079
 wrong in a message that inquiera come me 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.430
 it came very good answer I thank you 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.980
 enormously to all those who could 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.480
 come as I say they did not know it 1p 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 I saw it because I think that for it to be 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.489
 it would have been an opel I saw it was to live 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.320
 with you to talk to you but as 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.510
 I wanted to quickly have this video 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.399
 as soon as possible because I did not have the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.589
 opportunity to live with you and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.390
 that a great excuse for that and already 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.670
 happening now the subject of this video 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.040
 I want to quickly tell those who 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.660
 they do not know driver and four that are a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.760
 little newer in video games or that 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.409
 they are still or they are smaller because 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.690
 maybe a new generation that did not have 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.180
 the opportunity that unfortunately does not 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.070
 had the opportunity to play 44 for me 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.780
 it's this game I've done it in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.490
 different times it was 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.890
 and if it will be the best coverage of all the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.690
 history also in diverse in various 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.710
 videos I've commented on why and everything 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.960
 I'm not going to get into those details 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.380
 he simply told them there was a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.290
 map that is called shipment and is more or 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 less like new town how they work and 8a 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.090
 I do not know if it happened to them that some 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.880
 Friends tell them if you do not kill 60 or more 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.549
 of 50 is more the map of newtown you're a 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.290
 novice and you do not know how to play sometimes that happens 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.659
 that your friends challenge you especially in 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.880
 that map and it was good too 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.369
 become the one big one ones 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.470
 against ones with snipers then the map 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.530
 of hitman was to pretend that it is the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.659
 new town today so in that in 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.250
 that map as it was even smaller 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.450
 that new town was a smaller than 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.720
 which is in 2009 right now in its 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.160
 screens as people killed even to 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.509
 more than 100 people who were very 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 good in that game I remembered that 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.769
 they killed more than 100 and apart from that it was 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.709
 as the place of the one big one of the 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.720
 sneakers so they already have an idea 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.010
 still I'll leave some photos here 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.170
 on screen to access a better 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.030
 idea of ​​how the map as they can 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.830
 see is almost identical I tell you it's not 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.750
 just like and back that you 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.600
 I'm looking at the hitman map of 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.450
 capture and 4 but it's still very similar 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.220
 On the other hand I also tell you that 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.870
 you have left me messages that I 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.090
 they ask how you do it to climb 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.490
 level as fast as it does is for 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.720
 have so much money and obviously not what 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.430
 I did on this map but I want 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.870
 to recommend them widely that they lower it 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.090
 I'm going to explain how you can 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.070
 have but play it without any doubt 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.020
 friends because for some strange reason 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.970
 the plus so be the person who did it 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.460
 who put those modalities or do not know what 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.760
 wave but they earn a lot of money 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.680
 they earn a lot of rp me in the I think they were 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.950
 two hours a little less than two hours that 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.650
 I was playing was 78 level 78 I went up to 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.270
 final is at level 80 I said it was not so much 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.840
 but what I 'm going here is that if 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.120
 you are levels I do not know 10 15 20 25 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.470
 more or less in those levels are going to have 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.690
 the possibility of climbing very, very 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.280
 fast level and also to win 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.010
 money per game I think it's the 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.560
 winner takes almost 10 thousand 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.000
 dollars more or less then how do you 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.100
 I say it 's a very good opportunity to 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.480
 to download it and now I am telling you that 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.970
 to have it 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.130
 these are creators 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.960
 what does the maps do to your calculation? 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.750
 which it is the start page brock 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.030
 officer of gta 5 then people are going to 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.460
 the low and ready can play in them 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.140
 so for him to play they have to 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.540
 necessarily make your account rockstar 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.210
 and make a link or link it to your game 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.110
 It's very easy to get sick simply go 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.120
 someone who will leave them in the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.460
 description of the rockstar page 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.200
 make your account is very fast it is as if 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.750
 did some hotmail account or what 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.280
 that is and since they make it lower than 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.010
 I will leave this same description 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.690
 the link for you to download this map 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.000
 as the I did not do it I did it a 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.490
 chavo shared it uploaded it to rockstar 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.870
 so also since you make your account 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.240
 I leave the link for them to go and what 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.160
 go down and with your friends that more than more 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.220
 I was going to tell you friends I think that was 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.650
 everything really was nothing more than sharing 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.180
 with you this game thank you 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.030
 tell them how they can climb faster than 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.120
 level what the rp was also very 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.160
 important and well basically that's 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.710
 all friends for all those who are 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.770
 a little more veterans here in in in xbox 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.450
 and playstation 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.400
 surely the nostalgia comes to you 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.620
 this is how they were very 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.470
 good so revive the now in this 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.060
 game of gta 5 if you did not have the 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.590
 opportunity to play the cot 4 no 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.110
 they had the opportunity to play in hit 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.910
 meant come and do it now here in gta 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.310
 Believe me you are going to have a very good time 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.490
 and now yes to finish, I'll tell you 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.290
 that this map is only available 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.350
 for xbox because the person who did it 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.210
 only have xbox then if someone 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.130
 more in a future does some map 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.380
 similar for playstation will also be 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.510
 available but therefore only 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.040
 it's for xbox 360 so I'm really sorry 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.530
 also this aspect for those of 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.970
 playstation and now if I say goodbye 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.800

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.670
 forget to support me with a like and even 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.790

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.790
 bye
