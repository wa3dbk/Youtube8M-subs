00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.600 

okay<00:00:01.319> so

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay so

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.370 
okay so
a lot<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.850> questions<00:00:03.330> about<00:00:03.480> my<00:00:03.779> natural<00:00:04.140> curl

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
a lot of questions about my natural curl

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.720 
a lot of questions about my natural curl
pattern

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
pattern

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.960 
pattern
looks<00:00:05.850> like<00:00:06.060> it<00:00:06.360> is<00:00:07.069> and<00:00:08.069> I'm<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.550> my<00:00:08.700> fourth

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
looks like it is and I'm in my fourth

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.209 
looks like it is and I'm in my fourth
month<00:00:09.180> of<00:00:09.330> transitioning<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.290> as<00:00:10.559> much<00:00:10.889> as

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
month of transitioning and as much as

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.150 
month of transitioning and as much as
you<00:00:11.520> think<00:00:11.850> that

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
you think that

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.050 
you think that
you'd<00:00:13.580> be<00:00:13.730> able<00:00:13.820> to<00:00:14.030> see<00:00:14.240> clearly<00:00:14.740> what<00:00:15.740> your

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.060 
you'd be able to see clearly what your

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.640 
you'd be able to see clearly what your
natural<00:00:17.060> curls<00:00:17.330> look<00:00:17.540> like<00:00:17.779> it's<00:00:18.020> very

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
natural curls look like it's very

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.010 
natural curls look like it's very
difficult<00:00:18.980> for<00:00:19.310> me<00:00:19.490> anyway<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:20.510> I<00:00:20.630> think<00:00:20.869> that

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
difficult for me anyway and I think that

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.929 
difficult for me anyway and I think that
has<00:00:21.050> to<00:00:21.140> do<00:00:21.410> with<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.250> curl<00:00:22.460> pattern<00:00:22.790> that's

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
has to do with the curl pattern that's

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.130 
has to do with the curl pattern that's
emerging<00:00:24.910> it's<00:00:25.910> hard<00:00:26.240> to<00:00:26.390> see<00:00:26.540> this<00:00:26.689> well<00:00:26.960> this

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
emerging it's hard to see this well this

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.900 
emerging it's hard to see this well this

pushed<00:00:31.760> on<00:00:31.910> top<00:00:32.059> of<00:00:32.150> my<00:00:32.239> head<00:00:32.360> but<00:00:32.419> I<00:00:32.540> took

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
pushed on top of my head but I took

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.280 
pushed on top of my head but I took
pictures<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:33.590> go<00:00:34.809> in<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.080> middle<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.790> my<00:00:37.790> head

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
pictures so go in the middle of my head

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.710 
pictures so go in the middle of my head
here<00:00:39.290> in<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.680> middle<00:00:39.830> and<00:00:39.980> in<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.190> back

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
here in the middle and in the back

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:53.110 
here in the middle and in the back
it<00:00:41.810> looks<00:00:42.260> like<00:00:44.050> defined<00:00:45.050> as

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.639 

when<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.260> get<00:00:54.500> closer<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.730> crown<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.649> all

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
when you get closer to the crown and all

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.010 
when you get closer to the crown and all
right

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
right

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.640

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.250 

look<00:01:03.920> more<00:01:04.190> like<00:01:04.430> what

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
look more like what

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.050 
look more like what
for<00:01:05.470> deep

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
for deep

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.260 
for deep
and<00:01:07.210> if<00:01:08.079> we<00:01:08.500> take<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.250> size<00:01:09.460> my<00:01:09.850> temple

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
and if we take it to the size my temple

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.539 
and if we take it to the size my temple
was<00:01:10.420> here<00:01:10.659> in<00:01:10.810> here<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.619> looks<00:01:12.220> more<00:01:12.729> like

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.330

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
enough there it's a look like anything

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.590 
enough there it's a look like anything
but<00:01:34.020> um<00:01:34.729> most<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> curls

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
but um most of that you know the curls

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.649 
but um most of that you know the curls
in<00:01:36.719> my<00:01:36.810> head<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.079> tight<00:01:37.289> and<00:01:38.149> that's<00:01:39.149> fine

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
in my head are tight and that's fine

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.649 
in my head are tight and that's fine
with<00:01:39.689> me<00:01:39.840> um<00:01:40.289> I've<00:01:40.740> been<00:01:41.250> hearing<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.700> title

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
with me um I've been hearing that title

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.010 
with me um I've been hearing that title
curls<00:01:42.899> hold

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
curls hold

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.139 
curls hold
hold<00:01:45.590> better<00:01:45.859> than<00:01:46.219> loose<00:01:46.430> gross<00:01:46.670> which<00:01:46.969> is

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
hold better than loose gross which is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.080 
hold better than loose gross which is
great<00:01:47.929> because<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:49.159> don't<00:01:49.340> want<00:01:49.429> to<00:01:49.700> have<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.939> be

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
great because I don't want to have to be

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.830 
great because I don't want to have to be
dealing<00:01:50.990> with<00:01:51.670> trying<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.820> maintain<00:01:53.060> my

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
dealing with trying to maintain my

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.190 
dealing with trying to maintain my
corals<00:01:54.229> every

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
corals every

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.350 
corals every
so<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.920> will<00:01:56.039> work<00:01:56.189> out

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
so this will work out

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.720 
so this will work out
but<00:01:58.900> again<00:01:59.500> like<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.010> said<00:02:00.040> I'm<00:02:00.310> only<00:02:00.460> in<00:02:00.700> my

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
but again like I said I'm only in my

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.840 
but again like I said I'm only in my
fourth<00:02:01.740> month<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.310> will<00:02:03.550> keep<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:03.790> updated

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
fourth month so I will keep you updated

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.350 
fourth month so I will keep you updated
as

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
as

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.020 
as
continues<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:05.960> grow<00:02:06.140> out<00:02:06.350> in

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
continues to grow out in

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.500 
continues to grow out in
Vincent<00:02:08.720> needs<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.959> be<00:02:09.050> more<00:02:09.200> than<00:02:09.350> fine
