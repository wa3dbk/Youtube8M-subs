damper<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.409> think<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.249> might<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.609> getting<00:01:14.789> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
damper I think I might be getting the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.200 
damper I think I might be getting the
hyper<00:01:17.369> pro<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:18.560> was<00:01:19.560> thinking<00:01:20.069> maybe<00:01:20.670> i<00:01:20.880> might

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
hyper pro i was thinking maybe i might

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.620 
hyper pro i was thinking maybe i might
get<00:01:21.590> ascots<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.039> i<00:01:23.310> don't<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.819> yet<00:01:24.119> i<00:01:24.299> had

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
get ascots but i don't know yet i had

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.209 
get ascots but i don't know yet i had
most<00:01:24.899> likely<00:01:25.289> I<00:01:25.319> might<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.619> getting<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.979> hyper

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
most likely I might be getting a hyper

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.109 
most likely I might be getting a hyper
pro

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.760 

there's<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.509> couple<00:01:29.689> more<00:01:29.929> things<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.439> was

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
there's a couple more things I was

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.069 
there's a couple more things I was
thinking<00:01:30.799> of<00:01:31.189> doing<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.789> HID<00:01:32.270> lights<00:01:32.630> cuz

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079

thinking of doing the HID lights cuz
these<00:01:33.289> ones<00:01:33.530> are<00:01:33.710> factory<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:34.429> bothered<00:01:35.420> at<00:01:35.539> the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
these ones are factory I bothered at the

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.880 
these ones are factory I bothered at the
bike<00:01:35.869> show<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:36.710> it's<00:01:37.509> relatively<00:01:38.509> stock<00:01:39.109> other

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
bike show so it's relatively stock other

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.190 
bike show so it's relatively stock other
than<00:01:40.189> what<00:01:40.429> I<00:01:40.460> see<00:01:40.819> is<00:01:41.000> less<00:01:41.359> the<00:01:41.659> bombings<00:01:42.020> are

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
than what I see is less the bombings are

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.609 
than what I see is less the bombings are
say<00:01:42.439> Yoshi<00:01:42.950> Mirai<00:01:43.569> exhaust<00:01:44.569> and

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.789

like<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.520> cause<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.209> corrode<00:03:07.990> and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
like that and cause it to corrode and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.199 
like that and cause it to corrode and
stuff<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:08.800> that<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.220> I'm<00:03:09.490> not<00:03:09.700> gonna<00:03:09.880> do<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
stuff like that so I'm not gonna do it

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.990 
stuff like that so I'm not gonna do it
that<00:03:10.240> way

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
that way

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.790 
that way
I'm<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.660> going<00:03:11.960> to

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
I'm just going to

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.040 
I'm just going to
two<00:03:14.370> head<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.730> wash<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.360> I'm<00:03:15.780> gonna<00:03:15.930> make

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
two head and wash it and I'm gonna make

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.050 
two head and wash it and I'm gonna make

I didn't get to do a whole lot of

I didn't get to do a whole lot of

researching
though<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:56.250> was<00:03:56.700> told<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.239> if<00:03:57.450> I'd<00:03:57.690> wait<00:03:58.680> wait

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
though I was told that if I'd wait wait

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.090 
though I was told that if I'd wait wait
too<00:03:59.190> too<00:03:59.430> long

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
too too long

too too long
I<00:04:00.190> may<00:04:00.700> not<00:04:00.880> find<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.330> exact<00:04:01.810> one<00:04:02.020> I<00:04:02.170> like<00:04:02.410> and

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
I may not find the exact one I like and

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.060 
I may not find the exact one I like and
this<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.370> one<00:04:03.580> I<00:04:03.610> really<00:04:03.760> like<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:05.410> it<00:04:05.740> was<00:04:05.800> for

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
this is one I really like and it was for

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:20.970 
this is one I really like and it was for
a<00:04:06.100> decent<00:04:06.340> deal

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.260 

despite<00:04:21.580> some<00:04:21.970> peace

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.180 

I'm<00:04:26.569> not<00:04:26.840> gonna<00:04:26.960> kill<00:04:27.229> myself<00:04:27.259> on<00:04:27.830> this<00:04:27.979> they

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
I'm not gonna kill myself on this they

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.110 
I'm not gonna kill myself on this they
go<00:04:28.400> because<00:04:28.610> I've<00:04:29.360> written<00:04:29.569> as<00:04:29.960> ethics<00:04:30.349> 9r<00:04:31.120> so

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
go because I've written as ethics 9r so

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.659 
go because I've written as ethics 9r so
I<00:04:32.509> kinda<00:04:33.380> know<00:04:33.560> what<00:04:33.770> roughly<00:04:34.250> this<00:04:34.430> power

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
I kinda know what roughly this power

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.870 
I kinda know what roughly this power
this<00:04:34.940> probably<00:04:35.539> a<00:04:35.740> bit<00:04:36.740> more<00:04:36.770> powerful<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.699> a

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
this probably a bit more powerful of a

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.260 
this probably a bit more powerful of a
bike<00:04:38.090> but

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
bike but

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.189 
bike but
hi<00:04:39.630> I've<00:04:40.020> ridden<00:04:40.319> does<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.710> x9r<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:42.020> once<00:04:43.020> I

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
hi I've ridden does that x9r and once I

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.350 
hi I've ridden does that x9r and once I
felt<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.650> power<00:04:43.949> I<00:04:44.310> have<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.729> have<00:04:44.910> something

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
felt that power I have to have something

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.339 
felt that power I have to have something
like<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:46.099> more<00:04:47.300> so<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.330> figured<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.110> a

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
like it more so I figured this is a

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:50.719 
like it more so I figured this is a
little<00:04:49.620> bit<00:04:49.740> more<00:04:49.949> just<00:04:50.220> should<00:04:50.430> be<00:04:50.520> good

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
little bit more just should be good

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.210 
little bit more just should be good
enough<00:04:50.759> I<00:04:51.389> mean<00:04:52.259> I<00:04:52.440> don't<00:04:52.590> plan<00:04:52.889> on<00:04:52.949> doing

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
enough I mean I don't plan on doing

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.500 
enough I mean I don't plan on doing
anything<00:04:53.580> crazy<00:04:54.650> maybe<00:04:55.650> in<00:04:56.069> a<00:04:56.310> few<00:04:56.639> years

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
anything crazy maybe in a few years

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.080 
anything crazy maybe in a few years
I'd<00:04:59.080> get<00:04:59.380> used<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.890> it

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
I'd get used to it

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.170 
I'd get used to it
but<00:05:01.450> then<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.660> might<00:05:02.020> step<00:05:02.380> up<00:05:02.700> after<00:05:03.700> this<00:05:03.850> I'm

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
but then I might step up after this I'm

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.760 
but then I might step up after this I'm
gonna<00:05:04.330> try<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.810> get<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.960> CBR<00:05:06.389> 1000<00:05:07.770> although

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
gonna try and get a CBR 1000 although

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.190 
gonna try and get a CBR 1000 although
people<00:05:09.040> tell<00:05:09.400> me<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:09.940> pretty<00:05:10.510> much<00:05:10.660> a

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
people tell me this is pretty much a

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
people tell me this is pretty much a
1000<00:05:12.040> but<00:05:12.280> I<00:05:12.520> don't<00:05:13.270> know<00:05:13.510> it<00:05:13.840> says<00:05:14.380> 99<00:05:15.040> it's

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
1000 but I don't know it says 99 it's

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.180 
1000 but I don't know it says 99 it's
not<00:05:15.430> exactly<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.150> 1000<00:05:16.900> but<00:05:17.110> it's<00:05:17.680> pretty<00:05:17.950> damn

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
not exactly a 1000 but it's pretty damn

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.550 
not exactly a 1000 but it's pretty damn
close

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
close

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.030 
close
not<00:05:19.889> ballparks<00:05:20.639> but<00:05:21.050> I'll<00:05:22.050> see<00:05:22.290> I'll<00:05:22.710> think

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
not ballparks but I'll see I'll think

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.610 
not ballparks but I'll see I'll think
about<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.669> really<00:05:24.419> like<00:05:24.900> this<00:05:25.050> bike<00:05:25.320> so<00:05:25.590> far

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
about it I really like this bike so far

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.459 
about it I really like this bike so far
go

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:56.770 

I'll<00:05:32.830> show<00:05:33.039> you<00:05:33.099> the<00:05:33.789> exhaust

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.350 

relatively<00:05:57.710> high<00:05:57.889> but<00:05:58.280> for<00:05:58.550> my<00:05:58.850> first<00:05:59.150> bite

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
relatively high but for my first bite

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.439 
relatively high but for my first bite
can't<00:05:59.660> quite<00:05:59.900> complain

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.510 

but<00:06:04.809> I<00:06:04.900> heared<00:06:05.169> that<00:06:05.259> these<00:06:05.559> things<00:06:05.860> people<00:06:06.159> to

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
but I heared that these things people to

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.149 
but I heared that these things people to
a<00:06:06.550> hundred<00:06:06.909> thousand<00:06:07.389> caged<00:06:07.740> stuff<00:06:08.740> like<00:06:08.949> that

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
a hundred thousand caged stuff like that

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:10.330 
a hundred thousand caged stuff like that
so

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
so

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.770
