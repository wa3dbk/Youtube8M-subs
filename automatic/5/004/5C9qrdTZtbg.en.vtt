and emerging talent here and I think the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.590 
and emerging talent here and I think the
interesting<00:00:41.370> thing<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.760> his<00:00:42.000> construction

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
interesting thing is his construction

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200 
interesting thing is his construction
and<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.500> sort<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.920> volume<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> he's<00:00:44.730> able<00:00:44.910> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and the sort of volume that he's able to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170 
and the sort of volume that he's able to
penetrate<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:46.020> guys<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.590> no<00:00:47.180> attention

to<00:00:48.210> detail<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> construction<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.739> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to detail and construction I think it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.130 
to detail and construction I think it's
very<00:00:49.920> interesting<00:00:50.059> he's<00:00:51.059> an<00:00:51.210> artist<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.899> well
