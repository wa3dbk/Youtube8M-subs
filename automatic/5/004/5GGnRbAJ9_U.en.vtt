the word servant as a collective well
what<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> say<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.100> those<00:00:35.850> whom<00:00:36.149> saying

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
what I say is that those whom saying

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.160 
what I say is that those whom saying
it's<00:00:37.380> collective<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.850> right<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.930> what

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it's collective they are right in what

it's collective they are right in what
they<00:00:40.379> affirm<00:00:40.770> they're<00:00:41.370> wrong<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.059> they

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
they affirm they're wrong and what they

they affirm they're wrong and what they
deny<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.230> vice<00:00:43.469> versa<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.460> that's

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
deny and vice versa I think that's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.619

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
make the case the the Jewish view that's
always<00:01:55.860> made<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> most<00:01:56.490> sense<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.969> me<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.390> this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
always made the most sense to me in this

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.480 
always made the most sense to me in this
it's<00:01:58.049> been<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.469> argue<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> righteous

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it's been to argue for the righteous

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
it's been to argue for the righteous
remnant<00:01:59.729> as<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.079> function<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> collective

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
remnant as a function of the collective

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.200 
remnant as a function of the collective
as<00:02:01.829> opposed<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> Israel<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.759> whole<00:02:02.939> because

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
as opposed to Israel as a whole because

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.510 
as opposed to Israel as a whole because
we<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.509> Israel's<00:02:03.930> history<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.799> whole<00:02:05.100> is

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
we know Israel's history as a whole is

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.940 
we know Israel's history as a whole is
not<00:02:05.820> particularly<00:02:06.149> righteous<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> nation

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
not particularly righteous so the nation

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.800 
not particularly righteous so the nation
as<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.129> whole<00:02:08.160> doesn't<00:02:08.700> qualify<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> idea

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
as a whole doesn't qualify but the idea

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.180 
as a whole doesn't qualify but the idea
that<00:02:09.869> within<00:02:10.259> Israel<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:10.890> certain

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
that within Israel there are certain

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.510 
that within Israel there are certain
righteous<00:02:11.670> ones

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
righteous ones

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.400 
righteous ones
who<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.880> faithfully<00:02:13.150> represented<00:02:13.960> God<00:02:14.140> who

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
who have faithfully represented God who

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.830 
who have faithfully represented God who
could<00:02:14.620> perhaps<00:02:14.860> fit<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.520> role<00:02:15.670> seems<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.720> me

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
could perhaps fit this role seems to me

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.630 
could perhaps fit this role seems to me
to<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> plausible<00:02:17.440> way<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.010> try<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.370> make

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
to be a plausible way to try and make

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.820 
to be a plausible way to try and make
the<00:02:18.820> corporate<00:02:19.540> argument<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.800> me

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
the corporate argument and so that to me

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.940 
the corporate argument and so that to me
is<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.070> more<00:02:21.310> powerful<00:02:22.380> variation<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.710> V

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
is a more powerful variation on this V

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.740 
is a more powerful variation on this V
on<00:02:24.160> this<00:02:24.310> collective<00:02:25.240> view<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.600> this

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
on this collective view on this

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.020 
on this collective view on this
corporate<00:02:26.170> view<00:02:26.410> much<00:02:27.100> like<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:27.970> a

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
corporate view much like it's not a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.880 
corporate view much like it's not a
great<00:02:28.300> analogy<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:28.870> much<00:02:29.020> like<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.350> say<00:02:29.530> Uncle

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
great analogy but much like we say Uncle

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.470 
great analogy but much like we say Uncle
Sam<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.430> don't<00:02:30.550> mean<00:02:30.760> every<00:02:31.060> single<00:02:31.210> solitary

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
Sam we don't mean every single solitary

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.300 
Sam we don't mean every single solitary
American<00:02:32.200> when<00:02:32.320> we<00:02:32.380> say<00:02:32.590> Uncle<00:02:32.890> Sam<00:02:33.070> but<00:02:33.250> we

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
American when we say Uncle Sam but we

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.100 
American when we say Uncle Sam but we
know<00:02:33.550> there's<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.790> certain<00:02:34.000> group<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.540> mean<00:02:34.990> the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
know there's a certain group I mean the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.510 
know there's a certain group I mean the
United<00:02:35.230> States<00:02:35.500> government<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.070> right

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
United States government is a right

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.460 
United States government is a right
that's<00:02:37.180> right<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.660> know<00:02:38.050> they're<00:02:38.200> not<00:02:38.350> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that's right we know they're not the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.970 
that's right we know they're not the
righteous<00:02:38.770> random<00:02:39.040> yes<00:02:39.220> no<00:02:39.840> but<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.380> my<00:02:41.680> point

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
righteous random yes no but but my point

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.590 
righteous random yes no but but my point
is<00:02:42.160> is<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.730> kind<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.210> corporate

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
is is that it's that kind of corporate

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.390 
is is that it's that kind of corporate
representation<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.650> actually<00:02:44.890> think<00:02:45.280> that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
representation and I actually think that

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.340 
representation and I actually think that
that<00:02:45.850> if<00:02:46.000> you're<00:02:46.150> going<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.360> ask<00:02:46.540> which<00:02:46.990> two

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
that if you're going to ask which two

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.950 
that if you're going to ask which two
views<00:02:47.770> have<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.310> best<00:02:48.580> case<00:02:49.420> going<00:02:49.780> forward

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
views have the best case going forward

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.140 
views have the best case going forward
as<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.590> who<00:02:50.710> the<00:02:50.830> servant<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.340> we've<00:02:51.940> either

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
as to who the servant is we've either

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.680 
as to who the servant is we've either
got<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.690> singular<00:02:53.520> righteous<00:02:54.520> remnant<00:02:54.790> figure

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
got a singular righteous remnant figure

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.930 
got a singular righteous remnant figure
Messiah<00:02:56.350> or<00:02:56.710> we've<00:02:57.100> got<00:02:57.280> some<00:02:57.520> type<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.730> a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
Messiah or we've got some type of a

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.300 
Messiah or we've got some type of a
corporate<00:02:58.510> righteous<00:02:59.050> remnant<00:02:59.290> who<00:02:59.860> can<00:03:00.040> step

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
corporate righteous remnant who can step

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.380 
corporate righteous remnant who can step
into<00:03:00.460> this<00:03:00.640> place<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.180> one<00:03:01.300> who

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
into this place is the one who

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.690 
into this place is the one who
represents<00:03:01.540> God<00:03:02.020> righteously<00:03:02.680> what<00:03:03.580> we're

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
represents God righteously what we're

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.520 
represents God righteously what we're
trying<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.000> do<00:03:04.090> is<00:03:04.210> identify<00:03:04.360> who<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:05.170> this

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
trying to do is identify who is this

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.910 
trying to do is identify who is this
servant<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:06.340> isaiah<00:03:07.210> 52:13<00:03:07.750> through<00:03:08.200> 53:12

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
servant in isaiah 52:13 through 53:12

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.740 
servant in isaiah 52:13 through 53:12
and<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.120> i<00:03:10.150> think<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.480> would<00:03:10.570> be<00:03:10.630> really

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
and so i think it would be really

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.720 
and so i think it would be really
important<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.260> help<00:03:11.500> us<00:03:11.620> understand<00:03:12.130> who<00:03:12.550> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
important to help us understand who the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.730 
important to help us understand who the
servant<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.480> passage

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
servant is in this passage

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.460 
servant is in this passage
who<00:03:15.520> is<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:15.880> what's<00:03:16.330> this<00:03:16.480> word<00:03:16.720> servant<00:03:17.320> as
