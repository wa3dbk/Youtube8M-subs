about 20 years ago and it's been a tool

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.080 
about 20 years ago and it's been a tool
for<00:01:33.820> me<00:01:34.270> kind<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.630> cathartic<00:01:35.170> tool<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:36.090> process

for me kind of cathartic tool to process

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.540 
for me kind of cathartic tool to process
through<00:01:37.530> ideas<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.860> were<00:01:38.950> spinning<00:01:39.220> in<00:01:39.400> my

head<00:01:39.580> and<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.090> don't<00:01:40.330> actually<00:01:40.630> record<00:01:41.170> there's

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
head and I don't actually record there's

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.990

no paper in the typewriter I just type
on<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.180> just<00:01:43.450> because<00:01:43.540> I<00:01:43.810> like<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.220> mechanical

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
on it just because I like the mechanical

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.969 
on it just because I like the mechanical
feel<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.240> typewriter<00:01:46.780> itself<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.350> so

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
feel of the typewriter itself and so

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.500

that<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.910> think<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.870> most<00:02:20.110> signature<00:02:20.650> element

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
that I think the most signature element

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.170 
that I think the most signature element
of<00:02:21.700> my<00:02:22.000> style<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.849> Art<00:02:25.030> Nouveau

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
of my style is the the Art Nouveau

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.930
