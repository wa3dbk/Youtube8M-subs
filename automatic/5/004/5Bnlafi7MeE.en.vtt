like<00:00:05.490> clouds<00:00:05.700> going<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.970> do<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> same<00:00:06.180> thing

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
like clouds going to do the same thing

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.909 
like clouds going to do the same thing
kind<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.839> round<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.140> corner<00:00:07.319> make<00:00:07.649> sure<00:00:07.770> that

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
kind of round that corner make sure that

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.890 
kind of round that corner make sure that
aren't<00:00:08.220> kind<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.790> probe<00:00:09.210> Scouts<00:00:09.480> moving<00:00:09.780> if

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
aren't kind of probe Scouts moving if

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.540 
aren't kind of probe Scouts moving if
otherwise<00:00:10.469> if<00:00:10.710> there<00:00:10.860> was<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.219> kind<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.429> move

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
otherwise if there was you kind of move

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.890 
otherwise if there was you kind of move
out<00:00:11.670> that's<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> thing<00:00:12.269> if<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.480> were<00:00:12.509> going

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
out that's the thing if you were going

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.480 
out that's the thing if you were going
to<00:00:12.960> establish<00:00:13.170> an<00:00:13.500> early<00:00:13.799> base<00:00:13.980> that's<00:00:14.219> where

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
to establish an early base that's where

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.000 
to establish an early base that's where
you<00:00:14.580> would<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.089> do<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.299> g5<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.949> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
you would have to do it g5 is going to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.230 
you would have to do it g5 is going to
be<00:00:17.100> able<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.279> get<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.460> observer<00:00:17.820> out<00:00:18.029> but

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
be able to get that observer out but

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.000 
be able to get that observer out but
looks<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.570> he<00:00:18.779> almost<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> position

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
looks like he almost was in a position

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.550 
looks like he almost was in a position
to<00:00:20.250> lose<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.550> once<00:00:20.670> again<00:00:21.230> let's<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.380> cloud

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
to lose it once again let's see if cloud

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.689 
to lose it once again let's see if cloud
can<00:00:22.740> make<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.920> up<00:00:23.010> he's<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> lot

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
can make it up he's going to have a lot

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.570 
can make it up he's going to have a lot
it<00:00:24.240> looks<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.900> gateway<00:00:25.320> pumping<00:00:26.250> g5

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it looks like one up gateway pumping g5

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.550 
it looks like one up gateway pumping g5
still<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:26.939> five<00:00:27.150> where<00:00:27.359> he<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.779> six<00:00:28.260> but

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
still at five where he is at six but

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.660 
still at five where he is at six but
still<00:00:29.099> I'm<00:00:29.189> wondering<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
still I'm wondering of the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
still I'm wondering of the
differentiation<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.960> earlier<00:00:31.260> count

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
differentiation in that earlier count

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.170 
differentiation in that earlier count
nevermind<00:00:32.009> g5<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:32.640> getting<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.000> six

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
nevermind g5 just now getting that six

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.569 
nevermind g5 just now getting that six
online<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.469> again<00:00:35.010> having<00:00:35.399> just

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
online and I think again having just

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.520 
online and I think again having just
that<00:00:35.700> earlier<00:00:36.030> gateway<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.780> more<00:00:37.050> time<00:00:37.290> it's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that earlier gateway with more time it's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.530 
that earlier gateway with more time it's
just<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.219> additional

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
just going to have the additional

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.340 
just going to have the additional
Dragoon<00:00:39.540> count<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> work<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.320> but

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
Dragoon count to work out but

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.830 
Dragoon count to work out but
interestingly<00:00:41.070> enough<00:00:41.489> cloud<00:00:41.760> has<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> looks

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
interestingly enough cloud has a looks

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.270 
interestingly enough cloud has a looks
like<00:00:42.960> he's<00:00:43.050> moving<00:00:43.320> out<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.620> establish<00:00:44.070> an

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
like he's moving out to go establish an

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680 
like he's moving out to go establish an
expansion<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> nine<00:00:45.570> o'clock

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
expansion here at the nine o'clock

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.180 
expansion here at the nine o'clock
position<00:00:46.200> rather<00:00:46.379> than<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.739> three<00:00:46.980> o'clock

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
position rather than the three o'clock

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
position rather than the three o'clock
position<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.579> sorry<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> three<00:00:48.030> clock

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
position I'm sorry the three clock

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.670 
position I'm sorry the three clock
rather<00:00:48.390> than<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> nine<00:00:48.809> o'clock<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
rather than the nine o'clock and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
rather than the nine o'clock and
interestingly<00:00:50.010> enough<00:00:50.460> looks<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.789> he<00:00:50.879> has<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
interestingly enough looks like he has a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
interestingly enough looks like he has a
higher<00:00:51.239> supply<00:00:51.629> count<00:00:52.039> which<00:00:53.039> actually

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
higher supply count which actually

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
higher supply count which actually
confused<00:00:53.550> me<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:53.910> bit<00:00:54.149> looks<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.449> gee

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
confused me a little bit looks like gee

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.420 
confused me a little bit looks like gee
I<00:00:54.719> would<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.379> assumed<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> g5<00:00:56.160> would<00:00:56.309> be

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
I would have assumed that g5 would be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.369 
I would have assumed that g5 would be
able<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> maintain<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.140> sure<00:00:58.289> if

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
able to maintain that I'm not sure if

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.959 
able to maintain that I'm not sure if
he's<00:00:58.440> cutting<00:00:58.890> probes<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> haven't

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
he's cutting probes or not I haven't

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.160 
he's cutting probes or not I haven't
been<00:01:00.059> able<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.329> kind<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> take<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> look<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.109> he

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
been able to kind of take a look that he

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.479 
been able to kind of take a look that he
does<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.469> an<00:01:01.590> idol<00:01:01.739> probe<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
does have an idol probe right here I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.340 
does have an idol probe right here I
don't<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:03.420> he's<00:01:03.510> missing<00:01:03.809> his<00:01:03.840> micro<00:01:04.199> here

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
don't think he's missing his micro here

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.630 
don't think he's missing his micro here
it<00:01:04.439> does<00:01:04.650> look<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:04.920> he's<00:01:05.100> starting<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> cut

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it does look like he's starting to cut

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.850 
it does look like he's starting to cut
probes<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.080> looks<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.470> he's<00:01:07.619> also

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
probes and it looks like he's also

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620 
probes and it looks like he's also
starting<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.549> yeah<00:01:08.760> he's<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.060> pumping

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
starting to just yeah he's just pumping

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.260 
starting to just yeah he's just pumping
out<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.560> six<00:01:10.920> gateways<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:12.030> he's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
out of all six gateways and now he's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.520 
out of all six gateways and now he's
starting<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.570> move<00:01:12.720> forward<00:01:12.960> he's<00:01:13.110> also<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
starting to move forward he's also got a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.920 
starting to move forward he's also got a
pylon<00:01:13.890> along<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> back<00:01:14.820> edge<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.360> starting

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
pylon along that back edge and starting

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
pylon along that back edge and starting
move<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.740> able<00:01:17.250> sniper<00:01:17.520> observer

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
move out just as able sniper observer

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
move out just as able sniper observer
right<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.210> starting<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> move<00:01:18.630> out

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
this even these 4G goons out of this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.999 
this even these 4G goons out of this
fight<00:01:21.360> could<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.750> bad<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.229> cloud<00:01:22.439> cloud<00:01:22.770> means

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
fight could be bad for cloud cloud means

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.710 
fight could be bad for cloud cloud means
to<00:01:23.280> hold<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.030> exactly<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.570> needs

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
to hold this this is exactly what needs

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.999 
to hold this this is exactly what needs
to<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> defense<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.259> gonna<00:01:25.350> end<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.590> losing

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to the defense it's gonna end up losing

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.770 
to the defense it's gonna end up losing
these<00:01:26.490> four<00:01:26.759> dragoons<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.270> she<00:01:27.360> needed<00:01:27.570> in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
these four dragoons what she needed in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
these four dragoons what she needed in
this<00:01:27.900> battle<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.189> all

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
this battle and it's going to be all

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.770 
this battle and it's going to be all
he's<00:01:29.610> running<00:01:29.880> headlong<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.360> segregated

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
he's running headlong into a segregated

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450 
he's running headlong into a segregated
file<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.320> g<00:01:31.500> g5<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.220> move<00:01:32.340> around

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
file to see if g g5 can move around

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
file to see if g g5 can move around
don't<00:01:32.759> think<00:01:32.909> these<00:01:32.970> high<00:01:33.119> templar<00:01:33.509> have

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
don't think these high templar have

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.359 
don't think these high templar have
sized<00:01:34.229> storm<00:01:34.470> upgraded<00:01:34.860> yet<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.159> they're<00:01:35.280> not

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
sized storm upgraded yet so they're not

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.560 
sized storm upgraded yet so they're not
really<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.850> useful<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.390> fight

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
really going to be useful in this fight

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.719 
really going to be useful in this fight
that's<00:01:36.750> another<00:01:37.049> bad<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.560> cloud<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.310> g5

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that's another bad thing for cloud so g5

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.460 
that's another bad thing for cloud so g5
looks<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.090> he's<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.450> easily<00:01:39.990> gonna

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
looks like he's going to be easily gonna

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
looks like he's going to be easily gonna
be<00:01:40.560> able<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> take<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.250> match<00:01:41.490> yeah<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> high

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
base clouds gonna have to cancel that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.600 
base clouds gonna have to cancel that
nexus<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> corner<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.310> needs<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
nexus in the corner just needs to

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
nexus in the corner just needs to
dedicate<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.180> some<00:01:57.780> zealots<00:01:58.020> over<00:01:58.320> there

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
storm though basically what cloud needs

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.940 
storm though basically what cloud needs
to<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.869> at<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.049> stage<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.439> load<00:02:04.680> up<00:02:04.799> some

I expected honestly expected a little
bit<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.159> a<00:02:35.220> longer<00:02:35.489> match<00:02:35.790> he<00:02:36.329> does<00:02:36.540> have<00:02:36.690> a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
bit of a longer match he does have a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.390 
bit of a longer match he does have a
dark<00:02:36.989> templar<00:02:37.319> but<00:02:37.470> there's<00:02:37.650> two<00:02:37.980> observers
