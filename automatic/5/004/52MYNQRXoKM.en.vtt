My name is Angela and this is my Organifi
story. I've worked in a health field for over

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.019
18 years, but when I started having my own
health issues I knew I didn't want to be on

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.839
medication for the rest of my life. I didn't
want to feel how I was feeling for the rest

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.560
of my life. And the changes that I made, they
were hard at first but relatively speaking

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.760
they were simple. It's something anybody can
do. I wanted to lose weight quickly, but in

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.539
a way to act that would also be healthy. And
what has happened was just that. I was able

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.980
to accomplish that goal, but I accomplished
it so quickly that I had to start thinking

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.980
about what else I wanted to do. I lost now
47 pounds, but in the first maybe 3 months

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.050
I lost about 40.
So that got a lot of people asking questions

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.500
and then they saw me coming to work or me
walking around everywhere with green juice

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.160
or some version of something healthy much
different from what I use to eat. So they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.670
asked a lot of questions, they saw me getting
up and actually taking walks during lunch

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.810
time and doing the stairs at work. People
were able to notice my habits. When I first

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.900
started, everybody saw me coming in with smoothies,
everybody bought a Vitamix. Now with the juicing

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.190
people that used to frown at me and just be
like how can you drink that grass? It must

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.920
taste like dandelions in the summer. They're
coming in with green juice, it's great realy.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.770
I mean I love it.
I sleep much better, I have a lot more energy,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.770
my mood is much better, I don't have cravings
anymore, I don't have these guilty feelings

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.050
about food, it's just changed everything.
I take a day out of the week and make my juices

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.780
for the week, make my salads and all my healthy
foods for the week so I won't get off track

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.310
and that way everything is kind of grab and
go during the week and that's where this Organifi Green Juice 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.310
powder has been a tremendous help. Even with
all this preparation I still am not always

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.560
completely prepared so those days when I just
have to get up and go and I haven't had time

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.000
to go shopping to buy juice and do all the
prep, I can just put some powder and water

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and go out the door. Organifi Green Juice has been a godsend.
Me personally, I travel a lot. I travel internationally

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.880
every month and then even when you travel
you can't always find the types of things

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.240
that you want to juice. Organifi has gotten
rid of the worry and the hassle from all of

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.120
that. I can just take the canister with me,
add water and go, no matter where I am. And

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.330
even here at home on the days when I haven't
had time to make juice, I just throw my Organifi

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.610
in some water or some almond milk, kombucha,
water keifer, I mix it everything and go out

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.819
the door and I'm still getting all that nutrition
that I would get if I had taken the time to

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.170
make the juice. To get out wheat grass and
get out chorella and get out turmeric and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.110
get out coconut water, all these things take
a lot of time and it's super expensive if

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.700
you're going to buy them all separately. So
I really appreciate having them all in the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.959
right amounts in one place where it's just
a scoop and I am done. It really makes life

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.959
so much easier and so much cheaper. I remember
the first time I tried it, I was sitting down

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.680
and I was texting and I was like you know
what, this stuff taste really good. And as

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.720
I'm reading everybody else's responses like
in about 15 minutes I started buzzing. Like

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.530
you literally get an instant boost of energy
from this stuff. It's great. I have never

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.530
been a caffeine person, but I imagine if you
are this is a good way to kind of cut back

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.540
on that and get some energy from some things
that are better for you.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.540
I can see Organifi Green Juice helping people who don't
have access to local fresh produce. It takes

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.840
care of a lot of the sourcing issues that
people would have. It's definitely offered

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.010
at a great price so that to me was so powerful
that's what I want other people to know. It's

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.599
an easy thing to do and your life will change
as a result of it, not just your physical

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.780
health but your outlook on everything. Once
you're not fighting your body just for energy

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.720
you can start to use that energy for something
else and it's like the possibilities are limitless.
