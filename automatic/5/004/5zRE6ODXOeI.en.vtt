them<00:03:20.579> from<00:03:21.269> slickness<00:03:21.629> in<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.049> water

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
them from slickness in the water

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.699 
them from slickness in the water
the<00:03:22.919> speckle<00:03:23.639> trout<00:03:23.790> are<00:03:23.970> generally<00:03:24.620> gonna<00:03:25.620> be

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
the speckle trout are generally gonna be

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.610 
the speckle trout are generally gonna be
well<00:03:26.159> off<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.549> shoreline

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
well off the shoreline

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.080 
well off the shoreline
don't<00:03:28.620> forget<00:03:28.919> your<00:03:29.129> popping<00:03:29.519> corks<00:03:29.849> if<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
don't forget your popping corks if the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.430 
don't forget your popping corks if the
water<00:03:30.299> stayed<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.959> makes<00:03:31.139> a<00:03:31.229> tremendous

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
water stayed it makes a tremendous

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.770 
water stayed it makes a tremendous
difference<00:03:31.919> what<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.909> does<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.269> against<00:03:33.569> the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
difference what it does is against the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.439 
difference what it does is against the
fish's<00:03:34.169> attention<00:03:35.000> attacking<00:03:36.000> all<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.329> their

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
fish's attention attacking all of their

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.839 
fish's attention attacking all of their
senses<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.590> when<00:03:37.799> they<00:03:37.919> can<00:03:38.129> hear<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.579> cork

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
senses and when they can hear that cork

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.210 
senses and when they can hear that cork
popping<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.629> lot<00:03:40.229> of<00:03:40.379> times<00:03:40.590> they<00:03:40.829> might<00:03:41.010> think

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
popping a lot of times they might think

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.860 
popping a lot of times they might think
it's<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.459> shrimp<00:03:41.760> jumping<00:03:42.150> out<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.329> water<00:03:42.690> or

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
it's a shrimp jumping out the water or

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.619
