00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 LOL 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.490
 what is that 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.080
 to me 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.470
 like this and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.800
 to make these Chinese curls as you 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.460
 they say they are not very marked but if 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 is as a wave but giving 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.210
 Chinese because they are not as small as 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
 a video that I already made them as pots 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
 these are a little more then there was more 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.219
 pretty but still if you can see 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.350
 Chinese the wave that I like very much 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.469
 You see natural is cute they are very easy to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 do and the only thing we're going to need 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.399
 are these sticks as in the form of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.730
 spiral I do not know what they are called I bought them 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.440
 in bangÃº they take if they go gogh I think it's a 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.710
 Chinese page where they sell so many 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.019
 things came to me like in a month it took 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.059
 quite but they work very well because 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.270
 they have this hook here to all of you 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.670
 hair and you just put this little thing 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.440
 blue that is like the insurance so that it 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.740
 Hold your hair they work very 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.930
 well the only thing is that you have to grab 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.710
 very little hair because that is what 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.500
 it has to fall 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 in this insurance because if not it does not remain very 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.810
 okay if you take a lot of hair so it's 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.460
 the only bad thing could be said because if 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.140
 you have a lot of hair as I go 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.320
 I took two hours to take hours 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.840
 putting all this on but I love the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.149
 result and as always they ask me in 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
 my video passed pots of how to make the 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.259
 curls asked me how long 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.250
 They last if your hair is very very straight 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.080
 to last maximum 1 or 2 days because it does not last 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.850
 very much it is falling apart much more 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.220
 fast if your hair is wavy like 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.229
 mine can last you 34 days depends that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.300
 Both the time your hair when you wash 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.679
 obviously they are going to undo, I hope 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.929
 that they like very much to be done 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.520
 easy and if we're going to start if they have 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.860
 doubt comments whatever it is that I 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.510
 want to put benito here and if we 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.850
 we see in a next video 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.979
 do not 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.289
 first of all I wash my hair and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.020
 I win it and a bit with the dryer 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.760
 so it did not look so healthy wavy 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.520
 I do not like it then I threw it a little 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.220
 and we're going to need water and a little brush 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.630
 to comb us and obviously the sticks 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.580
 in spiral form the first thing that 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.170
 we have to do before anything is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.150
 brush our hair to avoid 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.270
 any knot before we put on 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.069
 the sticks are going to wet our 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.590
 hair and we're going to take sessions of 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.660
 small hair not extremely 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.110
 small but they know exactly 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.269
 in the spiral so that we get very very 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.880
 well the Chinese the only thing that we have to 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.680
 to do is to adore the security of the party 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.959
 from above very well in the part of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.840
 our root and just turn around and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.250
 turn counts in the spirals 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.450
 it is very very simple and not 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.489
 you have to make a great effort 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.720
 only to turn in your hair is going 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.720
 to accommodate perfectly 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.209
 and we simply put in security for 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.890
 that holds very well and that 's all 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.840
 now a little closer to 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.540
 you can observe we just turn around 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.819
 to the hair and when you have finished very 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.099
 very simply put the insurance and it 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.099
 will perfectly hold the hair 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.450
 and now let's do exactly what 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.760
 same for all our hair and already this 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.740
 it is the final result we must do but 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.960
 yes but do not worry about the result 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.850
 it's worth it I went to sleep with this 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.980
 although it was quite complicated he gave me my 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.550
 little head but it does not matter I loved the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.320
 result of the whole night dry and it's 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.120
 just as they are left, simply remove the 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.330
 sure and very carefully for 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.530
 unwinding your little chinito and the beautiful 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.530
 I love the rest 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.450
 year 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.610
 we can not leave like that because being very 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.100
 flat and lifeless so I'm going to make them 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.900
 stop to give me a lot of volume and that 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.920
 make much more natural our are 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.920
 mixed or curls 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.600
 and that is practically all this is a 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.150
 different way to make your waves 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.220
 because they always ask me to wait 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.020
 that they liked that they have been made 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.320
 very easy and see you in a next 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.320
 video 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.680
 no no
