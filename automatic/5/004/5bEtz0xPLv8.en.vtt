00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello to all his dreams but today 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.610
 we meet for my very first 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.440
 video on call of duty black ops de 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.059
 zombie fashion so I received them 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 today the game and it's my all 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.650
 first part just about on this game 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.180
 and so on this night nocta map or 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.160
 zombies which is so the map 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.110
 nok town of black ops 1 but who was 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.910
 in multiplayer mode and so has been 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.200
 remastered in zombie mode but one 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.210
 could see that I started my part 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.790
 already a little while ago I'm at the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.340
 sleeve 10 may but how to say 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.090
 now we can move forward as 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.980
 measure of sleeves 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.239
 we can choose his starting round is 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.350
 so I started the race well 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.700
 you can see the number of victims 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.590
 that I did there I commented in voiceover 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.809
 it's something I recorded there 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.420
 not very long ago right now 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.760
 this is my first game on black 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.809
 ops of zombies and it turns out that's it 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.040
 before I make videos and where I 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.350
 wanted me wanted to warm me a little 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.149
 little tried to offer us a 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.309
 content not too bad but it turns out 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.570
 that I found how to say a little 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.200
 place to turn there I have you 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.969
 already shown where to place it and actually 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.880
 it's here behind one of the two houses 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.410
 well we can burn tour is so 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.670
 distorted to lomÃ© between zombies ago 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.619
 really way to hold on long enough 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 so I keep a submachine gun on me 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.060
 and as soon as I brought 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.789
 almost every zombie on the map and 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.710
 well then I start to fire into the crowd 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.300
 it is a technique to which is enough 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.810
 known but that it is on any 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.950
 what zombie mode of call of duty but I 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.159
 find that this place is rather not 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.420
 wrong to do it on on black ops of 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.590
 launch the very first part to the whole 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.290
 first part I do on black 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.700
 ops of once again but since I 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.010
 I did it in fact I just did this 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.210
 part tell you not how far am I 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.880
 gone and in fact I live game next 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.130
 talked I do this live web video 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.270
 after but since I have not played so I 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.650
 I can not really give you 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.049
 information about the game I can not 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.670
 give you my feeling of the little that 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.140
 I could see when I checked 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.229
 tears 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.090
 frankly it's identical limit to 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.530
 black ops jeans finally we will tell me 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.850
 yeah nan but the purists who are going 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.860
 to say no that's what's changing and what's 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.630
 change but I mean - there when I 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.329
 air shot that shocked me it was 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.820
 very playable I really liked this 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.989
 first part and there I took the opportunity to 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.299
 a moment I saw that it was 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.440
 several rounds that I was doing there 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.090
 the same tito and that it worked rather 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.300
 well I first went for valence 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.680
 and the catch and ben we 'll try to 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.130
 here is to make a walk not too bad 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.450
 and just showing technique 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.770
 is relatively I want to say on 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.290
 the place where it's going is easy it 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.840
 can turn but but on the map it's 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.090
 enough it's pretty hot and it turns out 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.970
 that on finally she is quite restricted 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.790
 anyway and here it's it's one of 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.170
 most and more comfortable places I 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.660
 find for starters his little to 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.030
 his turn so after I do not know 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.070
 too much I can add is the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.530
 first video on black up of zombies 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.880
 it's a little video tips but you 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.980
 do not worry there are videos 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.800
 how to say live comment that go 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.290
 surely arrive on all the east especially 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.910
 that the maps derived from the parts more 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.650
 conventional what's there it's just that 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.850
 for once I wanted to go out 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.480
 little video story to tell you yes 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.010
 yes I played well but it will come through 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.090
 Following other videos that stuff 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.460
 will be longer this one is enough 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.160
 short so do not worry about it 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.120
 but I will leave you on 7 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.050
 on these images and I give you 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.920
 go for a next video 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.920
 hi to all this lease
