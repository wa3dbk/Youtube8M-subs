tuned ECU this is going to be probably

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.940 
tuned ECU this is going to be probably
the<00:00:08.790> easiest<00:00:09.240> mod<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.200> can<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.650> on<00:00:10.800> your

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
the easiest mod that you can do on your

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.009 
the easiest mod that you can do on your
car<00:00:11.160> simply<00:00:11.519> because<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.360> least<00:00:12.690> amount

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
car simply because it's the least amount

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.160 
car simply because it's the least amount
of<00:00:13.170> steps<00:00:13.559> taken<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.450> make<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.630> change<00:00:15.960> we're

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
of steps taken to make the change we're

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.990 
of steps taken to make the change we're
gonna<00:00:16.260> take<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> ECU<00:00:17.190> here<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
gonna take the ECU here this is the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.920 
gonna take the ECU here this is the
pre-programmed<00:00:18.449> ECU<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.199> received<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:20.930> JSF

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
are tuning soulful racing and we're

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.519 
are tuning soulful racing and we're
going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> replace<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.900> our<00:00:27.900> stock<00:00:28.289> one

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
going to replace it with our stock one

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.440 
going to replace it with our stock one
it<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> point<00:00:29.970> five<00:00:30.380> tune<00:00:31.550> 0.5<00:00:32.550> stage<00:00:32.969> tune

it is the point five tune 0.5 stage tune

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.069 
it is the point five tune 0.5 stage tune
rather<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.329> let's<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.480> started

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
rather and so let's get started

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.810 
rather and so let's get started
first<00:00:37.469> thing<00:00:37.649> we're<00:00:37.800> gonna<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.190> disconnect

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
first thing we're gonna do is disconnect

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.660 
first thing we're gonna do is disconnect
the<00:00:39.030> negative<00:00:39.480> terminal<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> battery<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
the negative terminal on the battery and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
the negative terminal on the battery and
wait<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> few<00:00:42.000> minutes<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> make<00:00:43.350> sure

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
wait a few minutes just to make sure

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.209 
wait a few minutes just to make sure
that<00:00:43.710> everything<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.219> discharged<00:00:46.160> do<00:00:47.160> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that everything is discharged do you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.220 
that everything is discharged do you
want<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> disconnect<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.149> ECU<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:49.079> you

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
want to disconnect the ECU and if you

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.160 
want to disconnect the ECU and if you
have<00:00:49.320> an<00:00:49.469> automatic<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.250> TCU<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
have an automatic the TCU as well this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.299 
have an automatic the TCU as well this
one<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
one right here is going to be the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.389 
one right here is going to be the
transmission<00:00:53.789> controller<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.680> this<00:00:55.680> box

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
transmission controller and this box

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.310 
transmission controller and this box
here<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> two<00:00:57.090> connectors<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:57.930> ECU

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
here with the two connectors is your ECU

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.290 
here with the two connectors is your ECU
so<00:00:58.910> simply<00:00:59.910> lift<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:01.129> like<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.430> it'll<00:01:02.910> unlock

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
so simply lift up like this it'll unlock

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140 
so simply lift up like this it'll unlock
and<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.350> lift<00:01:04.589> straight<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
and you can lift straight out of the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.380 
and you can lift straight out of the
port<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:07.890> disconnected<00:01:08.880> so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
port and it will be disconnected so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.510 
port and it will be disconnected so
simply<00:01:09.869> don't<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.280> all<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> them

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:33.390 

you<00:01:17.520> set<00:01:17.790> them<00:01:17.939> over<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> side

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.510 

okay<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.570> then<00:01:34.900> you<00:01:35.380> want<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.890> ten<00:01:36.250> millimeter

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
okay and then you want a ten millimeter

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.800 
okay and then you want a ten millimeter
socket<00:01:37.060> with<00:01:37.840> an<00:01:37.990> extension<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.360> there<00:01:40.600> are

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
socket with an extension and there are

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.690 
socket with an extension and there are
actually<00:01:41.200> let<00:01:41.350> me<00:01:41.500> show<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.770> how<00:01:42.040> because<00:01:42.280> you

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
actually let me show you how because you

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:59.940 
actually let me show you how because you
have<00:01:43.030> trouble<00:01:43.420> doing<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.410> run<00:01:44.650> hand<00:01:44.920> but<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:59.830> if

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
have trouble doing it run hand but so if

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.760 
have trouble doing it run hand but so if
you<00:02:00.100> could<00:02:00.280> take<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.490> look<00:02:00.790> down<00:02:01.060> here<00:02:01.770> you'll

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
you could take a look down here you'll

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.750 
you could take a look down here you'll
see<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.250> there's<00:02:03.520> one<00:02:03.970> two<00:02:05.369> silver<00:02:06.369> coloured

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
see that there's one two silver coloured

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.730 
see that there's one two silver coloured
bolts<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.479> then<00:02:08.170> there's<00:02:08.350> going<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.530> be<00:02:08.590> a

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
bolts and then there's going to be a

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
bolts and then there's going to be a
black<00:02:09.160> bolt<00:02:10.140> way<00:02:11.140> down<00:02:11.590> there<00:02:11.950> if<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.250> can<00:02:12.459> if

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
black bolt way down there if you can if

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.140 
black bolt way down there if you can if
the<00:02:12.880> camera<00:02:13.209> will<00:02:13.300> feel<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.290> photo<00:02:14.560> focus

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the camera will feel now the photo focus

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.510 
the camera will feel now the photo focus
its<00:02:16.150> focusing<00:02:16.600> now<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.260> camera<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.040> that's

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
its focusing now the camera so that's

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.800 
its focusing now the camera so that's
all<00:02:18.910> three<00:02:19.950> ten<00:02:20.950> millimeter<00:02:21.370> bolts<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.750> you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
all three ten millimeter bolts that you

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.100 
all three ten millimeter bolts that you
will<00:02:23.050> remove<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.890> entire<00:02:24.660> mount<00:02:25.660> this

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
will remove and this entire mount this

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.220 
will remove and this entire mount this
metallic<00:02:26.620> mount<00:02:27.130> for<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.700> ECU's<00:02:28.180> will<00:02:28.450> lift

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
metallic mount for the ECU's will lift

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.300 
metallic mount for the ECU's will lift
up<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.420> let's<00:02:31.420> go<00:02:31.570> ahead<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.190> come<00:02:33.190> in

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
up so let's go ahead and do that come in

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.350 
up so let's go ahead and do that come in
that<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.640> use<00:02:33.820> in<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.290> long<00:02:35.290> extension<00:02:36.360> socket

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
that you use in a long extension socket

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.250 
that you use in a long extension socket
for<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.680> black<00:02:39.580> bolt<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.269> that's<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:40.989> in

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
for the black bolt that that's it's in

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.259 
for the black bolt that that's it's in
there<00:02:41.470> simply<00:02:41.800> because<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.459> stud<00:02:42.970> coming

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
there simply because the stud coming

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.910 
there simply because the stud coming
through<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:43.989> little<00:02:44.260> tall<00:02:44.530> for<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
through it is a little tall for the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.949 
through it is a little tall for the
standard<00:02:45.370> sockets<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:48.959> extended

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
standard sockets so this is a extended

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.440 
standard sockets so this is a extended
size<00:02:50.230> socket<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.280> use<00:02:51.640> still<00:02:52.180> ten

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
size socket that I use still ten

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.040 
size socket that I use still ten
millimeter<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.590> once<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:53.920> remove<00:02:54.250> that

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
millimeter so once you remove that

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.920 
millimeter so once you remove that
rather<00:02:56.050> once<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.440> remove<00:02:56.709> all<00:02:56.920> three<00:02:57.190> bolts

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
rather once you remove all three bolts

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.350 
rather once you remove all three bolts
completely<00:02:58.930> grab<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.380> hold<00:02:59.940> pull<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.060> entire

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
completely grab a hold pull the entire

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.930 
completely grab a hold pull the entire
simply<00:03:01.870> out<00:03:06.570> be<00:03:07.570> very<00:03:07.840> careful<00:03:08.320> not<00:03:08.500> to

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
simply out be very careful not to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:20.089 
simply out be very careful not to
scratch<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.300> body<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.930> car

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.920 

so<00:03:20.310> at<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.640> point<00:03:21.859> down<00:03:22.859> nicely<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:24.420> we<00:03:24.629> want

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
so at this point down nicely and we want

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.500 
so at this point down nicely and we want
to<00:03:25.170> remove<00:03:26.129> these<00:03:26.489> four<00:03:28.519> bolts<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.760> this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
to remove these four bolts and this

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:40.240 
to remove these four bolts and this
entire<00:03:30.840> ECU<00:03:31.409> should<00:03:31.680> slide<00:03:32.099> off<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.670> believe

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.890 

yes<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.700> ten<00:03:41.939> millimeter<00:03:42.359> so<00:03:42.629> just

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
yes this is ten millimeter so just

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.319 
yes this is ten millimeter so just
continue<00:03:43.349> using<00:03:43.500> your<00:03:43.709> 10<00:03:44.010> millimeter<00:03:44.400> unbolt

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
continue using your 10 millimeter unbolt

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.319 
continue using your 10 millimeter unbolt
and<00:03:45.450> slide<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.049> stock<00:03:46.319> ECU<00:03:46.799> out

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
and slide the stock ECU out

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.020 
and slide the stock ECU out
heywood<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.450> four<00:03:48.689> bolts<00:03:48.900> removed<00:03:49.819> slide<00:03:50.819> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
heywood the four bolts removed slide the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.949 
heywood the four bolts removed slide the
stock<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.510> see<00:03:51.719> you<00:03:51.840> out<00:03:52.159> place<00:03:53.159> it<00:03:53.370> somewhere

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
stock you see you out place it somewhere

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.949 
stock you see you out place it somewhere
so<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.019> don't<00:03:55.200> get<00:03:55.319> it<00:03:55.439> mixed<00:03:55.680> up<00:03:56.569> grab<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.599> hold

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
so you don't get it mixed up grab a hold

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:06.949 
so you don't get it mixed up grab a hold

down and then push the toggle down the
the<00:04:32.220> flapper<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.789> rather<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:34.349> did<00:04:35.099> I<00:04:35.430> went<00:04:35.970> ahead

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
the flapper I rather I did I went ahead

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.390 
the flapper I rather I did I went ahead
and<00:04:36.389> used<00:04:36.990> both<00:04:37.289> my<00:04:37.530> hands<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.949> do<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.070> just<00:04:38.280> to

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
and used both my hands to do it just to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.159 
and used both my hands to do it just to
make<00:04:38.550> sure<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.729> did<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.090> solid<00:04:39.419> connection

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
make sure I did a solid connection

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.050 
make sure I did a solid connection
rather<00:04:40.320> than<00:04:40.650> doing<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:41.099> over<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.430> Cameron<00:04:41.849> and

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
rather than doing it over to Cameron and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.570 
rather than doing it over to Cameron and
not<00:04:42.960> making<00:04:43.289> a<00:04:43.349> good<00:04:43.380> connection<00:04:43.650> because<00:04:44.460> you

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
not making a good connection because you

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.439 
not making a good connection because you
don't<00:04:45.270> want<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.509> mess<00:04:45.659> with<00:04:45.870> these<00:04:46.020> two<00:04:46.349> badly

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
don't want to mess with these two badly

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.810 
don't want to mess with these two badly
last<00:04:48.449> step<00:04:48.750> or<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.710> second<00:04:50.159> to<00:04:50.220> last<00:04:50.340> step<00:04:50.639> is

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
last step or a second to last step is

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.040 
last step or a second to last step is
reinstall<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.949> battery<00:04:52.949> cable<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:54.050> then

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
reinstall the battery cable and then

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.920 
reinstall the battery cable and then
give<00:04:55.289> it<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.470> test<00:04:55.680> run

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
give it a test run

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.909 
give it a test run
okay<00:04:57.930> now<00:04:58.139> that<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.409> battery<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.800> connected

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
okay now that the battery is connected

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.189 
okay now that the battery is connected
we're<00:04:59.580> ready<00:04:59.759> to<00:04:59.970> do<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.120> test<00:05:00.210> run<00:05:00.659> and<00:05:00.960> so

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
we're ready to do a test run and so

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.070 
we're ready to do a test run and so
everybody<00:05:01.860> has<00:05:02.130> gathered<00:05:03.060> around<00:05:03.210> isn't<00:05:03.750> well

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
everybody has gathered around isn't well

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.370 
everybody has gathered around isn't well
maybe<00:05:04.770> not<00:05:04.979> everybody<00:05:05.400> but<00:05:06.080> let's<00:05:07.080> see<00:05:07.229> what

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
maybe not everybody but let's see what

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:27.020 
maybe not everybody but let's see what
we<00:05:07.500> did<00:05:07.530> what<00:05:07.830> we<00:05:08.930> accomplished

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.620 

well<00:05:28.030> she<00:05:28.270> fired<00:05:28.540> up<00:05:28.810> so<00:05:29.170> that's<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.530> good<00:05:29.710> sign

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
well she fired up so that's a good sign

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.320 
well she fired up so that's a good sign
everything<00:05:31.630> checks<00:05:32.080> out<00:05:32.230> okay

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
everything checks out okay

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.040 
everything checks out okay
no<00:05:34.569> immediate<00:05:35.110> problems<00:05:35.680> around<00:05:36.340> so<00:05:37.050> just

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
no immediate problems around so just

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.809 
no immediate problems around so just
give<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:38.349> a<00:05:38.409> test<00:05:38.620> run<00:05:38.800> but<00:05:39.099> that's<00:05:39.310> basically

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
give it a test run but that's basically

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.180 
give it a test run but that's basically
all<00:05:39.970> it<00:05:40.270> takes<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:40.780> swap<00:05:41.169> out<00:05:41.349> your<00:05:41.560> ECU

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
all it takes to swap out your ECU

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.740 
all it takes to swap out your ECU
let<00:05:43.700> me<00:05:43.760> know<00:05:43.850> if<00:05:43.940> you<00:05:44.030> have<00:05:44.120> any<00:05:44.300> questions
