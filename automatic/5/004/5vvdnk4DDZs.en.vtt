00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 the cardiocirculatory anatomy 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.589
 arteries of the upper limb 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.080
 in this video we will analyze the artery 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.370
 brachial arterial radial arteries e 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.299
 we will also give a hint of the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.550
 arterial circulation of the hand are 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.340
 few as the arteries said 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.170
 of the upper limb but have a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.180
 certain number of collateral branches 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 anastomoses that make the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.439
 treatment the brachial artery originates 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.230
 as a direct continuation of the scene 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.530
 re and ends at the bend of the elbow 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.899
 dividing into the radial and urn king 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.629
 and here it is the brachial artery a 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 very large deep artery like all 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.250
 the arteries that we can observe here 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.960
 give some side branches including the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 deep arm that goes goes 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.460
 schooling of the humerus was i 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 deeper muscles and collaterals 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.250
 radials and a ri going to join the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.520
 Radial arteries to nare body problem 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.420
 said generating a large number of branches 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.189
 Anastomosis is the elbow level 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.130
 the radial artery represents the branch 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.080
 side of the bifurcation arises a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.920
 centimeter below the fold of the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.049
 elbow and runs along in radio as 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.540
 we can observe is a structure 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.189
 very profound situation all 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.909
 Forearm muscles pass them 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.250
 front runs on the flying face of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.850
 radio and ends at the process level 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.070
 stylus idea of ​​this bone damage a branch 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.640
 which will form part of the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.680
 larter hand circulation to adorn 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.079
 instead it is the medial side of the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.930
 bifurcation same point of origin 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.810
 of the radial artery is obviously also 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.450
 same end point however this 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.490
 therefore, its point runs for nothing 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.329
 of arrival will be the stylus ideo process 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.250
 of the ulna as you can also observe 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.619
 this is a rather deep artery 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.750
 although not like the radial artery in 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.210
 how much some muscle structures 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.190
 they pass below you can already start 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.379
 to guess that the terminal branch 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.120
 of the lunar artery will join with 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.390
 some of ram artery terminals 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.160
 radial in shape 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.470
 the complex arterial circulation 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.880
 of the hand 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.680
 let's talk right now about the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.680
 arterial circulation of the hand 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.360
 here you can see how from the artery 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.630
 radial branch off a side branch 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.300
 towards its term called branch 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.090
 Carpal dorsal here in purple that will go 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.820
 to join the terminal part of the art 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.920
 réel mare of the salt-colored carpi branch yes 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.190
 then they will remove four large arteries 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.100
 that crossing the internet space a 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:54.610
 carpico will share at the end of 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.810
 this in two branches the two terminal branches 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.070
 vascularized year the region 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.060
 dorsal posterior of two adjacent fingers 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.860
 so there is no artery for each finger 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.900
 but each artery runs in space 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.290
 between the fingers and on the terminal branches 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.110
 vascularized half lateral finger and half 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.720
 medial finger the same speech can 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.120
 be done with the circulations of the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.060
 even these will have the same palm 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.269
 type of ram terminals but how can you 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.329
 already start to see palm arches 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.700
 there are two and not one the palm branch 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.060
 profound comes from reordering art and 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.670
 runs in front of the long carpus 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.310
 the proximal epiphysis of the metacarpals 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.470
 then going on to merge with the last one 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.250
 part of the radial artery that which 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.950
 exits in the first inter metacarpal space 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.350
 immediately on average compared to the thumb 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.390
 from the deep palmar artery will be born 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.910
 of internet branches to carpi c for i 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.820
 inter muscles or if instead the arch 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.260
 shallow and almost palm- sized 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.600
 exclusively an addiction 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.670
 of the lunar artery even its threads 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.760
 terminals go to join the artery 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.579
 radial from this arc will come off 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.019
 four internet branches in carpi c that 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.430
 arrived at the level of the fingers yes 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.519
 they will split in two 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.200
 exactly as it happens for the system 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.200
 of the dorsal Carpian branch
