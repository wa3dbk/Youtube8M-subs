00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
promotional video that was mounted up

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.490 
promotional video that was mounted up
here<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.900> kind<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.960> built<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.290> down

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
here so it's all kind of built in down

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
here so it's all kind of built in down
here<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.100> thing<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.490> mount<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.330> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
here now this thing can mount here to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.600 
here now this thing can mount here to
the<00:01:33.900> top<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.440> or<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.100> bottom<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.580> think

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the top of this or to the bottom I think

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.430 
the top of this or to the bottom I think
this<00:01:35.910> is<00:01:36.030> probably<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.480> smartest<00:01:36.840> location

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
this is probably the smartest location

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.810 
this is probably the smartest location
especially<00:01:37.890> considering<00:01:38.310> my<00:01:38.430> suspension

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
especially considering my suspension

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.820 
especially considering my suspension
rides<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:41.870> there's<00:01:42.870> a<00:01:42.960> bracket<00:01:43.440> here

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
rides in here but there's a bracket here

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.280 
rides in here but there's a bracket here
that<00:01:44.160> mounts<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.760> your<00:01:44.940> down<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.930> our<00:01:46.080> to

that mounts it to your down to our to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.680 
that mounts it to your down to our to
your<00:01:46.470> mainframe<00:01:47.370> bar<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.620> then<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:51.420> comes

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
your mainframe bar and then it comes

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.280 
your mainframe bar and then it comes
with<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.410> crank<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.100> bottom<00:01:53.460> bracket<00:01:54.290> the
