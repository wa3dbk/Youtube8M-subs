1300 miles on the trails coming into
this<00:00:44.269> race<00:00:44.540> I<00:00:44.750> mean<00:00:44.780> it's<00:00:45.110> been<00:00:45.320> built<00:00:45.559> up

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
this race I mean it's been built up

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.369 
this race I mean it's been built up
pretty<00:00:46.100> big<00:00:46.370> for<00:00:46.760> for<00:00:47.089> Jesse<00:00:47.479> and<00:00:47.659> I'm<00:00:48.079> really

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
pretty big for for Jesse and I'm really

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.979 
pretty big for for Jesse and I'm really
optimistic<00:00:48.920> about<00:00:49.190> Jesse's<00:00:49.879> prospects<00:00:50.570> he's

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
optimistic about Jesse's prospects he's

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.049 
optimistic about Jesse's prospects he's
stuck<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.710> his<00:00:51.859> plan<00:00:52.160> he's<00:00:52.430> stuck<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
stuck to his plan he's stuck to the

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.200 
stuck to his plan he's stuck to the
program<00:00:53.539> he's<00:00:54.109> paid<00:00:54.410> his<00:00:54.440> dues<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.340> I<00:00:55.609> think

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
program he's paid his dues so I think

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:10.550 
program he's paid his dues so I think
it's<00:00:56.510> going<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.690> be<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.899> good<00:00:57.140> race

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.260 

up<00:01:11.159> until<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.549> point<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.940> furthest

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
up until this point the furthest

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
up until this point the furthest
distance<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.659> run<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> 32<00:01:13.320> miles<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.890> that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
distance I've run to 32 miles and that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.680 
distance I've run to 32 miles and that
sounds<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:15.210> staring<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
sounds like a lot but I'm staring in the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.840 
sounds like a lot but I'm staring in the
barrel<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> 50-mile<00:01:16.500> race<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.640> there's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
barrel the 50-mile race and so there's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.090 
barrel the 50-mile race and so there's
this<00:01:18.119> huge<00:01:18.570> chunk<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> distance<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.770> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
this huge chunk of distance that you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.910 
this huge chunk of distance that you
know<00:01:20.190> it's<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.640> unknown<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.240> me

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
know it's going to be unknown to me

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
know it's going to be unknown to me
beyond<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> distance<00:01:23.610> though<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> fact

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
beyond the distance though is the fact

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
beyond the distance though is the fact
that<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.900> 50k<00:01:25.409> he<00:01:25.619> did<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that the 50k he did it was on a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.139 
that the 50k he did it was on a
technical<00:01:27.270> course<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.690> not<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.080> technical

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
technical course but not that technical

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.340 
technical course but not that technical
the<00:01:30.149> course<00:01:30.420> he's<00:01:30.570> gonna<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.810> running<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.170> Bear

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the course he's gonna be running in Bear

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.740 
the course he's gonna be running in Bear
Mountain<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.890> considerably<00:01:32.670> more<00:01:32.759> tricky<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
Mountain is considerably more tricky and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.850 
Mountain is considerably more tricky and
treacherous<00:01:35.930> he's<00:01:36.930> gonna<00:01:37.080> have<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.350> contend

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
treacherous he's gonna have to contend

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
treacherous he's gonna have to contend
with<00:01:37.950> conservative<00:01:38.759> his<00:01:38.880> energy<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.509> he's

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
with conservative his energy when he's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
with conservative his energy when he's
kind<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.110> scrambling<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.830> very<00:01:41.220> technical

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
kind of scrambling a very technical

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.779 
kind of scrambling a very technical
unrunnable<00:01:42.479> surfaces<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.700> of

laying out and going faster when he's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.370

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.560 

this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.190> furthest<00:01:53.550> he's<00:01:53.700> ever<00:01:53.880> gone<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this is the furthest he's ever gone it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
this is the furthest he's ever gone it
was<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.720> step<00:01:55.050> into<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> unknown<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.159> just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
was a step into the unknown and just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340 
was a step into the unknown and just
knowing<00:01:56.940> that<00:01:57.270> he<00:01:57.390> had<00:01:57.479> trained<00:01:57.840> his<00:01:57.990> entire

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
knowing that he had trained his entire

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.219 
knowing that he had trained his entire
body<00:01:58.620> to<00:01:59.400> deal<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> 50<00:02:00.330> miles<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.900> think

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
body to deal with the 50 miles I think

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.380 
body to deal with the 50 miles I think
was<00:02:01.640> psychologically<00:02:02.640> really<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.000> strong

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
was psychologically really a strong

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.300 
was psychologically really a strong
strong<00:02:03.780> thing<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.290> he<00:02:04.680> looked<00:02:04.950> good<00:02:05.130> he<00:02:05.280> just

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
strong thing and he looked good he just

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.620 
strong thing and he looked good he just
looked<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.910> was<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.060> really<00:02:06.450> good<00:02:06.570> shape

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
looked like it was in really good shape

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.240 
looked like it was in really good shape
I<00:02:07.580> feel<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:09.289> things<00:02:10.289> are<00:02:10.440> starting<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> sting<00:02:11.100> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
I feel it things are starting to sting a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.730 
I feel it things are starting to sting a
little

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
little

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.650 
little
coming<00:02:13.740> into<00:02:13.830> mile<00:02:14.040> 45<00:02:14.580> or<00:02:14.820> 46<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.540> was

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
coming into mile 45 or 46 I was

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.940 
coming into mile 45 or 46 I was
obviously<00:02:15.840> feeling<00:02:16.380> pretty<00:02:16.530> fatigued

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
obviously feeling pretty fatigued

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.890 
obviously feeling pretty fatigued
because<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.370> distance<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.720> was<00:02:18.810> at

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
because of the distance and it was at

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.350 
because of the distance and it was at
this<00:02:18.990> point<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.830> probably<00:02:20.340> hit<00:02:20.790> my<00:02:20.970> my

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
this point that I probably hit my my

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.449 
this point that I probably hit my my
mental<00:02:21.660> low<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.080> was<00:02:22.470> already<00:02:22.680> tired<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.370> there

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
mental low I was already tired and there

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.040 
mental low I was already tired and there
was<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> really<00:02:23.880> long<00:02:24.090> uphill<00:02:24.540> section<00:02:24.930> that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
was a really long uphill section that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.320 
was a really long uphill section that
was<00:02:25.140> steep<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.550> zapped<00:02:27.120> my

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
was steep and it just it zapped my

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.540 
was steep and it just it zapped my
strength<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.959> probably<00:02:28.290> took<00:02:28.410> 15-20<00:02:29.250> minutes

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
strength it probably took 15-20 minutes

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.300 
strength it probably took 15-20 minutes
to<00:02:29.820> scramble<00:02:30.300> up<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.630> top<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.140> when<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.070> was

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
to scramble up to the top and when I was

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.280 
to scramble up to the top and when I was
there<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.550> mean<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:33.030> wasn't<00:02:33.600> going<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.810> quit<00:02:34.050> of

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
there I mean I wasn't going to quit of

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.470 
there I mean I wasn't going to quit of
course<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.709> but<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.370> was<00:02:35.489> really<00:02:36.150> hard<00:02:36.360> to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
course not but it was really hard to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.080 
course not but it was really hard to
keep<00:02:36.600> going<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.760> that's<00:02:38.940> what

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.280 
keep going and and you know that's what
I<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.300> had<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> fall<00:02:39.660> back<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.020> training

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
I just had to fall back on the training

I just had to fall back on the training
you<00:02:40.860> know<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:40.980> knew<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> was<00:02:41.430> strong<00:02:41.670> enough<00:02:41.700> I

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
to disappear a little bit and I just

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.160 
to disappear a little bit and I just
found<00:02:58.850> this<00:02:59.000> energy<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.840> didn't<00:03:00.080> know<00:03:00.140> I
