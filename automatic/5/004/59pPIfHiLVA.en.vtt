Windows key and it taste is back so if

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.760 
Windows key and it taste is back so if
we<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:41.820> never<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.299> across<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.590> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
we now never get across now that's that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.490 
we now never get across now that's that
application<00:01:44.310> installed<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.820> well<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.840> we

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
application installed as well and we

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.999 
application installed as well and we
should<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:48.049> we<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> very<00:01:49.590> end<00:01:49.770> here

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
should see as we do at the very end here

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.190 
should see as we do at the very end here
it's<00:01:50.700> also<00:01:50.850> picked<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.360> my<00:01:51.570> mac<00:01:51.899> applications

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it's also picked up my mac applications

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.319 
it's also picked up my mac applications
as<00:01:52.890> well<00:01:52.920> inside<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> think

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
as well inside of here and I think

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.990 
as well inside of here and I think
that's<00:01:54.450> probably<00:01:54.630> parallels<00:01:55.320> doing<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.000> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that's probably parallels doing that and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.389 
that's probably parallels doing that and
not<00:01:57.540> windows<00:01:57.899> 8<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.280> we
