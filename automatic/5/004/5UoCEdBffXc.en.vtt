00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
January I feel and we also need sort of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.420 
January I feel and we also need sort of
like<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> holding<00:00:36.780> midfielder<00:00:36.980> very<00:00:37.980> similar

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
like a holding midfielder very similar

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.270 
like a holding midfielder very similar
to<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.730> Paul<00:00:38.969> skulls<00:00:39.300> sort<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:40.040> but<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to like Paul skulls sort of thing but I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.889 
to like Paul skulls sort of thing but I
guess<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.700> could<00:00:41.850> say<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.090> Fellaini<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
guess we could say that's Fellaini if it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
guess we could say that's Fellaini if it
gets<00:00:43.050> rotated<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.649> into<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> squad<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.820> let's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
I believe if we did sign him in Old

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.589 
I believe if we did sign him in Old
Trafford<00:02:42.099> he<00:02:42.250> would<00:02:42.370> play<00:02:42.580> very<00:02:43.090> very<00:02:43.360> well

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
Trafford he would play very very well

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.350

next<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:45.069> Shinji<00:02:45.519> Kagawa<00:02:45.790> playing<00:02:46.180> as<00:02:46.330> a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
next to a Shinji Kagawa playing as a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.210 
next to a Shinji Kagawa playing as a
centimeter<00:02:46.870> send<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.170> defensive<00:02:47.620> sort<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:47.980> roll

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
centimeter send a defensive sort of roll

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.100 
centimeter send a defensive sort of roll
and<00:02:48.489> he'd<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:48.970> very<00:02:49.450> like<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.810> said<00:02:50.080> like

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
and he'd be a very like I said like

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.080 
and he'd be a very like I said like
before<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.709> very<00:02:50.950> good<00:02:51.220> creative<00:02:51.670> midfielder

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
before a very good creative midfielder

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.120 
before a very good creative midfielder
that<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:52.330> do<00:02:52.480> need<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.440> do<00:02:53.500> believe<00:02:53.920> he

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that we do need and I do believe he

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.520 
that we do need and I do believe he
would<00:02:54.250> fit<00:02:54.489> well<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.480> Old<00:02:55.810> Trafford<00:02:56.350> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
would fit well in Old Trafford and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.890 
would fit well in Old Trafford and
hopefully<00:02:57.280> give<00:02:57.760> us<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.510> little<00:02:58.750> bit<00:02:58.810> of

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
hopefully give us that a little bit of

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.259 
hopefully give us that a little bit of
fresh<00:02:59.080> injection<00:02:59.440> into<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.069> squad<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:00.670> going

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
fresh injection into the squad so going

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.660 
fresh injection into the squad so going
to<00:03:01.360> goon<00:03:01.510> could<00:03:01.750> quite<00:03:01.959> possibly<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.670> potential

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
to goon could quite possibly a potential

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.470 
to goon could quite possibly a potential
target<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:04.090> my<00:03:04.209> opinion<00:03:05.549> matage<00:03:06.549> is<00:03:06.790> no

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
target in my opinion matage is no

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.150
