00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.410
 welcome I'm angry I'm a little 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.160
 pissed off step man I'm afraid not 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.750
 I'm going to sleep and good if you can sleep 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.520
 think that the program ended late 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.890
 but there are people who believe that there is no 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.470
 it just never happened after half past one 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.410
 you can go to bed if you do not already a little 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 was the woman's problems and then 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.340
 ends with a good mood our 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.260
 charlines or sleeps on Friday sleeps 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 you will sleep on Friday on Saturday and the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.790
 Sunday that is really not a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.380
 problem here the people that we are also 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.359
 a country I like this because it's a 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.789
 country that always goes to bed late that 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.230
 goes the farra that rises at nightfall and 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.410
 Then they tell me it's too late 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.269
 because we are in Sweden not good at 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.679
 Sometimes a phrase I think has been opened 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.269
 very interesting that every season 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.890
 you discover in quotes is a box of 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.960
 new toys with which to have fun 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.519
 at the moment we will have fun 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.640
 fun and aix this would not make sense 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.770
 because if this is as good and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.600
 terrible because there are other professions 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.370
 that are for life I know 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.980
 there is always fun but at a 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.300
 architect I do not know if he puts the fun 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.700
 as 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.980
 standard number one in our case yes 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.530
 because it is also transmitted and transmitted 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.100
 whether it converts or there is a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.690
 hopefully there never will be a 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.510
 disaffection everything would stop having a 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.490
 a sense is what I think 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.320
 it makes it a bit magical I am that I 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.410
 like to go to the plate, I really tell you 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.120
 because it 's the best time of the day 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.830
 then that just happens to be 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.900
 So I hope it lasts many 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.790
 Sometimes I have seen from the viewer 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.380
 I think that you are the zero spectator and if 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.880
 the product you like if the format you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.100
 like if the news you like has 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.200
 success as a viewer 0 before 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.580
 start on Monday has convinced you to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.770
 one hundred percent at a time still something for 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.630
 readjust I'm a dissatisfied you're 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.720
 with a zero viewer I like that 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.360
 concept but also very dissatisfied 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.920
 a constant seeker I have learned to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.110
 relax to enjoy more than what 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200
 I have to not always wait what I like 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.010
 will never come but I think that is 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.800
 good of general dissatisfaction 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.990
 overcoming 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.250
 and he already had one thing he told us 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:31.280
 no one 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:34.280
 good yes but I would not tell you no no 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.980
 I have very good feelings I have 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.410
 good feelings and that sometimes has not 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.600
 past in other times there was continuity 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.959
 there was such and this time as we have stopped 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.660
 we have quite opened up I say the body 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.610
 of the program with anesthesia and we have to 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.140
 A cool shake gave us time to talk 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.990
 between us laughing at dinner drinking 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.239
 I think we have taken good 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.130
 good faces decisions I like that 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.739
 be crowns for example give me good 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.080
 roll that comes crowns you know it 's 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:11.030
 the seville I worked with 15 years ago 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.000
 years go by as good after the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.340
 tele reality let's say it takes care of 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.640
 place them but there is good there is good roll 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.560
 he is so young scientist that he had 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.380
 seen anywhere ricardo moura 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.800
 little boy who likewise flips with him good 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.180
 those things that are are already good for 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.340
 finish you have made more signings than 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.280
 the barÃ§a 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.599
 which of those signings those that the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.650
 section which do you think goes more to 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.940
 surprise people because 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.620
 obviously we know the crowns 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.540
 we know Seville but what do you think 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.080
 will surprise me more my idea is that 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.430
 better is one that makes see all this is 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.140
 like soccer too 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.970
 that is chips to a player only at 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.980
 madrid but to touch that topic but 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.959
 and neither is there any signing 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.180
 star that you then say that it has happened 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.250
 here no no and it is part of the also of the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.890
 magic I do not think that everyone is going to 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.410
 leave the skin in search of chemistry 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.599
 like people there, everyone comes out 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.030
 to like then the audience says look at this 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.829
 we were surprised more or less I would not be 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.900
 unfair to highlight someone but yes 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.900
 would claim some attention by the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.180
 scientist I think it's a guy that 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.139
 account for things that had not previously 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.739
 counted 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.569
 not in vain is that contest bahamas is 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.330
 a very rare thing where scientists go 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.800
 to do monologues and man we are going to 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.360
 try to see what happens but I think 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.949
 It can be very curious 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.990
 the last andreu that we have followed your 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.340
 photographic project on the internet we have 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.319
 followed by install your videoblog 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.360
 looking at camera you who are a Twitter 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.099
 consecrated because on Monday we have to 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.749
 take command and stay up for the day 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:46.789
 next because you'll sleep when you 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:49.819
 die if not on Friday that also 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.370
 catch and make a tweet in fact not 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:56.300
 I can expand it or it is a holder already 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.770
 you will die when you will sleep today and buoys 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.240
 when you sleep, there was also the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.479
 Yes, because if you sleep 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.439
 it's like being dead, therefore 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:08.240
 bet on life and see the program has 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:10.099
 stayed as three were the slogans very 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.060
 messy everything you get and that you what 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.060
 arrange in your house 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.390
 I think I'm going to try the best 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:25.590
 to be there just in case 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.590
 It was not good in places
