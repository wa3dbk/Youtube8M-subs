support in ascend to of course a-- which

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.359 
support in ascend to of course a-- which
is<00:00:24.720> probably<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> best<00:00:25.800> racing<00:00:26.189> car

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
is probably one of the best racing car

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.050 
is probably one of the best racing car
games<00:00:26.670> out<00:00:27.029> there<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.689> my<00:00:28.050> honest<00:00:28.439> opinion

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
games out there in my honest opinion

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.450 
games out there in my honest opinion
however<00:00:30.060> setting<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.710> easy<00:00:32.009> so

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
however setting it up is not easy so

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.850 
however setting it up is not easy so
much<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.079> know<00:00:34.170> video<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.739> it

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
much so I think you know video for it

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.160 
much so I think you know video for it
and<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.309> course<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.730> webpage<00:00:36.329> described<00:00:36.960> how<00:00:37.110> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and of course a webpage described how to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.889 
and of course a webpage described how to
do<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> back<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.210> October<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> first

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
do it so back in October I first

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.330 
do it so back in October I first
described<00:00:40.260> how<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.070> there's<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
described how to do it but there's a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.770 
described how to do it but there's a
little<00:00:41.550> bit<00:00:41.640> more<00:00:41.820> difficult<00:00:42.329> because<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
little bit more difficult because you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.119 
little bit more difficult because you
have<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> move<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> window<00:00:43.620> from<00:00:43.890> your

have to move the window from your
desktop<00:00:44.579> into<00:00:45.090> your<00:00:45.890> oculus<00:00:46.890> which<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.370> are

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
desktop into your oculus which is are

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
desktop into your oculus which is are
making<00:00:48.329> me<00:00:48.450> nyan<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.379> there's<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> data<00:00:50.219> version

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
making me nyan so there's a data version

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
making me nyan so there's a data version
of<00:00:50.730> Midas<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.390> instructions<00:00:51.930> covers<00:00:52.379> how<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
of Midas my instructions covers how to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
of Midas my instructions covers how to
actually<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.850> set<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> course<00:00:54.360> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
actually have your a set of course in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
actually have your a set of course in
menus<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.050> your<00:00:55.199> desktop<00:00:55.710> monitor<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.520> then

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
menus on your desktop monitor and then

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.819 
menus on your desktop monitor and then
the<00:00:57.270> game<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.660> running<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.320> rift<00:00:58.590> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the game just running in your rift so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.020 
the game just running in your rift so
you<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.039> no<00:00:59.160> longer<00:00:59.370> switching<00:00:59.910> between

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you is no longer switching between

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.360 
you is no longer switching between
windows<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.899> moving<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.920> left<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.280> right

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
windows and moving it left to right

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.390 
windows and moving it left to right
right<00:01:02.760> left<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.449> on

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
right left and so on

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.740 
right left and so on
so<00:01:05.400> essentially<00:01:05.909> first<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.479> we're<00:01:06.659> going

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so essentially first of all we're going

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
so essentially first of all we're going
to<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:07.020> through<00:01:07.290> step<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.880> making<00:01:08.880> sure<00:01:08.909> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
to go through step one making sure that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
to go through step one making sure that
set<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> course<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> set<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.590> oculus

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
set of course is set up for your oculus

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.240 
set of course is set up for your oculus
rift<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> case<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.470> may<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> install

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
rift so in the case of may I install
