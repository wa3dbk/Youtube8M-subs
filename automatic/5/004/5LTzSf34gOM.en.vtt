00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.580
 I'm using ground turkey meat myself 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.290
 I used a pound and a half if you want 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.630
 you can add half the ground beef 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.650
 of pork and half of real networks 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.020
 what do you know, super rich 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 we are also going to use ground bread if 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.170
 you do not have it can be cereal or cookie I 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.660
 Use cookies and the moli very well 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.760
 and half a cup of finely chopped parsley 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.760
 and a cup of diced onion 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:44.420
 garlic powder and finally an egg 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.620
 let's start by adding a spoonful 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.620
 tablespoon garlic powder 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.820
 let's add a part first and 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.820
 let's start to stir it 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.260
 then we add the other part and what 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.260
 we stir very well 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.119
 now we are going to add half a spoonful of 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.119
 Salt 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.370
 then we are going to open the egg and we are going to 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.370
 add half cracker ground 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.970
 incorporates the very meat 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.280
 and then add the other half 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.039
 now we are going to add the onion 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.299
 we revolve it very well 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.750
 and finally the parsley 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.310
 make sure to stir all this very well 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.500
 since we do not have ready we are going to start 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.840
 to make some small balls I used 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.180
 gloves since it's easier and I do not know 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.040
 they stick so much the flesh of the hands we go 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.180
 to make some balls of that size or 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.090
 size you want 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.069
 and we are going to start planning the few 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.409
 doubts can make you bigger or more 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.810
 girls but they are going to use meat from 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.519
 pork or beef if you make it very 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.340
 big one is going to shrink take into account 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.989
 that turkey meat does not shrink much 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.989
 but beef and pork yes 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.670
 good as it is more or less like that in a 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.400
 previously hot pan we are going to 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.470
 add oil and we're going to start 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.470
 sew our hamburger meat 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.520
 then we check that it has already been cooked 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.520
 and the flipped 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.510
 is alive can vary between thicker 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.380
 it takes a little longer and the thinner 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.040
 it takes less and then we take it out and 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.040
 she is ready 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.920
