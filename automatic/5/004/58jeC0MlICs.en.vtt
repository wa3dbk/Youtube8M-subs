00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.749
 and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.680
 good today we are going to prepare some eyelet 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.750
 of these girls that you will see that 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.070
 we will do well for any occasion in 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.150
 that we have to prepare a 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.790
 appetizer or an entree that is quick 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.520
 you are sure that they are very good and 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.099
 love to do it we need a 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.820
 puff pastry sheet as the fresh 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.320
 frozen what you prefer if it can be 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.750
 square or rectangular much better 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.960
 because we will take better advantage of everything 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.510
 you leave but if not then round 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.089
 what would be cheese 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.649
 scratched from the flavor you want in the 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.510
 that you like most in this case is four 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.659
 cheeses because we like at home 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.089
 more oregano an egg and sausages 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.739
 fresh, of course, the better and 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.260
 the better the sausage, the better 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.000
 will be this incoming as I said 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.640
 it's a very fast entrÃ©e to make 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.640
 then what we are going to do is open 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.659
 the puff pastry 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.090
 and to make the most of it, we're going to 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.049
 place 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.049
 the sausages 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.740
 we will give 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.290
 a little bit more than nothing for 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.290
 calculate what we need 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.180
 and once we have more or less the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 measure 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.340
 finch we will do 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.340
 where are we going to open them 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.030
 and folded it, we roll it up again 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.989
 and we have 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.989
 one of the 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.870
 of the facts is basically now 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.920
 we will cut him 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.920
 the remainder 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.800
 we will be doing portions 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.350
 small more or less all of it 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.840
 size 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.990
 when we have them we will put them in the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.620
 oven tray 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.860
 with a greaseproof paper or a paper of 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.860
 oven 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.190
 we have made some without anything and others what 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.720
 we will do for those who like more 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.320
 normal 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.830
 and for others we will put the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.830
 oregano 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.240
 and the grated cheese 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.120
 and we will do the same thing we wrap it 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.120
 and we will form our 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.910
 our habits 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.470
 brush strokes with eggs 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.930
 and we cut 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.260
 if you prefer 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.760
 You can cut it with scissors 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.000
 we are the surplus 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.749
 and we will do the same thing that we have done with 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.219
 the others we will put in the tray 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:32.219
 carefully 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.290
 where they meet below 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.720
 and so we will continue doing that once 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.510
 we have all prepared now we go 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.210
 with the egg that we have left we go to 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.640
 brush well meanwhile we have the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.240
 180 degree heat preheated oven 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.240
 up and down 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.040
 what we did well so that we 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.390
 with a nice golden tone and 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.920
 once already those who brush us 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.510
 then we will decorate different 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.300
 ways for example those that do not have 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.910
 nothing we could put a little bit of 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
 sesame on top to distinguish them more 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.300
 than nothing 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.660
 or you can put oregano what you want 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.760
 that is 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.730
 this is already to your liking 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:28.160
 and to others we can put them 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.160
 example to oregano 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.030
 and another cheese a little bit of cheese 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.520
 and when we have them, we can already 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.770
 put in the oven are about 20 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.880
 minutes and here we have them finished 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.040
 take out of the oven 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.100
 As you can see we have been spectacular 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.770
 they are ready to let them cool down 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.140
 little bit and to enjoy them you can 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.370
 eat both cold and hot so 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.680
 They are ideal for any occasion
