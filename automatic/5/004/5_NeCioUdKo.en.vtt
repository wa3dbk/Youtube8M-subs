the<00:02:48.930> continue<00:02:49.650> doing<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.920> road<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
the continue doing the road to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.740 
the continue doing the road to
procedures<00:02:50.490> match<00:02:50.640> their<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.330> account

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
procedures match their on this account

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.960 
procedures match their on this account
I'm<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.560> gonna<00:02:52.680> use<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.100> for<00:02:53.310> regular<00:02:53.730> but

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
I'm just gonna use this for regular but

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.370 
I'm just gonna use this for regular but
I'm<00:02:54.090> gonna<00:02:54.210> start<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.690> I'm<00:02:54.810> gonna<00:02:54.930> make<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.170> new

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
I'm gonna start it I'm gonna make a new

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.350 
I'm gonna start it I'm gonna make a new
account<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:56.190> I'm<00:02:56.520> gonna<00:02:56.640> start<00:02:56.940> from<00:02:57.060> scratch

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
account and I'm gonna start from scratch

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.360 
account and I'm gonna start from scratch
and<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.410> think<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.739> will<00:02:58.830> be<00:02:58.950> better<00:02:59.100> too

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and I think this will be better too

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.280 
and I think this will be better too
because<00:02:59.550> instead<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.480> being<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.989> like

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
because instead of it being just like

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.470 
because instead of it being just like
just<00:03:01.980> me<00:03:02.100> leveling<00:03:02.489> up<00:03:02.640> it'll<00:03:02.820> like<00:03:03.030> show<00:03:03.330> my

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
just me leveling up it'll like show my

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.610 
just me leveling up it'll like show my
progression<00:03:04.020> like<00:03:04.140> i'll<00:03:04.260> start<00:03:04.530> with

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
progression like i'll start with

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.190 
progression like i'll start with
absolutely<00:03:05.040> nothing<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.489> guys<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:06.270> like<00:03:07.110> all

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
absolutely nothing and guys see like all

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.130 
absolutely nothing and guys see like all
my<00:03:07.380> stats<00:03:07.650> at<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.920> end<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:09.020> won't<00:03:10.020> have

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
my stats at the end like I won't have

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.540 
my stats at the end like I won't have
everything<00:03:10.500> unlocked<00:03:10.770> at<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.100> beginning<00:03:11.340> and

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
everything unlocked at the beginning and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.680 
everything unlocked at the beginning and
stuff<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:11.910> i<00:03:12.060> don't<00:03:12.180> know<00:03:12.360> i<00:03:12.390> think<00:03:12.420> it

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
stuff like that i don't know i think it

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.210 
stuff like that i don't know i think it
would<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:12.959> it'll<00:03:13.470> be<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> lot<00:03:13.739> better<00:03:13.920> um<00:03:14.280> and

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
would be it'll be a lot better um and

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.470 
would be it'll be a lot better um and
hopefully<00:03:17.220> i'll<00:03:17.489> be<00:03:17.520> able<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.000> fix<00:03:18.180> all<00:03:18.360> these
