 forklift background 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.849
 The first to arrive in Caracas began to be used from the middle of 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.449
 19th century and early 20th century where they took special importance in the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.289
 First and Second World War 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.949
 nowadays the forklift is an essential means of transporting 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.670
 giacomo of materials products their courses and applications can be observed 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.180
 than in all branches of industry and there are about 15 types of 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.160
 forklifts to operate in different earthquake positions on their own 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.100
 application 5 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.310
 white in recent years the forklift and industrial equipment company 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.500
 sonora has been dedicated to the sale 30 the forklift service said services 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.460
 They have provided experience and knowledge 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.560
 and used the design and development of an add-on to make the use of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.600
 forklift said device known as warning sightings 180 degrees 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.190
 extends the functions of a forklift allowing you to operate in spaces 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.820
 reduced 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.730
 Space saving allows companies to store more materials per 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.010
 square meter reducing rent and operation chunks 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.490
 etc 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 important notice incorporate a joystick to control the movement of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.920
 the tortillas allowing them to precise 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.150
 they were wrong up to 180 degrees that particularity allows the spaces 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.750
 that are regularly used for the operation of forklifts 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 reduce from three points 8 meters to some points or meters 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.770
 spaces that can now be used to store materials and 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.610
 products we exemplify how the attachment can pay itself in 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.410
 a few months if we have a plant of 50 meters by 50 meters that is to say 2 thousand 500 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.570
 square meter 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.250
 where the average rent is 50 cents per square foot if 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.540
 we convert piece meters a meter equals the next the mind to 10 feet 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.910
 that means we pay $ 5 for each meter 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.389
 p 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:21.279
 and if the households we converted to those taking as exchange rate 13 pesos per 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.449
 dollar we pay 65 pesos per meter 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:28.909
 considering that we have a task of 2500 square meters the income of 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.439
 our plant the c if I enter 62 thousand 500 pesos if we take into account that the use of 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:40.559
 the opinion all 180 degrees saves 40% in space we save up to 65 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:45.829
 thousand pesos a month that means that the attachment is paid in a shorter time 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.219
 to four months in the same way invest in the forklift with the 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.709
 Aditamento is recovered in a period of 8 to 9 months 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.129
 the 180 degree attachment has been developed with a very clear idea the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.180
 Efficient use of space and reduce operating costs of companies
