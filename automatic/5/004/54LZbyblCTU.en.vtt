00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.490 
purple EBA he's got the Spiker he's a
rare<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.870> he's<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.080> second<00:03:22.680> rare<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> set

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
rare so he's a second rare of the set

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.840 
rare so he's a second rare of the set
and<00:03:25.500> let's<00:03:25.710> get<00:03:25.890> his<00:03:26.070> number<00:03:27.800> he<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:29.040> number<00:03:29.340> 23

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
and let's get his number he is number 23

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.730 
and let's get his number he is number 23
so<00:03:32.850> Cortana<00:03:33.570> is<00:03:33.750> somewhere<00:03:34.080> falls<00:03:34.470> in

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
so Cortana is somewhere falls in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.120 
so Cortana is somewhere falls in
in-between<00:03:35.340> probably<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.990> know<00:03:37.110> maybe<00:03:37.350> 24

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
in-between probably you know maybe 24

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.860 
in-between probably you know maybe 24
I'm<00:03:38.370> thinking<00:03:38.820> or<00:03:40.190> 19<00:03:41.190> or<00:03:41.520> 20<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.630> could<00:03:42.750> be

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
I'm thinking or 19 or 20 so you could be

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.130 
I'm thinking or 19 or 20 so you could be
in<00:03:42.960> the<00:03:43.050> middle<00:03:44.480> but<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.690> know<00:03:45.810> all<00:03:45.990> these

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
in the middle but if you know all these

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.770 
in the middle but if you know all these
numbers<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> mean<00:03:47.030> then<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.390> just<00:03:48.570> need<00:03:48.720> to

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
numbers I mean then you just need to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.180 
numbers I mean then you just need to
find<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.080> one<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.410> don't<00:03:49.620> have<00:03:49.890> right

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
find the one that you don't have right

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.880 
find the one that you don't have right
and<00:03:50.520> that's<00:03:50.700> her<00:03:54.050> let's<00:03:55.050> take<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> look<00:03:55.710> at<00:03:55.800> the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
and that's her let's take a look at the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.210 
and that's her let's take a look at the
numbers<00:03:56.250> again

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.180
