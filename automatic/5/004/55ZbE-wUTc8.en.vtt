which<00:01:02.519> you<00:01:02.789> should<00:01:03.000> never<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
which you should never do it's a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.910 
which you should never do it's a
terrible<00:01:04.410> idea<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.470> think<00:01:07.470> it'd<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.680> kind

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
terrible idea but I think it'd be kind

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.520 
terrible idea but I think it'd be kind
of<00:01:07.950> fun<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.940> what<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.180> happen<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.780> either<00:01:10.170> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
of fun so what will happen is either it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
of fun so what will happen is either it
will<00:01:10.680> clear<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.490> barrel<00:01:11.940> it'll<00:01:12.540> knock<00:01:12.690> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
will clear this barrel it'll knock that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.270 
will clear this barrel it'll knock that
bullet<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.230> out<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.410> there<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.710> give<00:01:14.130> me<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
it's about as far as I can get it it
