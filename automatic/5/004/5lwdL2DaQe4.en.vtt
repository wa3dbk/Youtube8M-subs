00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.309
 from this time with you and see 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.860
 what nice things after susceptible 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.299
 active to our new partner 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.029
 welcome if we love everything 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.039
 you brought good let's start let's go 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.050
 leaving with the mold as always is not 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.730
 no base mold that you have at home if 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.160
 you do not have a base mold of a 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.710
 T-shirt that remains that we made years ago 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.450
 last or a good shirt I'm going to 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.030
 move on to give the stockings so quickie 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.699
 if they take pencil and paper and we're going to do 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.010
 this mold together and we are going from a 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.640
 60-centimeter long rectangle 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.350
 by 20 centimeters wide it is a waist 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.050
 but if that is the way you saw 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.760
 it is well adjusted good it also depends 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.210
 the material that you use for 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.379
 perform it then 60 long by 20 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.469
 Wide 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.899
 you see we knit fabric lines 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.429
 that this means that the double always 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.499
 to dot lines means before the 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.499
 double let's start with the back 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:02.420
 we have a neckline of 8 centimeters 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.000
 width with a two centimeter finish 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.100
 and means you see that we have little 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.790
 shoulders only seven inches from 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.580
 shoulders 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.640
 with a drop of two centimeters now 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.460
 how do we make the appointment from the point 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.220
 higher to the rectangle if we go down 18 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.020
 centimeters of if you see that a 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.900
 little bit of advantage and that gives you this 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.690
 so beautiful way in the lowered so much to 12 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.270
 centimeters let's burst just one 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.050
 centimeter and a half and then we join with 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.550
 a curve to the rectangle is very easy since 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.440
 we have our backs regarding the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.180
 front is exactly the same because 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.190
 We are working knit fabrics 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.250
 so what are we going to do so 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.430
 just dig the front neck 12 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.320
 centimeters just that we finished neckline 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.200
 forward but you remember that it is 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.390
 what we were doing here so that we stayed 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.190
 a neckline as I always say that they are not 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.960
 a closure that is more beautiful to the neckline 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.300
 in v and then we have to be 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.600
 you are going to throw the line straight and in 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.250
 half of this straight line go to the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.050
 we have to make a curvita of a 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.840
 centimeter then we go out a 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.930
 centimeter and there we form the slight curve 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.870
 and we already have back and front that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.849
 is what we would lack the hood 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.200
 then in the hood we go from 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:24.590
 a rectangle 38 centimeters high 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.629
 by 24 centimeters wide for where 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.670
 the curve the hood bottom that is what 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.349
 that we are going to be going to enter 10 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.840
 centimeters to one side of 10 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.780
 centimeters towards the other achieving thus 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.670
 the curve of the hood bottom now 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.160
 we have to get into it because we 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.810
 this has to have the ability to 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.880
 the necklines both on the back and 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.160
 front then let's go into the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.190
 hood bottom two and a half centimeters 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.040
 and with a height of 7 centimeters 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.870
 You tell me how we form the east 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.730
 this is very simple because they are going to 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.910
 are going to throw a straight line from 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.790
 this point and get warm from the bottom of 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.790
 hood and they are going to draw it this going up 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.079
 and going down one centimeter just this 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.690
 remember 38 long by 24 wide 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.519
 ladies and they copied any doubt that 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.500
 have been left this can be requested in the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.340
 next good now we're going to start 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.620
 with the armed of reality 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.959
 come on let's work or we're 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.900
 working with a cotton jersey with 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.269
 enough body you can fix and 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.940
 can notice well this does have 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.500
 body and has quite a bounce is very 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.250
 cute extra cloth because the fundamental 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.080
 it's super super soft good we have 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.000
 front back as we begin 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.590
 joining these pieces by the shoulders 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.900
 facing the rights of fabrics 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.299
 as I always tell them we have to 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.390
 place the reinforcement activity which 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.250
 is 2 centimeters and they are always 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.220
 they will listen well we should always cut 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.780
 the thread yes because it's because it says so 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.360
 It is the reinforcement activity that is 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.459
 reinforcing the shoulder of the shirt because 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.980
 that's where he's going to take all the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.620
 weight of it once we work 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.260
 so let's do let's go to the hood 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.099
 let's cut the bottom of the hood 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.090
 we join the pieces by the fund and by 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.349
 course I only did in a tone in 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.510
 contrast but you are going to work 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.220
 with high threads 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.459
 we have to set free and you 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.800
 can notice here 2 centimeters 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.560
 front of hood remember this because 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.410
 over there we're going to start placing the 10 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.289
 around the outline once we have 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.800
 this way we're going to sew this hood 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.979
 cleaving rights to the neckline but 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.410
 let's place the leader union when the 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.889
 hood in the middle of the neckline of 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.129
 back and let's start sewing from 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.800
 this center sideways 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.899
 then now with patience our 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.149
 will this be obviously in the machine 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:56.639
 costar we do it super super fast 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:05:00.779
 but they have to take into account is 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:03.119
 not to stretch and cost are 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:06.149
 working with knit fabrics then 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:08.999
 It is advisable to use the machine 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:11.369
 overlok but if you do not have or a 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:14.039
 dress inah or a friend who can 

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:16.229
 lend and then they will try to 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.199
 replace this point with your machine 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.319
 sewing can be a zigzag quietly 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.360
 or some elastic point that has its 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.120
 brand 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.610
 once we sew to one side and 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.580
 towards the other 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:36.080
 you are going to finish it we go to the 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.150
 placement of 10 how are we going to work 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.430
 the 10 I'm going to put the right so what 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.340
 you can notice it 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.850
 in straws short strips of 4 centimeters 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.480
 high by the width of the fabric of 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.480
 way 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.970
 I'm going to use the yellow here 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.330
 I had a Marist and you can see 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.150
 four high and the width of the fabric 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.979
 because because it comes 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.690
 once they cut the strip like this this is 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.449
 the width of the ctera 3d on the roll 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.729
 that he achieved once we have thus all 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:12.970
 the strip we're going to start sewing like me 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.639
 I told them from the opening that we left 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.250
 and those centimeters free books that 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.259
 we are in the front of hood 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.199
 placing right of the strip on the 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:27.490
 back of the hood and there we go to 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.969
 start sewing if with the likes or with 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.259
 not see it 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:36.829
 once stretching slightly and 10 but 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:39.289
 slightly tim once we know well 

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:42.229
 that we are going to make understand how we 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:45.799
 is neat on the back and now we go 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:48.499
 to fold and placing what we knew 

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:50.209
 in the aunt we go again 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.789
 because this is important what 

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:54.889
 we met inside the strip 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.919
 so now let's double this to the 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:01.039
 half and there we support and cost have 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:03.229
 thus achieving all day the 10 what 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.989
 we do in the outline I say again 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:08.389
 of the hood front if we go through the 

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:10.669
 neckline if your front and we finish in 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.769
 the front of the hood with the same 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.610
 system of 10 which is what we're going to 

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:19.549
 do let's work the lists 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.349
 you can give 2 come out I have it and 

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:23.419
 we will be this way with the 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:26.119
 same system of 10 this is very easy to 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:28.459
 do here we already have the two colitas 

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:30.379
 idleb and this is what we're going to do 

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:33.339
 we are always sitting on the rights 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:33.339
 with a seam 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.030
 this is simple finally which is what 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.670
 what are we going to do, let's close this 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.070
 shirt on the sides facing the 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.530
 rights of the fabrics you know how 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.990
 this is neat if we give it a good 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.060
 determination we close the sides and 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.610
 let's do the hem two 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.580
 centimeters just that and we already have 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.410
 a remerita and to place us later 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.090
 we put the tealight up we take out 

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.580
 the hood and we were super super 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.930
 modern good ladies I'm going to leave them 

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.100
 with the annalynne girls because they have 

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.100
 so much to show us
