performance which is amazing i mean i

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
performance which is amazing i mean i
have<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> front<00:01:05.220> facing<00:01:05.280> camera<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.180> VJ

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
have a front facing camera which we VJ

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.719 
have a front facing camera which we VJ
quality<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.590> back<00:01:07.770> facing<00:01:08.159> camera<00:01:08.549> which

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
quality of a back facing camera which

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.500 
quality of a back facing camera which
would<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.939> 720p<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.020> 5<00:01:10.619> megapixels<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:12.330> will<00:01:12.420> be

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
would be 720p or 5 megapixels it will be

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
would be 720p or 5 megapixels it will be
thirty-three<00:01:13.260> percent<00:01:13.380> thinner<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.490> eight

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
thirty-three percent thinner so be eight

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.090 
thirty-three percent thinner so be eight
point<00:01:15.060> eight<00:01:15.180> millimeters<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.979> can

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
point eight millimeters and so you can

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.190 
point eight millimeters and so you can
