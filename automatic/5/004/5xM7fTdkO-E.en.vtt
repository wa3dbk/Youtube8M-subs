00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
good experience we we don't typically

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.710 
good experience we we don't typically
fuse<00:00:28.800> our<00:00:28.980> moves<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:29.579> soccer<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.630> was

definitely a new a new element to add

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.430 
definitely a new a new element to add
into<00:00:32.699> what<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.879> do<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> lot<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> fun

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
into what we do but it was a lot of fun

also we were doing lot of stuff on
rooftops<00:00:36.629> and<00:00:36.809> stuff<00:00:37.019> which<00:00:37.290> which<00:00:37.739> made<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
rooftops and stuff which which made it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.500 
rooftops and stuff which which made it
really<00:00:38.040> interesting<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.850> well<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.210> don't

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
really interesting as well we don't

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.220 
really interesting as well we don't
usually<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:40.379> our<00:00:40.500> acrobatics<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.159> on<00:00:41.400> rooftops

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.410 

we're<00:00:44.470> pretty<00:00:44.649> used<00:00:44.950> to<00:00:45.130> the<00:00:45.880> arts<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.390> the

we're pretty used to the arts and the

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.299 
we're pretty used to the arts and the
disciplines<00:00:46.930> we<00:00:47.079> do<00:00:47.260> like<00:00:47.530> tricking<00:00:48.160> and

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
disciplines we do like tricking and

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.340 
disciplines we do like tricking and
extreme<00:00:48.610> martial<00:00:48.790> arts<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.210> parkour<00:00:49.350> but

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
extreme martial arts and parkour but

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.069 
extreme martial arts and parkour but
throwing<00:00:50.920> in<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.220> soccer<00:00:51.460> ball<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.960> know

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
throwing in a soccer ball and you know

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.500 
throwing in a soccer ball and you know
taking<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.890> streets<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.640> a<00:00:54.699> lot

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
taking it to the streets is a lot

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.030 
taking it to the streets is a lot
different<00:00:55.720> but<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.230> have<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.559> say<00:00:56.590> it<00:00:56.800> was<00:00:56.829> one

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
different but I have to say it was one

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.010 
different but I have to say it was one
of<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.520> coolest<00:00:58.059> things<00:00:58.900> I've<00:00:59.079> done

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
of the coolest things I've done

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.530 
of the coolest things I've done
working<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.830> the<00:01:01.950> mexican<00:01:02.430> squad<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:03.000> was

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
working with the mexican squad was was

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.600 
working with the mexican squad was was
really<00:01:03.840> cool<00:01:04.020> because<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> lot

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
really cool because they have a lot

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
really cool because they have a lot
better<00:01:05.820> ball<00:01:06.390> handling<00:01:06.690> skills<00:01:06.840> than<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.470> have

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
better ball handling skills than we have

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.830 
better ball handling skills than we have
so<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.610> were<00:01:08.670> able<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.030> teach<00:01:09.360> us<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so they were able to teach us how to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
so they were able to teach us how to
control<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> ball<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.040> how<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> direct<00:01:11.730> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
control the ball and how to direct the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.460 
control the ball and how to direct the
ball<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> direction<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.900> wanted<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.200> go

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
ball in the direction we wanted to go

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
ball in the direction we wanted to go
because<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.250> found<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.820> had<00:01:14.910> no<00:01:15.090> problem

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because we found like we had no problem

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480 
because we found like we had no problem
making<00:01:16.170> contact<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.010> ball<00:01:17.100> after

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
making contact with the ball after

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.400 
making contact with the ball after
executing<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.420> trick<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.870> an<00:01:18.930> acrobatic

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
executing a trick or an acrobatic

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.200 
executing a trick or an acrobatic
movement<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.400> biggest<00:01:20.580> problem<00:01:20.820> was

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
movement the biggest problem was

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
movement the biggest problem was
directing<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> straight<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.250> next

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
directing it straight at the next

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
directing it straight at the next
person's<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.360> could<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.630> their<00:01:24.780> trick

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
person's that they could do their trick

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 
person's that they could do their trick
and<00:01:25.290> kick<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.400> were<00:01:26.490> able<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.850> teach

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and kick it so they were able to teach

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.270 
and kick it so they were able to teach
us<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> know<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.780> position<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.470> our<00:01:28.650> footing

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
us you know the position of our footing

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.890 
us you know the position of our footing
and<00:01:29.400> whatnot<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.240> could<00:01:30.390> direct<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and whatnot so that we could direct it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.930 
and whatnot so that we could direct it
where<00:01:31.050> we<00:01:31.170> wanted<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.590> well<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.760> case

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
where we wanted to go well in this case

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.609 
where we wanted to go well in this case
here<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.330> had<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.600> strike<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> ball<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.530> way

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
here we had to strike a ball that way

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
here we had to strike a ball that way
that<00:01:34.800> was<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> key<00:01:35.460> component<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.450> were

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that was the key component that we were

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.050 
that was the key component that we were
focusing<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.890> basically<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.820> were<00:01:38.880> just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
focusing on so basically we were just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.730 
focusing on so basically we were just
trying<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.360> add<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.690> many<00:01:39.840> flips<00:01:40.229> or<00:01:40.440> twist

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
trying to add as many flips or twist

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.070 
trying to add as many flips or twist
while<00:01:41.430> striking<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> ball<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
while striking the ball the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.510 
while striking the ball the
transformation<00:01:43.530> was<00:01:43.979> quite<00:01:44.340> relevant

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
transformation was quite relevant

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.430 
transformation was quite relevant
because<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.240> martial<00:01:45.600> arts<00:01:45.780> were<00:01:45.930> used<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
because we do martial arts were used to

some moves I have seen the game that we

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.080 
some moves I have seen the game that we
did<00:04:33.259> do<00:04:33.470> in<00:04:33.650> real<00:04:33.800> was<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.610> one<00:04:34.910> where<00:04:35.060> we

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
did do in real was the one where we

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.240 
did do in real was the one where we
kicked<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:35.930> ball<00:04:36.080> off<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.410> wall<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:36.860> then<00:04:37.100> we

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
kicked the ball off the wall and then we

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.340 
kicked the ball off the wall and then we
flip<00:04:37.520> over<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:37.880> opponent<00:04:38.389> I<00:04:38.479> noticed<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.229> it

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
flip over the opponent I noticed that it
