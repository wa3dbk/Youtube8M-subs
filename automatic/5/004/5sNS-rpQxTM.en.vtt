00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
is at room temperature because it beats

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.109 
is at room temperature because it beats
so<00:01:57.679> much<00:01:57.920> better<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.429> you<00:01:58.490> end<00:01:58.639> up<00:01:58.759> with<00:01:58.909> no

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
so much better and you end up with no

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.609 
so much better and you end up with no
lumps<00:01:59.479> so<00:01:59.869> this<00:01:59.990> we're<00:02:00.170> going<00:02:00.319> to<00:02:00.380> add<00:02:00.439> in<00:02:00.560> our
