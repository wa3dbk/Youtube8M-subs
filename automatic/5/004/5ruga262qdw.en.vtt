00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 hi scum are the most chosen ones 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.360
 breaking italy and yesterday you have not seen the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.009
 my face unless you have 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 watched at least the episode of let's talk about it 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.910
 because the only thing I put online 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.189
 and then you lost even if not for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.359
 your fault my very long one 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.699
 rumination on the new apple phones 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.710
 how the iPhone 5 there were different 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 from the iphone 5 be all you would have 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.980
 quarreled as everyone has done up 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 internet between yesterday and yesterday is also a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.130
 little today because this moment does not 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.200
 you argue more for what the band is 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.210
 favorite is the best music from 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.649
 listen to the best rock star but yes 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.840
 quarrels about the product a 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 better industrial production is if there 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 actually think about how they come 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.360
 made product presentations 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.770
 technology and companies are becomes 39 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.600
 rockstar i don't know if you saw tim cook 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.420
 get on stage and do you are edges 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 you are hot and all six here is a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.070
 750 euros phone and all 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.350
 apparently they were happy and this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 obviously leads to a serious problem that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.129
 is that of the disposal of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.140
 technology because all this stuff doesn't 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.820
 it is obviously made to last and is not 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 made to last for various reasons not 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.750
 only the components inside or for 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.490
 the constant use that varies so go 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.110
 always smaller but also because we are 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 constantly looking for a new one 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.100
 design a new feature think of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.750
 how angry you get when apple or 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.640
 anyone else brings out a phone and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.490
 it doesn't have enough ends that is we have 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.320
 need of pictures is obviously everything 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.939
 this turns into garbage and this one 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.619
 is the vision that would have pushed a 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.689
 young designer to launch a campaign 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.790
 of awareness for then 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.439
 hypothetically I imagine gathering gods 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.360
 funds is to create a new phone 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.490
 conception now I am flattered by how many 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.619
 of you, they tweeted written to me via e 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 mail written via facebook this stuff is 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.920
 we obviously still love each other and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.320
 you know how much I like this guy 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 of things therefore it is hateful that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.520
 I'll have to demolish this product 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.869
 which is called phone blocks and is explained 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 in a video that as usual I leave you 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.979
 in description is the video is very nice 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.780
 very attractive the idea is also good 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.219
 under an ecological aspect because the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.040
 The boy's reasoning is why not 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.240
 create a modular phone in the sense 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.430
 I did in fact modules 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.079
 blocks that can be moved up 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.729
 a base so that when the phone 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.410
 becomes a little slower you change the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.090
 processor or if you want a camera 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.360
 bigger you don't have to throw all the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.220
 phone you buy another 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.600
 room and if the display is damaged, change 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.390
 the display and you don't have to change phone 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.980
 and of course everyone has gone mad 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.930
 for this thing the video on youtube has 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.120
 reached in a few hours and then what like 3 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.650
 millions of views and they are all 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.880
 ready to support a 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.290
 this guy anyone would want a 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.820
 phone of this type, I also sin 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.190
 that apparently can't work 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.600
 at least according to more or less all the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.340
 engineers I saw leave a 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.420
 comment on the project why 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.920
 it can't work because 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.450
 tend to be the functioning of 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.459
 this phone then sees a technology 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.560
 that does not exist because the base is that 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.630
 of a real desktop computer there is a card 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.520
 mother on whom things are attached 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.170
 but a motherboard is not a base on 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.090
 which you can paste things at random 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.530
 above but there are components of these 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.300
 components must be inserted in the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.010
 slots and I don't just talk about 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.110
 here goes the ram where the processor goes 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.300
 but here we go this this 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.100
 processor but not the one or this one 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.450
 rara mÃ©tropole chi sa is not supported 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.670
 from this motherboard is one thing 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.770
 it often happens like never two reasons 1 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.900
 compatibility the boy fact that yes 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.520
 Dave Atkins would like to mobilize 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.440
 all companies that build 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.030
 phones and tell them instead of doing 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.830
 phone because you don't make the pieces e 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.209
 therefore he will not be able to take a piece from 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.799
 one part one piece from the other then 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.900
 avola camera apple however the 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.370
 samsung processor and sony touchpad but 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.959
 does not work so the hardware must 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.880
 being compatible is for what 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.260
 many people continue to faint on 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.700
 fact that apple products have a 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.440
 more than computers 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.420
 normal because both the hardware and the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.709
 software are made by apple then 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.630
 everything inside the computer is 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.130
 compatible in a computer instead 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.049
 so there are many more possibilities 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.489
 creating conflicts is very simple and 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.560
 this in a motherboard that anyway 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.150
 has standard housings and is not 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.160
 a piece of gruyere cheese pierced in 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.230
 which then insignia said gliele chips like 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.970
 tv there would be some other problem 1 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.410
 there is no real economic interest in the 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.750
 do it not just because companies 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.280
 they want to make a lot of money then it is 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.170
 true company agrees much more 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.640
 continue to produce phones instead 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.440
 that produce the single piece from 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.030
 change and also obvious because it is good 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.519
 part of the market itself does not want 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.350
 this thing wants a new design wants 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.239
 a miniaturization and this phone 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.250
 it couldn't be like this 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.810
 much bigger part of the process 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.489
 miniaturization is a process that 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.930
 we could define artistic that is where 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.489
 I put this piece in this piece 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.169
 He moved here the battery the exposed side 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.430
 so we can get smaller and the 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.680
 work that engineers and designers 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.360
 they have always been together otherwise if 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.030
 were it so simple we will have of weiss that 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.260
 they are dead 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.970
 all much smaller than those 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.920
 we normally use google plus ad 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.170
 example would not have this giant thing 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.540
 behind that houses the dr ever hypothesized 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.220
 that all these things are not a 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.080
 problem there is also the problem of 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.820
 speed if the hardware is not delivered 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.380
 well therefore it is not delivered stuck 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.450
 a computer for example can know where 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.250
 and where is the ram and where all the 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.550
 in other words, if the circuit is not done 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.680
 well the computer is slow and nobody wants 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.270
 a slow phone consequently 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.310
 I think this stuff is bullshit 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.110
 very nice the market never goes 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.669
 vast what is beautiful what is right 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.560
 for example, respect for the environment goes 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.300
 always on what is possible what 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.980
 however scum is good for me 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.660
 know what you think maybe I'm wrong 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.760
 you are completely engineers and 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.380
 can you explain how blunt works here 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.850
 in the comments or you are not you would like 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.050
 know if you would like this thing 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.610
 have it or not 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.169
 or you can simply crush 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.850
 on this notation is to see some 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.500
 another video I made today I am 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.500
