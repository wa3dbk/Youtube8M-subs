00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
that when you train okay your body can

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.090 
that when you train okay your body can
only<00:01:29.380> live<00:01:29.770> there<00:01:30.039> so<00:01:30.759> much<00:01:31.030> Chi<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.770> if<00:01:33.009> you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
only live there so much Chi so if you

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.050 
only live there so much Chi so if you
train<00:01:33.369> for<00:01:33.399> an<00:01:33.700> hour

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
train for an hour

train for an hour
your<00:01:34.689> body<00:01:34.929> can<00:01:35.229> only<00:01:35.319> absorb<00:01:35.499> so<00:01:35.979> much<00:01:36.249> Chi

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:36.639 
your body can only absorb so much Chi

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:40.319 
your body can only absorb so much Chi
and<00:01:36.939> as<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.950> continue<00:01:39.219> to<00:01:39.609> train<00:01:39.850> your<00:01:40.090> body

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
and as you continue to train your body

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.019 
and as you continue to train your body
will<00:01:40.539> absorb<00:01:40.840> more<00:01:41.109> and<00:01:41.499> more<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:42.759> more

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
will absorb more and more and more

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:45.899 
will absorb more and more and more
cheating<00:01:43.450> but<00:01:44.049> as<00:01:44.200> time<00:01:44.499> progresses<00:01:45.039> you<00:01:45.880> will

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
cheating but as time progresses you will

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.300 
cheating but as time progresses you will
expand<00:01:46.539> but<00:01:46.869> when<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.049> first<00:01:47.259> start<00:01:47.649> you<00:01:48.219> know

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
expand but when you first start you know

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.010 
expand but when you first start you know
you're<00:01:48.609> a<00:01:48.639> vessel<00:01:48.939> that<00:01:49.240> can<00:01:49.420> only<00:01:49.569> be<00:01:49.659> filled

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
you're a vessel that can only be filled

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.349 
you're a vessel that can only be filled
so<00:01:50.200> much<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:51.369> happens<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:51.969> extra

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
so much what happens to that extra

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.660 
so much what happens to that extra
energy<00:01:52.509> that<00:01:52.749> you<00:01:53.049> you<00:01:53.829> you're<00:01:54.490> running

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
energy that you you you're running

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.370 
energy that you you you're running
through<00:01:54.939> your<00:01:55.029> body<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.509> kind<00:01:55.719> of<00:01:55.810> spills<00:01:56.139> over

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
through your body it kind of spills over

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.029 
through your body it kind of spills over
okay<00:01:57.249> it<00:01:57.729> kind<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:57.999> leaks<00:01:58.240> off<00:01:58.450> into<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.039> the

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
okay it kind of leaks off into the the

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.429 
okay it kind of leaks off into the the
energy<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.670> your<00:02:00.969> atmosphere<00:02:01.630> okay

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
energy in your atmosphere okay

this key stick can be used to store that
energy<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:07.090> then<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:07.779> energy<00:02:07.929> can<00:02:08.320> be<00:02:08.440> used

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
energy and then that energy can be used

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.540 
energy and then that energy can be used
at<00:02:08.979> another<00:02:09.250> time<00:02:09.520> which<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.210> beautiful

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
at another time which is beautiful

okay
so<00:03:31.770> whatever<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.190> can<00:03:32.340> think<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.600> can<00:03:33.630> do

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
so whatever you can think of you can do

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.600 
so whatever you can think of you can do
with<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.530> ruler<00:03:34.950> okay

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
with this ruler okay

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.160 
with this ruler okay
and<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.150> don't<00:03:36.300> understand<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.930> look<00:03:37.080> good

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
and if you don't understand to look good

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.470 
and if you don't understand to look good
as<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.590> train<00:03:37.890> with<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.670> stronger<00:03:39.209> it's

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
as you train with it it's stronger it's

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.630 
as you train with it it's stronger it's
going<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.840> grit<00:03:40.100> when<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.190> first<00:03:41.400> get<00:03:41.580> your

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
going to grit when you first get your

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.270 
going to grit when you first get your
ruler<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.270> it's<00:03:42.420> going<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.690> probably<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.290> or

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
ruler if it's going to probably be or

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.740 
ruler if it's going to probably be or
your<00:03:44.520> your<00:03:44.790> chin<00:03:45.090> when<00:03:45.240> you<00:03:45.330> first<00:03:45.540> get<00:03:45.690> your

your your chin when you first get your

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.020 
your your chin when you first get your
cheese<00:03:46.080> stick<00:03:46.350> it's<00:03:47.010> going<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.340> be<00:03:47.490> a<00:03:47.520> certain

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
cheese stick it's going to be a certain

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.430 
cheese stick it's going to be a certain
weight<00:03:48.209> but<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.570> more<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.840> train<00:03:49.110> with<00:03:49.290> it

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
weight but the more you train with it

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.880 
weight but the more you train with it
you'll<00:03:49.590> actually<00:03:49.770> feel<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:51.600> split<00:03:52.470> get

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
you'll actually feel the split get

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.610 
you'll actually feel the split get
heavier<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.760> it'll<00:03:54.630> get<00:03:54.750> heavier<00:03:55.170> with<00:03:55.440> your

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
heavier and it'll get heavier with your

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.380 
heavier and it'll get heavier with your
energy<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.310> when<00:03:56.490> you<00:03:56.580> touch<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.970> you'll<00:03:57.150> feel

can train with this stick and and and
when<00:05:32.139> you<00:05:32.259> train<00:05:32.529> with<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.039> you<00:05:33.159> pull

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
when you train with it and you pull

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.879 
when you train with it and you pull
energy<00:05:33.879> up<00:05:34.060> aside<00:05:34.870> from<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.409> train<00:05:35.740> that

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
energy up aside from the train that

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:36.930 
energy up aside from the train that
you're<00:05:36.009> going<00:05:36.219> to<00:05:36.279> get<00:05:36.520> you're<00:05:36.759> going<00:05:36.879> to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
you're going to get you're going to

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.240 
you're going to get you're going to
learn<00:05:37.150> how<00:05:37.479> to<00:05:40.080> allow<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.139> energy<00:05:41.620> that

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
learn how to allow the energy that

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.180 
learn how to allow the energy that
you're<00:05:42.400> cultivating<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.960> also<00:05:44.409> be<00:05:44.589> cultivated

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
you're cultivating to also be cultivated

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.689 
you're cultivating to also be cultivated
in<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.430> stick<00:05:45.669> as<00:05:45.819> well<00:05:46.770> okay<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:47.979> that

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
in the stick as well okay and that

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.600 
in the stick as well okay and that
builds<00:05:48.969> a<00:05:49.029> strong<00:05:49.389> empathic<00:05:50.229> ability<00:05:50.710> that

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
builds a strong empathic ability that
