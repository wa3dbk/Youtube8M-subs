 construction of the guest station 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.000
 expected 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.310
 think so 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.310
 expert ra 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.050
 after a hot topic and the format of the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.610
 he could selection after work 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.580
 but in tournaments 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.070
 here is the tournament 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.200
 in five years 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.590
 however guard court 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 that is, when something for yourself aut 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.160
 x 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.090
 this file as a criterion and so i want 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480
 ask a question 3 august transmits 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.950
 interfax 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.820
 all our teams he said 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.320
 But the return of these 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.549
 fans the city itself is planned tomorrow 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.759
 and why Rome this team attracts 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.860
 maybe it's in this person 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.310
 it would be good that it started even earlier 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.480
 atomic somewhere and even if the border 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.050
 even earlier long before this correspondent 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.770
 what is on the radio 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.080
 recall there 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.270
 aek why will be arranged 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.360
 because most likely the atmosphere and 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 badly 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.570
 what is in the team what 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.400
 on tuesday m easier square 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.580
 equally 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.490
 because they do say in a group 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.000
 let's place us going on 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.800
 refueling write strictly on conversation 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.500
 and this is almost 100 embassy 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.320
 physically and half an hour one answer 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.499
 one compartment another 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.889
 that's all pretty good 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.839
 so wanted to show very well spent 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.520
 about 5 kg 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.970

 which all fans can sleep say 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.069
 meet but now i'm talking 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.239
 to output 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.980
 although there is each other's housing this wonderful 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 but that they are heroes of PR 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.669
 Alexey Mustache send this question 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.809
 she is 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:43.109
 the given office department bow 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.349
 optimal 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.249
 Attention 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.199
 and perfect can't say 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.779
 true consequence 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.899
 dial for some achievement yes then 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.589
 there is a command percent as party as 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.489
 eSports she is known 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.599
 the percentage is on tournaments for some 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.919
 sports car competitions 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.259
 I think we won the trial from him. 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.299
 not often enough children on all sorts of 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.299
 tournaments that is guys not herself 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.599
 future owner 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.059
 to play 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.109
 production activities 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.699
 fans are experiencing 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.539
 many say that it will be necessary to act 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.319
 they will show all the best composition of Russia 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.419
 losing to live in this case 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.319
 follows from the record how many we have 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.669
 But how much was 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.589
 fans speaking today on their 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.169
 site and in print 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.289
 What can I say regrettably if the bridge 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:36.869
 Boris Simonov 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.869
 on our own we are proud 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:42.919

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.289
 and tell me how I am 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:46.850
 in our group in contact 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.850
 however note in half 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.059
 how to solve together such a format 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.840
 the message that 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.850
 true while it will be a duel in plus 4 3 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.799
 festival with other groups let's say 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.409
 ice savings 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.150
 oil industry markets are closed due to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.199
 reports that notaries tournaments 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.009
 times 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.909
 percentage of knowing not remember communication with 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:14.869
 to tell 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:17.039
 thus support the team 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.469
 only that is impossible and we can communicate with 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.309
 faces of months of ambition 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:23.729
 the situation is 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.960
 we could all together so here today 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.150
 gathered what will be the first time in 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.339
 on the Internet, we know well a bary

 can say that 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.819
 everyone should not wait 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.819
 but maximum 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.590
 make it out of the championship because of 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.520
