seismics<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.579> more<00:02:00.360> efficiently

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
seismics is now I can more efficiently

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.590 
seismics is now I can more efficiently
do<00:02:01.649> Virago<00:02:02.340> rolls<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.299> really

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
of it but I do want to continue it maybe

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.460 
of it but I do want to continue it maybe
more<00:02:08.099> make<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:08.729> money<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.989> maybe<00:02:10.110> try

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
more make more money so I can maybe try

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.230 
more make more money so I can maybe try
basing<00:02:11.129> more<00:02:11.340> with

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
basing more with

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.640 
basing more with
sighs<00:02:12.540> mix<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.080> doesn't<00:02:13.350> really<00:02:13.440> make<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
sighs mix it doesn't really make a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.560 
sighs mix it doesn't really make a
difference<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.190> how<00:02:14.310> bad<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.670> am<00:02:14.820> at<00:02:14.850> basing<00:02:15.450> at

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
difference for how bad I am at basing at

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.840 
difference for how bad I am at basing at
this<00:02:15.720> point<00:02:15.960> but<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:17.280> still<00:02:17.430> cool<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.700> have

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
this point but it's still cool to have

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.030 
this point but it's still cool to have
and<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.330> well<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.230> might<00:02:19.500> help<00:02:19.650> me<00:02:19.800> do

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
and as well on this might help me do

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
I'm gonna be doing with these seismics

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430 
I'm gonna be doing with these seismics
and<00:02:38.700> before<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.480> also<00:02:39.780> wanted<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> say

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
that now that I have seismics pretty

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.180 
that now that I have seismics pretty
much<00:02:42.420> all<00:02:42.600> my<00:02:42.810> weapon<00:02:43.170> goals<00:02:43.380> are<00:02:43.620> done<00:02:43.920> I

really don't need anything better than
drag<00:02:46.290> oars<00:02:46.560> obviously<00:02:47.330> ascensions<00:02:48.330> are<00:02:48.450> fine

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
drag oars obviously ascensions are fine

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.110 
drag oars obviously ascensions are fine
by<00:02:48.840> me<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.830> got<00:02:49.950> seismic<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.580> really<00:02:50.940> all<00:02:51.090> I

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
by me and I got seismic so really all I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.990 
by me and I got seismic so really all I
need<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:52.020> maybe<00:02:52.770> buy<00:02:53.100> an<00:02:53.220> ox<00:02:53.490> longbow

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
need now is maybe buy an ox longbow

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.750 
need now is maybe buy an ox longbow
because<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.260> pretty<00:02:55.530> decent<00:02:55.770> at<00:02:56.100> KK<00:02:56.490> but

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
because that is pretty decent at KK but

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.550 
because that is pretty decent at KK but
for<00:02:57.360> now<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.480> think<00:02:57.810> I'm<00:02:57.900> good<00:02:58.050> on<00:02:58.170> all<00:02:58.320> weapons

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
for now I think I'm good on all weapons

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.160 
for now I think I'm good on all weapons
now<00:02:59.490> I<00:02:59.520> can<00:02:59.730> maybe<00:02:59.880> start<00:03:00.300> saving<00:03:00.720> up<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:01.080> like

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
now I can maybe start saving up for like

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.840 
now I can maybe start saving up for like

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
a green party hat that's like my end

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.240 
a green party hat that's like my end
goal<00:03:03.120> item<00:03:03.630> because<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.500> goes<00:03:04.620> well<00:03:04.890> with<00:03:05.100> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
goal item because it goes well with the
