00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.770
 jonas ivens enthusiastic v looked at scoreboard because it is a bit 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.970
 incredible 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.150
 yes very beautiful of course 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.889
 if you can win in the four, they say 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.789
 speak to the imagination 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.179
 it is really there 4 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.509
 I also went twice with the churches 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:23.500
 employee banking he has nice and 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.949
 but then monday i'm what 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.399
 the grows and 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.589
 the wrong 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.710
 we made the difference comparing the comparison with the other eu 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.010
 nadal monday the woman was very annoying being a rider 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.990
 a shorter ww that points 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.210
 kooijman 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.290
 that he creates effect can ven that is good if you watch the game there now too 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.180
 played again today both defensively and offensively yes then 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.680
 it is almost nevertheless a normal result downwards we might have had more 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.250
 you might be a little crazy 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.370
 well it must be so we think we should look especially hey that is the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.590
 carrying out all those things that we always mention 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.840
 they must have been nice today 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.980
 very early on the heerenveen, especially on the build-up players 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.980
 not being very good, that worked out well 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.090
 that everyone in our sport is aware at home that they try it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.079
 off too 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.999
 We did not want it to be a tidy thing about sharp enough to be 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:20.330
 fixed days 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.740
 We have also taken the risk through and through it still being an attack 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.430
 midfielder released 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.710
 but that worked out very well and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.340
 yes the most important thing is actually it actually started already 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.670
 match in utrecht that v in possession of the ball and that the texan our try to be busy 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.750
 that they really start playing football 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.860
 also people who play midfield and don't just play to the long ball 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.270
 use and in the ad today especially the key to success was and made 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.189
 itself the 2 0 that there if within the twelve minutes of the match 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.389
 jes kortenhoef on a header it even gets a part his spring division 

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:55.089
 can't buy at all yes apparently pay out quality to purchase 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.320
 yes i can make it perfect and and this time is a step forward and backward 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.140
 but I was completely free 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
 according to the sprint over dogs to cooperate and that ing 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.170
 the countryside to the city is permanent though in other places 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.439
 originated from men 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.379
 he came to thank the supporters because that proves here and there we have 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.889
 A few times per sport is by all but also as one of Groningen 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.309
 that's why people get a little sick for one of the children 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:25.159
 thank scores also a fourth part with napoli will now be around 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:25.629
 I think 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.669
 analyst maarten altena I am only topper in the short term 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.919
 effect of and I am happy to manage and 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:39.619
 more is that feels and for the rest magna what do you think of napoli 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.839
 still a good club 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.559
 may you come that battle come Groningen napoli 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.589
 no i don't know one you need one right after the outcome 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:49.860
 the money to london 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.039
 do you recognize yourself do you expect yourself to come napel 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.399
 he got a chip 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:56.339
 from March 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:58.159
 for the commodity depends on it 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.249
 but I don't even know where to go 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.219
 that's the and 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:10.399
 a few years so if we have time the bones at least yes my foot smack 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.500
 on this duel perhaps the injury of ours to what exactly is land 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.170
 yes i am not outstanding i have my knowledge yet at this time either 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.479
 I hope it is better than expected this morning to be examined and then I know for sure 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.729
 I've put it myself because he's becoming a quack 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:25.899
 Yes there 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.069
 that have term did not have said again yes I hope so 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.239
 better than expected 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.639
 but is extensively investigated and then we know there is first diagnosis 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.529
 making a requirement 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:40.239
 no not really the only thing we are told is that it makes it 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.199
 probably not a cruciate ligament but 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.489
 we also know that tomorrow
