if<00:00:55.310> my<00:00:55.640> mate<00:00:55.790> is<00:00:55.970> standing<00:00:56.300> here<00:00:56.559> he<00:00:57.559> can<00:00:57.739> boost

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
if my mate is standing here he can boost

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.390 
if my mate is standing here he can boost
you<00:00:58.250> up<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.660> wall<00:00:59.840> as<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:00.620> can<00:01:01.040> see<00:01:01.250> and

you up on the wall as you can see and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.280 
you up on the wall as you can see and
this<00:01:01.970> gets<00:01:02.150> you<00:01:02.330> in<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.570> very<00:01:02.780> nice<00:01:03.050> position

this gets you in a very nice position

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.960 
this gets you in a very nice position
because<00:01:03.800> there's<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.100> little<00:01:04.250> ledge<00:01:04.489> over<00:01:04.790> here

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
because there's a little ledge over here

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
which you can walk on if you crouch you

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.469 
which you can walk on if you crouch you
can<00:01:07.580> be<00:01:07.760> seen<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.240> if<00:01:09.050> you<00:01:09.200> stand<00:01:09.440> up<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.740> can

can be seen and if you stand up you can
either<00:01:11.560> spot<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.680> wordsmith<00:01:13.009> or<00:01:13.310> towards

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
either spot to wordsmith or towards

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.140 
either spot to wordsmith or towards
their<00:01:14.720> respond<00:01:15.140> why<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:16.130> works<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.850> because

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
their respond why this works is because

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.719 
their respond why this works is because
if<00:01:17.570> you're<00:01:17.780> standing<00:01:18.080> here<00:01:18.500> with<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.979> up<00:01:19.130> you

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
if you're standing here with the up you

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.730 
if you're standing here with the up you
are<00:01:19.850> most<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.600> time<00:01:20.780> double<00:01:21.229> zooming<00:01:21.590> and

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
are most of the time double zooming and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.969 
are most of the time double zooming and
as<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:22.850> can<00:01:23.000> see<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.450> can't<00:01:23.990> see<00:01:24.140> anything

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
as you can see I can't see anything

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.070 
as you can see I can't see anything
above<00:01:25.610> here<00:01:25.850> because<00:01:26.330> he<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:26.630> standing<00:01:26.840> right

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
above here because he is standing right

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.990 
above here because he is standing right
there<00:01:27.140> but<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.920> can't<00:01:28.160> see<00:01:28.310> anything<00:01:28.520> because

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
there but I can't see anything because

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.900 
there but I can't see anything because
I'm<00:01:29.210> double<00:01:29.390> zooming<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:31.490> actually<00:01:31.700> very

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
I'm double zooming so it's actually very

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.560 
I'm double zooming so it's actually very
nice<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:33.460> course<00:01:34.460> what<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.789> saw<00:01:34.970> was<00:01:35.210> it's<00:01:35.420> a

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
nice of course what you saw was it's a

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.540 
nice of course what you saw was it's a
little<00:01:35.840> bit<00:01:35.930> risky<00:01:36.289> because<00:01:36.440> if<00:01:36.979> your<00:01:37.250> boost

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
little bit risky because if your boost

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.580 
little bit risky because if your boost
did<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:37.850> jump<00:01:38.090> up<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.390> little<00:01:38.690> higher<00:01:38.930> in<00:01:39.259> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
did you jump up a little higher in the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.070 
did you jump up a little higher in the
air<00:01:39.619> before<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.580> fall<00:01:40.789> down<00:01:40.820> that<00:01:41.810> means

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
air before you fall down that means

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.130 
air before you fall down that means
however<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.710> if<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.720> jump<00:01:44.720> up<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.020> air

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
however that if you jump up in the air

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.420 
however that if you jump up in the air
over<00:01:45.200> here<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.860> think<00:01:46.070> like<00:01:46.220> them

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
over here and you think like them

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.800 
over here and you think like them
there's<00:01:46.700> somebody<00:01:47.030> risking<00:01:47.360> death<00:01:47.509> valley

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
there's somebody risking death valley

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.779 
there's somebody risking death valley
and<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.530> don't<00:01:48.860> want<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.160> go<00:01:49.340> into<00:01:49.580> the

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
and you don't want to go into the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.029 
and you don't want to go into the
engagement<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.780> can<00:01:50.990> very<00:01:51.440> easily<00:01:51.530> and

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
engagement you can very easily and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.580 
engagement you can very easily and
safely<00:01:52.250> fall<00:01:53.060> back<00:01:53.240> down<00:01:53.300> again<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.960> course

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
safely fall back down again of course

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.020 
safely fall back down again of course
you<00:01:54.740> can<00:01:54.920> shoot<00:01:55.190> through<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.670> door<00:01:56.000> but

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
you can shoot through the door but

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.660 
you can shoot through the door but
that's<00:01:56.470> quite<00:01:57.470> hard<00:01:57.680> then<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:57.979> can<00:01:58.130> hide<00:01:58.340> here

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
that's quite hard then you can hide here

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.330 
that's quite hard then you can hide here
stuff<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.479> that<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.770> would<00:02:01.070> say<00:02:01.250> it's

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
stuff like that so I would say it's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.649 
stuff like that so I would say it's
quite<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.670> low<00:02:01.939> risk<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:03.400> can<00:02:04.400> have<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.850> very

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
quite a low risk and can have a very

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.840 
quite a low risk and can have a very
high<00:02:05.840> reward<00:02:06.350> because<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:07.130> can<00:02:07.280> get<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.490> very

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
high reward because you can get a very

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.370 
high reward because you can get a very
early<00:02:08.060> kill<00:02:08.329> you<00:02:08.450> can<00:02:08.600> also<00:02:08.750> stand<00:02:09.079> here<00:02:09.259> for

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
early kill you can also stand here for

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.449 
early kill you can also stand here for
example<00:02:09.530> with<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:11.200> deagle<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.380> get<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> killer

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
example with a deagle and get a killer

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.520 
example with a deagle and get a killer
if<00:02:13.640> somebody<00:02:13.970> walks<00:02:14.420> admit<00:02:14.780> if<00:02:14.959> you're<00:02:15.320> in<00:02:15.410> an

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
if somebody walks admit if you're in an

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.740 
if somebody walks admit if you're in an
eco<00:02:16.010> round<00:02:16.160> stand<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.060> little<00:02:17.090> bit<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.570> this

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
eco round stand a little bit to this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.979 
eco round stand a little bit to this
side<00:02:18.010> towards<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.130> side<00:02:19.600> but<00:02:20.600> then<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.840> need

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
side towards this side but then you need

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.490 
side towards this side but then you need
to<00:02:21.079> crouch<00:02:21.320> like<00:02:22.100> my<00:02:22.280> mates<00:02:22.579> doing<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:24.019> yeah

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
to crouch like my mates doing so yeah
