we'll<00:02:03.770> start<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.340> timer<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:06.649> you'll<00:02:07.219> notice

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
we'll start the timer and you'll notice

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.190 
we'll start the timer and you'll notice
it's<00:02:09.220> omnidirectional<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.959> don't<00:02:12.080> need

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it's omnidirectional and you don't need

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:27.790 
it's omnidirectional and you don't need
to<00:02:12.650> line<00:02:13.340> up<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:15.370> lens<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.860> barcodes

minutes<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.470> CHS<00:03:07.470> took<00:03:07.830> less<00:03:08.670> than<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.910> minute

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
minutes the CHS took less than a minute

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.320 
minutes the CHS took less than a minute
and<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.350> translates<00:03:10.950> into<00:03:11.160> roughly

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
and so that translates into roughly

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.060 
and so that translates into roughly
three<00:03:12.330> times<00:03:12.360> speed<00:03:12.870> improvement<00:03:13.440> or

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
three times speed improvement or

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.300 
three times speed improvement or
scanning<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.600> if<00:03:15.870> you're<00:03:16.050> skating<00:03:16.800> 20<00:03:17.190> or<00:03:17.280> less

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
scanning so if you're skating 20 or less

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.449 
scanning so if you're skating 20 or less
items<00:03:17.820> in<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.060> day<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:19.050> red<00:03:19.470> laser<00:03:19.709> application

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
items in a day the red laser application

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.630 
items in a day the red laser application
works<00:03:20.940> quite<00:03:21.209> well<00:03:21.680> we've<00:03:22.680> previously<00:03:23.040> tested

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
works quite well we've previously tested

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.970 
works quite well we've previously tested
in<00:03:23.730> various<00:03:24.000> lighting<00:03:24.270> conditions<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.170> it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
in various lighting conditions and it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.640 
in various lighting conditions and it
suits<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:27.450> know<00:03:27.540> most<00:03:27.959> environments<00:03:28.470> that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
suits you know most environments that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.979 
suits you know most environments that
you're<00:03:28.830> working<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.550> if<00:03:29.670> you're<00:03:29.850> again<00:03:30.720> doing

mission critical type information and

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.270 
mission critical type information and
you've<00:03:38.640> got<00:03:38.790> employees<00:03:39.570> deployed<00:03:40.190> doing<00:03:41.190> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
you've got employees deployed doing the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.490 
you've got employees deployed doing the
scanning<00:03:41.519> apps<00:03:41.820> we<00:03:42.570> highly<00:03:42.840> recommend<00:03:42.900> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
scanning apps we highly recommend a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.930 
scanning apps we highly recommend a
product<00:03:44.070> like<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.370> CHS<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:46.250> using<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.280> you

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
product like the CHS and using that you

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.160 
product like the CHS and using that you
can<00:03:48.180> get<00:03:48.390> fast<00:03:49.170> response<00:03:49.650> time<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:51.080> you<00:03:52.080> know

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
can get fast response time and you know

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.729 
can get fast response time and you know
an<00:03:52.950> ROI<00:03:53.280> return<00:03:53.459> in<00:03:54.230> less<00:03:55.230> than<00:03:55.410> two<00:03:55.590> months

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
an ROI return in less than two months

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.210 
an ROI return in less than two months
and<00:03:56.660> so<00:03:57.660> if<00:03:57.780> you're<00:03:57.930> interested<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.799> CHS

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
and so if you're interested in the CHS

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.940 
and so if you're interested in the CHS
and<00:03:59.430> would<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.670> see<00:04:00.000> more<00:04:00.750> features<00:04:01.200> that
