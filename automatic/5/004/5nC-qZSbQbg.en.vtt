about this was that you know the event

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
happens and then it's done right and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.750 
happens and then it's done right and
then<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.559> you're<00:00:37.680> left<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> often

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
then what you're left with is the often

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.160 
then what you're left with is the often
right<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.420> something<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.719> until

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
right and that's something that until

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.080
