00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.289
 hello to you e &amp; k beast today 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.320
 my tutorial, I'll tell you how 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.500
 get rid of corrosion on the wheel 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.500
 arches 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.440
 what we need to prepare we take 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.280
 grater 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.719
 high pressure and water jet 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.960
 warm or cold no matter but 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.699
 preferably of course warm 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.359
 wash all the dirt here 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:59.170
 spaces some some particles 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:01:03.789
 mud on the ice they stay dry under 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.690
 the name of the captivity of this liquid is usually 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.200
 my engine 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.200
 allow by the proportion of 50 to 50 with water 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.700
 didn't take such an ordinary jar from 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.270
 I'm ready 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:26.800
 made holes specially after it becomes 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.460
 we fill we cover remaining 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.710
 the surface of this chemistry 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.490
 let it brew for 5-10 minutes 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.240
 so that it connector as much as possible and then 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.910
 also 5 peel to wash off everything turns out 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.980
 remaining mud tikva 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.920
 net utility vodka here for now 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.860
 showed this peak now she is completely 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.600
 considered prepared 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.280
 coated 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.540
 Were you hard to see but there is no dirt 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.119
 There is nothing here if this device is like 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.450
 insert them conditions that it will dry 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.240
 itself for two or three hours on the street 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.229
 it 's autumn now 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.770
 high humidity so me 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.430
 apply the corner gun it dries everything 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:20.380
 fully within an hour and a half after 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.940
 of how we dried and he antigravel 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.750
 body 950 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.690
 I am gray because black was not 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.080
 in the store but it can be unimportant gray 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.940
 You can cover a jar with black 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.930
 which is specially made under the gun 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.670
 it is larger in volume and cheaper in price 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.260
 there is specifically how to do spray 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.120
 this deck of cards and went somewhere exactly 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.980
 we are antigravel under the gun because there 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.430
 punch this special connector 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.120
 screw and cover so you can 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.440
 cover general surface integral 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.250
 if you see whether she puts with such 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.510
 thick stratum granulosum to start 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.910
 represents the pressure on the gun 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.220
 minimum to be obtained 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.269
 maximum air flow minimum 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.450
 feed head and clog small pores then 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.579
 there are microcracks there for traces 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.280
 the remaining rust and it covers everything 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.150
 in such a thin layer then gradually 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.459
 increase the flow of gravel and such 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.120
 we cover with a granular film all 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.459
 wheel arch surface 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.030
 jars such an average is enough for two 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.180
 wheels 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.880
 if you save up enough for four but 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.930
 save much on this after coverage 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.530
 two years you have been protected from 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.480
 corrosion 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.500
 Now we will show you clearly 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.500
 example of how i will cover 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.590
 sh 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.739
 what 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.190
 after completion we will spend such 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:19.830
 wonderful spray with games that we have 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:24.480
 It turned out in the end that's what we have 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.750
 turned white little arches 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.520
 on the still scary that they are of such color i 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.820
 even he shock absorbers dusty levers 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.770
 know a little bit but then after 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.950
 first mud 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:45.750
 it will become normal color and so 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.670
 from this side then wear protective clothing 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.750
 no h press between all rust it 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:54.470
 minute arches withdraw and everything will be 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.470
 fine 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:04.230
 let dry 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:07.460
 23 hours and you can dress the wheels 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.470
 the end of the work you need to rinse the gun 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:15.890
 pulled him in the bank see that pivot 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:19.440
 all gravel so we rub it 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:22.770
 you can carefully use our 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:27.120
 gloves but if it is dirty therefore 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:29.990
 then wash my hands all rubbed now 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.720
 need to rinse it from the inside 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:43.100
 pour in a jar 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:43.100
 a little solvent go try 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:54.150
 we take it old we allow 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:57.740
 Thank you all for your attention with you was bright 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.740
 beast goodbye and bye
