go one step two step and then three step

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.740 
go one step two step and then three step
this<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.290> one<00:01:09.470> step<00:01:09.710> inside<00:01:10.190> set<00:01:10.580> you've<00:01:11.509> got

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
this is a one step inside set you've got

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.870 
this is a one step inside set you've got
a<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:12.320> head<00:01:12.890> up<00:01:13.009> defender<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.550> you<00:01:13.640> need<00:01:13.790> to

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
take away that inside this is a two step

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.310 
take away that inside this is a two step
and<00:01:16.250> power<00:01:16.460> okay<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.420> defender<00:01:18.110> that's

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320

in<00:01:18.530> your<00:01:18.710> inside<00:01:19.070> here<00:01:19.399> slide<00:01:19.790> protection

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
in your inside here slide protection

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.310 
in your inside here slide protection
whatever<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:20.750> might<00:01:20.899> be

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
whatever it might be

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.160 
whatever it might be
we're<00:01:21.770> going<00:01:22.009> power<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.940> is<00:01:23.119> set<00:01:23.360> reset<00:01:23.810> kick

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
we're going power this is set reset kick

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.749

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
so you have a head up defender that's

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.480 
so you have a head up defender that's
working<00:01:26.180> back<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.570> your<00:01:26.720> outside<00:01:27.160> right<00:01:28.160> there
