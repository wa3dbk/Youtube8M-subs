00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
 Those who are baptized from the dark mark will live forever 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.520
 Locked in a constant state of death and revival 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.560
 But God does not consider it a blessing here 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.080
 They are called fuck, with reason justified 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.820
 Death was replaced with madness, 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.740
 A state in which humanity was lost and became Hulu 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.220
 They no longer have the will to preserve their humanity, 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.960
 To preserve their body, or their mind. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.300
 Holo is a continuous process though 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 You will reach a point where no return 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.240
 A point where humanity can not be restored. 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.280
 We meet Oscar of Astora before reaching that point where no return is made 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.280
 "I can feel it coming" 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.440
 It is very easy to forget the role of Oscar 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.080
 But it can be said that his interview is the most important thing that happens to you 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.680
 Without it it will still be locked away in a cell 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.620
 He went to suffer in order to find a key to your cell 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.100
 but why? 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.800
 Well there is a reason. 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.200
 "You who have been chosen" 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.260
 Who will embark on a trip from the Isle of Isles 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.840
 A long journey to the land of the ancient nobles 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.180
 When the bell rings up, you will discover the fate of the laminate 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200
 This statement goes through the Oscar family 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.880
 But it is more than just saying, it is very clear it is a prophecy 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.120
 She says that the lameet will escape from Islam 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.760
 To the land of the ancient nobles 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.320
 He will discover the fate of the Lamitians 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.440
 Something desperate for human knowledge 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.100
 This prophecy is the reason why there is an Oscar in Islam 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.860
 Because if he can leave the Ismail 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.840
 Perhaps it will be included within the prophecy 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 And if it is part of the prophecy 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.180
 A person may become presumed to discover the fate of the laminate 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.980
 But can not confirm if he is the person 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.460
 There are hundreds of other lamites 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.880
 They are locked away in the blinds 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.620
 So, when it is on the ceiling 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.020
 He tries to make the elmite escape from his cell 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.900
 Hoping to kick the start of the prophecy 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.260
 But there is something else on the ceiling 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.360
 Satan Assimil guards prison 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.600
 Have you ever wondered why you find Oscar dead in a closed cell? 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.740
 There is only one entrance 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.080
 There is a hole in the ceiling 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.720
 He was smashed into his room by a demon of Islam 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.680
 "You are a gift from heaven to come at this moment, I hope to ask you something" 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.380
 Oscar tells you the prophecy 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.900
 And the hulu with knowing you are 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.860
 Perhaps the fate of the two laments is to leave Islam 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.840
 He is right, you are as well 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.820
 But what if Oscar continued to live? 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.480
 What if you both went out of school together? 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.540
 "Please, come quickly, it's your destiny" 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.840
 "It is a pleasure to meet you, talk to Hakim Farambt about you" 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.060
 "I am an Oscar from Astora, I hope to thank you for ringing a wake-up call" 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.780
 "I am ready to leave, I will follow the instructions of the wise Frampt," 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.080
 I will search for Anwar Lundo by Scenes Fortis " 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.420
 "Maybe both of us are achieving our honorable goal, I hope we will meet again somewhere" 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.560
 "one day..." 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.480
 If true prophecy implies that one of you or Oscar will be an elliptical chosen 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.240
 You both meet the requirements, both of you have left the school 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.800
 But over time, it becomes clearer that you are the chosen elliptical, not Oscar 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.200
 You are the person who rang the bells, and the person who meets the prophecy more forcefully 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.240
 "I can not stay here, I must find my own goal" 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.800
 All the Lamitons chase a goal to keep themselves from turning to Hulu 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.960
 For Oscar it's different, he's looking for a worthy goal 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.920
 This mania is what will put a tragic end to it 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.320
 "Well, how long have you been here?" 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.960
 "Glad to see you fine, but be careful, you're definitely here like I'm here 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.600
 "Search for the tomb of Mr. Arturias" 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.800
 "This forest is the land of a vicious band of thieves" 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.080
 What will we do if we join forces? " 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.480
 "What about that? If we work together we may run away from thieves" 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.640
 "Is this appeal to you? Well, let's keep our intelligence" 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.960
 "A person can always do with another pair of eyes" 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.920
 "Things seem to have stabilized, you're right to partner with you." 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.800
 You will rest a short rest here, do not hesitate to go forward 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.600
 While you both make your journey through the world, you win before Oscar, 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.320
 An important success succeeds 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.120
 And finally arrive in the Clown of the First Fleece area 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.480
 To either replace the dead, dead or completely annihilated. 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.080
 Whatever route you choose, Oscar will choose the opposite road 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.920
 Driven by the need to be important, opposed to every choice they play. 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.760
 Whether the dead god finishes or leaves the first fire to extinguish ... 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.520
 "If you are ..." 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.120
 "I had the feeling ... I should destroy you," he said. 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.400
 "As fate commanded me, the foolish assailant of the dark haunt of Cath," 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200
 "The devil of Satanic darkness." 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.720
 You may choose to replace the dead god, and rekindle the fire age. 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.040
 "I have waited for you, the foolish slave of the gods," 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.040
 "He will kill you, and become the true God of darkness." 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.440
 Whatever path you choose, Oscar opposes you desperately to be content in destiny. 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.520
 The search for the goal is all he owns
