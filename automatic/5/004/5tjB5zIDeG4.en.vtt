your program that costs some spring it's

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.449 
your program that costs some spring it's
five<00:04:18.389> dollars<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.739> need<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:19.949> 14-day<00:04:20.430> free

to<00:05:54.500> smack<00:05:54.860> it<00:05:54.889> upside<00:05:55.340> the<00:05:55.460> head<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.660> as<00:05:56.780> you

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
to smack it upside the head I so as you

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.029 
to smack it upside the head I so as you
can<00:05:56.990> see<00:05:57.910> this<00:05:58.910> is<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.300> root<00:06:00.050> of<00:06:00.169> our<00:06:00.260> file<00:06:00.530> it's

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
can see this is a root of our file it's

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.219 
can see this is a root of our file it's
much<00:06:01.490> simpler<00:06:01.910> than<00:06:03.580> when<00:06:04.580> I'm<00:06:04.760> Wi-Fi<00:06:05.389> but<00:06:06.020> I

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
much simpler than when I'm Wi-Fi but I

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.740 
much simpler than when I'm Wi-Fi but I
mean<00:06:06.500> it's<00:06:06.620> much<00:06:06.740> simpler<00:06:07.070> than<00:06:07.490> SSH<00:06:08.180> but<00:06:08.539> it

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
mean it's much simpler than SSH but it

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.170 
mean it's much simpler than SSH but it
does<00:06:08.900> cost<00:06:09.110> money<00:06:09.380> eventually<00:06:09.680> and<00:06:10.340> you<00:06:11.030> knew

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
does cost money eventually and you knew

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.000 
does cost money eventually and you knew
you<00:06:11.419> do<00:06:11.600> need<00:06:11.840> to<00:06:11.990> have<00:06:12.139> access<00:06:12.380> to<00:06:12.710> a<00:06:12.740> cable

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
you do need to have access to a cable

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.650 
you do need to have access to a cable
whereas<00:06:13.699> you<00:06:13.880> don't<00:06:14.060> need<00:06:14.180> to<00:06:14.270> access<00:06:14.389> to

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
whereas you don't need to access to

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.909 
whereas you don't need to access to
enjoyable<00:06:15.050> typically<00:06:15.530> to<00:06:15.830> SSH<00:06:17.740> so<00:06:18.740> that's

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
enjoyable typically to SSH so that's

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.379 
enjoyable typically to SSH so that's
