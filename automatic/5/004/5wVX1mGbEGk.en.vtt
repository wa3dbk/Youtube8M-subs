00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 hi buddy i'm very glad that you are again 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.520
 you watch our issues today 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.710
 tell you about the planes 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.370
 long ago the ancient people looked at 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.510
 birds dreamed of flying like they passed 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.910
 plenty of time before it happened 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.660
 first people learned to rise in 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.940
 balloon balloon filled the air 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.710
 smoke from the fire which is lighter 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.980
 ambient air 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.830
 but treat the ball where the wind blows 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.970
 and the man himself wanted to choose where 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:06.240
 immunity and then to the balloon 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.170
 attached the engine and got to fly 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 in the right direction such a design 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.040
 have called 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.580
 the airship went on and people learned 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.460
 do the first planes and a hundred years ago 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 on such a device was produced first 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.040
 flight the first planes were small them 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.700
 the hull was sheathed with wood and climbed into 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.100
 air and not with the help of propellers at that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.460
 same time were invented and the first 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.870
 vertical takeoffs 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.360
 helicopters 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.660
 at first they were funny and awkward 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.810
 but with the advent of jet engines they 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.210
 become fast and big 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.890
 airplanes also refined them 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.920
 steel made of metal 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.440
 they became bigger and they got one 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.420
 pair of wings planes 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.350
 can now not only sit on 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.729
 asphalt but also on the snow and inputs for this 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.819
 they place the most modern ski wheels 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.180
 aircraft already controlled by the computer and 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.540
 the pilot only follow the flight there 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.239
 even those planes that pilot 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.620
 rules being on earth they 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.879
 are called drones 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.629
 the fastest x15 aircraft he can 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.000
 reach a speed of more than seven thousand 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.540
 kilometers per hour and the largest aircraft 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.360
 in the world of an-225 mriya 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.950
 it's so big it can 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.400
 carry trains 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.000
 The world's most expensive aircraft is a military 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.959
 bityu spirit it is worth 2 billion 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 dollars 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.489
 it is also called my reading on it all 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.099
 trembling 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.540
 to new meetings and new interesting 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.950
 releases if you want to find out first about 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.799
