00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:27.000
 loops on the needle 7 way it is called 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.010
 cruciform looping method with 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.309
 thickened edge 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.059
 we measure the segment from the end of the string seven times 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 longer than the width of our future 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:44.739
 sample and here in this place will do 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 sliding loop 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:53.670
 it is done like this and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:58.000
 pull the thread in this loop 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.940
 we form a sliding loop 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.940
 sliding loop on 2 spokes and tighten 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.509
 it can start a set of loops 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.840
 doubly put the end of the thread so that 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:21.750
 the tip was a little lines of cars and spokes 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.229
 pinch with three fingers of the right hand 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.350
 left hand 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.200
 Enter the code and strings in such a way that 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.429
 on the index finger 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.569
 it turned out there which leads to a tangle 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.950
 on the thumb 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:43.030
 the end of the thread consisting of two threads and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:54.209
 the other three fingers hold 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:56.640
 all the threads then knitting needles take to the left and 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:00.759
 left to right 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.670
 we enter under the thread that goes down with 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.209
 thumb allot spokes right and 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.739
 then right to left 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:12.640
 grab the thread with the index finger 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.130
 and drag it through the loop on the big 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.130
 finger 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.390
 we withdraw the needles to the right index finger 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.610
 right hand by moves up and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.310
 holding a new loop then 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:33.069
 left thumb down 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:38.959
 eggs from the loop and after that 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:41.319
 bottom up tighten our 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.530
 loop 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:49.580
 the following loop knit has different 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.970
 needles take away to the left and right to left 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.620
 we introduce a thread on the abandoned 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.120
 thumb allot right spokes 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.269
 grabbing the thread with the index finger 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.780
 and drag through the loop on the big 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.360
 finger allot right spokes 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.819
 forefinger 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.019
 push to hold 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:19.000
 loop then the thumb pull out 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:24.709
 from loop and top to bottom 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:32.410
 tighten the loop knit the following 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:32.410
 and now upward movement 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:42.730
 tighten the loop and knit the following 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:48.250
 and now top down 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.250
 tighten the loop and knit the following and 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:58.840
 now upward movement 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.840
 tighten the loop and knit the following and 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.370
 move the loop from top to bottom 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.100
 with this looping method 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.010
 loop on our knitting needles 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:22.070
 be arranged in pairs and the edge will be 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:29.950
 thickened and now you can pull out 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:33.220
 knitting needle and start knitting with you evil irina 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.139
