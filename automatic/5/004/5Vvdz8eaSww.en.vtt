 the rest we all know that red 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.769
 stand and green go 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.349
 but at the same time red and green can 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.320
 designate different things for different 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.960
 people maybe you support arsenal and

 either about something more acute at someone 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.620
 there are such associations with someone their 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 no color at all carries the most 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.320

 special collages from posters to 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.690
 films that are clearly shown 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.280
 the popularity of light depending on the genre 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.010
 independent films usually have 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.630
 yellow background films about nature 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.909
 advertised with a blue background thriller 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.930
 analogies you can make yourself 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.180
 just come to the cinema and carefully 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.290

 bloom 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.659
 this can lead to misunderstanding and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.610
 disputes especially in cases where one 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.000
 subjective opinion is faced with 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.340
 to others 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.240
 to solve many problems should be 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.979
 objective reality which is more important 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.280
 subjective preferences who nothing 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 I understand I will say it is easier for each of us 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.469
 taste but there is some settled in the heads 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.079
 people and stereotypes and associations 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.479
 arising from the sight of one or another 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.610

 patches of excitement to buy 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.520
 delicacy but if you are commercial 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.220
 the designer decided to create packaging for

 coffee decorated with yellow and white stripes 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.750
 or package for spaghetti with blue 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.240
 peas the project would be rejected 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.560
 because these shapes and colors are not 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.890
 matches the topic 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.410

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.100
 think and in a completely different way 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.300
 look and peer into color 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.920
 analyze why next to one

 how ridiculous and ridiculous those artists are 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.930
 only small heads give shapes 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.719
