how is the ship combat um not very good

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.330 
how is the ship combat um not very good
at<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.899> it's<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.289> complex<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.219> it's

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
at all it's really complex and it's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.979 
at all it's really complex and it's
really<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> strange<00:01:02.879> system<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.870> don't

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
really a strange system you don't

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.330 
really a strange system you don't
control<00:01:05.090> where<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> ship<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.110> all

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
control where the ship is going at all

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.000 
control where the ship is going at all
you<00:01:08.390> control<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> cannon<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.830> there's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
you control the cannon and then there's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.800 
you control the cannon and then there's
two<00:01:11.250> different<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.180> let's<00:01:12.420> take<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> right

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
two different so let's take on the right

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.350 
two different so let's take on the right
stick<00:01:13.080> both<00:01:14.000> independently<00:01:15.000> control

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
stick both independently control

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.700 
stick both independently control
different<00:01:15.570> functions<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> cannon<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
different functions of the cannon the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
different functions of the cannon the
left<00:01:16.920> stick<00:01:17.240> controls<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.869> arc<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.630> ones

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
left stick controls the arc and the ones

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.830 
left stick controls the arc and the ones
at<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.780> left<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:22.979> mmm<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.720> then

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
at the left and the right mmm and then

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
at the left and the right mmm and then
the<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.049> stick<00:01:25.320> controls<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> power<00:01:26.270> so

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
the right stick controls the power so

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.080 
the right stick controls the power so
basically<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.130> tiger<00:01:29.460> woods'<00:01:29.490> style

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
basically what you tiger woods' style

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.340 
basically what you tiger woods' style
too<00:01:30.960> uh<00:01:31.650> no<00:01:32.990> that'd<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.020> pretty<00:01:34.229> awesome

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
too uh no that'd be pretty awesome

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.390 
too uh no that'd be pretty awesome
actually<00:01:34.799> no<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.000> power<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.720> um<00:01:37.400> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
actually no the power is in like um the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.760 
actually no the power is in like um the
different<00:01:38.700> clubs<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.270> Tiger<00:01:39.540> Woods<00:01:39.619> mmm<00:01:40.619> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
different clubs and Tiger Woods mmm so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
different clubs and Tiger Woods mmm so
like<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.070> straight<00:01:41.610> line<00:01:41.790> drive<00:01:42.119> versus<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
like a straight line drive versus a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.800 
like a straight line drive versus a
pitching<00:01:43.380> wedge<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.790> basically<00:01:45.720> all

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
pitching wedge I see so basically all

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
pitching wedge I see so basically all
you<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> turn<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> power<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.460> way

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
you do is you turn the power all the way

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.240 
you do is you turn the power all the way
up<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> line<00:01:49.020> drive<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:49.890> aim<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
up so it's a line drive and then aim it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.940 
up so it's a line drive and then aim it
right<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> side<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> boat<00:01:51.270> sounds

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
right at the side of the boat sounds

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.569 
right at the side of the boat sounds
kind<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.040> good<00:01:53.299> it's<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> okay

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
kind of good it's that's kind of okay

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.609 
kind of good it's that's kind of okay
there's<00:01:57.360> nothing<00:01:57.450> fun<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.049> interesting<00:01:58.170> about

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
there's nothing fun or interesting about

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.080 
there's nothing fun or interesting about
it<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.360> these<00:02:00.509> are<00:02:00.570> basically<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> same<00:02:01.770> game

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090

prison yeah trying to kill Nikki it

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.110 
prison yeah trying to kill Nikki it
seems<00:05:25.979> much<00:05:26.160> easier<00:05:26.220> just<00:05:27.210> to<00:05:27.330> request<00:05:27.840> a

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
seems much easier just to request a

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.260 
seems much easier just to request a
meeting<00:05:30.120> or<00:05:30.680> like<00:05:31.680> prisoner<00:05:32.400> visitation

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
meeting or like prisoner visitation

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.909 
meeting or like prisoner visitation
rights<00:05:33.510> even<00:05:34.200> though<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.320> guess<00:05:34.530> this<00:05:34.710> is

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
rights even though I guess this is

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.070 
rights even though I guess this is
before<00:05:35.660> prisoners<00:05:36.660> probably<00:05:36.960> have

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
before prisoners probably have

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.600 
before prisoners probably have
visitation<00:05:37.620> rights<00:05:37.680> and<00:05:38.070> there's<00:05:38.340> things

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
visitation rights and there's things

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.610 
visitation rights and there's things
like<00:05:38.729> cruel<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:39.180> unusual<00:05:39.270> punishment<00:05:40.020> and<00:05:41.419> or

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
like cruel and unusual punishment and or

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.640 
like cruel and unusual punishment and or
rules<00:05:43.620> against<00:05:44.130> cruel<00:05:44.430> unusual<00:05:44.550> punishment

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
rules against cruel unusual punishment

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.900 
rules against cruel unusual punishment
so<00:05:46.650> if<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.890> don't<00:05:47.010> get<00:05:47.130> seen<00:05:47.400> it's<00:05:47.610> easy<00:05:47.820> not

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
so if you don't get seen it's easy not

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.659 
so if you don't get seen it's easy not
to<00:05:48.180> kill<00:05:48.390> the<00:05:48.510> guards<00:05:51.350> and<00:05:52.350> that's<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.520> for

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
to kill the guards and that's it for

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:02.870 
to kill the guards and that's it for
that<00:05:53.820> one

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.940
