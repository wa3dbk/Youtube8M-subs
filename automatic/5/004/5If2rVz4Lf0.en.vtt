00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.440
 Welcome to the channel 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.480
 Yesterday I did a tutorial 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:18.300
 by showing how to do that 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:24.210
 ton mapping operates under today wants 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.689
 I associate two things once 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.160
 fake HDR image we then still 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.420
 continue to process high mapping 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.829
 First and foremost, I duplicate with level 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 place the plane mode on top of each other 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:49.860
 Go to colors and satisfy take here 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:55.760
 luminosity steady with ok then I go 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:59.370
 on colors invert filter 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.290
 soft blur excel 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.310
 here we take the value of 40 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:12.330
 confirm with ok now we duplicate 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.570
 the original level and bring it with you 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.799
 the arrow keys upwards 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.479
 here we take the plane mode fiber 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.860
 mission 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:28.080
 this is sometimes known as fake hdr 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 Now we go to the upper right level 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.920
 merge mouse button visible levels and 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.680
 it goes with the filter on the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.229
 Also used in the tutorial yesterday 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.030
 have been 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.460
 I have the download links to this in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.960
 the following video already in the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.520
 description with given in 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.649
 There they could find and they can 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.000
 download first we go again 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.000
 on damage replacement smart opening 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:08.580
 then we go back to script fu 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:13.799
 carla sound mapping confirm with ok 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.150
 we duplicate this level twice 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:20.650
 Now we go to the upper level 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:27.299
 right mouse button visible planar 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:31.810
 we continue on filter 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.480
 generally split color and humanities 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.160
 surgery 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:43.569
 Here we create the color channel filter 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:48.610
 improve and mask for 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:52.690
 radio 125 and add 0.50 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.290
 with ok now we go to colors colour- 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.099
 balance go to shadow here 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.099
 the value 7 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:13.340
 with all three opponents in the rent 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:16.989
 we do the same 777 and at 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.989
 suddenly we take the value 10 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.350
 confirm with ok now we get the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.170
 upper level on right mouse button 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.980
 unite the visible 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.950
 Now we go to color hue 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.200
 saturation here if we at the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.200
 Saturation has a value of minus 60 and 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:56.020
 Let's go also colors curves here 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.640
 we still lighten up a bit 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.750
 if we want that different 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:10.290
 areas and that was 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:15.010
 ck dr with tone mapping original before 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.140
 afterwards I forgot something that I can 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.680
 I also go back later 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:24.550
 on filter light and shadow another 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:29.110
 highlights take the upper one at the top 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:33.820
 worth 80 and at the bottom regulator the value 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.490
 45 confirm with ok then it still clicks 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.490
 a little bit more light and shadow 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.730
 further lightened and darkened and 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:48.630
 Now we go to picture visible 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:50.930
 unite and now always ready before 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.740
 later 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.330
 You can do that later if you can 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.620
 that would like to have that too 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:05.169
 blatant again the saturation by 50 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.169
 set percentage return 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.740
 and you have a wonderful one here 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.380
 effect a lot of fun when rebuilding 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.110
 I hope I was able to help you just a little bit 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.550
 if you liked my tutorial 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.650
 Give me thumbs up and give 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.650
 Abo until next time
