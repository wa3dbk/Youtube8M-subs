the<00:00:00.359> truss<00:00:00.659> rod<00:00:00.810> adjustment<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.429> delicate

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
the truss rod adjustment is a delicate

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.869 
the truss rod adjustment is a delicate
operation<00:00:03.600> it's<00:00:04.470> very<00:00:04.740> easy<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.370> break<00:00:05.609> them

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
operation it's very easy to break them

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.509 
operation it's very easy to break them
if<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.150> go<00:00:06.359> too<00:00:06.420> far<00:00:06.980> we've<00:00:07.980> already<00:00:08.220> removed

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
if you go too far we've already removed

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.410 
if you go too far we've already removed
the<00:00:08.940> truss<00:00:09.179> rod<00:00:09.300> cover<00:00:09.950> and<00:00:10.950> ideally<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.300> would

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the truss rod cover and ideally it would

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.780 
the truss rod cover and ideally it would
be<00:00:12.480> nice<00:00:12.809> if<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.230> can<00:00:13.380> release<00:00:13.950> some<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.670> the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
be nice if we can release some of the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.019 
be nice if we can release some of the
middle<00:00:15.089> strings<00:00:15.800> so<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.369> some<00:00:17.730> room

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
middle strings so that we have some room

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.710 
middle strings so that we have some room
to<00:00:18.060> move<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.199> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> loosen<00:00:20.130> these<00:00:20.250> two

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
to move so I'm going to loosen these two

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.720 
to move so I'm going to loosen these two
Center<00:00:21.720> strings<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.160> pull<00:00:23.490> them

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
Center strings so that I can pull them

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.910 
Center strings so that I can pull them
out<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> don't<00:00:25.529> want<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
out of the way but I don't want to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
out of the way but I don't want to
completely<00:00:26.400> remove<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.750> strings

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
completely remove all the strings

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.740 
completely remove all the strings
because<00:00:28.550> once<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.240> release<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
because once we do we release the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.959 
because once we do we release the
tension<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> neck<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
tension on the neck and then all of the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.560 
tension on the neck and then all of the
adjustments<00:00:33.870> inside<00:00:34.020> change<00:00:35.300> remove<00:00:36.300> those

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
adjustments inside change remove those

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.170 
adjustments inside change remove those
to<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.710> thing<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.430> want<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> make<00:00:38.940> sure

to the thing that I want to make sure
that<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.320> find<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> right<00:00:41.129> size<00:00:41.550> allen

particular<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.870> has<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.950> will<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
particular one has this this will do and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.319 
particular one has this this will do and
what<00:00:48.510> we'll<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.230> want<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> test<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.329> if

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
what we'll do is we want to test it if

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.889 
what we'll do is we want to test it if
we<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> warp<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.660> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
we see a warp and we want to if it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
we see a warp and we want to if it's
warping<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:56.250> typically<00:00:56.789> we're<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
warping up then typically we're going to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.360 
warping up then typically we're going to
go<00:00:58.879> in<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.859> guess<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
go in a I guess that would be a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.500 
go in a I guess that would be a
clockwise<00:01:03.090> motion<00:01:04.159> in<00:01:05.159> order<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.790> increase

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
clockwise motion in order to increase

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.780 
clockwise motion in order to increase
the<00:01:06.780> tension<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.830> increased<00:01:08.250> tension

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the tension and as the increased tension

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.660 
the tension and as the increased tension
goes<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.540> warp<00:01:09.900> should<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:11.640> only

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
goes that warp should go down we only

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.350 
goes that warp should go down we only
want<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.990> quarter<00:01:13.500> turn<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.189> time<00:01:14.360> in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
want to go one quarter turn at a time in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.830 
want to go one quarter turn at a time in
order<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> make<00:01:15.900> an<00:01:16.049> adjustment<00:01:17.299> then<00:01:18.299> let<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
order to make an adjustment then let it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890 
order to make an adjustment then let it
sit<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.530> moment<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:20.460> probably<00:01:21.330> five

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
sit for a moment actually probably five

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.710 
sit for a moment actually probably five
minutes<00:01:22.470> would<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.830> wise<00:01:23.420> test<00:01:24.420> for

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
minutes would be wise test for

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.740 
minutes would be wise test for
straightness<00:01:25.229> again<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.970> if<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.210> straight

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
straightness again and if it's straight

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.090 
straightness again and if it's straight
then<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.500> stop<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> adjustment<00:01:31.100> that's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
then you can stop the adjustment that's

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.300 
then you can stop the adjustment that's
the<00:01:32.400> process<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:34.079> warping<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.009> other

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the process if it's warping the other

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.240 
the process if it's warping the other
way<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.600> rare<00:01:36.930> than<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.890> make<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
way which is more rare than you make the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.569 
way which is more rare than you make the
adjustment<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:40.009> this<00:01:41.009> direction<00:01:43.579> if

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
adjustment going this direction if

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.149 
adjustment going this direction if
you're<00:01:44.880> finding<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:46.079> doesn't<00:01:46.740> want<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
you're finding that it doesn't want to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.850 
you're finding that it doesn't want to
move<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> possibility<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
move then there's a possibility that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.990 
move then there's a possibility that
your<00:01:50.130> truss<00:01:50.820> rod<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.360> rusted<00:01:52.729> whatever<00:01:53.729> you

your truss rod has rusted whatever you

your truss rod has rusted whatever you

do the important thing is not to force
it<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:58.200> likely<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.680> cause<00:01:59.149> the<00:02:00.149> nut<00:02:00.420> that
