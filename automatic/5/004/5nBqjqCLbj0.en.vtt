first of all I'm gonna plug it into the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.129 
first of all I'm gonna plug it into the
wall<00:00:10.170> now<00:00:10.889> there's<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.730> float<00:00:12.179> right<00:00:12.599> here<00:00:12.960> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
wall now there's a float right here and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.980 
wall now there's a float right here and
as<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.860> water<00:00:14.070> table<00:00:14.580> Rises<00:00:14.610> around<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.719> pump

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
as the water table Rises around the pump

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.930 
as the water table Rises around the pump
this<00:00:16.320> float<00:00:16.650> will<00:00:16.890> rise<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.460> turn<00:00:17.730> this

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
this float will rise and turn this

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.570 
this float will rise and turn this
switch<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.500> activating<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.680> pump<00:00:19.920> as<00:00:20.130> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
switch on activating the pump as the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.790 
switch on activating the pump as the
water<00:00:20.760> table<00:00:21.119> goes<00:00:21.270> down<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.109> shuts<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
water table goes down it then shuts the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.429 
water table goes down it then shuts the
pump<00:00:23.010> off<00:00:23.359> okay<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.689> first<00:00:24.840> thing<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.260> need

getting<00:01:29.250> caught<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> impeller<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.750> also

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
getting caught in the impeller it also

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.679 
getting caught in the impeller it also
creates<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> nice<00:01:31.680> flat<00:01:32.009> surface<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.479> pump

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
creates a nice flat surface for the pump

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.240 
creates a nice flat surface for the pump
to<00:01:33.810> sit<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.159> alright<00:01:35.159> let's<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.460> how<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.579> did

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
elbow or run down along the ground and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.530 
elbow or run down along the ground and
we'll<00:02:10.830> stop<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
we'll stop it right here because the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.760 
we'll stop it right here because the
grade<00:02:12.840> really<00:02:13.110> slopes

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
grade really slopes

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.740 
grade really slopes
really<00:02:14.250> nice<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.730> that'll<00:02:15.210> stop<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.450> water

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
really nice and that'll stop the water

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.900 
really nice and that'll stop the water
from<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:16.050> back<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> foundation<00:02:19.910> push

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
from going back to the foundation push

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.380 
from going back to the foundation push
on<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.370> glue<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.880> end<00:02:24.210> and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
on it I'm going to glue this end and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.770 
on it I'm going to glue this end and
pull<00:02:24.570> down<00:02:24.750> on<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:32.060> let's<00:02:33.060> try<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.330> pump<00:02:33.630> and

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
pull down on it let's try the pump and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
pull down on it let's try the pump and
see<00:02:33.900> how<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.140> works<00:02:35.510> okay<00:02:36.510> now<00:02:36.720> remember<00:02:36.900> when

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
see how it works okay now remember when

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.410 
see how it works okay now remember when
that<00:02:37.950> perimeter<00:02:38.280> drain<00:02:38.670> should<00:02:38.700> fill<00:02:39.210> or

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
that perimeter drain should fill or

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.090 
that perimeter drain should fill or
should<00:02:39.570> be<00:02:39.600> clogged<00:02:39.990> or<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.500> water<00:02:40.710> table

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
should be clogged or the water table

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.700 
should be clogged or the water table
starts<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.580> rise<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:42.660> pump<00:02:43.050> should<00:02:43.350> come<00:02:43.560> on

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
starts to rise this pump should come on

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:51.050 
starts to rise this pump should come on
so<00:02:44.010> let's<00:02:44.190> put<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.460> on<00:02:47.300> yeah<00:02:48.300> works<00:02:48.780> well
