00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and last but not least the biggest

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.380 
and last but not least the biggest
difference<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.809> got<00:00:58.109> 50<00:00:58.800> megapixels<00:00:59.579> so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
difference is it's got 50 megapixels so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.870

the video on this is identical to its

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.770 
the video on this is identical to its
predecessor<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.619> 5d<00:01:08.070> Mark<00:01:08.310> 3<00:01:08.780> but

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
predecessor the 5d Mark 3 but

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
predecessor the 5d Mark 3 but
unfortunately<00:01:10.909> it<00:01:11.909> doesn't<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
unfortunately it doesn't have a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.890 
unfortunately it doesn't have a
headphone<00:01:12.630> jack<00:01:13.080> which<00:01:13.350> isn't<00:01:14.900> particularly

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
headphone jack which isn't particularly

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
headphone jack which isn't particularly
good<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.590> videographers<00:01:19.280> meanwhile<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
good for videographers meanwhile it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.620 
good for videographers meanwhile it
shoots<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.790> 1080p<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> standard<00:01:23.630> aspects

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
shoots at 1080p or the standard aspects

that<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.810> expect<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.939> DSLR<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.150> shoots

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that you expect for my DSLR that shoots

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.910 
that you expect for my DSLR that shoots
video<00:01:27.750> other<00:01:28.350> 50<00:01:28.860> megapixels<00:01:29.700> were<00:01:30.740> worth<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
video other 50 megapixels were worth it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
video other 50 megapixels were worth it
yeah<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> guess<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.810> again<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> depends

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
yeah I guess they are again it depends

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.359 
yeah I guess they are again it depends
