00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.240 

here<00:01:21.150> turn<00:01:21.510> around

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250

I want to work in this engine so it's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.400 
I want to work in this engine so it's
fine<00:01:34.640> unless<00:01:35.060> you're<00:01:35.480> making<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.870> sharp<00:01:36.140> turn

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
on snow and then it'll tend to spin out

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.719 
on snow and then it'll tend to spin out
a<00:01:38.660> little<00:01:38.900> bit<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.470> could<00:01:39.590> take<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> little

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
a little bit so you could take a little

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.080 
a little bit so you could take a little
u-turn<00:01:41.000> here<00:01:42.340> real<00:01:43.340> careful<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:43.910> slow

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
u-turn here real careful and slow

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.870 
u-turn here real careful and slow
otherwise<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:44.840> end<00:01:45.110> up<00:01:45.260> going<00:01:45.470> sideways

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:02.070

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.660 

all<00:02:48.140> right<00:02:48.410> then<00:02:48.680> we've<00:02:49.190> been<00:02:49.220> running<00:02:49.490> for

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
all right then we've been running for

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.910 
all right then we've been running for
maybe<00:02:50.060> three<00:02:50.720> minutes<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.320> defroster

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
maybe three minutes and the defroster

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.110 
maybe three minutes and the defroster
starting<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.900> fire<00:02:53.900> up<00:02:54.140> here<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:55.030> could<00:02:56.030> have

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
starting to fire up here I could have

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.460 
starting to fire up here I could have
let<00:02:56.240> it<00:02:56.330> warm<00:02:56.510> up<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.780> little<00:02:56.990> longer<00:02:57.140> but<00:02:57.410> I

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
let it warm up a little longer but I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.900 
let it warm up a little longer but I
gotta<00:02:57.620> get<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:57.800> work

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
so typically what you have is on a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.070
