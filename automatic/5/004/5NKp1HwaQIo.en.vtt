this as a really wide screen smartphone
as<00:01:26.890> well<00:01:26.920> so<00:01:27.460> we'll<00:01:27.880> see<00:01:28.000> how<00:01:28.119> this<00:01:28.240> develops

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
as well so we'll see how this develops

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.399 
as well so we'll see how this develops
and<00:01:29.350> see<00:01:29.619> if<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.830> ever<00:01:29.950> goes<00:01:30.220> anywhere

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and see if it ever goes anywhere

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.440 
and see if it ever goes anywhere
definitely<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> unique<00:01:32.549> form<00:01:32.850> factor<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
definitely a unique form factor that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.530 
definitely a unique form factor that
normally<00:01:34.200> seen<00:01:36.380> for<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.439> five<00:01:37.649> inch<00:01:37.829> screens

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.560 

and<00:01:41.540> finally<00:01:41.990> we<00:01:42.110> have<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.910> prototype<00:01:43.910> tablet

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
and finally we have a prototype tablet

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.840 
and finally we have a prototype tablet
as<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:44.810> can<00:01:44.930> see<00:01:45.080> it's<00:01:45.200> running<00:01:45.740> Android<00:01:46.250> 3.2

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.690 
as you can see it's running Android 3.2
honeycomb<00:01:47.230> but<00:01:48.230> what's<00:01:48.440> nice<00:01:49.100> about<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.490> one

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
honeycomb but what's nice about this one

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.190 
honeycomb but what's nice about this one
is<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:49.910> it's<00:01:50.210> actually<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.570> water<00:01:50.780> group<00:01:51.080> you

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
is that it's actually a water group you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.900 
is that it's actually a water group you
can<00:01:51.350> see<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.590> sitting<00:01:51.770> in<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.010> fish<00:01:52.190> tank<00:01:52.220> it

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
can see it sitting in the fish tank it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.960 
can see it sitting in the fish tank it
also<00:01:52.970> has<00:01:53.660> a<00:01:54.020> wireless<00:01:54.890> power<00:01:55.400> transfer

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
also has a wireless power transfer

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.100 
also has a wireless power transfer
capability<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:58.430> can<00:01:58.490> see<00:01:58.760> here<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.900> there

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
capability you can see here that there

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.000 
capability you can see here that there
is<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.290> power<00:02:00.830> pack<00:02:01.100> on

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
is a power pack on

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.430 
is a power pack on
and<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.490> transferring<00:02:03.150> power<00:02:03.440> wirelessly

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
and that's transferring power wirelessly

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.270 
and that's transferring power wirelessly
to<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.100> tablet<00:02:05.550> so<00:02:05.760> no<00:02:06.240> need<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.660> battery

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
to the tablet so no need for a battery

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.490 
to the tablet so no need for a battery
you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.400> just<00:02:08.580> transfer<00:02:09.060> power<00:02:09.840> wirelessly

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you can just transfer power wirelessly

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.920 
you can just transfer power wirelessly
very<00:02:10.860> unique<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.350> just<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> prototype
