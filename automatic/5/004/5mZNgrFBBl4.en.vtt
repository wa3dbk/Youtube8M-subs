take<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> look<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.570> bad<00:00:21.750> boy<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
take a look at this bad boy this is a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.130 
take a look at this bad boy this is a
handheld<00:00:23.189> controller<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.029> operates<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.510> 2.4

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
handheld controller it operates on 2.4

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.609 
handheld controller it operates on 2.4
gigahertz<00:00:25.369> it<00:00:26.369> sends<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.000> signal<00:00:27.199> midi<00:00:28.199> signals

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
gigahertz it sends a signal midi signals

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.749 
gigahertz it sends a signal midi signals
over<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> USB<00:00:29.849> dongle<00:00:30.710> from<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.610> up

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
over to a USB dongle from there it's up

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.060 
over to a USB dongle from there it's up
to<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.690> assign<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.350> map<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:34.829> these

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
to you you can assign and map all these

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670 
to you you can assign and map all these
controls<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.510> basically<00:00:36.870> any<00:00:37.170> parameter

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
controls it's basically any parameter

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.430 
controls it's basically any parameter
you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.829> think<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:38.670> midi<00:00:39.000> controller

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
you can think of that's midi controller

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.959 
you can think of that's midi controller
so<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.620> example<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:41.040> i'm<00:00:41.190> using<00:00:41.460> DJ<00:00:41.730> software

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
so for example if i'm using DJ software

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
so for example if i'm using DJ software
i<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.870> start<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.320> stop<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:43.649> music<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.100> this

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
i can start and stop my music with this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.270 
i can start and stop my music with this
button<00:00:44.489> or<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.120> button<00:00:45.450> or<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.200> button<00:00:46.559> or

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
button or this button or this button or

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.029 
button or this button or this button or
i<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.760> use<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.059> Center<00:00:48.989> knob<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
i can use this Center knob here as a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.400 
i can use this Center knob here as a
volume<00:00:50.430> control<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> shuttle<00:00:51.629> again<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
volume control or a shuttle again the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.049 
volume control or a shuttle again the
possibilities<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.010> endless<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.760> here's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
possibilities are endless and here's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
possibilities are endless and here's
where<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.300> gets<00:00:54.360> even<00:00:54.570> better<00:00:54.949> these<00:00:55.949> shoulder

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
where it gets even better these shoulder

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.760 
where it gets even better these shoulder
buttons<00:00:56.550> allow<00:00:56.730> me<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> access<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.960> built-in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
buttons allow me to access and built-in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.790 
buttons allow me to access and built-in
accelerometer<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> two<00:01:00.149> axis

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
accelerometer is a two axis

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.170 
accelerometer is a two axis
accelerometer<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.460> access<00:01:02.730> using

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
accelerometer that you can access using

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.000 
accelerometer that you can access using
these<00:01:03.329> shoulder<00:01:03.690> buttons<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.530> fact<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.830> can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
these shoulder buttons in fact I can

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
these shoulder buttons in fact I can
combine<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.090> crazy<00:01:06.510> with

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
combine them and get really crazy with

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.130 
combine them and get really crazy with
filters<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.250> effects<00:01:08.580> or<00:01:08.820> lighting<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.720> mean

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
filters and effects or lighting I mean
