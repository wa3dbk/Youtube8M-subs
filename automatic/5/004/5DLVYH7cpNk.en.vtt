00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
this Christina or lucky bamboo I just

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.220 
this Christina or lucky bamboo I just
have<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.550> vase<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:27.119> water<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.660> rocks<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
have in a vase with water and rocks and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.589 
have in a vase with water and rocks and
then<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> roots<00:00:28.740> are<00:00:28.949> down<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.970> it's

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
then the roots are down there and it's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
then the roots are down there and it's
so<00:00:30.840> easy<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.260> don't<00:00:31.410> really<00:00:31.679> take<00:00:32.009> care<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so easy I don't really take care of it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.280 
so easy I don't really take care of it
in<00:00:32.579> any<00:00:32.730> way<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.360> leave<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.020> sunny

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
in any way I just leave it in a sunny

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
in any way I just leave it in a sunny
window<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:35.100> even<00:00:35.880> part<00:00:36.180> sunny<00:00:36.540> window<00:00:36.840> it's

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
window or even part sunny window it's

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.900 
window or even part sunny window it's
not<00:00:37.110> very<00:00:37.320> sunny<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
not very sunny in there at all and it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.479 
not very sunny in there at all and it
seems<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.360> grow<00:00:39.510> really<00:00:39.780> well<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.379> did<00:00:41.129> let<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
seems to grow really well I did let it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.819 
seems to grow really well I did let it
dry<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.700> too<00:00:42.149> much<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.649> I've

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
dry out too much and as you can see I've

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.850 
dry out too much and as you can see I've
lost<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.340> leaves<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
lost some leaves so all I have to do is

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.610 
lost some leaves so all I have to do is
peel<00:00:47.129> off<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.610> leaves<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.780> they'll<00:00:49.590> just

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
peel off these leaves and they'll just

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.670 
peel off these leaves and they'll just
grow<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.640> more<00:00:50.700> plants<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:52.230> one<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.649> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
grow more and more plants at one time I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.189 
grow more and more plants at one time I
left<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> deck<00:00:54.000> outside<00:00:54.390> during

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
left it out on the deck outside during

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
left it out on the deck outside during
the<00:00:55.379> summer<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.730> too<00:00:56.940> cold<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.360> night

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the summer and it got too cold at night

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.020 
the summer and it got too cold at night
in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> fall<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.949> did<00:00:58.980> lots<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.699> damage

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
in the fall and it did lots of damage

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
in the fall and it did lots of damage
and<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.210> pretty<00:01:00.359> much<00:01:00.449> froze<00:01:00.780> down<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> just

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and it pretty much froze down so I just

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
and it pretty much froze down so I just
chopped<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> way<00:01:02.730> back<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.539> put

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
chopped it all the way back down and put

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.359 
chopped it all the way back down and put
it<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> house<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.559> sunny<00:01:04.739> window<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it in the house in a sunny window and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.820 
it in the house in a sunny window and
eventually<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:07.020> shot<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.350> new<00:01:07.560> shoots

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
eventually it just shot up new shoots

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.270 
eventually it just shot up new shoots
again<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.390> thing<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.810> love<00:01:10.170> about<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.770> lucky

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
again so one thing I love about my lucky

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
again so one thing I love about my lucky
bamboo<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:12.000> even<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.990> kill<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.290> usually<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
bamboo is even if I kill it usually I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
bamboo is even if I kill it usually I
don't<00:01:13.860> kill<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.060> will<00:01:15.150> come<00:01:15.360> back

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
don't kill it and it will come back

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.109 
don't kill it and it will come back
again<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.560> periodically<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.700> take<00:01:17.939> out

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
again so periodically I just take out

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.149 
again so periodically I just take out
all<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> yellow<00:01:18.840> leaves<00:01:19.110> or<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> dead<00:01:19.860> leaves

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
all the yellow leaves or the dead leaves

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
all the yellow leaves or the dead leaves
so<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> looks<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.210> ratty<00:01:21.390> I'll<00:01:21.600> chop

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
so if it looks really ratty I'll chop

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.630 
so if it looks really ratty I'll chop
them<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.380> down<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.920> they'll<00:01:23.400> grow

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
them all the way down and they'll grow

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.530 
them all the way down and they'll grow
new<00:01:24.330> growth<00:01:24.600> again<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:26.159> particular<00:01:26.540> lucky

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
new growth again this particular lucky

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.030 
new growth again this particular lucky
bamboo<00:01:27.780> probably<00:01:28.409> should<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> more

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
bamboo probably should be in more

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
bamboo probably should be in more
sunlight<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.720> haven't<00:01:30.960> been

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
sunlight it's kind of I haven't been

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
sunlight it's kind of I haven't been
watering<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.770> well<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.400> little<00:01:32.520> bit

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
watering it very well it's a little bit

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
watering it very well it's a little bit
wimpy<00:01:33.060> looking<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> might<00:01:34.140> give<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
wimpy looking and I might give it just a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
wimpy looking and I might give it just a
little<00:01:34.829> bit<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.159> fertilizer<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.939> give<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
little bit of fertilizer just to give it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
little bit of fertilizer just to give it
some<00:01:36.360> more<00:01:36.390> nutrition<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.740> hasn't

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
some more nutrition because it hasn't

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.789 
some more nutrition because it hasn't
had<00:01:38.250> any<00:01:38.520> nutrition<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.270> years<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.290> at<00:01:40.560> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
had any nutrition in years and at this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.520

wonderful plant for inside and outside
in<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> summer<00:01:48.420> I'll<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.720> leave<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.079> my

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
in the summer I'll just leave it on my

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
in the summer I'll just leave it on my
deck<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:49.590> summer<00:01:49.860> long<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.280> well<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.820> then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
deck all summer long as well and then

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.609 
deck all summer long as well and then
just<00:01:51.390> bring<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> fall<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just bring it in in the fall when it

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.649 
just bring it in in the fall when it
starts<00:01:52.890> getting<00:01:53.130> cold<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.490> night<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.540> do

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
starts getting cold at night but I do

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.660 
starts getting cold at night but I do
know<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.439> leave<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.680> outside<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
know if you do leave it outside and it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.060 
know if you do leave it outside and it
gets<00:01:56.850> below<00:01:57.030> even<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.540> 45<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.469> seems<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.950> they

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
gets below even a 45 it seems like they

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.679 
gets below even a 45 it seems like they
get<00:01:59.219> damaged<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.790> you'll<00:02:00.060> eventually<00:02:00.210> lose

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
get damaged so you'll eventually lose

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.870 
get damaged so you'll eventually lose
them<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.170> they're<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.100> an<00:02:02.250> indoor<00:02:02.579> plant

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
them so they're more of an indoor plant

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.749 
them so they're more of an indoor plant
especially<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> winter<00:02:04.530> time<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.070> I

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
especially in the winter time and I

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.910 
especially in the winter time and I
leave<00:02:05.969> mine<00:02:06.210> indoors<00:02:06.570> year-round<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
leave mine indoors year-round and as you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.619 
leave mine indoors year-round and as you
can<00:02:08.099> see<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> don't<00:02:08.429> take<00:02:08.759> much<00:02:08.970> care<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
can see I don't take much care of it and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.530 
can see I don't take much care of it and
it<00:02:09.750> does<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.259> well
