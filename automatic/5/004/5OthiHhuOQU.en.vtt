00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.090 
all so I'm going to go ahead and show
you<00:00:21.840> how<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.770> get<00:00:22.920> your

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
you how to do it when you get your

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.980 
you how to do it when you get your
tinsel<00:00:24.560> it's<00:00:25.560> pretty<00:00:25.859> long<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.840> go

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
tinsel it's pretty long so you can go

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
tinsel it's pretty long so you can go
ahead<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.230> either<00:00:28.470> pull<00:00:28.859> off<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> strand<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
ahead and either pull off a strand and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.659 
ahead and either pull off a strand and
then<00:00:30.390> cut<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:31.949> length<00:00:32.160> actor

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
then cut it to the right length actor

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.460 
then cut it to the right length actor
after<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.239> put<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.539> in<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.350> it's

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
after you put it in but I think it's

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.950 
after you put it in but I think it's
easier<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.100> ahead<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.489> precut<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.239> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
easier to go ahead and precut it and to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.549 
easier to go ahead and precut it and to
do<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:38.660> you're<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.989> ahead<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
do that you're going to go ahead and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
do that you're going to go ahead and
just<00:00:40.770> put<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.760> figure<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.260> where

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
just put it up and figure out where

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.720 
just put it up and figure out where
you're<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.680> putting<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> you'll

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you're going to be putting it and you'll

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.110 
you're going to be putting it and you'll
want<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.239> double<00:00:45.570> over<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> you're

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
want it to double over so you're

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
want it to double over so you're
essentially<00:00:48.540> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> make<00:00:49.050> two<00:00:49.290> strands

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
essentially going to make two strands

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
essentially going to make two strands
out<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> then<00:00:51.450> you'll<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.690> ahead

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
out of one so and then you'll go ahead

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.819 
out of one so and then you'll go ahead
and<00:00:51.989> cut<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.140> I've<00:00:52.920> already<00:00:53.309> pre-cut<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.960> piece

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
and cut it I've already pre-cut a piece

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.970 
and cut it I've already pre-cut a piece
of<00:00:55.980> tinsel<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.520> myself<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.860> be
