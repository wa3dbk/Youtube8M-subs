00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.680
 Hello 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.380
 let subscribers of internet resources us 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.990
 this test course, we have more than once 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.860
 stopped at a solid state drive it 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 were we 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.660
 120 or most often 256 megabytes so 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.480
 given anyway anyway 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.270
 different high price tag and not everyone 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.160
 available don't forget that there is and 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.020
 simple computers for example the same even 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.210
 T-shirts where not required to store 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.219
 large amount of data or for example there is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.120
 ability to transfer data by block 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.040
 or home from us we have chosen the most one 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.710
 of the cheapest in the Russian market 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.410
 the labor of individual drives is silicon power 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.050
 55 volume our dessert gigabyte 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.120
 will cost Russian buyers 2000 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.690
 rubles and let's see if you can 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.420
 save on buying this drive and if 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.300
 what flaws and pitfalls with 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.950
 faced as a user 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.950
 This disc comes in updated packaging with 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.780
 55 now comes with updated with us 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.770
 controller but preserved 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.240
 maximum speed declared 550 and 441 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.430
 a record 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.320
 here are the main features and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.329
 It is worth noting that 3 years 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.570
 manufacturer's warranty this disc can be 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.280
 don't worry if you have a check 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 You can contact the shops at any time. 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.510
 and swap patient disc and back with 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.729
 Further technical details 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.729
 characteristics and fillings that 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.040
 used in this drive have 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 Naturally versions and volumes more we 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.150
 taken away all and a whole it's enough my 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.000
 operating system if not stored 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.530
 a lot of data on the disk c tus you have 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.080
 Naturally there must be a second hard 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 the disk at the system is the delivery of us all 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.409
 the following is included with the disc 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:55.700
 proposed complete list of names 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.619
 uncomplicated your get instructions 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.590
 a set of screws for mounting any 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.759
 sled adapters 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.830
 nothing right hand itself 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.990
 millimeter disc to discredit 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.840
 you can restore to work that is 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.629
 this is his advantage in my past 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.930
 the model was active meters and that thing 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.510
 he has a new hole here 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.540
 half you're on top sticker this 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.020
 actually everything on the disk is something inside 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.920
 platform used father controller 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.320
 ps 3108 s8 and some models will have 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.910
 you hand that is better to say honestly not 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.220
 I would like to compare these two 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.020
 but probably all of you just donâ€™t 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 will be choosing in the store will 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.000
 acquire the drive that they have 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.620
 go along with under one marking 10 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.330
 uses for memory otshiblo memory 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.750
 good have proved effective in these 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.570
 tests in this version we have 60 gigabytes and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.060
 only 51 available benefit do not worry 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.820
 part of the data used later need 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.040
 most solid-state drive and from memory 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.870
 reserved using can that is 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.710
 after installing windows somewhere left 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.200
 about 40 gigabytes here understand this 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.880
 the moment the version is by the way 120 gigabytes 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.060
 will cost 1000 rubles more that is 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.380
 same silicon power on out of 75 if you 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.180
 There are thousands of rubles naturally possible 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.060
 pay extra if not confine intimate and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.420
 stay neat 64 something like this and 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.560
 let's look at the data synthetically 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.150
 tests that we got from this disc 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.930
 summing up I will say it seemed very 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.590
 okay with no lags sagging 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.070
 speeds 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.290
 4 records speed is good and even a little 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.270
 higher than the wheels that cost even 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.820
 a little more expensive sells honestly my 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.740
 such a volume tester is very rare it 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.970
 drive my mind on my own and 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.830
 asked us to improve and reinstall 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.450
 system reassemble the system unit as we 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.130
 chose such a disk with your fingers was 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.620
 our budget is limited 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.230
 recall look around the angle of silicon power 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.180
 with p55 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.310
 if this test would be interesting for you 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.110
 put likes signed our channel to another 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.709
 many many interesting thanks to all and 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.709
 until
