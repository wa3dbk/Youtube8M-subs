 to the play store if we're in the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.640
 android and if we are in what is I 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 is we are not going to what the author is 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.119
 once we agree let's look 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 this part, I'll leave you here in this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.369
 part the name of the application already 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.530
 you know this a wiki as you can see here 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.400
 in this part and then once the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.260
 we have downloaded and we can open it 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.850
 and how can you see there is the interface 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.630
 of what is this application comes in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.890
 this black color where it comes as a 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.300
 kind of community shows us 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.310
 different users than what they are 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.870
 looking for there are different types of 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.000
 activities that are doing these 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.490
 users and you can to use it is 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.470
 pretty simple we can simply 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.720
 see here in this menu on the side that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.250
 we have different options one that is 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.080
 home where we are right now we can 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.490
 log on to what is a wiki 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.950
 we can see what is our 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.330
 music library we can see the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.040
 song that is playing in 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.720
 this moment we can see different 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.490
 ringtones we have radio by 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.560
 internet we have this function that is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.210
 called zone kylie which is very similar to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.070
 what jazz makes us am that is to look for the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.630
 name of the songs and in addition to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.240
 look for the name will give us the letters 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.470
 and that function is very very good 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.560
 we can add friends and what they are 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.090
 adjustments and can play just what is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.700
 this application the functions that more 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.040
 let's use the most important ones are 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.110
 these is the music library that 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.240
 we have it here on this side what is 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.410
 is playing now and what they are 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.480
 heidi 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.980
 these are the best functions that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.020
 we have in our application so 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.330
 we're going to go here with the first one in 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.190
 where are we going to put what they are see all 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.300
 our library of songs all 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.700
 songs that we have in our 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.500
 device so I 'm going to see here 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.770
 here in this part in what is 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.480
 songs and then we can reproduce it 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.940
 like any other player so 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.670
 I'm going to put 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.349
 a song I'm going to select this 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.150
 here in this part when lowering the volume 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.370
 for copyright issues to 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.500
 have no problem and how can 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.430
 see now on the screen is putting us 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.980
 what is the lyrics of the song 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.050
 as it is reproducing so there 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.340
 you can see it and this function that was 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.470
 It's pretty good and you did not see 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.959
 other other apps that do the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.300
 same is going to be traveling as 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.850
 a kind of karaoke where 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.860
 go go playing the song 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.790
 is going to be putting here and it is happening 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.230
 line to line 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.080
 so just what you are seeing 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.720
 that's what the letter of 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.180
 the songs 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.110
 besides knowing what is the lyrics of 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.840
 the songs that we already have 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.390
 incorporated into this other good function 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.650
 we come back here in this part is the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.480
 playback function now that 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.980
 he's just going to send us to the song 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.720
 that is playing at that moment 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.850
 that does not matter but it fits 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.380
 it's worth it to highlight it for 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.900
 that they know more or less how to access the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.270
 music so it's playing in 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.560
 that moment as you can see here also 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.060
 can access what the song is in 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.640
 this top part so there's no 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.080
 no problem another function quite 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.670
 important and that I like quite a lot 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.520
 of what is this application is the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.600
 Shanghai function of this function is 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.130
 what is going to do to us is 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 give us the name of the song and what 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.340
 it's the lyrics so I was pretty 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.209
 good because we can know the letter of 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.459
 those songs that are 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.770
 playing at a party on the radio 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.090
 in different places and also it's going to 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.430
 give what is the lyrics of the songs 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.370
 so today I 'm going to put them so that 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.459
 see how I work in this part I'm going 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.229
 to select what a song is 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.850
 here in this part I already have it 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.800
 selected I will put here the 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.840
 volume half and in this part I'm going 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.460
 to lower the volume so simply 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.500
 are going to see how this will work 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.500
 application so I 'm going to play it 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.470
 here 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.210
 as you can see here in this part the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.160
 application gave me what is the name of 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.050
 the song as you can see it is called to me 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.180
 here we have here you can also see the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.920
 name of the song and besides that we 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.300
 is there reproducing the letter a 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.160
 criterion difference I already put the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.660
 song but and we are going 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.449
 what is the song as it goes 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.180
 making progress 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.770
 what is the song so it is 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.300
 function is quite good and can 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.919
 to leave much profit to what is a 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.599
 android and I remember it is also 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.520
 compatible with what is ios so 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.319
 they simply look for it and have a 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.330
 very similar interface and that should not 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.669
 have no problem using them 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.139
 on your devices 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.879
 good guys this was all I hope that 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.259

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.180
 pretty good I recommend them 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.009
 enough to remember it's called tunewiki 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.990
 just look for the one you already know in the 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.309
 app store or in the play store and 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.629
 download it and they will be able to take it out 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:36.069
 quite useful what is this 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.169
 application and they will be able to know the 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.629
 lyrics songs by simply accessing 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.759

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.589
