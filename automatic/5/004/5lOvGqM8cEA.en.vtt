00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
than high E and B for most of the chords

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.060 
than high E and B for most of the chords
and<00:01:21.630> those<00:01:22.170> notes<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.500> actually<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> be

the same notes just one octave and
another<00:01:27.900> octave<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> same<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
another octave at the same time so the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.149 
another octave at the same time so the
first<00:01:31.200> chord<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.070> e

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.249

you with smaller hands for example just
reaching<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.480> octave<00:02:26.900> like<00:02:27.079> this<00:02:27.319> will<00:02:27.769> kind

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
reaching this octave like this will kind

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.880 
reaching this octave like this will kind
of<00:02:28.160> cause<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.110> crumple<00:02:30.110> your<00:02:30.290> fingers<00:02:30.650> up

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
E and the 9th fret E you just let your

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.129 
E and the 9th fret E you just let your
fingers<00:03:00.459> in<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.730> case<00:03:02.000> I've<00:03:02.209> kind<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.510> my<00:03:02.690> my

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
fingers in this case I've kind of my my

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.809 
fingers in this case I've kind of my my
middle<00:03:03.410> fingers<00:03:03.709> kind<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.069> laying<00:03:04.250> against<00:03:04.670> it

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
middle fingers kind of laying against it

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.849 
middle fingers kind of laying against it
my<00:03:05.299> index<00:03:05.690> finger<00:03:05.989> is<00:03:06.049> laying<00:03:06.319> against<00:03:06.739> it

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
my index finger is laying against it

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.090 
my index finger is laying against it
because<00:03:07.160> I'm<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:08.019> have<00:03:09.019> my<00:03:09.170> hand<00:03:09.440> angled<00:03:09.889> back

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
because I'm I have my hand angled back

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.940 
because I'm I have my hand angled back
to<00:03:10.609> play<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.970> other

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
to play the other

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.820 
to play the other
so<00:03:12.700> anyway<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.569> d-string<00:03:13.959> doesn't<00:03:14.440> ring<00:03:14.650> out

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
so anyway the d-string doesn't ring out

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.300 
so anyway the d-string doesn't ring out
you<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:15.610> get<00:03:16.170> those<00:03:17.170> two<00:03:17.410> notes<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.860> again

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
you just get those two notes and again

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.490 
you just get those two notes and again
the<00:03:18.790> high<00:03:18.970> E<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.450> B<00:03:19.599> strings

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
the high E and B strings

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.660 
the high E and B strings
open<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.540> total<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:25.160> can't<00:03:25.430> pay

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
open so that total is and you can't pay

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.100 
open so that total is and you can't pay
the<00:03:26.360> low<00:03:26.540> e-string

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
the low e-string

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.220 
the low e-string
as<00:03:27.320> well<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:27.950> want<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:29.960> don't<00:03:30.110> have
