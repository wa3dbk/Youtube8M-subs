00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
Mac minis Laozi 4 gigs of ram to a sweet

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.450 
Mac minis Laozi 4 gigs of ram to a sweet
16<00:00:18.779> gig<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.740> first<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.100> all<00:00:20.130> we're<00:00:20.279> gonna<00:00:20.340> need

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
16 gig so first of all we're gonna need

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.670 
16 gig so first of all we're gonna need
for<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:20.910> operation<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.840> course<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.470> Mac

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
for this operation is of course the Mac

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.759 
for this operation is of course the Mac
Mini<00:00:22.710> itself<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.609> well<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> ddr3<00:00:25.019> RAM<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
Mini itself as well as a ddr3 RAM and a

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.720 
Mini itself as well as a ddr3 RAM and a
pair<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> scissors

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
pair of scissors

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.880 
pair of scissors
so<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> RAM<00:00:27.240> I'll<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.630> using<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> Patriot

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
so the RAM I'll be using is the Patriot

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.179 
so the RAM I'll be using is the Patriot
ddr3<00:00:29.670> 16<00:00:30.330> gigs<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.720> ram<00:00:30.990> Mac<00:00:31.500> series

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
ddr3 16 gigs of ram Mac series

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.680 
ddr3 16 gigs of ram Mac series
so<00:00:32.399> first<00:00:32.610> let's<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:32.969> everything<00:00:33.239> out<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
so first let's get everything out of the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750 
so first let's get everything out of the
way<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> flip<00:00:34.350> over<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.739> Mac<00:00:34.920> Mini<00:00:35.160> now<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
way and flip over to Mac Mini now that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.430 
way and flip over to Mac Mini now that
we<00:00:35.850> flipped<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.210> over<00:00:36.360> we'll<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> as

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
we flipped it over we'll see that as

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
we flipped it over we'll see that as
these<00:00:37.620> two<00:00:37.920> dots<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.430> indicate<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> lock

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
these two dots to indicate to the lock

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.209 
these two dots to indicate to the lock
and<00:00:39.510> unlock<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.500> gotta<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.829> put<00:00:41.129> our

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and unlock all we gotta do is put our

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.459 
and unlock all we gotta do is put our
fingers<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.670> these<00:00:41.969> grooves<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.690> slide<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.799 
fingers in these grooves and slide it to
unlock<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.250> now<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> black<00:00:44.910> disk<00:00:45.270> lid<00:00:45.539> should

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
unlock and now the black disk lid should

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
unlock and now the black disk lid should
just<00:00:46.079> pop<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
process so to take out the RAM all we

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.340 
process so to take out the RAM all we
got<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> spread<00:00:57.539> apart<00:00:57.840> these<00:00:58.020> metal

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
clips and the RAM should just pop right

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
clips and the RAM should just pop right
out<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.140> pull<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> do
