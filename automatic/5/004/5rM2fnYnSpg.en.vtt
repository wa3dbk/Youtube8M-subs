00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.800
 Every time I breathe 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.500
 Every time I walk 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.000
 every time I breathe every time I see 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.100
 I'm always thinking of you 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.800
 I no longer have words 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 Everything that is left over 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.300
 It's love and I have it for you 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.300
 everything is for you, that's for you 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.100
 Every time I breathe 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.800
 every time I walk 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 every time I see you 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 it comes to my mind what we have lived 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 Every time I breathe 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 every time I walk 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.900
 every time I see you 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.300
 I remember moments that I have with you 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.800
 Every time I breathe 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.300
 I am yours, and any path 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 I see it and it's for you, every time I breathe 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 Everything makes sense 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.300
 And I can not find the reason ... 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.100
 ... that hurts me if you're with me 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.300
 If I always have you 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 there is not enough time 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.300
 I can not live 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 And this life I do not live without you 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 Everything is for you, this is for you. 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.000
 Every time I breathe, every time I walk 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.100
 Every time I see you, it comes to my mind what we have lived 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.300
 Every time I breathe, every time I walk 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.700
 every time I see you I remember moments that I have with you 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.150
 every time I breathe, I am yours and any way I see it and it is for you 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.800
 every time I breathe 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.300
 Every time I breathe, every time I walk 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.300
 Every time I see you, it comes to my mind what we have lived 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.300
 Every time I breathe, every time I walk 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.800
 every time I see you I remember moments that I have with you 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.100
 every time I breathe, I am yours and any way I see it and it is for you 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.300
 every time I breathe
