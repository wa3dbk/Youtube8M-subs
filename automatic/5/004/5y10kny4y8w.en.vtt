00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
TS NS I see that it handles 5,000 watts

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.709 
TS NS I see that it handles 5,000 watts
yes<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.969> rate<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.539> for

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
yes that is what we rate them like for

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.590 
yes that is what we rate them like for
RMS<00:00:55.230> daily<00:00:55.649> music<00:00:56.039> playing<00:00:56.340> okay<00:00:57.059> cool<00:00:57.329> so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
RMS daily music playing okay cool so

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.740 
RMS daily music playing okay cool so
they<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.260> play<00:00:58.469> music<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.239> SPL

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
they can play music and not just for SPL

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.930 
they can play music and not just for SPL
yes<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.430> correct

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
yes that is correct

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.179 
yes that is correct
they<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.780> designed<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.530> built<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:05.010> an

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
they are designed and built as an

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.910 
they are designed and built as an
extreme<00:01:05.640> ground-pounding<00:01:06.479> woofer<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.740> they

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
extreme ground-pounding woofer so they

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.580 
extreme ground-pounding woofer so they
can<00:01:08.100> play<00:01:08.310> any<00:01:08.580> music<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.630> play<00:01:10.290> very

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
can play any music you want play very

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.310 
can play any music you want play very
low<00:01:10.799> frequencies<00:01:11.460> too<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> they<00:01:12.750> also<00:01:12.930> get

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
low frequencies too and they also get

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
low frequencies too and they also get
very<00:01:13.350> loud<00:01:13.740> doing<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.460> their<00:01:15.270> particular

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
very loud doing so their particular

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.230 
very loud doing so their particular
design<00:01:16.380> also<00:01:16.619> allows<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.700> super<00:01:17.850> loud

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
design also allows them to be super loud

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.109 
design also allows them to be super loud
in<00:01:18.299> SPL<00:01:19.080> tone<00:01:19.380> burst<00:01:19.710> setups<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.369> competition

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
in SPL tone burst setups for competition

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.080 
in SPL tone burst setups for competition
oh<00:01:21.270> well<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> wanted<00:01:23.939> to
