 today you will see an artist 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.370
 working with graffiti here on the street 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.230

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.130
 If you call luiz, I said it was a 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.650
 little before 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.019

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.020
 impressive 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:53.700
 logical that they happened Brazil 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.290
 Then I know that I arrived where I arrived. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.840

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.330

 difference nowadays aid and expression live 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.170

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.710
 right if you are heavy and you feel right and 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.710

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.709
 one color to have a graffiti life is this is 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.810
 a freedom of expression that you 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.640
 tries to pass the message on the wall to 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.250
