00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.770
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to make another 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.510
 cute hair bun for this 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.780
 We will use the following materials 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.810
 let's use organza ribbon in 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.110
 this case worked and wired from 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.189
 approximately 4 centimeters wide 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.019
 let's use liquid silicone scissors and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.210
 hair hook to design 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.550
 materials and ss super attentive to the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.740
 elaboration step by step from the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.930
 Cute and easy hair bun with 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.719
 organza ribbons for our next 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.390
 model of bun for the hair we are going to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.610
 work on this opportunity with 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.820
 rectangles of organza ribbon 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.790
 wire fence 4 centimeters wide and 8 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.580
 centimeters and a half long 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.580
 we are going to double this way 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.030
 forming a kind of pretty 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.380
 and once we have it this way 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:11.020
 we are going to bend the terminal towards 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.380
 part of the setback to fix there is 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.920
 in this same way I will work all 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.320
 the cones we're just going to rotate from 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.819
 this way we are left with a kind of 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.850
 milestone and once it's like that we double 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:31.659
 towards the back in this way 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.140
 there it is then let's work like this 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.729
 approximately 17 with milestones and one of 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.189
 the rectangles let's do what 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.140
 next this is the part of the right 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.479
 where has the carved and we are going to bend 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.270
 towards the center and toward the center 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.179
 We are forming a rectangle 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.780
 doing so double for about this going 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.340
 hitting the cones that will form the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.140
 I'm doing it double because 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.689
 We are working with a tape 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.170
 organza if you will work with a 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.539
 This thicker common tape does not 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.959
 they would need to do it doubles simply 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:12.069
 would cut the square after that I'll 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:14.890
 add liquid silicone in this case 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.210
 the entire surface of the square to go 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.200
 hitting 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.099
 petals in the bow flower 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.190
 there we have it if you for any 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:31.959
 reason they will work not with wire tape 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.209
 but with common tape do not forget this 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.880
 burn around the edges to prevent it from 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:42.050
 thaw then let's go 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.200
 placing them in this way so around 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.840
 from the center to the sides and we're going to 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.220
 go adding small amounts of 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.980
 Liquid silicone to the side 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.890
 so that in this way it goes together 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.370
 one with another 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.640
 there is 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.290
 then we are hitting in this way 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.560
 You can also use the organza ribbon 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.220
 if they want full color in this case 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.340
 It is also recommended 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.500
 burn to the sides to avoid 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.780
 that thaws and in this case I'm not 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.020
 burning because it's an organza appointment 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.360
 I do not know how to tell you then you do not need 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.880
 this burn to the edges only I have 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.310
 cut and I have bent and jacques wired 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.530
 we're just doing it this way 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.360
 but you can work with the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.120
 different types of tape there is 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.030
 we are turning and we are going to do the first 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.930
 row of 8 cones 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.530
 of tapes then the second row in the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.850
 who are going to enter 5 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.720
 later the third in which they go 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.720
 to enter this 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.590
 approximately this 3 and finally 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.620
 let's close our flower 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.430
 with this 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:10.430
 the tape that with a nice on the part 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.019
 central then we will go accommodating 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.850
 we are seeing that they are staying 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.600
 couple 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:22.770
 there it is we already have 6 so far and 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.580
 we are going to hit the first 8 so 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.580
 pretty 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.480
 this is quite easy and simple to 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.800
 end let's join one with another 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.140
 and let's wait for some small 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.230
 seconds than 7 to form the next 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.090
 part once we have already pasted the 8 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.870
 first petals we will add silicone 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.300
 liquid in the center and we will continue 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.740
 sticking intercalating 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.330
 and in this case I'm going to hit six 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.270
 petals can be from five to six 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.190
 petals I think I prefer to paste six 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.460
 for that way 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.720
 give him this 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.960
 as even numbers then we continue 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.430
 hitting 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:15.610
 there it is in the same way that we have 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.930
 done in the first part this is a 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.600
 just pasting is pretty simple 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.320
 we're sticking there and I'm going to hit six 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.320
 petals 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:31.819
 in this way and this 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.819
 we are accommodating 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.440
 and later here we are going to put 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.440
 both sides 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:48.610
 in the central part I do not know how we are going to 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.180
 wait a little these seconds 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.440
 I know that 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:57.410
 to stick the following petals 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.520
 once we have already pasted the 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.400
 next six petals we're going to 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.940
 continue pasting the last three 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.680
 petals and later once that 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:14.910
 be dry, let's fluff the hair 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.810
 taste there we are going to paste the three 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:21.090
 central petals wait a few minutes 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.210
 let it dry and we give it sponge to 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.970
 later add to this beautiful 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.060
 the hair hook because I'm going to 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.550
 wait for it to dry for this one 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.920
 how the finished bun looks once 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.680
 that we have already pasted in the following 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.230
 six petals we are going to continue sticking 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.160
 in the last three petals and 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:48.780
 subsequently once it is dry 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:51.990
 let's push the little bun to the taste there 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.710
 we are going to paste the three petals 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.230
 central 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.600
 we wait a few minutes to dry and what 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:02.050
 let's sponge for later 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.850
 add to this nice the hook for 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.330
 the hair, I'm going to hope that 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:10.000
 dry for this one show them what the 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.620
 little bunny finished as you see here already 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.750
 we have our cute bun for the 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.450
 finished hair observe you what 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.430
 pretty has been left then I hope that it 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.650
 encourage them to do so do not forget to share
