00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.120
 nine people i am all stems 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.849
 his new video channel today to one 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.189
 Other weapons garden though to cz 805 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.750
 I do not mean it's the 21st 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.970
 I really do not believe it anymore 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.070
 I will have chosen this at some point 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.280
 but in between , as I said at some point 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.789
 now cz 805 that makes a harm of 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.800
 25 to 18 so start from storm rifles 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.420
 that means two to three hits in the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.419
 head four to six hits in the chest 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.520
 and five to six in the legs of the village 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.559
 is also standard with one 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.019
 thursday from 8 meters that is to say 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.420
 after midnight a damage of 25 off 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.620
 then the damage drops to 55 and with 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.399
 then we have the minimal damage of 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.829
 18 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.229
 the fire rate is 700 fans connects 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.420
 that is solid a bit more 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.440
 lower but actually for everything 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.539
 actually already so slow 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.269
 Do not use the melee quite so 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.649
 great but maybe that's just how it is 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.209
 for distance even still great 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.979
 to control and still has 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:03.499
 a little bit faster and the opposite 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.750
 an sms example at the kur 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.000
 tz does not quite see the speed 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.220
 Be so well equipped at the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.100
 storm rifles with 85 meters per second 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.650
 is not that high and the range is 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.300
 thereto that scare meter 78 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.140
 Nevertheless , the weapon is for distance 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.150
 good to use 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.750
 The capacity is 30 plus one shot 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.130
 So the city â€‹â€‹size of a storm rifle 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.530
 Exceptional us even after a long time 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.330
 time is not so low bothers now 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.590
 We are not necessarily too doll because who 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.320
 did not run in close combat and that 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.020
 23 50 clock is still a ball on 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.170
 and if the weapon is completely empty 2.9 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.170
 seconds 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.600
 the rebound also has something for itself 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.630
 above 0.29 is one so low and low 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.700
 to the right 035 after life 0.05 the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.560
 means weapons noticeably fails 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.330
 right off so the mouse when shooting 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.710
 or controller stick always lower left 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.540
 then pull the weapon loose 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.080
 control the multiplier in the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.800
 first shot is 21 now 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.409
 Mittelding so of course there are 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.790
 lower there are higher in the mini stock market 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.450
 So the gun is welcome 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.310
 open a little bit more 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.350
 in the scattering tears the cz also no 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.970
 trees off so start value for one 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.120
 assault rifle which is not in the bowl top 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.830
 design is built that is in sight 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.870
 02 in case I should not move 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.450
 and if it was because of him that would be 190 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.150
 So you can see clearly when shooting 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.220
 possible to stay out soon 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.450
 also very passable values but I say 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.670
 even so at the cz 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.110
 yes that's the more often old when you're right 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.360
 in front of a stand, a man runs anyway 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.069
 not so likely to rhyme around that 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.230
 but rather a tactical one 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.330
 that's why the precision is on the way 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.720
 does not really help the rise is 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.250
 still quite good with 0 091 of rising 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.140
 recoil he does not increase the scatter 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.110
 so extreme idea can sometimes 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.420
 longer brushing on the sets 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.380
 I have something of my own 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.420
 but I have the same with the 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.280
 160 played which they very much 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.050
 behaves similarly and both 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.280
 Weapons I liked that so much that they 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.200
 that does not really change anymore 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.670
 you still want to have things in your face 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.530
 tried and I am always again 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.209
 landed here 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.890
 that means when vising course that 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.959
 What a loved one would like me to be 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.549
 just finally I had the coni by Sun 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.120
 a gold battle pack to happiness very early 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.950
 to get 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.480
 there it is the cobra understood how 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.989
 Of course she has something totally in 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.120
 order goes 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.280
 then you can take the laser is yes 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.630
 not even the duty because well me 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.880
 do not go so close the thing 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.110
 always need otherwise 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.090
 turn off if you are on distance 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.519
 should fight the education brake is 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.320
 then cling because of the residue after 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.450
 yes not so exaggerated is many 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.709
 a user in compensatory white 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.329
 I do not always like it that way meanwhile 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.760
 I became a great developed commentator 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.040
 when the weapon is not so warm with me 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.840
 now omitted educational brake can 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.480
 but you use as I have said you have to 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.730
 not and then the ergonomic grip 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.610
 So intervene that ensures that I 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.690
 in motion are more accurate so if I zb 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.060
 I'm in sight and I'm a bit like that 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.140
 then move left and right then am 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.510
 I'm a bit more precise than that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.420
 right at hand could not have been late to 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.280
 Overall surprisingly good and I can 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.010
 just say that and try it out 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.420
 Of course the two attacks are 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.940
 both fully angled and ok too 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.790
 also briefly just grabbed the name 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.430
 which you can handle yourself best 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.739
 overall I would so to tz they say 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.190
 shoot faster than the sar and is 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.850
 Nevertheless, I want to be super exact 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.100
 never as accurate and so little 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.780
 recoil leave you like stop the sar 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.760
 denomination there he is really like that 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.110
 masterpiece but they had shoot 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.600
 also a piece faster has one 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.150
 has a little more firepower behind 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.610
 but now with the ar 160 a good one 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.980
 The 160 also compete with them 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.080
 superwaffe because you have to look what 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.870
 one would rather like middle for stans 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.670
 distance both, the weapon is good too 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.680
 use 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.450
 yes that was it with these weapons gliding 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.890
 can now also the new dlc weapons 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.180
 I suggest the freedom of the 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.860
 you can also unlock these are so 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.080
 all except that driver rifle goes that 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.760
 not yet there you have to kills on 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.250
 do the level strike maps and we 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.640
 are not there yet that was it with this 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.000
 Video 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.000
 pure skin
