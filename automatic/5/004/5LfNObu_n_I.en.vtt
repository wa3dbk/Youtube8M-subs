00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
plans of course it separated from the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.140 
plans of course it separated from the

group and you see Clementine now how are
you<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.390> some<00:00:30.539> silhouettes<00:00:31.080> now<00:00:31.320> wondering

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you see some silhouettes now wondering

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.470 
you see some silhouettes now wondering
if<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.130> could<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.520> Walker's<00:00:33.000> or<00:00:33.210> could

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
if that could be just Walker's or could

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.540 
if that could be just Walker's or could
be<00:00:33.510> people<00:00:33.719> cuz<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.469> said<00:00:34.680> she<00:00:34.890> got<00:00:35.010> separated

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
be people cuz you said she got separated

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.549 
be people cuz you said she got separated
from<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> group<00:00:35.780> could<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.530> know

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
from the group could it be like you know

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.260 
from the group could it be like you know
definitely<00:00:37.860> walkers<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.670> background<00:00:39.059> or

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
definitely walkers in the background or

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
definitely walkers in the background or
could<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.870> new<00:00:39.930> group<00:00:40.290> she<00:00:40.530> found<00:00:40.829> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
could be like a new group she found so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.459 
could be like a new group she found so
my<00:00:41.610> guess<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.540> Walker's<00:00:43.020> because

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
my guess is that it's Walker's because

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.040 
my guess is that it's Walker's because
you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.300> guess<00:00:45.300> they're<00:00:45.510> trying<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> like

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you know I guess they're trying to like

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
you know I guess they're trying to like
you<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.430> isolate<00:00:47.430> come<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> time<00:00:47.820> from<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you know isolate come a time from the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420 
you know isolate come a time from the
group<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.360> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.690> every<00:00:49.320> no<00:00:49.739> developer

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
group a little bit every no developer

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
group a little bit every no developer
her<00:00:50.579> own<00:00:50.760> character<00:00:51.239> away<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.320> everyone

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
her own character away from everyone

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.040 
her own character away from everyone
else<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.180> her<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.660> learning

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
else and have you know her just learning

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
else and have you know her just learning
her<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.469> their<00:00:55.590> own<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.219> guess<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.969> she'll

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
her on their own so I guess that she'll

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.110 
her on their own so I guess that she'll
alone<00:00:57.570> hopefully<00:00:58.289> she<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.370> want

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
alone hopefully she is because I want

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.479 
alone hopefully she is because I want
her<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> actually<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.890> learn

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
her to actually you know just learn

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
her to actually you know just learn
survival<00:01:02.910> skills<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.660> her<00:01:03.809> own<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.769> when

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
survival skills on her own and then when

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.530 
survival skills on her own and then when
she<00:01:05.010> come<00:01:05.159> back<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> group<00:01:05.640> therefore<00:01:06.450> she

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
she come back to the group therefore she

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
she come back to the group therefore she
won't<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.260> know<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:08.159> don't<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.460> that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
won't have to know they don't think that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.070 
won't have to know they don't think that
she<00:01:08.729> uses<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.270> grow<00:01:09.420> anymore<00:01:09.659> she<00:01:09.869> just

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
she uses will grow anymore she just

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
she uses will grow anymore she just
learned<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.530> skills<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.100> she<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.580> used

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
learned some skills that she can be used

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.460

have path less traveled learning for our
skills<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:16.020> look<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.420> icon<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:19.350> looks

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
then I really getting right now but I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
then I really getting right now but I
have<00:01:27.570> no<00:01:27.750> idea<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.259> means<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
see what that he is because it could be

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
see what that he is because it could be
some<00:01:37.619> travel<00:01:37.979> kill<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:38.340> no<00:01:38.549> belt<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.030> I

a little bit he said back to the meeting
place<00:02:38.250> they<00:02:38.580> probably<00:02:38.820> had<00:02:39.720> some<00:02:40.110> kind<00:02:40.230> of

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
place they probably had some kind of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.620 
place they probably had some kind of
place<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.650> go<00:02:40.860> when<00:02:41.459> every<00:02:41.730> know<00:02:41.970> they<00:02:42.510> got

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
place to go when every know they got

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.840 
place to go when every know they got
separated<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.560> could<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:43.980> why<00:02:44.069> they<00:02:44.640> had

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
separated so that could be why they had

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.130 
separated so that could be why they had
a<00:02:45.030> meeting<00:02:45.060> place<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.780> came<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.050> get

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
separated so moving on from that to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.110 
separated so moving on from that to
those<00:02:49.410> two<00:02:49.530> achievements<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:50.190> making<00:02:51.000> an

those two achievements to making an

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
those two achievements to making an
observation<00:02:51.300> now<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.530> picture<00:02:52.920> we<00:02:52.950> see<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
observation now in this picture we see a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.220 
observation now in this picture we see a
can<00:02:53.730> now<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.060> wondering<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.750> actually<00:02:55.200> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
can now I'm wondering is actually a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.750 
can now I'm wondering is actually a
working<00:02:55.769> cannon<00:02:56.130> because<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.489> see<00:02:56.610> them

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
working cannon because I can see them

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.000 
working cannon because I can see them
actually<00:02:56.910> using<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.600> against<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> walkers<00:02:58.830> it

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
actually using it against the walkers it

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.979 
actually using it against the walkers it
could<00:02:59.310> be<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> prop<00:02:59.850> okay<00:03:00.450> because<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:00.900> a

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
could be a prop okay because it's a

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.390 
could be a prop okay because it's a
museum<00:03:01.410> but<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.650> really<00:03:01.890> hope<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.370> not

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
interesting because you see a walker and

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.910 
interesting because you see a walker and
do<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:26.940> see<00:03:27.120> some<00:03:27.299> bars<00:03:27.510> now<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.560> couldn't

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
kind of gay or something so that's why

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.380 
kind of gay or something so that's why
they<00:03:32.250> actually<00:03:32.610> had<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.820> got<00:03:32.940> away<00:03:33.150> from<00:03:33.209> the

they actually had to got away from the
walkers<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.870> everything<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.320> couldn't

what<00:04:48.680> we<00:04:48.800> see<00:04:48.979> there<00:04:49.009> so<00:04:49.370> it's<00:04:49.520> like<00:04:49.639> a<00:04:49.789> cross

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
what we see there so it's like a cross

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.510 
what we see there so it's like a cross
and<00:04:50.629> you<00:04:51.409> see<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.680> whole<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:52.009> know<00:04:52.099> stake<00:04:52.370> on

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
and you see the whole you know stake on

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.100 
and you see the whole you know stake on
it<00:04:52.639> so<00:04:52.789> it's<00:04:53.060> pretty<00:04:53.240> interesting<00:04:53.599> to<00:04:53.900> see<00:04:54.020> how

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
it so it's pretty interesting to see how

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.559 
it so it's pretty interesting to see how
that<00:04:54.259> happened<00:04:54.560> so<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:55.150> guess<00:04:56.150> when<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.360> church

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
that happened so I guess when the church

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.360 
that happened so I guess when the church
will<00:04:56.689> be<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.870> next<00:04:56.990> scenery<00:04:57.349> in<00:04:57.680> last<00:04:58.129> cent

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
will be the next scenery in last cent

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.890 
will be the next scenery in last cent
last<00:04:58.610> in<00:04:58.849> the<00:04:58.909> reading<00:04:59.090> episode<00:04:59.479> 4<00:04:59.690> where<00:04:59.840> they
