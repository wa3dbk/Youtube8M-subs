00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.480
 chapter of the labor party 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.359
 neus sanz 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:06.830
 of work 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.249
 the latest version of the program to some goal per side 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.319
 an interesting feature 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:14.749
 and if it is the work tables 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.749
 when we create a golden document 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.380
 of any nature that they have deserved 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.910
 he documented it with pepper could be any other 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.599
 ee 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.800
 It allows 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.529
 the possibility that 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.180
 talk about 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.059
 Start 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.129
 several working tables for example we are going to expand six work tables 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.510
 the goal of cosón beach like 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.260
 pages within the operation historically attempt had only one 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.810
 page 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.920
 a quartet from liverpool that won the team fearing 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.990
 badia illustrations 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.300
 or think blind to appointments 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.120
 now 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 connect incorporation of the work table 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.160
 created 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.960
 in the same document 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.290
 several pages 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.409
 even apply can have different size to each other 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 here we are 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.940
 we are preparing a document with six pages 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.930
 grant the working table here we can define as a citizen presented 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.630
 and is that at this time did not tremble common size to all 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 then you can modify 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.040
 here we have 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.340
 the six worktables 16 document 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.280
 6 and illustrations as it leads I suppose that you according to documents to the pacino or something 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.080
 similar 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.840
 the worktable tool 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.380
 allows you to configure each of the work tables 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.850
 for example make them have 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 different sizes 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.060
 and each one 'corresponds to a different graphic piece 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 let's see an example of a coordinated work 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.159
 to set up a job offer 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.259
 we simply have that we can put a man select it with tools 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.770
 work table 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.529
 we can put a man 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.189
 we can define the location of this work table in it 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.269
 the document window 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.269
 and the actual size society 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.009
 suppose we are going now to alternate document 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.169
 we are going to open a document the right one of the templates that brings the 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.809
 Program 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.159
 here 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.159
 we see that it is a job the area of ​​the capital 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.489
 of a company paper letter about 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.489
 a little 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.939
 the Euribor has followed a 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.569
 card 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.329
 of presentation 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.869
 all kinds of objects 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:53.929
 each other 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.249
 document 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.219
 It's in 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.219
 a different work table 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.339
 the 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.019
 the specific configuration of each one of them will be controlling with 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.169
 tool 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.389
 work table if selected we will see the size 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.319
 inclusive 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 double-clicking on the tool 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.919
 the worktable option will not appear 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.109
 we can also access it by double clicking on it 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.479
 on the aircraft 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.539
 the buyer of the of the panel chaired by the slogan work table 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.269
 here we have the name 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:45.209
 some default configuration is of size or with the size of width and a 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.799
 high 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.939
 in order that the series of options 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.829
 sword specifically setting up meadow killing 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.260
 In this case, they should point out that at the work table with whom they faced 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.499
 a substitution of courteous 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.499
 the huge work that for graphic 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.929
 he has his flight that is defined at the moment of plane commented then on it 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.010
 the joy of getting ahead 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.809
 cutting elements 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.329
 balance exceeding the limit 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.729
 print st 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.360
 then comes the provision of that work the tool work tables 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.539
 the worktable panel set up a system 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.289
 very interesting to fight 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.289
 in a single document 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.479
 different 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.849
 presentations 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.559
 of a work graficó in this case
