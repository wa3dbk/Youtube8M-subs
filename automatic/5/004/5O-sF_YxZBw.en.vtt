00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:08.720
 There is no dead human in our house 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.010
 as always but what did you do 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.050
 I that I do not know anything wants a 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.000
 explanation that I had never seen this 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.609
 kind before why did you kill this person 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.949
 expensive I did not kill people that's what 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.329
 I like to do less and better than that 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.589
 is exactly before it came to 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.989
 very good house very well 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.689
 I was up or I was reading a 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:29.329
 book if in my room it continues until 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:34.300
 good between this guy so I approached 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.300
 him and I stabbed him 37 times in the chest 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.860
 and that kills people or not did not know how 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.290
 I did not know, yes I was wrong 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.240
 I'm an idiot what happened with your hands 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.120
 what things your hands for because it is not so 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.330
 Well I kind of cut them and I 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.330
 I ate 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.960
 I know but I was hungry and it is not known 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.199
 be told why the hell is a craving for 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.600
 Do not make a scandal and a vacuum 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.149
 that only in the hands could God fill 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.979

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.979
 people and I like their hands happy 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.350
 what the hell was all that I do not know what 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 are you talking about a cruise 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.030
 whole carlos I assure you that it was me who 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.650
 I think he would remember something like that and how 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 firing is a harpoon to the face of 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.759
 capital sounds danger if nothing gets 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.049
 work of children with a head 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.580
 see if a horrible show and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.470
 after you started kissing with the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.409
 ice sculpture thank god that 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.030
 the children were not there to see that 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.250
 because our boat is red and sticky 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.770
 I suppose if it's red and sticky 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.119
 You guessed that strawberry glaze 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.429

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.710
 croissants and I can believe what I hear 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.420
 I'm going to apologize for the art where 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.979
 are the other boats a genius ni 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.570
 I had even noticed the boats 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.210
 lifeguard to judge by the trajectory 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.649
 of the sun and the moon probably in the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.409
 I made a lot of ocean 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.250
 holes I have a problem I have a 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.380
 serious problem are you these terrible today 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.330
 do you hear that 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.850
 that is the sound of people drowning 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.020
 that's how forgiveness sounds first 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.020
 screams and then silence 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.560
 we should be on vacation I do not know about you 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.200
 but I 'm having a great time with rock 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.270
 until the South American government the town 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.680
 has spoken alive the resistance pushes 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.330
 until the leader of the resistance a 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.280
 giant fan is a traitor 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.990
 scoundrel was trying to avoid 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.750
 that push more people to the fan 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.490
 giant ok is about a 10 such it seems that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.140
 I bring a whole person that would be 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.420
 the hotel bartender that would explain 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.290
 because my mojito took so long 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.209
 horrifying your mouth is like a 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.340
 deranged snake or that's a 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.780
 I can not travel with you anymore 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.910
 you are my feelings now both 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.230
 we're wrong I want to go home in this 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.520
 case I think I should mention that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.230
 They have our suitcases with meat from 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.520
 orphans that I'm building a 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.530
 dragon of flesh and I will not settle for 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.150
 any meat you know forget it already 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.010
 I'm even surprised that it's not 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.780
 fun this is like a rule for you 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.550
 I'll have to try harder next 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.320
 please I do not feel that you gave me a 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.940
 challenge is too late you do not 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.140
 I have an idea what your name is, we know each other 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.510
 for three years 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.320
 and baix impression you left me my name is 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.970
 that I said my name is and I thought 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.490
 that is not a woman because you would think that 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.980
 hat machine is safe 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.030
 oh well if you excuse me I have to go to 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.030
 delete some pictures from my computer 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.710
 of all the mud carpet that yes that 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.990
 it's a disaster they had just cleaned 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.850
 yesterday I am not the responsible one I was 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.680
 playing the saxophone all day is clear 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.060
 that are your meat prints then there are 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.430
 a loose imposter go directly 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.290
 towards you track number one the imposter is 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.290
 a ghost stops avoiding 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.190
 happy birthday is not my tell me not 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.340
 you had nothing to do with this that did not 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.540
 blow the candles too far not you 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.310
 I listen for the sound of the city 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.310
 melting you did it 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.540
 funny and who laughs sure not the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.070
 people that exploded I'm leaving I had 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.350
 enough but think of all the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.479
 past faces that we can eat because 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.710
 because we are friends and friendship is like 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.750
 Two brothers eating a good face 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.100
 cooked that's not friendship is sickly 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.990
 then you may not like your 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:39.050
 birthday decoration is not even 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.669
 my or by God surprise I do not feel it I think 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.139
 that you liked the faces obviously a 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.070
 communication problem this is 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.990
 horrible 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.000
 you're right seemed the best taste my 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.650
 head I think I'm going to vomit hate is 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.110
 one touched me I think it did not go very well 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.910
 it seems expensive that I can say I thought 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.820
 it would be more cooked the raw faces give 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.560
 Loathing the problem why you think this 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.940
 it would be a good idea maybe because I am 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.529
 a dangerous sociopath with a long 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.410
 history of evidence 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:14.660
 I do not understand how you always forget 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:14.660
