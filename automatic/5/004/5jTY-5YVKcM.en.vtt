00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
people like adults then they tend to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.490 
people like adults then they tend to

them<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.979> used<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.760> treat<00:01:09.000> if

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
them like we used to do if we treat if

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.460 
them like we used to do if we treat if
you<00:01:09.180> treat<00:01:09.450> them<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.659> George<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> all
