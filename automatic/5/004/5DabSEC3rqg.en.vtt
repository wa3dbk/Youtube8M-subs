this<00:00:00.849> is<00:00:01.000> called<00:00:01.240> the<00:00:01.360> g<00:00:01.569> zero<00:00:01.630> seven<00:00:02.610> it's<00:00:03.610> a

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:03.759 
this is called the g zero seven it's a

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:05.999 
this is called the g zero seven it's a
16<00:00:04.150> 803<00:00:04.630> sensor<00:00:05.050> in<00:00:05.230> it<00:00:05.260> you<00:00:05.530> can<00:00:05.680> have<00:00:05.800> a<00:00:05.830> lot

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:06.009 
16 803 sensor in it you can have a lot

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.009 
16 803 sensor in it you can have a lot
of<00:00:06.130> different<00:00:06.430> sensors<00:00:06.850> this<00:00:07.450> has<00:00:07.660> a<00:00:07.690> 2

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:08.019 
of different sensors this has a 2

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.049 
of different sensors this has a 2
megahertz<00:00:08.440> network<00:00:09.040> interface<00:00:09.490> on<00:00:09.730> it<00:00:09.849> so<00:00:10.000> as

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
megahertz network interface on it so as

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.870 
megahertz network interface on it so as
twice<00:00:10.390> as<00:00:10.630> fast<00:00:10.900> as<00:00:11.140> our<00:00:11.700> regular<00:00:12.700> effort

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
twice as fast as our regular effort

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.570 
twice as fast as our regular effort
regular<00:00:13.630> use<00:00:13.809> series<00:00:14.170> cameras<00:00:14.650> but<00:00:15.250> it's<00:00:15.400> in<00:00:15.519> a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
regular use series cameras but it's in a

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.939 
regular use series cameras but it's in a
network<00:00:15.910> configuration<00:00:16.689> it<00:00:17.109> also<00:00:17.259> has<00:00:17.560> a<00:00:17.589> USB

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
network configuration it also has a USB

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.040 
network configuration it also has a USB
2.0<00:00:18.699> interface<00:00:18.730> on<00:00:19.419> it<00:00:19.569> and<00:00:19.929> it's

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
2.0 interface on it and it's

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.859 
2.0 interface on it and it's
auto-sensing<00:00:20.589> so<00:00:21.009> you<00:00:21.099> can<00:00:21.279> use<00:00:21.400> either<00:00:21.609> or<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
auto-sensing so you can use either or a

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.079 
auto-sensing so you can use either or a
lot<00:00:23.289> of<00:00:23.409> new<00:00:23.529> refinements<00:00:24.279> are<00:00:24.429> it<00:00:24.699> has<00:00:24.849> the

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
lot of new refinements are it has the

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:29.309 
lot of new refinements are it has the
deep<00:00:25.269> cooling<00:00:26.429> standard<00:00:27.460> so<00:00:28.119> this<00:00:28.689> particular

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:29.319 
deep cooling standard so this particular

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.310 
deep cooling standard so this particular
unit<00:00:29.829> has<00:00:29.859> the<00:00:30.159> same<00:00:30.399> cooling<00:00:31.269> as<00:00:31.449> our<00:00:31.599> v9<00:00:31.989> hot

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
unit has the same cooling as our v9 hot

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.290 
unit has the same cooling as our v9 hot
cooling<00:00:32.680> unit<00:00:32.980> except<00:00:33.550> it's<00:00:33.670> more<00:00:33.850> compact

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
cooling unit except it's more compact

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.470 
cooling unit except it's more compact
and<00:00:35.190> everything<00:00:36.190> about<00:00:36.430> this<00:00:36.640> was<00:00:36.700> redesigned

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
and everything about this was redesigned

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.530 
and everything about this was redesigned
from<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:37.750> ground<00:00:37.840> up<00:00:38.290> it<00:00:38.830> has<00:00:39.390> basically<00:00:40.390> it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
from the ground up it has basically it

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.390 
from the ground up it has basically it
has<00:00:40.690> all<00:00:40.930> these<00:00:41.050> graduated<00:00:41.650> field<00:00:41.860> stops<00:00:42.130> in

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
has all these graduated field stops in

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.950 
has all these graduated field stops in

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
it everything inside the chamber is

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.340 
it everything inside the chamber is
black<00:00:44.260> now<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.700> still<00:00:46.090> has<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.570> residual

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
black now and still has the residual

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.550 
black now and still has the residual
imaging<00:00:47.830> you<00:00:48.130> know<00:00:48.250> IR<00:00:48.730> LED<00:00:49.120> flash<00:00:49.420> but<00:00:50.260> anyway

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
imaging you know IR LED flash but anyway

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.290 
imaging you know IR LED flash but anyway
everything<00:00:51.010> inside<00:00:51.310> this<00:00:51.460> whole<00:00:51.670> system<00:00:51.910> is

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
everything inside this whole system is

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.810 
everything inside this whole system is
is<00:00:52.900> now<00:00:53.140> completely<00:00:53.620> black<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.400> there's<00:00:54.550> all

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
is now completely black and there's all

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.700 
is now completely black and there's all
these<00:00:55.000> new<00:00:55.060> fill<00:00:55.450> stops<00:00:55.810> in<00:00:56.079> it

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
these new fill stops in it

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.640 
these new fill stops in it
they<00:00:57.490> spent<00:00:57.790> tens<00:00:58.480> of<00:00:58.720> hours<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:59.230> flow<00:00:59.440> design

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
they spent tens of hours of flow design

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.220 
they spent tens of hours of flow design
to<00:01:00.040> figure<00:01:00.280> out<00:01:00.430> this<00:01:00.579> new<00:01:00.760> cooling<00:01:01.150> system<00:01:01.600> it

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
to figure out this new cooling system it

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.139 
to figure out this new cooling system it
uses<00:01:02.590> heat<00:01:02.770> pins<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:03.400> is<00:01:03.550> basically<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.970> huge

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
uses heat pins this is basically a huge

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.289 
uses heat pins this is basically a huge
piece<00:01:04.509> of<00:01:04.659> copper<00:01:05.079> it's<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:06.969> nickel

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
piece of copper it's it's a nickel

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.200 
piece of copper it's it's a nickel
coated<00:01:07.689> so<00:01:08.170> it's<00:01:08.289> really<00:01:08.439> high<00:01:08.770> quality<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
coated so it's really high quality you

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.169 
coated so it's really high quality you
change<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.689> look<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:10.990> little<00:01:11.109> bit<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:11.969> so<00:01:12.969> this

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
change the look a little bit and so this

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.959 
change the look a little bit and so this
is<00:01:13.299> our<00:01:13.450> new<00:01:13.659> Aspen<00:01:14.229> series<00:01:14.619> line<00:01:14.859> this<00:01:15.819> will

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
is our new Aspen series line this will

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.989 
is our new Aspen series line this will
adapt<00:01:16.270> directly<00:01:16.869> whether<00:01:17.219> FW<00:01:18.219> 50<00:01:18.549> filter

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999

wheels the back focus on these with this
enhance<00:01:22.389> cooling<00:01:22.840> it's<00:01:22.960> only<00:01:23.109> one-inch<00:01:23.439> we're

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
enhance cooling it's only one-inch we're

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.639 
enhance cooling it's only one-inch we're
on<00:01:24.219> the<00:01:24.369> d9<00:01:24.670> system<00:01:25.659> that<00:01:25.840> people<00:01:26.139> used<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.439> use

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
on the d9 system that people used to use

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.980 
on the d9 system that people used to use
it<00:01:26.920> was<00:01:27.039> one<00:01:27.219> point<00:01:27.520> three<00:01:27.700> six<00:01:27.999> three<00:01:28.119> this<00:01:28.840> is

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
it was one point three six three this is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.359 
it was one point three six three this is
only<00:01:29.109> one-inch<00:01:29.439> so<00:01:29.829> you<00:01:29.920> can<00:01:30.039> use<00:01:30.159> them<00:01:30.280> with

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
only one-inch so you can use them with

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.550 
only one-inch so you can use them with
camera<00:01:30.850> lenses<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:32.049> it's<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.259> lot<00:01:32.409> more

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
camera lenses so it's a lot more

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.669 
camera lenses so it's a lot more
versatile<00:01:33.039> product<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.729> there<00:01:34.479> we've<00:01:35.469> got<00:01:35.499> a

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
versatile product and there we've got a

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.380 
versatile product and there we've got a
whole<00:01:35.920> different<00:01:35.950> line<00:01:36.549> of

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
whole different line of

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.210 
whole different line of
of<00:01:37.540> asking<00:01:38.020> systems<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.620> you<00:01:38.710> can<00:01:38.740> look<00:01:39.040> at

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
of asking systems that you can look at

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.790 
of asking systems that you can look at
the<00:01:39.910> different<00:01:40.300> optical<00:01:40.720> configurations<00:01:41.560> for

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
the different optical configurations for

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.250 
the different optical configurations for
them<00:01:42.070> we<00:01:42.670> even<00:01:42.880> have<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:43.630> hot<00:01:43.870> coolant

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
them we even have a really hot coolant

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.520 
them we even have a really hot coolant
called<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.800> g0<00:01:45.070> nun<00:01:45.670> which<00:01:46.480> even<00:01:46.780> surpasses<00:01:47.380> our

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
called a g0 nun which even surpasses our

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.800 
called a g0 nun which even surpasses our

Aldine on my cooling system but

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.620 
Aldine on my cooling system but
essentially<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.740> g7<00:01:51.340> now<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.730> standard<00:01:52.240> hot

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
essentially the g7 now is standard hot

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.810 
essentially the g7 now is standard hot
coolant<00:01:52.870> for<00:01:53.200> all<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.410> our<00:01:53.500> CDs<00:01:54.070> in<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.370> Aspen

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.690 
coolant for all of our CDs in the Aspen
series<00:01:55.440> so<00:01:56.440> if<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.770> end<00:01:56.950> user<00:01:57.040> wants<00:01:57.640> to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
series so if the end user wants to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.110 
series so if the end user wants to
upgrade<00:01:58.000> they<00:01:58.450> could<00:01:58.630> still<00:01:58.900> use<00:01:59.140> their<00:01:59.410> same

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
upgrade they could still use their same

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.810 
upgrade they could still use their same
exactly<00:02:01.120> exactly<00:02:01.660> if<00:02:02.590> they<00:02:03.100> have<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> current

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
exactly exactly if they have a current

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.550 
exactly exactly if they have a current
system<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:04.930> they'd<00:02:05.020> like<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.230> get<00:02:05.470> the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
system and they'd like to get the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.560 
system and they'd like to get the
network<00:02:05.860> interface<00:02:06.310> they<00:02:06.970> could<00:02:07.150> go<00:02:07.300> ahead

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
network interface they could go ahead

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.380 
network interface they could go ahead
and<00:02:07.780> take<00:02:08.530> their<00:02:08.740> 16<00:02:09.190> 803<00:02:09.610> chip<00:02:09.910> or<00:02:10.090> whatever

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
and take their 16 803 chip or whatever

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.290 
and take their 16 803 chip or whatever
type<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.630> chip<00:02:10.960> upgrade<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.980> into<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.430> Aspen

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
type of chip upgrade it into the Aspen

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.710 
type of chip upgrade it into the Aspen
Series<00:02:13.600> body<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:15.030> basically<00:02:16.030> we<00:02:16.270> still<00:02:16.540> have

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
Series body so basically we still have

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.890 
Series body so basically we still have
that<00:02:16.870> upgrade<00:02:17.260> path<00:02:17.530> all<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.950> way<00:02:18.070> up<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
that upgrade path all the way up so and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.570 
that upgrade path all the way up so and
there's<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.500> couple<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.920> other<00:02:21.070> things<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.550> want

to mention to you other than the Aspen

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.330 
to mention to you other than the Aspen
and<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:25.350> package<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.770> something

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and that is the package is something

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.030 
and that is the package is something

over

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
over

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.580 
over
basically<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.330> take<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:41.290> ascent

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
basically you can take the ascent

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.190 
basically you can take the ascent
packages<00:02:42.130> like<00:02:42.280> an<00:02:42.459> 8<00:02:42.640> megapixel<00:02:42.970> imager<00:02:43.720> and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
packages like an 8 megapixel imager and

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.080 
packages like an 8 megapixel imager and
combine<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.709> with<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.980> proprietary<00:02:45.280> interface

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
combine it with a proprietary interface

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.840 
combine it with a proprietary interface
hook<00:02:46.780> your<00:02:46.959> filter<00:02:47.260> will<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.820> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
hook your filter will to it so the the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.699 
hook your filter will to it so the the
scent<00:02:49.300> only<00:02:49.510> has<00:02:49.690> 8<00:02:49.870> millimeters<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.560> back

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
scent only has 8 millimeters of back

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.979 
scent only has 8 millimeters of back
focus<00:02:51.190> now<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:52.090> put<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.269> camera<00:02:52.570> lens<00:02:52.810> on

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
focus now you can put a camera lens on

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.570 
focus now you can put a camera lens on
this<00:02:53.200> you've<00:02:53.380> got<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> built-in<00:02:53.950> filter<00:02:54.370> wheel

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
this you've got a built-in filter wheel

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.090 
this you've got a built-in filter wheel
but<00:02:55.150> still<00:02:55.360> got<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.630> same<00:02:55.870> mechanical

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
but still got the same mechanical

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.920 
but still got the same mechanical
positioning<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.250> we're<00:02:57.430> famous<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.870> our

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
positioning that we're famous for in our

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.300 
positioning that we're famous for in our
filter<00:02:59.320> wheels<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.830> now<00:02:59.980> you've<00:03:00.130> got<00:03:00.160> a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
filter wheels so now you've got a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.270 
filter wheels so now you've got a
complete<00:03:00.700> package<00:03:01.180> for<00:03:01.209> 3695<00:03:02.200> i'm<00:03:02.860> theory

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
complete package for 3695 i'm theory

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.430 
complete package for 3695 i'm theory
nanase<00:03:03.670> okay<00:03:04.390> that's<00:03:04.720> definitely<00:03:05.260> something

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
nanase okay that's definitely something

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.170 
nanase okay that's definitely something
I<00:03:05.590> want<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.769> bring<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:05.950> your<00:03:06.130> attention<00:03:06.190> we

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
I want to bring to your attention we

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.290 
I want to bring to your attention we
still<00:03:07.420> have<00:03:07.630> some<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.050> Alta<00:03:08.410> f-series

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
still have some of the Alta f-series

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.970 
still have some of the Alta f-series
cameras<00:03:10.300> we<00:03:10.540> went<00:03:10.750> from<00:03:10.840> an<00:03:11.019> alter<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.560> series

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
cameras we went from an alter you series

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.880 
cameras we went from an alter you series
to<00:03:12.220> an<00:03:12.280> alter<00:03:12.580> f-series<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:14.140> now<00:03:14.320> in<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.560> Alta

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
to an alter f-series and now in the Alta

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.680 
to an alter f-series and now in the Alta
f-series

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
f-series

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.570 
f-series
it's<00:03:16.690> essentially<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> same<00:03:17.410> as<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.130> old<00:03:18.340> you

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
it's essentially the same as the old you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.180 
it's essentially the same as the old you
series<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.209> just<00:03:19.390> faster<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.769> can<00:03:20.890> run<00:03:21.070> up

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
series it's just faster you can run up

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.050 
series it's just faster you can run up
to<00:03:21.220> 8<00:03:21.459> megahertz<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.450> can<00:03:22.630> also<00:03:23.670> run<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.880> dual

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
to 8 megahertz you can also run in dual

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.699 
to 8 megahertz you can also run in dual
channel<00:03:25.480> mode<00:03:25.600> for<00:03:25.959> since<00:03:26.140> there's<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.410> support

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
channel mode for since there's a support

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.530 
channel mode for since there's a support
dual<00:03:26.920> channel<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.940> can<00:03:28.060> run<00:03:28.209> up<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.360> 8

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
dual channel you can run up to 8

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.300 
dual channel you can run up to 8
megahertz<00:03:28.870> per<00:03:29.260> channel<00:03:29.590> that's<00:03:29.920> 16

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
megahertz per channel that's 16

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.150 
megahertz per channel that's 16
megahertz<00:03:30.610> total<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.260> we<00:03:32.410> still<00:03:32.680> have<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
megahertz total so so we still have the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.670 
megahertz total so so we still have the
Aspen<00:03:33.970> Evelyn<00:03:34.390> we<00:03:34.630> have<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.900> Aspen<00:03:35.260> series

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
Aspen Evelyn we have the Aspen series

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
Aspen Evelyn we have the Aspen series
the<00:03:36.390> cent<00:03:37.390> series<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.110> now

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
the cent series and now

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.880 
the cent series and now
the<00:03:38.849> alte<00:03:39.540> f-series<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.410> there's<00:03:40.680> three

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
the alte f-series so there's three

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.309 
the alte f-series so there's three
different<00:03:41.069> camera<00:03:41.670> lines<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.900> still<00:03:43.140> got<00:03:43.290> all

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
different camera lines you still got all

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.339 
different camera lines you still got all
your<00:03:43.620> filter<00:03:43.980> wheels<00:03:44.900> let's<00:03:45.900> say<00:03:46.080> three

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
your filter wheels let's say three

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.900 
your filter wheels let's say three
different<00:03:46.680> camera<00:03:47.040> lines<00:03:47.250> we've<00:03:47.580> got<00:03:47.760> new

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
different camera lines we've got new
