00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.880
 friends, hello to you, total and games 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.980
 just literally about 5 minutes ago came out 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.369
 gta 5 trailer 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.970
 until the 60fps version I looked at it 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 sales gave more but generally happy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.690
 the fact that the game is stable 60 fps is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.760
 can be seen right in the trailer 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.390
 Of course, some moments showed 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:45.860
 with action that is shown even 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.920
 road textures 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.500
 the police were there showed texture 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.840
 reflection of the world for example in 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.250
 the same puddle 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 that is, well, you can safely say 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.680
 that everything will be stable game 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.619
 finally optimized yes because 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.470
 it is in principle and the principle is the version of the game 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.679
 for 5 1 and 4 . 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.800
 already lost count but the trainer 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:16.440
 pretty not bad but I'll repeat 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.050
 expected more don't know why here 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.910
 I probably put some big 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.110
 hopes for a version but none the less 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.170
 can with confidence 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.440
 state gruen I will not tolerate standing 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.860
 the end of the coach is written release date then 14 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.910
 April 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.780
 so you can already enjoy date with 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.569
 order the game, it has not yet pre-ordered 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.250
 Basically there is no pure soul and wait for 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:47.849
 reboot that when booting will 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.970
 somewhere around April 10 plus or minus 1 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.970
 de 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.050
 there you can already play with 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:02:03.149
 stable fps given how i already 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:06.500
 again said the same before in the coach 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.800
 it's all clearly demonstrated 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.360
 so friends are waiting and waiting with loyalty 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.500
 do not remember the joy of two years 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.230
 wait for the game and finally live without difficulty 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.660
 that it will not be transferred again and the game is already 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.630
 more game will come out 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.080
 Well, even tested and where already 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.350
 tester and even laid out their tests 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.930
 games that is, everything is there. 8th okay, I 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.490
 I will discuss everything in the next video 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.490
