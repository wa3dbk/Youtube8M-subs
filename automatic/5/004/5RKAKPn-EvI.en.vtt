00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
i'll just show you this cutout on the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.750 
i'll just show you this cutout on the
back<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.289> actually<00:00:16.379> really<00:00:16.830> fiddly<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.430> open

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
back it's actually really fiddly to open

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.689 
back it's actually really fiddly to open
so<00:00:18.330> I've<00:00:18.390> left<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.750> slightly<00:00:19.080> open<00:00:19.640> just<00:00:20.640> for

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
so I've left that slightly open just for

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.769 
so I've left that slightly open just for
the<00:00:20.850> purpose<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> review<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.539> got<00:00:21.660> off

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the purpose of the review you got off

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.340 
the purpose of the review you got off
some<00:00:21.960> nails<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.439> don't<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:22.980> any<00:00:23.160> nails<00:00:23.369> so

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
some nails I don't have any nails so

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.720 
some nails I don't have any nails so
slightly<00:00:25.350> hard<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.650> open<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.670> see

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
slightly hard to open up as you can see

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.700 
slightly hard to open up as you can see
so<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.539> isn't<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> type<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> case<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.349> want

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
so this isn't the type of case you want

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.929 
so this isn't the type of case you want
if<00:00:28.859> you're<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.070> looking<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.429> take<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> quick

if you're just looking to take a quick

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.620 
if you're just looking to take a quick
photo<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.380> real<00:00:31.500> protection<00:00:32.630> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
photo this is for real protection so

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.600 
photo this is for real protection so
there's<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.680> case<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.010> comes<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.340> three

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
there's this case that comes in three

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850 
there's this case that comes in three
separate<00:00:36.000> parts<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> back<00:00:37.559> you've<00:00:37.829> got

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
separate parts on the back you've got

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.080 
separate parts on the back you've got
this<00:00:38.149> sort<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> rock-solid<00:00:40.070> case<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.969> then

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
this sort of rock-solid case and then

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.369 
this sort of rock-solid case and then
inside<00:00:42.390> you've<00:00:42.570> got<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.719> couple<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.020> spongy

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
pads on that for impact protection

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.750
