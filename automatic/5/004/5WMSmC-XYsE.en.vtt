00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.700
 Hey, I'll tell you about putting off for later. 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.340
 I'm just on the plane coming back from the Philippines, so I have some time to 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.780
 to make a recording, I've just finished 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.480
 to read such a book "Strength of Will" is there 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.640
 a lot of facts, it's not an easy book 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.780
 read, because you have to think a little over it, 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.860
 but I can recommend you as much as possible. this 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.660
 the book reminded me of a few things that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.220
 I did not have the opportunity to say before. 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.920
 What to postpone for later, listen to it, 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.860
 that 95 percent of people according to various surveys 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.600
 Research puts off later, 95 percent, no 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.340
 I suspect that these 5 percent, well just in 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.540
 these surveys are lying, so unfortunately, everyone 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.740
 of us put off for later only that some are 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.880
 larger throwers and other smaller ones. 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.020
 Fifty percent of people do notoriously postpone after 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.860
 just addictive, puts things down for later 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.320
 there are those who do not like it a bit 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.480
 cope more. So I can give you as far as possible 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.820
 simple ways to deal with it. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.160
 Look, I really think that 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.900
 the biggest problem is if everything 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.720
 you are in your head and you can not take it for yourself 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 job, because it's overwhelming you, I have it 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.400
 a simple method, I do not keep things in my head 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.560
 to do, I have a notebook when I'm traveling 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.580
 I have a suitable notebook for it, everything 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.960
 what I have to do, I note myself, 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.360
 all ideas, all tasks, all 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.940
 things to do I write to myself, 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 if he spills it onto a piece of paper, it's like a head 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.180
 cleanses. So then you can calmly with it, 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.100
 what is saved, go to the plan and start 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.020
 then slowly implement. There is a GTD method 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.520
 (Get this down) Allen, he did it for many years 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.540
 ago, there is a book about it, wrote about 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.220
 including a book, he did training on this subject. This 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.480
 it is the method of coping 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.080
 with a huge amount of tasks that they can do to some 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.220
 collapse the desk with a hundred papers, affairs 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.080
 'Nieprzerobienia'. And he describes in this book 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.820
 how to deal with it, you know what, I would 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.020
 here from this book two cool things. One 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.340
 the thing was like I have something to do, 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.500
 What can I do within 2 minutes, i.e. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.340
 I look at this list of how I can do it 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.340
 right away, I just take it and do it right away 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.180
 and then many sentences just very quickly 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.440
 you can plot from this list and go 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.440
 man very fast forward. The second thing 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.520
 it is having either appropriate cabinets 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.640
 or such t-shirts for documents where 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.000
 you have at least the next three months 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.480
 sorted out what you're doing on this day, if you have one 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.960
 some meetings and it's all sorted out, 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.540
 you can do the same through a computer, 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.120
 I do not agree with the computer, no 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.400
 it fits, even though I work a lot on my computer, 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.600
 how I put it on some shirts better 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.020
 I cope with tasks because I see here 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.820
 there is something there, there is something to do there. 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.980
 I'll tell you how cool it is with postponing 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.380
 people who have to work a lot 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.780
 because it depends on them to be or not to be 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.760
 earnings, writers. There are various writers, I am 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.480
 I will tell you how it is with the writers who are 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.420
 the most prolific writers. Well, most 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.960
 Flirty writers, they do something that they have 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.160
 just fixed working hours, some 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.200
 they have to say, right after getting up, they're working, 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.940
 others have at noon, others in the evening, but 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.060
 they always have to say an hour or three hours, 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.640
 or some time measured there when they are sitting 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.360
 at the desk and work. 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.560
 There are some here 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.520
 those who measure exactly how much to write 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.480
 words or sentences or words in a given space 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.560
 time, then they just concentrate like that 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.040
 just to start doing it. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.740
 The human mind somehow does 

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.860
 it's interesting to work 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.960
 improve your effectiveness to improve 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.880
 your self-control, because it really is 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.420
 the issue of self-control, it's good to measure, 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.000
 it means it is not good it is brilliant. 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.120
 This is brilliant, if you measure it, 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.320
 what are you doing. How to do it? You know what's in me 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.240
 I have a few things that I do 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.040
 and in every field I have a table there 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.860
 in Excel, where I write some data 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.540
 and I know day after day if I'm going to 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.280
 mountains, or I'm going down. Ok, but let's say 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.400
 on the example of slimming, if I were to lose weight 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.360
 I would do it in such a way that I would measure my weight if I was on 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.160
 the space of the month 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.420
 whether I see two months or this chart 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.740
 goes down or up, then I know 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.260
 what progress I make or what progress I have not made 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.800
 I do if I study the language intensively 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.300
 I would write the same number of words every day 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.480
 I learned and then in some space 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.780
 there you can determine the period of time 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.640
 whether you are growing or moving back. 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.880
 Good plane right now, because I can hear the message 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.660
 will start, because I preferred to record it now, because how 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.640
 we'll be in the air, it's going to be that noise 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.340
 that you will not hear. But by the way 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.060
 I can show you what a business class looks like, because 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.280
 from here I fly first to Abu-Dhabi and then to Europe. 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.320
 You are just going to chase afterwards, I will tell you. 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.880
 I'll show you what a business class looks like, maybe not 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.720
 You had the opportunity, look here is the place to go 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.380
 seat and even to sleep, because it gets 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.620
 nice blanket, waiting for later, 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.860
 standard headphones, but you get something like that, 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.000
 what you do not get elsewhere. 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.120
 I think it's a nice place, I'll show you 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.300
 what exactly is it, so bajer to sleep, 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.360
 here some other gadgets, socks, 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.160
 some cosmetics, cosmetics 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.620
 and probably washing equipment 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.860
 teeth and yet, I have to help myself with teeth, 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.120
 also a continuation of cosmetics, more for ladies. 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.960
 You see, that's how the first class looks like, 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.120
 business class exactly. 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.960
 I wish you, that in the future, you would fly something like that, because 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.360
 on long distances, the possibility of getting enough sleep, 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.520
 something fantastic, price ... but you know everything is for people.
