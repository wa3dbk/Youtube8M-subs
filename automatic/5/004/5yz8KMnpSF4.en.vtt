little<00:00:32.290> lens<00:00:32.500> unit<00:00:33.420> gives<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.510> equivalent<00:00:34.960> of

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:35.049 
little lens unit gives the equivalent of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
28 to 300 millimeters it's a lens it's a

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.600 
28 to 300 millimeters it's a lens it's a
shutter<00:00:39.729> it's<00:00:40.180> a<00:00:40.479> sensor<00:00:40.989> they<00:00:41.979> do<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.220> number

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
shutter it's a sensor they do a number

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.969 
shutter it's a sensor they do a number
of<00:00:42.879> prime<00:00:43.180> lenses<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:43.870> zoom<00:00:44.229> lenses<00:00:44.589> and<00:00:44.739> each

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
of prime lenses and zoom lenses and each

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.990 
of prime lenses and zoom lenses and each
follow<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.580> same<00:00:45.870> configuration<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
follow the same configuration the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.509 
follow the same configuration the
benefit<00:00:49.659> of<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.869> is<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.470> they<00:00:50.949> can<00:00:50.979> choose

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
benefit of that is that they can choose

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.729 
benefit of that is that they can choose
to<00:00:51.760> change<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.269> sensor<00:00:52.690> size<00:00:52.869> to<00:00:53.229> suit<00:00:53.500> the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
to change the sensor size to suit the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.520 
to change the sensor size to suit the
lens<00:00:53.979> that<00:00:54.220> they<00:00:54.400> wish<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.690> put<00:00:55.690> in<00:00:55.839> it<00:00:56.049> for

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
lens that they wish to put in it for

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.100 
lens that they wish to put in it for
example<00:00:57.040> this<00:00:57.460> gives<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.089> 28<00:00:58.479> to<00:00:58.600> 300

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
example this gives you the 28 to 300

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.439 
example this gives you the 28 to 300
equivalent<00:00:59.769> well<00:01:00.309> usually<00:01:00.939> that<00:01:01.119> would<00:01:01.210> mean

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
equivalent well usually that would mean

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.170 
equivalent well usually that would mean
the<00:01:01.839> lens<00:01:02.049> would<00:01:02.170> be<00:01:02.290> absolutely<00:01:03.129> massive<00:01:03.369> so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
the lens would be absolutely massive so

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.240 
the lens would be absolutely massive so
to<00:01:04.239> combat<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.989> they<00:01:05.409> put<00:01:05.619> in<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.860> smaller

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
to combat that they put in a smaller

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.030 
to combat that they put in a smaller
sensor<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.300> by<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.570> smaller<00:01:07.900> sensor<00:01:08.500> they<00:01:08.860> can

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
sensor and by a smaller sensor they can

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.800 
sensor and by a smaller sensor they can
therefore<00:01:09.250> do<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.520> shorter<00:01:10.030> focal<00:01:10.210> length<00:01:10.510> lens

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
therefore do a shorter focal length lens

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.960 
therefore do a shorter focal length lens
to<00:01:11.320> give<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.800> equivalent<00:01:12.100> keeping

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
to give you the equivalent keeping

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.330 
to give you the equivalent keeping
things<00:01:13.210> nice<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.630> compact<00:01:14.100> simply<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:15.280> if

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
things nice and compact simply so if

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.940 
things nice and compact simply so if
they<00:01:15.490> do<00:01:15.700> wide<00:01:16.360> lenses<00:01:16.900> or<00:01:17.260> there's<00:01:17.830> some

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
they do wide lenses or there's some

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.980 
they do wide lenses or there's some
there<00:01:18.100> Prime's<00:01:18.430> they<00:01:18.970> put<00:01:19.180> in<00:01:19.300> a<00:01:19.390> larger

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
there Prime's they put in a larger

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.900 
there Prime's they put in a larger
sensor<00:01:20.500> always<00:01:20.860> giving<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.400> 35mm

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
sensor always giving you the 35mm

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.970 
sensor always giving you the 35mm
equivalent<00:01:22.240> but<00:01:23.080> because<00:01:23.440> they<00:01:23.560> can<00:01:23.740> change

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
equivalent but because they can change

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.890 
equivalent but because they can change
that<00:01:24.220> sensor<00:01:24.760> means<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.420> whole<00:01:25.600> system

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
that sensor means that the whole system

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.980 
that sensor means that the whole system
can<00:01:26.680> retain<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.070> really<00:01:27.520> compact<00:01:28.030> size<00:01:28.330> but

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
can retain a really compact size but

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.649 
can retain a really compact size but
also<00:01:29.140> give<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.470> great<00:01:29.650> quality<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:31.000> simple

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
also give you great quality I'm simple

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.810 
also give you great quality I'm simple
to<00:01:31.780> use<00:01:32.020> very<00:01:32.650> strong<00:01:32.770> little<00:01:33.400> system

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
to use very strong little system

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.210 
to use very strong little system
obviously<00:01:34.720> because<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.260> lens<00:01:35.470> units<00:01:35.980> and<00:01:36.159> the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
obviously because the lens units and the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.580 
obviously because the lens units and the
shutters<00:01:36.610> are<00:01:36.850> integrated<00:01:37.780> then<00:01:38.230> you<00:01:38.409> don't

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
shutters are integrated then you don't

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.230 
shutters are integrated then you don't
have<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.830> worry<00:01:39.070> about<00:01:39.220> dust<00:01:39.580> problems<00:01:40.090> which

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
have to worry about dust problems which

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.180 
have to worry about dust problems which
you<00:01:40.270> would<00:01:40.510> do<00:01:40.630> with<00:01:40.659> an<00:01:40.840> SLR<00:01:41.230> it's<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.830> simple

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
you would do with an SLR it's a simple

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.480 
you would do with an SLR it's a simple
case<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.690> locating<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:43.840> clicking<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.010> the

the<00:01:48.820> GX<00:01:49.090> has<00:01:49.270> been<00:01:49.450> out<00:01:49.570> for<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.780> little<00:01:49.930> while

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
the GX has been out for a little while

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.740 
the GX has been out for a little while
but<00:01:50.590> our<00:01:50.800> main<00:01:51.250> interest<00:01:51.670> is<00:01:52.240> when<00:01:52.570> they

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
but our main interest is when they

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.680 
but our main interest is when they
announced<00:01:53.260> this<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.920> this<00:01:54.460> take<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.300> lens<00:01:55.450> I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
announced this and this take the lens I

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.030

one by Panasonic like m2 Micro Four
Thirds<00:02:11.170> adapter<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:12.069> it's<00:02:12.220> not<00:02:12.660> completely

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
Thirds adapter so it's not completely

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
Thirds adapter so it's not completely
and<00:02:13.930> utterly<00:02:14.110> new<00:02:14.830> concept

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and utterly new concept

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.179 
and utterly new concept
but<00:02:15.829> it<00:02:16.219> is<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.730> very<00:02:17.000> nice<00:02:17.269> way<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.569> doing<00:02:17.689> it<00:02:18.189> if
