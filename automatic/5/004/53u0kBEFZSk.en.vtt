00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
something like that I developed a little

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.600 
something like that I developed a little
bit<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.019> criteria<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.830> before<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.219> tell<00:00:14.519> you

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
bit of a criteria and before I tell you

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.340 
bit of a criteria and before I tell you
guys<00:00:14.759> my<00:00:14.940> top<00:00:15.000> 4<00:00:15.450> let<00:00:15.690> me<00:00:15.780> tell<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.080> what<00:00:16.320> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
guys my top 4 let me tell you what I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.680 
guys my top 4 let me tell you what I
judge<00:00:16.740> them<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.580> number<00:00:17.850> 1<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.210> judge<00:00:18.480> them

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
judge them on so number 1 I judge them

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.420 
judge them on so number 1 I judge them
on<00:00:18.810> design<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> appearance<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.220> troops

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
on design and appearance so what troops

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.279 
on design and appearance so what troops
look<00:00:20.699> really<00:00:21.060> good<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.779> they<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:21.960> any<00:00:22.109> sort

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
look really good do they have any sort

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.900 
look really good do they have any sort
of<00:00:22.350> special<00:00:22.529> abilities<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.490> definitely

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
of special abilities that definitely

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.060 
of special abilities that definitely
factors<00:00:24.300> into<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> rankings<00:00:25.230> number<00:00:25.859> 2<00:00:26.039> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
factors into the rankings number 2 I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.250 
factors into the rankings number 2 I
factored<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.910> usefulness<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.019> are<00:00:28.170> they

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
factored in the usefulness so are they

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.450 
factored in the usefulness so are they
used<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> lot<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> different<00:00:29.099> army

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
used in a lot of different army

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.250 
used in a lot of different army
compositions<00:00:30.029> how<00:00:30.179> effective<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
compositions how effective are they and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
compositions how effective are they and
the<00:00:31.619> number<00:00:31.800> 3<00:00:32.070> versatility<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.210> these

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the number 3 versatility so can these

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
the number 3 versatility so can these
troops<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.780> used<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.260> different<00:00:34.590> things<00:00:34.829> do

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
troops be used to do different things do

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.799 
troops be used to do different things do
they<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.370> only<00:00:35.670> serve<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.180> purpose<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
they really only serve one purpose and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.630 
they really only serve one purpose and
those<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> three<00:00:37.829> things<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
those are really the three things that I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.389 
those are really the three things that I
looked<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.960> overall<00:00:40.230> making<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> top<00:00:41.100> four

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
looked at so overall making the top four

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
looked at so overall making the top four
was<00:00:41.640> sort<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> difficult<00:00:42.149> honestly<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> first

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
was sort of difficult honestly the first

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.680 
was sort of difficult honestly the first
one<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.430> easy<00:00:44.820> than<00:00:45.180> my<00:00:45.270> number<00:00:45.539> one

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
one was really easy than my number one

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
one was really easy than my number one
troop<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.350> number<00:00:46.620> four<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> put<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> lot<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
troop but number four I put a lot of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
troop but number four I put a lot of
effort<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:48.090> thinking<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.950> I

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
effort into thinking about and I think I

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.470 
effort into thinking about and I think I
came<00:00:50.129> up<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.489> pretty<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:50.789> top<00:00:51.059> four<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
came up with a pretty good top four and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.670 
came up with a pretty good top four and
if<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.629> guys<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> different<00:00:52.289> top<00:00:52.410> four

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
if you guys have a different top four

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.110 
if you guys have a different top four
you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.949> drop<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> comment<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> comment

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you can drop a comment in the comment

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.860 
you can drop a comment in the comment
section<00:00:54.390> below

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
section below

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.450 
section below
so<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.500> ahead<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.770> start<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.160> number

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so let's go ahead and start with number

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
so let's go ahead and start with number
four<00:00:56.760> again<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> most<00:00:58.050> difficult

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
four again this was the most difficult

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.560 
four again this was the most difficult
one<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.859> think<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> end<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.300> ended

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
one to think of and in the end I ended

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.720 
one to think of and in the end I ended
up<00:01:00.719> settling<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> barbarian<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.399> even

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
up settling with the barbarian so even

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
up settling with the barbarian so even
though<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> people<00:01:03.270> might<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
though the people might think the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
though the people might think the
barbarian<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> pretty<00:01:04.650> boring<00:01:04.890> troop<00:01:05.309> I

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
barbarian is a pretty boring troop I

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.219 
barbarian is a pretty boring troop I
think<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.150> definitely<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.570> staple<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.990> clash

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
think it's definitely a staple of clash

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.510 
think it's definitely a staple of clash
of<00:01:07.380> clans<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.950> far<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.130> design<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
of clans so as far as design and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.980 
of clans so as far as design and
appearance<00:01:09.000> goes<00:01:09.150> whenever<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> think<00:01:09.780> about

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
appearance goes whenever you think about

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.570 
appearance goes whenever you think about
clash<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.470> barbarian<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.400> thing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
clash the barbarian is the first thing

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.980 
clash the barbarian is the first thing
that<00:01:11.610> pops<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.780> far<00:01:12.930> as

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that pops up and then as far as

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.990 
that pops up and then as far as
usefulness<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.740> versatility<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.549> barbarian

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
usefulness and versatility the barbarian

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.210 
usefulness and versatility the barbarian
is<00:01:15.119> definitely<00:01:15.720> pretty<00:01:15.960> underrated<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.920> for

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
is definitely pretty underrated so for

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.649 
is definitely pretty underrated so for
the<00:01:17.729> different<00:01:18.150> amount<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.390> army

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the different amount of army

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.210 
the different amount of army
compositions<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.530> barbarians<00:01:20.100> in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
compositions you can use barbarians in

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.670 
compositions you can use barbarians in
pretty<00:01:20.549> much<00:01:20.700> townhall<00:01:21.119> 9<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.570> below<00:01:21.869> people

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
pretty much townhall 9 and below people

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.499 
pretty much townhall 9 and below people
use<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> non-stop<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.700> whether<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.060> farming

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
use it non-stop for whether it's farming

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.880 
use it non-stop for whether it's farming
using<00:01:24.810> barge<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> certain<00:01:25.650> army

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
using barge and certain army

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.410 
using barge and certain army
compositions<00:01:26.369> people<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> destroy

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
compositions people use them to destroy

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
compositions people use them to destroy
stuff<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> outside<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.920> can

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
stuff on the outside and then you can

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
stuff on the outside and then you can
even<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.430> them<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.670> Town<00:01:29.850> Hall<00:01:30.000> 10<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
even use them in Town Hall 10 and the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.789 
even use them in Town Hall 10 and the
Champions<00:01:30.900> League<00:01:30.960> when<00:01:31.500> you're<00:01:31.680> using

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
Champions League when you're using

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.760 
Champions League when you're using
barche<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.310> climb<00:01:32.520> trophies<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.810> yeah<00:01:34.409> it's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
barche to climb trophies and yeah it's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.050 
barche to climb trophies and yeah it's
pretty<00:01:35.100> effective<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.729> trophy

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
pretty effective when your trophy

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.130 
pretty effective when your trophy
pushing<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.479> pretty<00:01:36.659> effective<00:01:36.840> when

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
pushing it's pretty effective when

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.050 
pushing it's pretty effective when
you're<00:01:37.229> farming<00:01:37.530> also<00:01:38.040> another<00:01:38.700> thing<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.030> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you're farming also another thing that I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.580 
you're farming also another thing that I
factored<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> put<00:01:39.990> barbarians<00:01:40.500> at

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
factored in when I put barbarians at

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
factored in when I put barbarians at
number<00:01:40.799> 4<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.250> they're<00:01:41.400> also<00:01:41.790> used<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.180> lure

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
number 4 is they're also used to lure

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.429 
number 4 is they're also used to lure
out<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> clan<00:01:42.720> castle<00:01:42.930> troops<00:01:43.259> pretty

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
out the clan castle troops pretty

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
out the clan castle troops pretty
efficiently<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.220> that's<00:01:44.640> why<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> picked

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
efficiently so that's why I picked

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
efficiently so that's why I picked
barbarian<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> pretty<00:01:46.110> tough<00:01:46.380> choice<00:01:46.740> there

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
barbarian is a pretty tough choice there

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.200 
barbarian is a pretty tough choice there
were<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.220> other<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.640> cool<00:01:47.790> troops<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
were some other really cool troops that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.940 
were some other really cool troops that
I<00:01:48.270> had<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> leave<00:01:48.720> off<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> thought<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.890> was

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
I had to leave off but I thought it was

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.499 
I had to leave off but I thought it was
a<00:01:50.009> pretty<00:01:50.250> well-rounded<00:01:50.549> troop<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.270> seeing

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
a pretty well-rounded troop and seeing

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
a pretty well-rounded troop and seeing
as<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> face<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> clash<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.860> had<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
as it's the face of clash I had to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
as it's the face of clash I had to
include<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.759> inside<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> my<00:01:54.240> top<00:01:54.420> 4<00:01:54.720> alright<00:01:55.290> so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
include it inside of my top 4 alright so

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740 
include it inside of my top 4 alright so
number<00:01:55.680> three<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.610> golem<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.299> really

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
number three is the golem and I really

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
number three is the golem and I really
really<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> golem<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> troop<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> let

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
really like the golem as a troop and let

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.980 
really like the golem as a troop and let
me<00:01:59.610> tell<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> why<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> put<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> as<00:02:00.450> number<00:02:00.689> 3<00:02:00.899> on

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
me tell you why I put it as number 3 on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.649 
me tell you why I put it as number 3 on
my<00:02:01.020> list<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.640> before<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> golem<00:02:03.090> came<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
my list so before the golem came out it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
my list so before the golem came out it
was<00:02:03.780> sort<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.170> hard<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> find<00:02:04.799> diversity<00:02:05.369> when

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
was sort of hard to find diversity when

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.130 
was sort of hard to find diversity when
you're<00:02:05.610> doing<00:02:05.850> ground<00:02:06.060> attacks<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.960> right

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you're doing ground attacks but right

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.749 
you're doing ground attacks but right
when<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:07.380> released<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> golems<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.459> golem

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
when they released the golems the golem

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.369 
when they released the golems the golem
sprouted<00:02:09.239> out<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> bunch<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> different<00:02:10.080> attack

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
sprouted out a bunch of different attack

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.290 
sprouted out a bunch of different attack
strategies<00:02:10.890> because<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.580> had<00:02:12.000> your<00:02:12.150> main

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
strategies because you had your main

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.980 
strategies because you had your main
front

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
front

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.440 
front
by<00:02:13.560> dropping<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> big<00:02:14.220> golem<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.850> with<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
by dropping the big golem so with the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.180 
by dropping the big golem so with the
golems<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.960> had<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.170> go<00:02:16.320> wee-wee<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.830> had<00:02:16.950> go

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
golems we had to go wee-wee we had go

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.280 
golems we had to go wee-wee we had go
wipe<00:02:17.400> we'd<00:02:17.640> go<00:02:17.910> vape<00:02:18.210> pretty<00:02:18.630> much<00:02:18.780> all<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
wipe we'd go vape pretty much all of the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.040 
wipe we'd go vape pretty much all of the
major<00:02:19.560> ground<00:02:20.010> attacks<00:02:20.400> develop<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.780> guess

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
major ground attacks develop or I guess

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.110 
major ground attacks develop or I guess
derived<00:02:22.530> from<00:02:22.710> having<00:02:22.890> golems<00:02:23.490> so<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.000> can

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
derived from having golems so you can

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120 
derived from having golems so you can
pretty<00:02:24.270> much<00:02:24.360> put<00:02:24.900> golems<00:02:25.320> up<00:02:25.470> front<00:02:25.710> use

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
pretty much put golems up front use

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.380 
pretty much put golems up front use
different<00:02:26.460> troops<00:02:26.700> behind<00:02:26.880> them<00:02:27.240> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
different troops behind them and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.060 
different troops behind them and
experiment<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.990> use<00:02:28.110> whatever<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.470> want<00:02:28.590> so

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
experiment to use whatever you want so

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.410 
experiment to use whatever you want so
this<00:02:29.250> wouldn't<00:02:29.550> be<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> case<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.180> using

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
this wouldn't be the case of using

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.450 
this wouldn't be the case of using
Giants<00:02:30.990> or<00:02:31.080> something<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.860> golems

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
Giants or something like that and golems

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.980 
Giants or something like that and golems
really<00:02:32.790> change<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.240> game<00:02:33.270> because<00:02:33.690> they<00:02:33.810> made

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
really change the game because they made

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.420 
really change the game because they made
a<00:02:34.020> bunch<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.410> different<00:02:34.740> ground<00:02:35.100> attacks

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
a bunch of different ground attacks

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.340 
a bunch of different ground attacks
viable<00:02:35.910> also<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.600> think<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.930> golems<00:02:37.200> look

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
viable also I think the golems look

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.570 
viable also I think the golems look
pretty<00:02:37.560> cool<00:02:37.770> especially<00:02:38.070> when<00:02:38.460> they're

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
pretty cool especially when they're

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.520 
pretty cool especially when they're
maxed<00:02:38.850> out<00:02:39.060> with<00:02:39.450> their<00:02:39.900> purple<00:02:40.260> little

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
maxed out with their purple little

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.620 
maxed out with their purple little
spiked<00:02:40.800> Mohawks<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> beginning<00:02:42.420> they

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
spiked Mohawks in the beginning they

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.880 
spiked Mohawks in the beginning they
might<00:02:43.050> be<00:02:43.170> sort<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.410> boring<00:02:43.650> when<00:02:43.770> they're

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
might be sort of boring when they're

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.020 
might be sort of boring when they're
gray<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.280> definitely<00:02:44.550> when<00:02:44.640> they're<00:02:44.760> maxed

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030

least 2 to 5 archers and any army
composition<00:03:27.360> just<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:28.500> pick<00:03:28.650> up

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
composition just so you can pick up

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.500 
composition just so you can pick up
buildings<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> outside<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.940> they<00:03:30.269> serve

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
buildings on the outside and they serve

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.940 
buildings on the outside and they serve
a<00:03:30.540> great<00:03:30.810> purpose<00:03:30.840> inside<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.590> game<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:31.920> I

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
a great purpose inside of the game so I

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.290 
a great purpose inside of the game so I
think<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.280> archers<00:03:32.640> are<00:03:32.760> really<00:03:32.970> good<00:03:33.120> I

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
think the archers are really good I

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.670 
think the archers are really good I
don't<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.570> they're<00:03:33.780> necessarily<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.440> best

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
don't think they're necessarily the best

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.040 
don't think they're necessarily the best
design<00:03:35.040> troop<00:03:35.400> again<00:03:36.239> they<00:03:36.390> were<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.690> second

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
design troop again they were the second

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.870 
design troop again they were the second
troop<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.320> guess<00:03:37.500> ever<00:03:37.739> created<00:03:38.220> inside<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
troop I guess ever created inside of the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.490 
troop I guess ever created inside of the
game<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.330> think<00:03:39.750> they<00:03:39.870> definitely<00:03:40.320> serve

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
game but I think they definitely serve

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.199 
game but I think they definitely serve
their<00:03:40.680> purpose<00:03:41.040> they're<00:03:41.370> super<00:03:41.700> versatile

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
their purpose they're super versatile

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.580 
their purpose they're super versatile
you<00:03:42.390> can<00:03:42.420> use<00:03:42.570> them<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.930> literally<00:03:43.290> every

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
you can use them in literally every

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.289 
you can use them in literally every
single<00:03:43.620> army<00:03:44.130> composition<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:45.030> that's<00:03:45.180> why

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
single army composition so that's why

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.850 
single army composition so that's why

but<00:04:02.850> when<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.060> witches<00:04:03.239> first<00:04:03.600> came<00:04:03.780> out<00:04:03.810> I

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
but when the witches first came out I

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.720 
but when the witches first came out I
remember<00:04:04.140> when<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.709> got<00:04:04.980> them<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.430> dropped

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
remember when I got them and I dropped

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.370 
remember when I got them and I dropped
my<00:04:05.820> first<00:04:06.090> witch<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.600> saw<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.959> spawned<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
my first witch and I saw it spawned the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.050 
my first witch and I saw it spawned the
skeletons<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.100> was<00:04:08.280> literally<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> coolest

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
skeletons it was literally the coolest

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.270 
skeletons it was literally the coolest
thing<00:04:09.450> inside<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.260> clash<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.890> witch<00:04:11.100> is

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
thing inside of clash like the witch is

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.240 
thing inside of clash like the witch is
so<00:04:11.519> far<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.180> be<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.510> force<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.560> far<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.040> above

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
so far and be of force so far and above

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.580 
so far and be of force so far and above
any<00:04:14.489> other<00:04:14.580> troop<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.540> ridiculous<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.350> fact

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
any other troop it's ridiculous the fact

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.409 
any other troop it's ridiculous the fact
that<00:04:16.709> they<00:04:16.890> can<00:04:17.010> spawn<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.910> witch<00:04:18.120> like

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that they can spawn the the witch like

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.759 
that they can spawn the the witch like
first<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.720> all<00:04:18.810> design<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.260> appearance<00:04:19.470> wise

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
first of all design and appearance wise

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.580 
first of all design and appearance wise
they're<00:04:20.040> by<00:04:20.220> far<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.760> away<00:04:20.820> number<00:04:21.209> one

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
they're by far and away number one

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.200 
they're by far and away number one
usefulness<00:04:22.590> when<00:04:23.400> they<00:04:23.520> came<00:04:23.729> out<00:04:23.789> they<00:04:23.970> were

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
usefulness when they came out they were

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.300 
usefulness when they came out they were
like<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.539> number<00:04:24.810> one<00:04:24.930> army<00:04:25.169> composition<00:04:25.680> you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
like the number one army composition you

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.860 
like the number one army composition you
pretty<00:04:26.490> much<00:04:26.610> just<00:04:26.669> bring<00:04:26.970> 20<00:04:27.270> witches<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:27.780> a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
pretty much just bring 20 witches and a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.150 
pretty much just bring 20 witches and a
bunch<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.139> lightning<00:04:28.410> spells<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.770> demolish

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
bunch of lightning spells and demolish

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.190 
bunch of lightning spells and demolish
an<00:04:29.280> entire<00:04:29.400> base<00:04:29.850> but<00:04:30.360> still<00:04:30.660> they<00:04:30.840> find<00:04:31.050> their

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
an entire base but still they find their

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.780 
an entire base but still they find their
place<00:04:31.350> now<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.830> different<00:04:32.130> trophy<00:04:32.520> pushing

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
place now in different trophy pushing

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.879 
place now in different trophy pushing
strategies<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.450> they<00:04:33.960> they<00:04:34.410> definitely<00:04:34.680> are

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
strategies and they they definitely are

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.350 
strategies and they they definitely are
still<00:04:35.070> super<00:04:35.250> powerful<00:04:35.760> inside<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.180> game

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
still super powerful inside of the game

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.420 
still super powerful inside of the game
so<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.660> use<00:04:36.900> them<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.230> destroy<00:04:37.740> clan<00:04:38.040> castle

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
so you use them just destroy clan castle

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.010 
so you use them just destroy clan castle
units<00:04:38.730> you<00:04:38.850> can<00:04:38.880> use<00:04:39.150> them<00:04:39.330> in<00:04:39.450> gowiwi

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
units you can use them in gowiwi

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.659 
units you can use them in gowiwi
you<00:04:40.320> can<00:04:40.470> use<00:04:40.590> them<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:40.860> gowipe<00:04:41.190> they're

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
you can use them in gowipe they're

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.820 
you can use them in gowipe they're
pretty<00:04:41.910> much<00:04:42.030> used<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.810> majority<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.530> the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
pretty much used in a majority of the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.470 
pretty much used in a majority of the
high-level<00:04:44.160> ground<00:04:44.460> attacks<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.240> I'm<00:04:45.450> a

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
high-level ground attacks so I'm a

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.090 
high-level ground attacks so I'm a
really<00:04:45.900> big<00:04:46.050> fan<00:04:46.230> of<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.410> witch<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.830> that's

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
really big fan of the witch and that's

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.470 
really big fan of the witch and that's
why<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.280> took<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.610> number<00:04:47.730> one<00:04:47.880> spot<00:04:48.000> on<00:04:48.389> my

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
why I took the number one spot on my

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.390 
why I took the number one spot on my
list<00:04:48.660> so<00:04:49.020> that's<00:04:49.320> my<00:04:49.440> top<00:04:49.650> 4<00:04:49.889> number<00:04:50.250> 4

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
list so that's my top 4 number 4

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.550 
list so that's my top 4 number 4

I'm<00:04:57.389> pretty<00:04:57.600> interested<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:58.110> see<00:04:58.230> what<00:04:58.350> you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
I'm pretty interested to see what you

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.050 
I'm pretty interested to see what you
guys<00:04:58.530> think<00:04:58.770> especially<00:04:59.310> when<00:04:59.669> it<00:04:59.790> comes<00:04:59.910> to

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
guys think especially when it comes to

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.000 
guys think especially when it comes to
the<00:05:00.240> number<00:05:00.450> one<00:05:00.570> troop<00:05:00.870> certain<00:05:01.710> troops<00:05:01.919> I

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
the number one troop certain troops I

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.379 
the number one troop certain troops I
had<00:05:02.130> to<00:05:02.220> leave<00:05:02.340> off<00:05:02.490> like<00:05:02.700> I<00:05:02.820> really<00:05:03.030> loved<00:05:03.300> the

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
had to leave off like I really loved the

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.640 
had to leave off like I really loved the
hog<00:05:03.570> rider<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:03.930> think<00:05:04.169> it's<00:05:04.260> a<00:05:04.320> pretty<00:05:04.470> cool

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
hog rider I think it's a pretty cool

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.900 
hog rider I think it's a pretty cool
troop<00:05:04.950> I<00:05:05.070> think<00:05:05.250> it's<00:05:05.340> really<00:05:05.490> well<00:05:05.700> designed

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
troop I think it's really well designed

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.520 
troop I think it's really well designed
but<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.479> thing<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.660> with<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.930> hog<00:05:07.050> riders<00:05:07.380> you

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
but the thing is with the hog riders you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.260 
but the thing is with the hog riders you
can<00:05:07.680> only<00:05:07.860> use<00:05:08.160> them<00:05:08.370> in<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:08.729> many<00:05:08.850> scenarios

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
can only use them in so many scenarios

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.020 
can only use them in so many scenarios
you're<00:05:09.720> either<00:05:09.900> using<00:05:10.290> like<00:05:10.910> actually<00:05:11.910> they

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
you're either using like actually they

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.280 
you're either using like actually they
are<00:05:12.150> coming<00:05:12.479> back<00:05:12.600> in<00:05:12.810> certain<00:05:13.050> army

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
are coming back in certain army

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.690 
are coming back in certain army
composition<00:05:13.500> so<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:13.889> guess<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.160> have<00:05:14.280> to<00:05:14.310> factor

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
composition so I guess I have to factor

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.159 
composition so I guess I have to factor
them<00:05:14.820> in<00:05:14.970> I'd<00:05:15.330> probably<00:05:15.540> put<00:05:15.780> them<00:05:15.870> at<00:05:15.990> number

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
them in I'd probably put them at number

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.990 
them in I'd probably put them at number
5<00:05:16.350> but<00:05:16.590> certain<00:05:16.889> troops<00:05:17.130> just<00:05:17.580> couldn't<00:05:17.910> make

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
5 but certain troops just couldn't make

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.190 
5 but certain troops just couldn't make
the<00:05:18.120> list<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.479> unfortunately<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:18.960> couldn't

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
the list and unfortunately I couldn't
