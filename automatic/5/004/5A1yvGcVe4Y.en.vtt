 Hi, people today 's recipe is a 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.849
 casserole casserole casserole casserole 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.340
 The name does not matter, it gets super tasty. 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.330
 crisp and still people q jo 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:27.320
 Let's believe and 300 grams of manioc 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.599
 4 tablespoons of wheat flour 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.710
 150 grams of mozzarella cheese in cubes 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.190
 4 tablespoons grated cheese 3 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.590
 Water tablespoons 4 tablespoons 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:47.340
 Margarine soup Milk flour 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.870
 Salt pepper and parsley August 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 the first thing we need 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 do is cook cassava 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.870
 I bought mine already stripped on the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.390
 market but you can buy it with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.489
 I'll cook at home. 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.770
 on microwaves but you can cook 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.320
 also in the standard pan or pan of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.670
 pressure to cook in the microwave 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.460
 I'll add some water to the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.200
 sufficient to cover all cassava and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.390
 I'll take a microwave for five 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.549
 minutes and then another five minutes 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.229
 depending on your cassava may be that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.000
 need to stay a little bit longer 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.200
 so keep an eye out for a peek 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.439
 with a fork and time is already in the bread after 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.810
 cassava belt is just the marcela with cat 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.520
 cool make it hot because 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.439
 it's easier to access 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.290
 if your cassava has those 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.560
 fibers in the middle and thorns is cool to take 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.070
 I did not get in the way of modeling in 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.399
 panela I'm going to add margarine here 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.710
 You can use butter too if you want. 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.290
 expected slightly melted add to 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.920
 wheat flour and I will mix well for 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.920
 form a mass 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.270
 I'm going to add cassava now 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.240
 triturated road will also add the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.440
 Cheese in the field is optional if you want 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.360
 no need to put the parsley one 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.680
 little pepper 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.010
 if you want you can also use pepper 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.900
 Calabrese just a little salt 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.370
 I'll mix everything, I'll teach one. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.910
 a little water to help form 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.910
 a mass 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.570
 now that it has become difficult to move and 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.240
 turned into a clay 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.320
 I'll put it back in the bowl. 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.500
 wait cool down a little bit for us 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.460
 start rolling 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.190
 now that in March a 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.050
 I'm going to take a shower on her 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.280
 with their hands even to help form 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.280
 still more a mass 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.100
 now just get a little bit of March 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.660
 model as you want I go 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.620
 make a ball stuffed with 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.920
 cheese 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:01.130
 you can stuff it with calabrian meat 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:07.040
 dry when do you choose hers 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:09.200
 ball and reserve I'll do this with 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.930
 all my mass to us passed the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.870
 next step after rolling all the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.900
 your cookies can you explain or the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.460
 they 'll either beat me or I'll go 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.560
 spend here in the milk 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.230
 If you do not have milk you can 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.030
 egg also in flour 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.130
 I'm using the bank but you can 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.040
 use breadcrumbs or breadcrumbs 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.140
 4 does or sets aside something else that you 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.150
 You can also do it if you want. 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.520
 seasoning your flour for one 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.610
 panties much more delicious but she is 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.670
 optional to fry the dumplings 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.850
 it rains very hot, it only puts 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.860
 cook about 15 at a time and let 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.850
 fry until golden 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.850
 there is only to enjoy 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.590
 but this super soft lightweight 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.840
 unfortunately the black version gets very 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.319
 forward more emphasis and speech what 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.319
 you found
