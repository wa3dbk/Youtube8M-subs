00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 you hardly have a new server now 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.120
 make today again today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.500
 with the server simulia the pilot the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.820
 Team without point de is natural 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.730
 again everything in the video 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 description of the thi muglia is a 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.119
 Servers from exactly experts would have to be there 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.380
 Do not go if you do not search then 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 youtube finally exporting him 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.500
 if it is correct we have first 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.119
 then you can throw an appeal 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.380
 be imported fly and then see 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.390
 Educators can throw them again 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.500
 July then I have player visible 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.440
 make invisible 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.790
 so even teleported so then have 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.020
 I still lobby as it turns on 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.500
 We can do that to the gaming server 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.100
 then go into any blog here 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.210
 is normal there is lobby switchen 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.480
 apparently by lobbyists that's yes 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.489
 extra lobbies okay then you have the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.780
 pixel shop here we can get in 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.969
 buy certain things 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.100
 you want to specify here you are right 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.329
 I have such 14 picks not so sure 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.829
 only get pixel if you know it 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.050
 i like to like my comments 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.940
 Write and then continue here 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 with apixaban already timo lia 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.850
 should probably here that the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.659
 Models are but what vividly 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.600
 have been done 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.460
 then we have come here to yes what 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.270
 we actually want to do it then 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 we plan it 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.400
 the landesmuseum what it is that is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 I believe something like that I believe so 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.540
 something like that just so with letter 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.170
 that can be bows 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.549
 knows she can not do that though 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.530
 we have another posthumous kothari 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.909
 dna engine plays but we would have 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.799
 really a bit of description 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.020
 can do for all the games for 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.490
 the evening or so, but the work even 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.540
 I will not be there now 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 then you can explain yourself 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.040
 let's see because it is always such a delight 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.329
 if you play that I know 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.710
 that you would like to play have 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.970
 I think I uploaded myself 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.869
 not but I always wanted on the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.880
 channel 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.920
 I might make the same times on so 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.990
 then we come back to the spot 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 astra has got me hour have timo liane 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.710
 team games so I can now 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.329
 say they are just a lot of fun 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.960
 but only simulate 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.189
 they just have a game like that 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 varied are where you the one 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.920
 really must have played because 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.380
 I just totally fun as which one 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.940
 Do not show because it's fun if you 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.030
 Find out for yourself what that is 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.240
 I also noticed 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 so that as the boom to Braine e book 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.630
 I can just clarify 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.209
 There are several different shapes here 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.250
 blocks There are four teams and you have to 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.310
 try to wipe out all other teams 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.890
 according to which a blog in the given field 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.120
 from opposing team shoots it sounds 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.350
 pretty incomprehensible but if it is 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.080
 once you've played you know what I mean 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.140
 then mine is so warm and not then 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.610
 there is still before irina I had 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.380
 even recorded but I never had 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.670
 really time to upload that i have 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.709
 the recording maybe it works 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.330
 yes, at some point, such a single one 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.220
 single also just because it is great 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.440
 fun making and that you can click on here 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.940
 quite a lot of once-in-one server 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.130
 go because that's actually it 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.590
 Almost everyone plays timo yes 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.269
 only there goes the this and sick your 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.319
 friends or opponents which foreign people 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.850
 play one against one 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.170
 There are also tournaments sometimes 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.880
 made if that can but only premium 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.230
 start people and then you can in here 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.790
 enter this zone and then you can 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.860
 I assemble your own kitty 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.569
 have more kids out of fun here 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.000
 put together and then you have to 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.530
 just go to someone now 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.580
 clear exit has someone 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.340
 Do you swear or need someone? 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.570
 Watch and if the skin you back 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.060
 then later against each other and 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.370
 I would like to withdraw here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.260

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.640

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.910

 That's why it's so popular 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.359
 what they do here
