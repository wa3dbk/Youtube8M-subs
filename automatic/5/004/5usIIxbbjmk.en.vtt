00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so this is a short video to demonstrate

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.690 
so this is a short video to demonstrate
the<00:00:02.909> matchless<00:00:03.840> 650<00:00:04.620> twin<00:00:04.980> so<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.430> first

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
the matchless 650 twin so the first

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.450 
the matchless 650 twin so the first
thing<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:05.970> will<00:00:06.060> do<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.299> them<00:00:07.340> start<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
thing we will do is them start the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.120 
thing we will do is them start the
engine<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.360> run<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.349> brakes<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.889> gears

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
engine and run to the brakes the gears

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.650 
engine and run to the brakes the gears
and<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> clutch<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.969> kind<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.269> thing<00:00:12.450> so

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
and the clutch and that kind of thing so

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.030 
and the clutch and that kind of thing so
United<00:00:13.110> when<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.349> stand<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.679> bike<00:00:13.799> upright

United when you stand the bike upright
the<00:00:14.250> stars<00:00:14.490> then<00:00:14.790> clicks<00:00:15.509> up<00:00:16.550> attending

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the stars then clicks up attending

the stars then clicks up attending
there's<00:00:17.910> no<00:00:18.060> know<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> gauge

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
there's no know you can see the gauge

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.370 
there's no know you can see the gauge
shows<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.949> bit<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.100> discharge<00:00:20.609> there<00:00:24.289> seems<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
young the battery charges as it goes

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.580 
young the battery charges as it goes
along<00:00:31.610> you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> Reds<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.590> bringing

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
along you can see the Reds are bringing

along you can see the Reds are bringing
out<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> bolt<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.219> there<00:00:35.430> yet<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
out the bolt is there yet what the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.860 
out the bolt is there yet what the
answers<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.309> as<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> rip<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.629> first

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
answers you as you rip it up the first

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
answers you as you rip it up the first
thing<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> junction<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
thing here it is up to the junction and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.560 
thing here it is up to the junction and
then<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.700> apply<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.149> bit<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.360> rear

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
then just apply a little bit a rear

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
then just apply a little bit a rear
brake<00:00:44.690> which<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:45.899> doing<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.670> little<00:00:47.670> bit

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
brake which I'm doing now a little bit

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.990 
brake which I'm doing now a little bit
more<00:00:49.219> important<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> rear<00:00:50.730> drum

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
more important out of the rear drum

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.110 
more important out of the rear drum
feels<00:00:51.360> nice<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> round<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.670> rear<00:00:53.850> brake

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
feels nice and round and the rear brake

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
feels nice and round and the rear brake
pills<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:55.140> power<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> would<00:00:55.860> expect<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
pills as power as you would expect it to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.930 
pills as power as you would expect it to
fill<00:00:56.690> for<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.809> old<00:00:57.960> bike<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> down<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> same

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
fill for an old bike so down the same

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.219 
fill for an old bike so down the same
for<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> front<00:01:00.890> but<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.219> bit<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.430> speed

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
for the front but a little bit of speed

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.420 
for the front but a little bit of speed
by<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> little<00:01:04.470> bit<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.769> brake<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.790> more

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
by a little bit of that brake a bit more

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.980 
by a little bit of that brake a bit more
ok<00:01:08.430> important<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> front<00:01:09.360> drum<00:01:09.689> feels

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
ok important as the front drum feels

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.499 
ok important as the front drum feels
nice<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.290> round<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.990> front<00:01:13.710> brake<00:01:13.920> fuels

nice and round and the front brake fuels
as<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.659> would<00:01:15.780> expect<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.500> old<00:01:16.619> bike<00:01:17.900> so

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
as you would expect for an old bike so

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.390 
as you would expect for an old bike so

I'm<00:01:41.500> going<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.800> accelerate<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.610> little<00:01:42.730> bit<00:01:43.030> in

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
I'm going to accelerate a little bit in

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.210 
I'm going to accelerate a little bit in
HSN<00:01:43.540> see<00:01:43.690> how<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.840> accelerates<00:01:44.170> last<00:01:44.920> time<00:01:45.130> I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
HSN see how it accelerates last time I

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.620 
HSN see how it accelerates last time I
rode<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.670> seemed<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.910> break<00:01:46.120> down<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.390> bit

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
rode it it seemed to break down a bit

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.260 
rode it it seemed to break down a bit
but<00:01:46.780> just<00:01:46.930> some<00:01:47.140> silly<00:01:47.560> does<00:01:47.860> house<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:49.060> use

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
but just some silly does house can use

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.120 
but just some silly does house can use
that's<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:49.720> neither<00:01:50.050> and<00:01:50.590> back<00:01:50.800> into<00:01:51.070> a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
that's it neither and back into a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.789 
that's it neither and back into a
credenza

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.459 

yeah<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.729> give<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> myself<00:01:57.329> ik<00:01:57.719> comma<00:01:58.200> sort

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
yeah you give it to myself ik comma sort

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
yeah you give it to myself ik comma sort
of<00:01:58.560> casts<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.429> some<00:01:59.640> as<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.359> speed

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
of casts out a bit but some as a speed

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.599 
of casts out a bit but some as a speed
comes<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.350> take<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.009> guess<00:02:02.399> that's

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
comes up don't take it I guess that's

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.370 
comes up don't take it I guess that's
the<00:02:02.640> carburation<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.600> pick<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.810> Sun<00:02:04.079> salt

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the carburation do you pick the Sun salt

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.919 
the carburation do you pick the Sun salt
