00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
nevermore by cult nails and one count of

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.020 
nevermore by cult nails and one count of
this<00:05:05.180> if<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.479> only<00:05:05.840> applied<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:07.070> has

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
this if you only applied this it has

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.360 
this if you only applied this it has
also<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.539> great<00:05:09.050> effect<00:05:09.500> because<00:05:09.830> it<00:05:09.950> kind<00:05:10.190> of

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
also a great effect because it kind of

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.630 
also a great effect because it kind of
applies<00:05:11.330> like<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:12.530> black<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:12.919> kind<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.340> sheer

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
applies like the black is kind of sheer

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.940 
applies like the black is kind of sheer
and<00:05:13.910> i<00:05:14.330> think<00:05:14.660> that's<00:05:14.900> that's<00:05:15.169> pretty<00:05:15.320> too<00:05:15.740> but

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
and i think that's that's pretty too but

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.860 
and i think that's that's pretty too but
i<00:05:16.039> wanted<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.580> have<00:05:16.789> it<00:05:16.820> opaque<00:05:17.510> so<00:05:17.720> i've

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
i wanted to have it opaque so i've

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.320 
i wanted to have it opaque so i've
applied<00:05:18.350> a<00:05:18.470> layer<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:18.890> black<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:19.669> one<00:05:20.060> layer

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
applied a layer of black and one layer

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.020 
applied a layer of black and one layer
of<00:05:20.600> this<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:22.070> i<00:05:22.130> really<00:05:22.340> think<00:05:22.640> that<00:05:22.880> this

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
of this so i really think that this

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.570 
of this so i really think that this
isn't<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.600> polish<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:24.260> see<00:05:24.500> every<00:05:24.919> day<00:05:24.950> and

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
isn't a polish you see every day and

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.390 
isn't a polish you see every day and
that's<00:05:26.570> why<00:05:26.930> it's<00:05:27.350> definitely<00:05:28.010> one<00:05:28.220> of<00:05:28.250> my

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
that's why it's definitely one of my

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.940 
that's why it's definitely one of my
favorites<00:05:29.090> let's<00:05:29.840> move<00:05:30.080> on<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.740> last

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950
