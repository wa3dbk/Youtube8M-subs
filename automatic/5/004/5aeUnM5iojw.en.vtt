00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I'm sure like there's actual commands

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280 
I'm sure like there's actual commands
that<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.390> getting<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.110> again

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that I'm just not getting this is again

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.380 
that I'm just not getting this is again
this<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.950> prototype<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.060> very

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
this is just the prototype the very

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.420 
this is just the prototype the very
early<00:02:03.659> prototype<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.229> doesn't<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.950> nowhere

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
early prototype and doesn't is nowhere

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.620 
early prototype and doesn't is nowhere
even<00:02:05.549> close<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> version<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.420> they're

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
even close to the version that they're

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.180 
even close to the version that they're
working<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.409> they've<00:02:07.560> shown<00:02:07.590> videos

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
working on and that they've shown videos

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.130 
working on and that they've shown videos
for<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.209> know<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.840> little<00:02:10.020> bit

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
for but you know just just a little bit

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.950 
for but you know just just a little bit
of<00:02:10.200> eye<00:02:10.319> candy<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.739> sort<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.280> pay<00:02:11.400> attention

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
of eye candy to sort of pay attention

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.390 
of eye candy to sort of pay attention
and<00:02:12.350> yeah<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.580> you're<00:02:14.540> here<00:02:14.840> you're<00:02:15.050> alone<00:02:15.530> you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
and yeah so you're here you're alone you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.070 
and yeah so you're here you're alone you
are<00:02:16.430> running<00:02:16.880> out<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.090> oxygen<00:02:17.360> you're<00:02:17.840> running

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
are running out of oxygen you're running

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.260 
are running out of oxygen you're running
out<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.200> battery<00:02:18.740> power<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.370> there's<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.760> huge

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
out of battery power and there's a huge

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.240 
out of battery power and there's a huge
area<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.840> think<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.380> kilometers<00:02:22.070> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
area I think it's like kilometers and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.160 
area I think it's like kilometers and
kilometers<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:23.000> kilometers<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.540> space<00:02:23.960> to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
kilometers and kilometers of space to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.670 
kilometers and kilometers of space to
cover<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:25.130> try<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.880> find<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:27.080> know<00:02:27.110> remnants

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
cover to try to find you know remnants

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.050 
cover to try to find you know remnants
of<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.890> previous<00:02:28.250> with<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.670> previous

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
of the previous with that previous

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.630 
of the previous with that previous
expedition<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.070> so<00:02:31.070> I'm<00:02:31.130> going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.310> run<00:02:31.430> its

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
expedition and so I'm going to run its

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.550 
expedition and so I'm going to run its
going<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.820> use<00:02:31.970> up<00:02:32.120> more<00:02:32.240> oxygen<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:33.440> also

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
going to use up more oxygen I can also

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.990 
going to use up more oxygen I can also
hear<00:02:33.800> myself<00:02:33.950> breathing<00:02:36.460> this<00:02:37.460> particular

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
hear myself breathing this particular

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.490 
hear myself breathing this particular
demo<00:02:38.480> doesn't<00:02:38.930> have<00:02:39.020> much<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.350> way<00:02:39.410> of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
demo doesn't have much in the way of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.840 
demo doesn't have much in the way of
sound<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.040> know<00:02:40.100> they<00:02:40.280> want<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.520> keep<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.760> a

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
sound I know they want to keep it a

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.430 
sound I know they want to keep it a
little<00:02:40.880> bit<00:02:41.180> low<00:02:41.420> because<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:42.020> know<00:02:42.110> space

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
little bit low because you know space

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.200 
little bit low because you know space
and<00:02:42.650> all<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.340> think<00:02:44.060> they're

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
and all that but I think they're

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.880 
and all that but I think they're
probably<00:02:44.480> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.020> add<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.170> little<00:02:45.380> bit<00:02:45.710> more

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
probably going to add a little bit more

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.520 
probably going to add a little bit more
sound<00:02:46.420> anyway<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.450> think<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.900> cool<00:02:48.080> cool

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
sound anyway I think it's a cool cool

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.720 
sound anyway I think it's a cool cool
concept<00:02:49.010> there's<00:02:49.160> going<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.340> be<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.430> link<00:02:49.610> down

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
concept there's going to be a link down

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.670 
concept there's going to be a link down
to<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.000> Kickstarter<00:02:50.450> down<00:02:50.600> below<00:02:50.900> do<00:02:51.380> not

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
to the Kickstarter down below do not

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.790 
to the Kickstarter down below do not
feel<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.610> need<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.660> spend<00:02:54.260> money<00:02:54.500> just

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
feel the need to spend money just

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.530 
feel the need to spend money just
because<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.370> said<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.760> or<00:02:56.150> anything<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:56.420> that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
because I said so or anything like that

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.450 
because I said so or anything like that
it's<00:02:56.900> just<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.200> really<00:02:57.740> like<00:02:57.860> these<00:02:58.070> fellows

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
it's just I really like these fellows

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.250 
it's just I really like these fellows
and<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.210> I<00:02:59.240> approached<00:02:59.630> them<00:02:59.870> on<00:02:59.960> Reddit<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
and so I approached them on Reddit and

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.440 
and so I approached them on Reddit and
been<00:03:00.440> like<00:03:00.470> listen<00:03:01.160> guys<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.790> would<00:03:02.150> love<00:03:02.390> to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
been like listen guys I would love to

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.000 
been like listen guys I would love to
give<00:03:02.960> you<00:03:02.990> a<00:03:03.140> little<00:03:03.560> bit<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.770> press<00:03:03.980> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
give you a little bit of press and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.890 
give you a little bit of press and
attention<00:03:04.700> because<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.300> think<00:03:05.630> this<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.870> a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
attention because I think this is a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.140 
attention because I think this is a
really<00:03:06.110> cool<00:03:06.380> game<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:07.880> think<00:03:08.090> it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
really cool game and I think it

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.430 
really cool game and I think it
represents<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.540> sort<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.780> games<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.020> maybe

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
represents the sort of games that maybe

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.290 
represents the sort of games that maybe
would<00:03:09.650> not<00:03:09.920> be<00:03:10.130> done<00:03:10.370> without<00:03:10.760> something<00:03:11.090> like

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
would not be done without something like

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.690 
would not be done without something like
Kickstarter<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.190> that's<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.310> I'm<00:03:13.430> gonna<00:03:13.580> go

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
Kickstarter so that's it I'm gonna go

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.450 
Kickstarter so that's it I'm gonna go
wander<00:03:13.880> off<00:03:14.180> into<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.900> marsh<00:03:15.830> wilderness

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
wander off into the marsh wilderness
