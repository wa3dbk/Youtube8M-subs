okay<00:00:00.810> so<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:01.380> thought<00:00:01.650> mix<00:00:01.920> it<00:00:02.100> up<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.399> little<00:00:02.490> bit

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay so I thought mix it up a little bit

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.329 
okay so I thought mix it up a little bit
this<00:00:02.790> weekend<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.529> make<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.560> dessert<00:00:04.980> instead

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
this weekend and make a dessert instead

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.270 
this weekend and make a dessert instead
of<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.850> usual<00:00:06.450> meal<00:00:06.779> so<00:00:07.560> we're<00:00:07.980> going<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.130> make

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
of a usual meal so we're going to make

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.759 
of a usual meal so we're going to make
white<00:00:08.519> sugar<00:00:08.790> sponge<00:00:09.179> cake<00:00:09.510> which<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
white sugar sponge cake which is a

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.850 
white sugar sponge cake which is a
Chinese<00:00:11.309> steamed<00:00:11.759> cake<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.530> it's<00:00:13.530> only<00:00:13.650> got<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
Chinese steamed cake and it's only got a

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.020 
Chinese steamed cake and it's only got a
few<00:00:14.070> ingredients<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.639> actually<00:00:14.880> quite

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
few ingredients it's actually quite

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.930 
few ingredients it's actually quite
simple<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.420> make<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:16.410> very<00:00:16.560> flavorful

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
simple to make but it's very flavorful

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.250 
simple to make but it's very flavorful
so<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> main<00:00:18.180> source<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> flavor<00:00:18.810> here

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
so the main source of the flavor here

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.400 
so the main source of the flavor here
and<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.830> texture<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.310> mist<00:00:21.199> so<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.320> going

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
and the texture is mist so we're going

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.939 
and the texture is mist so we're going
to<00:00:22.470> start<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:23.039> some<00:00:23.730> active<00:00:24.180> dry<00:00:24.420> yeast<00:00:24.949> you

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
to start with some active dry yeast you

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.730 
to start with some active dry yeast you
want<00:00:26.130> 8<00:00:26.340> grams<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.449> weigh<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.810> but

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
want 8 grams you can weigh it out but

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.339 
want 8 grams you can weigh it out but
it's<00:00:28.949> easier<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.490> volumetrically<00:00:30.349> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
it's easier to do volumetrically it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.049 
it's easier to do volumetrically it
should<00:00:31.529> say<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> jar<00:00:32.160> how<00:00:32.640> much<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.940> need

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
should say on the jar how much you need

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.680 
should say on the jar how much you need
in<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.360> case<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.050> 11<00:00:34.680> milliliters<00:00:35.690> two

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
in this case it's 11 milliliters two

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.940 
in this case it's 11 milliliters two
tablespoons<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.710> 1/4<00:00:38.190> teaspoon<00:00:39.680> then<00:00:40.680> like

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
tablespoons and 1/4 teaspoon then like

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.959 
tablespoons and 1/4 teaspoon then like
we're<00:00:41.129> breaking<00:00:41.219> bread<00:00:41.579> we're<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
we're breaking bread we're going to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
we're breaking bread we're going to
prove<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.200> we're<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> add<00:00:43.829> some

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
prove it so we're going to add some

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
prove it so we're going to add some
sugar<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.460> give<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> food<00:00:45.829> this<00:00:46.829> case<00:00:47.160> 1

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
sugar to give it food this case 1

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.959 
sugar to give it food this case 1
tablespoon<00:00:48.750> 15<00:00:49.140> milliliters<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.730> some

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
tablespoon 15 milliliters and then some

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.630 
tablespoon 15 milliliters and then some
water<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> water<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.340> warm

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
water and we want the water to be warm

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
water and we want the water to be warm
but<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:53.969> too<00:00:54.120> hot<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.690> around<00:00:54.870> 38<00:00:55.379> or<00:00:55.500> 39

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
but not too hot so around 38 or 39

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.319 
but not too hot so around 38 or 39
degrees<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> shouldn't<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.850> any<00:00:56.969> higher<00:00:57.180> than

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
degrees it shouldn't be any higher than

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.529 
degrees it shouldn't be any higher than
40<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.649> about<00:00:58.770> 50<00:00:59.219> milliliters<00:00:59.699> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
40 so what about 50 milliliters and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.939 
40 so what about 50 milliliters and
we'll<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.809> mix<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:01.559> we'll<00:01:01.800> set

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we'll just mix it up and then we'll set

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.820 
we'll just mix it up and then we'll set
that<00:01:01.980> aside<00:01:03.199> next<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> big<00:01:04.799> bowl<00:01:05.180> way<00:01:06.180> out

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
that aside next in a big bowl way out

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:16.530 
that aside next in a big bowl way out
190<00:01:07.830> grams<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.430> rice<00:01:09.330> flour

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.540 

and<00:01:17.080> then<00:01:17.230> we're<00:01:17.350> going<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.500> add<00:01:17.650> 120

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
and then we're going to add 120

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.730 
and then we're going to add 120
milliliters<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:19.270> cold<00:01:20.110> water<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.840> since<00:01:23.680> I

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
milliliters of cold water and since I

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.840 
milliliters of cold water and since I
got<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.980> scale<00:01:24.220> out<00:01:24.250> I'm<00:01:24.490> just<00:01:24.670> going<00:01:24.790> to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
got the scale out I'm just going to

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.180 
got the scale out I'm just going to
weigh<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.150> out<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.260> stir<00:01:29.950> this<00:01:30.130> up

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
weigh it out and then just stir this up

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.280 
weigh it out and then just stir this up
and<00:01:32.190> we<00:01:33.190> just<00:01:33.220> want<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.790> rough<00:01:34.240> paste<00:01:34.690> it'll

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
and we just want a rough paste it'll

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.480 
and we just want a rough paste it'll
still<00:01:35.500> be<00:01:35.620> pretty<00:01:35.860> pretty<00:01:36.700> powdery<00:01:37.260> but<00:01:38.490> just

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
still be pretty pretty powdery but just

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.920 
still be pretty pretty powdery but just
make<00:01:39.610> sure<00:01:39.760> everything<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.150> mixed<00:01:40.210> as<00:01:40.720> well<00:01:40.840> as

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
make sure everything is mixed as well as

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.350 
make sure everything is mixed as well as
you<00:01:41.050> can<00:01:41.580> and<00:01:42.580> then<00:01:42.730> we're<00:01:43.060> going<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.210> take

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
you can and then we're going to take

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.530 
you can and then we're going to take
some<00:01:43.570> boiling<00:01:43.870> water<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:45.280> 250<00:01:46.180> milliliters

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
some boiling water about 250 milliliters

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.020 
some boiling water about 250 milliliters
of<00:01:46.570> boiling<00:01:46.870> water<00:01:46.930> and<00:01:47.440> we<00:01:47.740> report<00:01:48.100> 150<00:01:48.729> grams

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
of boiling water and we report 150 grams

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.660 
of boiling water and we report 150 grams
of<00:01:49.120> sugar<00:01:49.420> into<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:51.220> I've<00:01:51.310> just<00:01:51.340> done<00:01:51.580> this

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
of sugar into it so I've just done this

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.190 
of sugar into it so I've just done this
in<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.850> measuring<00:01:52.150> cup<00:01:52.210> with<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.690> microwave<00:01:53.170> you

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
in a measuring cup with a microwave you

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.170 
in a measuring cup with a microwave you
can<00:01:53.410> do<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.560> on<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.710> stove<00:01:53.920> too<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.970> way<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.150> a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
can do it on the stove too this way is a

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:04.410 
can do it on the stove too this way is a
little<00:01:55.360> bit<00:01:55.450> easier

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.130 

and<00:02:05.420> just<00:02:05.659> stir<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.320> dissolve<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:07.989> we<00:02:08.989> want

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
and just stir to dissolve and we want

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.510 
and just stir to dissolve and we want
make<00:02:09.229> sure<00:02:09.380> there's<00:02:09.590> no<00:02:09.770> crystals<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.369> there

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
make sure there's no crystals in there

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.400 
make sure there's no crystals in there
it<00:02:10.700> should<00:02:10.880> be<00:02:10.910> all<00:02:11.180> nice<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.630> we<00:02:12.170> should<00:02:12.290> have

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it should be all nice and we should have

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.600 
it should be all nice and we should have
a<00:02:12.440> nice<00:02:12.590> clear<00:02:12.860> solution<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:19.250> then<00:02:19.370> we're

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
a nice clear solution and then we're

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.979 
a nice clear solution and then we're
just<00:02:19.640> going<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:19.970> pour<00:02:20.239> this<00:02:20.420> while<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:20.810> still

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
just going to pour this while it's still

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.309 
just going to pour this while it's still
hot<00:02:21.260> into<00:02:21.860> our<00:02:21.980> flour<00:02:22.190> mixture<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.989> then<00:02:23.989> mix

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
hot into our flour mixture and then mix

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.780 
hot into our flour mixture and then mix
it<00:02:24.440> up<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.769> that<00:02:24.800> there's<00:02:25.069> no<00:02:25.190> lumps<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.640> should

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
it up so that there's no lumps it should

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.180 
it up so that there's no lumps it should
be<00:02:25.880> quite<00:02:26.090> smooth<00:02:29.500> now<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:30.920> going<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.069> be

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
be quite smooth now this is going to be

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.160 
be quite smooth now this is going to be
quite<00:02:31.400> hot<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:31.700> we<00:02:31.940> want<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> cool<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.330> down<00:02:32.450> so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
quite hot so we want to cool it down so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.120 
quite hot so we want to cool it down so
I'm<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.319> going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.500> put<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.709> in<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.860> freezer

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
I'm just going to put it in the freezer

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.150 
I'm just going to put it in the freezer
here<00:02:34.489> for<00:02:34.880> about<00:02:35.480> five<00:02:35.750> or<00:02:35.900> ten<00:02:36.080> minutes<00:02:37.959> and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
here for about five or ten minutes and

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.830 
here for about five or ten minutes and
by<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.220> point<00:02:40.610> if<00:02:40.790> your<00:02:41.209> yeast<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.660> still

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
by this point if your yeast is still

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.120 
by this point if your yeast is still
good<00:02:42.049> it<00:02:42.170> should<00:02:42.319> have<00:02:42.410> phoned<00:02:42.620> up<00:02:42.799> like<00:02:42.950> this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
good it should have phoned up like this

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.070 
good it should have phoned up like this
if<00:02:43.310> you're<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.239> me<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.510> use<00:02:44.630> two<00:02:44.870> smaller

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
if you're like me and use two smaller

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.710 
if you're like me and use two smaller
container<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.560> may<00:02:45.650> need<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.860> transfer<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.720> so

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
container you may need to transfer it so

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.380 
container you may need to transfer it so
we<00:02:47.870> want<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.080> check<00:02:48.230> our<00:02:48.290> flour<00:02:48.650> mixture<00:02:49.390> again

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
we want to check our flour mixture again

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.620 
we want to check our flour mixture again
it<00:02:50.810> shouldn't<00:02:51.110> be<00:02:51.170> over<00:02:51.410> 42<00:02:51.799> degrees<00:02:52.630> because

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
it shouldn't be over 42 degrees because

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.410 
it shouldn't be over 42 degrees because
we<00:02:53.840> want<00:02:54.049> it<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> not<00:02:54.590> kill<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.950> yeast<00:02:55.420> so

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
we want it to not kill the yeast so

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.910 
we want it to not kill the yeast so
we're<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.690> add<00:02:56.750> our<00:02:56.780> yeast<00:02:56.900> mixture<00:02:57.500> to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
we're going to add our yeast mixture to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.870 
we're going to add our yeast mixture to
the<00:02:57.950> flour<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.670> sugar<00:02:58.790> mixture<00:03:00.700> make<00:03:01.700> sure

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
the flour and sugar mixture make sure

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.190 
the flour and sugar mixture make sure
it's<00:03:02.030> well<00:03:02.180> mixed<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.750> then<00:03:02.900> we<00:03:02.989> want<00:03:03.140> to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
it's well mixed and then we want to

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.630 
it's well mixed and then we want to
leave<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.440> somewhere<00:03:03.799> warm<00:03:04.040> where<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.519> yeast

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
leave it somewhere warm where the yeast

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.250 
leave it somewhere warm where the yeast
will<00:03:04.849> have<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.000> chance<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.420> act<00:03:05.630> on<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.930> sugars

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
will have a chance to act on the sugars

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.099 
will have a chance to act on the sugars
in<00:03:06.410> there<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.730> I'm<00:03:07.910> going<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.090> put<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.329> in<00:03:08.450> my

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
in there so I'm going to put it in my

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.930 
in there so I'm going to put it in my
oven<00:03:09.350> which<00:03:09.799> was<00:03:09.980> just<00:03:10.160> left<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.489> for<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.730> little

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
oven which was just left on for a little

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.150 
oven which was just left on for a little
bit<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.359> then<00:03:11.720> turned<00:03:11.959> off<00:03:12.140> for<00:03:12.620> about<00:03:12.769> 40

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
bit and then turned off for about 40

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.300 
bit and then turned off for about 40
minutes<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.730> should<00:03:13.820> be<00:03:13.940> nice<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.239> foamy

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
minutes and it should be nice and foamy

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.280 
minutes and it should be nice and foamy
next<00:03:16.310> we're<00:03:16.940> going<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.120> steam<00:03:17.359> this<00:03:17.570> here<00:03:18.200> I'm

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
next we're going to steam this here I'm

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.660 
next we're going to steam this here I'm
using<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.590> wok<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:19.100> pot<00:03:20.000> will<00:03:20.150> work<00:03:20.299> too<00:03:21.609> so<00:03:22.609> if

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
using a wok a pot will work too so if

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.180 
using a wok a pot will work too so if
you<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:22.910> one<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.329> bamboo<00:03:23.900> steamer<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:24.980> great

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
you have one a bamboo steamer is great

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.470 
you have one a bamboo steamer is great
for<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:26.000> can<00:03:26.150> also<00:03:26.269> do<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:29.390> a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
for this you can also do it in a in a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.440 
for this you can also do it in a in a
cake<00:03:29.690> pan<00:03:29.989> inside<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.530> pot<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.180> line<00:03:32.299> it

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
cake pan inside a pot so just line it

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.300 
cake pan inside a pot so just line it
with<00:03:32.540> parchment<00:03:32.569> paper<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.470> then<00:03:33.530> we'll<00:03:34.100> pour

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
with parchment paper and then we'll pour

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.599 
with parchment paper and then we'll pour
a<00:03:34.340> mixture<00:03:34.430> in<00:03:34.819> there<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:38.390> basically<00:03:39.340> all<00:03:40.340> of

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
a mixture in there and basically all of

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.819 
a mixture in there and basically all of
the<00:03:40.670> carbon<00:03:40.940> dioxide<00:03:40.970> from<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> yeast<00:03:41.900> is

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
the carbon dioxide from the yeast is

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.860 
the carbon dioxide from the yeast is
going<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.220> make<00:03:43.340> nice<00:03:43.940> big<00:03:44.239> bubbles<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:44.750> there

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
going to make nice big bubbles in there

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.080 
going to make nice big bubbles in there
and<00:03:45.049> then<00:03:45.620> as<00:03:45.859> it<00:03:46.160> cooks<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.670> bubbles<00:03:47.030> are

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
and then as it cooks the bubbles are

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.729 
and then as it cooks the bubbles are
going<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.269> get<00:03:47.359> traps<00:03:47.690> or<00:03:47.930> get<00:03:48.170> lots<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.560> nice

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
going to get traps or get lots of nice

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.039 
going to get traps or get lots of nice
air<00:03:49.010> pockets<00:03:49.519> which<00:03:49.700> gives<00:03:49.940> us<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.840> great

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
air pockets which gives us the great

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.129 
air pockets which gives us the great
texture<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.650> cake<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:53.480> just<00:03:53.780> put<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:53.930> lid

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
texture of the cake so just put the lid

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.479 
texture of the cake so just put the lid
on<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.440> then<00:03:54.530> we're<00:03:54.829> going<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.010> steam<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:55.310> for

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
on and then we're going to steam it for

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.300 
on and then we're going to steam it for
25<00:03:55.880> minutes<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.450> then<00:03:56.769> when<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:57.859> take<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.190> out

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
25 minutes and then when you take it out

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.840 
25 minutes and then when you take it out
it<00:03:58.519> should<00:03:59.000> look<00:03:59.120> something<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.450> this<00:04:00.850> so

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
it should look something like this so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.220 
it should look something like this so
remove<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.269> from<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.540> steamer<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.959> let<00:04:03.109> it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
remove it from the steamer and let it

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.470 
remove it from the steamer and let it
cool<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.650> then<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.069> can<00:04:04.280> slice<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:04.760> serve<00:04:04.940> if

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
cool and then you can slice and serve if
