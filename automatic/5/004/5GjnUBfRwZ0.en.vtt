I've<00:00:55.120> got<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.930> drive<00:00:56.199> set<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.680> bit<00:00:56.860> less

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
I've got the the drive set to a bit less

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:20.140 
I've got the the drive set to a bit less
than<00:00:57.070> half<00:00:57.570> check<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.690> out

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.120

00:01:36.000 --> 00:02:06.200 

bye

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.140 

very<00:02:07.210> very<00:02:07.420> nice<00:02:07.660> thick<00:02:08.320> kind<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.980> a<00:02:09.070> sound<00:02:09.340> now

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
very very nice thick kind of a sound now

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.420 
very very nice thick kind of a sound now
what<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.450> might<00:02:10.570> do<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.810> roll<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.620> EQ<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
what I might do is roll the EQ the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:25.940 
what I might do is roll the EQ the
fatness<00:02:12.760> control<00:02:13.180> for<00:02:13.360> about<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.660> middle

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.770 

so<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.070> fatness<00:02:27.400> kind<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.820> as<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.480> pull<00:02:28.690> it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
so the fatness kind of as you pull it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.270 
so the fatness kind of as you pull it
back<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.080> way<00:02:29.320> obviously<00:02:29.680> gets<00:02:29.950> brighter

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
back this way obviously gets brighter

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.180 
back this way obviously gets brighter
and<00:02:30.580> thins<00:02:31.000> out<00:02:31.270> so<00:02:32.110> it's<00:02:32.230> kind<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.650> controls

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
and thins out so it's kind of a controls

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:49.370 
and thins out so it's kind of a controls
the<00:02:33.310> treble<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.760> bass<00:02:34.000> at<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.240> same<00:02:34.480> time

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.690 

so<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.440> can<00:02:50.590> cater<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:51.040> towards<00:02:51.490> whatever

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
so you can cater that towards whatever

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.160 
so you can cater that towards whatever
your<00:02:51.970> amp<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.390> if<00:02:52.510> you've<00:02:52.630> got<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> fairly

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
your amp is if you've got a fairly

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.020 
your amp is if you've got a fairly
mellow<00:02:53.770> sounding<00:02:54.280> amp<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.580> might<00:02:54.760> want<00:02:54.910> to

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
mellow sounding amp you might want to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.460 
mellow sounding amp you might want to
nice<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.540> bright<00:02:55.570> like<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:55.900> personally<00:02:56.410> I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
nice and bright like that personally I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.250 
nice and bright like that personally I
like<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> fatness<00:02:57.070> up<00:02:57.250> generally<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:57.790> full

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260

let's<00:04:49.070> go<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.280> bit<00:04:49.400> nuts<00:04:49.580> here<00:04:49.940> no<00:04:50.560> just<00:04:51.560> here

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
let's go a bit nuts here no just here

00:04:51.740 --> 00:05:10.629 
let's go a bit nuts here no just here
it's<00:04:51.889> like<00:04:52.070> if<00:04:52.220> we<00:04:52.310> get<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.580> up<00:04:52.669> into<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.000> crazy

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:29.540 

you

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:45.010 

No

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.300 

also<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.110> get<00:05:46.230> massive<00:05:46.650> amounts<00:05:46.950> of<00:05:46.950> nice

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
also you get massive amounts of nice

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.700 
also you get massive amounts of nice
staying<00:05:48.060> up<00:05:48.240> there<00:05:48.360> creamy<00:05:48.720> sound<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.260> my

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
staying up there creamy sound and my

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.710 
staying up there creamy sound and my
volume<00:05:49.950> is<00:05:50.100> not<00:05:50.160> too<00:05:50.400> loud<00:05:50.640> either<00:05:50.850> so<00:05:51.270> you'd

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
volume is not too loud either so you'd

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.660 
volume is not too loud either so you'd
get<00:05:51.900> some<00:05:52.110> nice<00:05:52.260> sustained<00:05:52.740> feedback<00:05:53.310> and<00:05:53.520> so

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
get some nice sustained feedback and so

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.540 
get some nice sustained feedback and so
forth<00:05:53.970> very<00:05:54.750> very<00:05:55.110> easily<00:05:55.500> i<00:05:55.890> like<00:05:56.190> it<00:05:56.310> around

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
forth very very easily i like it around
