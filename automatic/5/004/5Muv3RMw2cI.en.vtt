Freddy minigame now this one is
offensively<00:03:07.019> complex<00:03:07.590> I'm<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:08.070> going<00:03:08.250> to

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
offensively complex I'm just going to

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.620 
offensively complex I'm just going to
pause<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:08.970> explain<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
pause it here and explain this for a

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
identical to this which looks like this

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.340 
identical to this which looks like this
and<00:03:14.400> we<00:03:14.670> start<00:03:14.910> off<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.269> top<00:03:15.510> left<00:03:15.989> most

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
and we start off in the top left most

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.590 
and we start off in the top left most
room<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.220> here<00:03:17.400> goes<00:03:17.430> I'll<00:03:17.760> explain<00:03:18.180> as<00:03:18.420> we<00:03:18.450> go

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
room so here goes I'll explain as we go

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.000 
room so here goes I'll explain as we go
through<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.079> so<00:03:19.230> we<00:03:19.320> start<00:03:19.500> off<00:03:19.680> we<00:03:19.799> need<00:03:19.890> to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
through it so we start off we need to
