00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.859
 banks do than before 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.239
 we are back with the wife being even what a horrible you know 

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:16.960
 does not want to 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.009
 yes I think it's a really cool game but then of course we were there 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.379
 and you really are not his belt I believe yes you are already far 

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:25.739
 from the myth of the gt or yes like games 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.039
 and that put the fool who had no past kees kwakman very much to two 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.159
 years ago from two years ago the doors play guest separately for two years 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.550
 suddenly our late and e3 and whatever comes 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.440
 and now 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.489
 it is so far that it finally hits king play and I am there 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.030
 surprised because 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.120
 titia wick 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 to get rid of the shares in short it is a team that suspects 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.180
 mistreatment 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.360
 that's the biggest carp 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.080
 German 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.240
 the the residents who dare 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.610
 the locals i have i would of course not like on the pictures 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.869
 have seen on the youtube videos that are the year or we give 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.719
 are you experiencing a little more 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.169
 that made from the games and on an equal or filth what was the behavior of 

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:14.319
 the people in that game that resume on art and it was noticed that everyone responds to 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.170
 each other because of his wife but also fainted at the bus stop 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.490
 and everything goes like the phone call 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 lg with all his wife jenny also was shocked to catch an imac tram pictures that is true 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.310
 realistic because nowadays everyone also has a mobile one 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.970
 other 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.530
 yes and then nothing 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.590
 how waalwijk i can make me go f i am i was speechless about that nature and all 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.679
 the shadows mikati sparkles reflection 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.910
 her 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.330
 that's how a gartmore should be 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.680
 you have 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.810
 see below 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.590
 That 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.630
 but the transfer 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.590
 awake animal yes then you automatically get when two were great yes sorry 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.810
 i'm not that perfect for say but i'm not running out 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.080
 by that i mean i would know if sp play against us just for the kick 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.119
 we all know 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.369
 therefore i'm not going to corrupt x so much but the game play yes 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.429
 the kink 2 had come super great 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:19.129
 and what you already are of course the interaction from the outside world to 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.860
 the main character and nac 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.420
 yes the rest of the world what you do that i have a second child he was really great 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 vincent and the interaction with the outside world will be for sale 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.440
 so became itself 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.520
 a nice example that could look at things just out of the blue just you drive 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.120
 along 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.589
 you drive let traffic light 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.300
 hey the knot himself 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.359
 if it's achmea, he drives the police 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.620
 all came together in abundance and the beauty was still there 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.100
 it every time so that you perform such a take down is also a very nice slow 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.870
 motion 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.400
 and whatever happened that was what it liked that was a nice addition 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.259
 wells 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.629
 to maintain 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.639
 now it's just not there that the drivers are subdued nicely 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.840
 colombo anp the eleven people think of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.090
 in that you say but make with gt5 at the same time 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.290
 This is totally white teeth clean not innovative especially with the fence system 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.349
 the answer a point a funny ending there that has a mobile citibank once 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.000
 to do directly that account for him you eat grab them money you are going to be 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.170
 machine to take that money back so he is good 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.029
 and yes that makes you earn money and not because of the missions but 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.779
 it was unclear to me that I was able to take on the missions 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:42.129
 I clearly had one 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.809
 mission 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.399
 de and I also hope that the language will not be driven by this number 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:49.210
 for by mission say you have mission 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.200
 and that you lead and behind colorful next that you have with you and 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.939
 to guide you 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.939
 and you naturally come up for discussion 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.210
 wormer what is this anyway 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.210
 it's about order calls 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.399
 who wants to do something 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.169
 want to do the market 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.639
 but i just wanted to talk about how it works online think this 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.240
 also play online game 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.490
 that was very strange that assad came as a single player and for a woman reason 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.470
 there is a multi purpose neighborhood direct m we will be the main character 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.590
 experimented multiplayer 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.800
 so what happened was the city 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 the he had to switch it out well with that he did 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.580
 then he just had it switched 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.460
 and then you come back to watch it again and then if you are a bit crazy if you do 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.969
 was complete say 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.649
 that what you added to a list is so through the ears that even more people 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:01.610
 who is already crazy to do then you know what fat you have to dare to look for day and day 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.499
 that guy in front of us 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:07.400
 say it to the opposite of our table and still take a look at it 

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:11.339
 we didn't see that yet, but this is pretty much what we propose for myself sometimes 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.909
 a little bit during the day to look at our elop art and then he looked at it and then 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.089
 know that work was and scales full but complete yes 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.129
 that dick dekker who was echoing online times it was something innovative 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.620
 different and the spark is nice only it is still a bit itself 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.229
 but what now you know what now 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.460
 but no I thought short or long game that you and certainly gave up 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.470
 November comes from I can't wait 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.610
 Leonie also, but it was that he was just making it 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.020
 The mountain entheimer there are still long 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.020
 harold web 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.019
