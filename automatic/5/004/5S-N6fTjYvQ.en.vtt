00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 Hello, I 'm Marques, and I 'm another guide. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:12.420
 com s revised episode 20 I got here 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 in cadin it's 15 to finish 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.529
 opinion on the video is not enough with the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.230
 what point do you think should be 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.820
 finish is for the people are talking about 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.779
 who reach a point so year is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.849
 impossible this episode between a car 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.199
 but let's go there this episode 20 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.329
 after the run of the last episodes 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.000
 I would kill a lot of death. 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.520
 lots of people dying home with paint 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.469
 The female who was once everything is the capeta 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.610
 our team is more the time is now for me 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.890
 taking the one you know who is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.559
 It's different so I 'm not going to say anything 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 is in a war that should not appear 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.550
 No one yet in the second season 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.610
 but she is a fuck 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.699
 the visual of the visual year I like the style 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.070
 total and this episode was on the field and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.979
 after all that one would run half the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 episode is talk, just talk, and it's good, it 's 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.020
 that they were debating would have been 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.270
 the right choice is that it was not possible 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 have done some other way then 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.680
 other means justify why it has 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.130
 hidden from everyone because they 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.900
 suspicion that titans of the type 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.170
 unknown of the special type 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.320
 they are people right then you could not 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.450
 have simply told people to jump looks 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.350
 only person staying here in the middle will fall 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.540
 to attract the ruler will attract the titan and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490
 this could not have had to fool all 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.820
 world basically deceived everyone 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.500
 Like I said a cool thing about 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.079
 episode in past elections was 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.479
 precisely the disorientation of the crowd and 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.829
 This choice justified in this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.030
 half of this next episode in the 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.670
 first half 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.189
 in the second half as I always thought 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.390
 I had things going to stay there and such 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.490
 of titan is corrupt 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.490
 not really because at the end of the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.020
 You saw that it is possible that 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.580
 Be someone else there I do not think 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.330
 he was just as important as the other 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.210
 when the other 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.820
 the past episodes nor because until 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.610
 because what was happening and 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.970
 accessories is not a club with great ne 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.580
 but that's what blew the guy's head looks 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.360
 only she called the staff they ignored 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.270
 the soldiers and such and such eat a wipe 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.770
 the living and she escaped so atypical of 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.890
 of a bitch who thought it would go 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.920
 to move on to this self 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.420
 I do not think I give an average rating 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.850
 before acting well again kakÃ¡ by the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.040
 ability of reasoning because 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.360
 while you had a group talking to 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.920
 he trying to understand why the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:03.000
 bayern did this together with the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.250
 same time alone all just reasoning 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.380
 alone happening beating you 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.970
 hiring information then not me 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.040
 He is a very intelligent guy. 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.110
 I like the character to donate - have to 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.240
 have a little more prominence suddenly 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.100
 put it in a more 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.080
 strategy does not have to fight hard 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.260
 because he is very weak 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.690
 I really like the character and more. 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.570
 once like I said 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.170
 two things happened episodes already 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.330
 had said before that the first 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.209
 air is to see ne 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.670
 Damn it because I was an ear buddy. 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.600
 for the people of patrician decision was 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.130
 certain or not 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.440
 but he himself was to be saw nothing 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.280
 of character damn relevant 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.050
 main 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.420
 and do not come with this one, you do not have 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.840
 rush that is missing or 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:01.140
 the enemy has made everything do not have the strength 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:04.830
 now it's a great and even great time. 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:09.390
 in mg comic 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.450
 He threw himself, I did not spin clothes, and I 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.140
 that at that time I only know 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.209
 china and usa containing funny no no 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.950
 Come down to me, do not come down. 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.620
 I do not know if anyone thinks it's funny 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.139
 this average episode 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.970
 I found it incredible more good to be 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.930
 prepared for the future as I know more 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.180
 or less that will happen in the coming 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.919
 episodes 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.449
 I'm obviously as excited as ever. 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.660
 I got put on an animal. 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:39.260
 well this week I will try me 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.880
 painted to achieve spending in degrees and 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.530
 I do not even know how much 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.139
 treasure is now with 67 each segment 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.810
 in making videos that should come out 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:56.030
 next weekend 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:05:03.590
 sure the videocast 58 will leave this Friday 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:06.350
 That time the promise I think you're going 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.960
 I really like the right theme 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.970
 linked to the west id and opted to 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.199
 videocast com.br 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.199
 hug your head
