00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.930
 Today I show you a variant of 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.059
 simple origami bookmark her 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.219
 need has such a square piece 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.520
 origami paper or any 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.150
 other pieces of square paper and one 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.759
 scissors 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.470
 if you do not care how paper used then 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.040
 It's best to follow the printed page 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.910
 below 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.290
 Now we hold the point from below 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 on top of the top so that one 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.880
 right triangle arises 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.340
 now comes the difference to that 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.830
 simple origami bookmark 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.590
 we'll be the tips from the bottom in 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.870
 Keep the direction of the triangle 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.300
 but not quite up to the top 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:55.690
 but hang on small distance 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:57.310
 Leave it like this 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.930
 We must also do exactly the same thing 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.930
 so often do other things 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.560
 This is how the middle of a small bar 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 remains open 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.210
 now the steps are similar to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.979
 the simple origami fold both 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.979
 tip down again in half 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.880
 from this figure it arises to solve it 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.040
 We the last two case still stepped 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.440
 ever a 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.760
 the front side of the triangle behind 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.180
 down to the very edge 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.890
 get this now and again we get 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.210
 the step from before in which we 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.330
 right side of the triangle again 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.570
 fold up but do not hold forward 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.270
 but into the resulting bag 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 we have to work very carefully because 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.650
 in this bag after he in his book 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.960
 is plugged 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.550
 then this figure is the same 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.290
 then make another side here too 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.400
 Let's meet the side of that again 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.040
 triangle upwards 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.910
 in fold the point in the resulting 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.910
 in 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.380
 Now our bookmark is almost 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.300
 we just have to finish up here 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.300
 make a small cut 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.270
 and already lead by bookmarks 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:41.070
 that's really a big deal 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.530
 Variation about a quarter of a normal 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.900
 origami paper of 15 cm page length 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.510
 a nice little one is used 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.360
 program next time a lot of fun 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.310
 Try it and show it next time 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.430
 i want you to do a simple carmen like 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.430
