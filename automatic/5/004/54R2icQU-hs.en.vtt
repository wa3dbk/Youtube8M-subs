you can see I've got to sketch books on
this<00:00:33.309> table<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:34.320> basically<00:00:35.320> I'm<00:00:35.649> really

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
this table and basically I'm really

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.610 
this table and basically I'm really
psyched<00:00:36.309> that<00:00:36.550> Seth<00:00:37.149> is<00:00:37.329> on<00:00:37.510> schedule<00:00:37.870> to

finish<00:00:38.950> both<00:00:39.399> of<00:00:39.430> these<00:00:39.700> sketchbooks<00:00:40.270> and<00:00:40.390> so

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
finish both of these sketchbooks and so

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.869 
finish both of these sketchbooks and so
the<00:00:40.750> first<00:00:41.020> one<00:00:41.289> it's<00:00:42.010> pretty<00:00:42.280> thick<00:00:42.489> it's<00:00:42.699> not

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879

the first one it's pretty thick it's not
super<00:00:43.210> skinny<00:00:43.449> is<00:00:44.350> due<00:00:44.679> for<00:00:44.980> seven<00:00:45.519> weeks<00:00:45.699> of

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
super skinny is due for seven weeks of

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.520 
super skinny is due for seven weeks of
the<00:00:45.940> semester<00:00:46.179> and<00:00:46.719> so<00:00:46.870> let's<00:00:47.079> flip<00:00:47.320> through

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
the semester and so let's flip through

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.849 
the semester and so let's flip through
it<00:00:47.589> and<00:00:47.769> this<00:00:48.190> is<00:00:48.370> actually<00:00:48.550> second<00:00:49.769> part<00:00:50.769> of

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
it and this is actually second part of

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.430 
it and this is actually second part of
the<00:00:50.920> semester<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.519> second<00:00:52.510> seven<00:00:52.899> weeks<00:00:53.140> it's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
the semester the second seven weeks it's

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.160 
the semester the second seven weeks it's
it's<00:00:53.679> really<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.010> 15-week<00:00:54.640> semester<00:00:55.149> but<00:00:55.329> I'm

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
it's really a 15-week semester but I'm

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's really a 15-week semester but I'm
just<00:00:56.289> dividing<00:00:56.739> it<00:00:56.920> into<00:00:57.100> two<00:00:57.309> so<00:00:57.999> if<00:00:58.089> we<00:00:58.239> flip

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
just dividing it into two so if we flip

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.479 
just dividing it into two so if we flip
through<00:00:58.839> this<00:00:59.079> and<00:00:59.409> I<00:00:59.769> know<00:00:59.920> that<00:01:00.280> these<00:01:00.460> are

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
through this and I know that these are

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.399 
through this and I know that these are
really<00:01:00.969> hard<00:01:01.149> to<00:01:01.269> see<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.809> I'm<00:01:01.929> going<00:01:02.139> to<00:01:02.199> take

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
really hard to see and I'm going to take

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.710 
really hard to see and I'm going to take
pictures<00:01:02.679> of<00:01:02.829> some<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.159> them<00:01:03.370> but<00:01:04.030> basically

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
pictures of some of them but basically

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.680 
pictures of some of them but basically
these<00:01:05.260> are<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:06.729> unique<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:07.510> different

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
than the other two previous sketch books

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.480 
than the other two previous sketch books
that<00:01:10.150> I<00:01:10.180> showed<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.870> and<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:12.010> detail<00:01:12.460> of

that I showed to you and the detail of

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.530 
that I showed to you and the detail of
these<00:01:12.880> drawings<00:01:13.180> is<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:14.710> delicate<00:01:15.540> when

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
these drawings is really delicate when

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.540 
these drawings is really delicate when
you<00:01:16.660> look<00:01:16.870> up<00:01:17.080> close<00:01:17.110> at<00:01:17.800> all<00:01:18.010> of<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.340> line

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
you look up close at all of the line

would just say to mix it up with the
line<00:02:43.850> variety<00:02:44.390> because<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.170> drawings<00:02:45.530> are

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
line variety because the drawings are

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.810 
line variety because the drawings are
beautiful<00:02:46.040> those<00:02:46.160> are<00:02:46.280> those<00:02:46.370> bridgeman

beautiful those are those bridgeman
drawings<00:02:47.150> I'm<00:02:47.240> going<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.480> flip<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.870> second

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
drawings I'm going to flip to the second

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.370 
drawings I'm going to flip to the second
sketchbook<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.070> i<00:02:49.610> think<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.330> paper<00:02:50.990> in

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
sketchbook and i think the the paper in

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.860 
sketchbook and i think the the paper in
the<00:02:51.980> second<00:02:52.400> sketch<00:02:52.670> book<00:02:52.910> is<00:02:53.120> making<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the second sketch book is making the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.850 
the second sketch book is making the
lines<00:02:54.110> much<00:02:54.680> darker<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.200> again<00:02:57.200> if<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.470> kind<00:02:57.770> of

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
lines much darker and again if I kind of

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.440 
lines much darker and again if I kind of
come<00:02:58.010> up<00:02:58.040> close<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.790> can<00:02:58.850> see<00:02:59.150> some<00:02:59.420> of

you're<00:03:18.110> going<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.380> develop<00:03:18.560> your<00:03:18.770> eye<00:03:18.830> hand

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
you're going to develop your eye hand

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.890 
you're going to develop your eye hand
coordination<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:20.720> was<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:22.360> Lauren<00:03:23.360> jorn

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
coordination that was the Lauren jorn

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.199 
coordination that was the Lauren jorn
that<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.230> thought<00:03:24.530> came<00:03:24.890> out<00:03:25.070> really<00:03:25.760> good<00:03:25.970> I

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
that I thought came out really good I

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.940 
that I thought came out really good I
think<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.660> looks<00:03:26.690> pretty<00:03:27.049> much<00:03:27.320> like<00:03:27.470> her<00:03:27.799> and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
think it looks pretty much like her and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.610 
think it looks pretty much like her and
now<00:03:28.100> from<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:29.000> point<00:03:29.120> on<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.570> can<00:03:30.049> see<00:03:30.380> the

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
now from this point on you can see the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.460 
now from this point on you can see the
improvement<00:03:31.310> in<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.610> line<00:03:31.850> variety<00:03:32.570> in<00:03:32.750> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
improvement in the line variety in the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.039 
improvement in the line variety in the
drawings<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.940> think<00:03:35.450> there's<00:03:35.600> some<00:03:35.810> good

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
drawings and I think there's some good

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.900 
drawings and I think there's some good
stuff<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.500> there's<00:03:36.709> some<00:03:36.890> major<00:03:37.190> improvement

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
stuff and there's some major improvement

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.660
