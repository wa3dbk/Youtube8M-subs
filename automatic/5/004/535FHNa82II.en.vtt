00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
got as far as core more so here we are

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.680

1700 watt Meridian hi-fi but what

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.820 
1700 watt Meridian hi-fi but what
matters<00:02:23.150> most<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.840> what's<00:02:24.380> under<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.709> bonnet

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
matters most is what's under the bonnet

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.760 
matters most is what's under the bonnet
and<00:02:25.160> there<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.940> new<00:02:26.270> three<00:02:26.690> litre<00:02:26.900> v6<00:02:27.350> yes

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
and there is a new three litre v6 yes

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.910 
and there is a new three litre v6 yes
only<00:02:28.010> three<00:02:28.130> litres<00:02:28.840> v6<00:02:29.840> engine<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.350> let's

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
only three litres v6 engine so let's

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:43.430 
only three litres v6 engine so let's
just<00:02:31.100> see<00:02:31.220> how<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.520> goes<00:02:31.670> shall<00:02:31.940> we

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.730 

this<00:02:44.070> may<00:02:44.280> be<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:45.150> 3-liter<00:02:45.630> v6<00:02:45.750> under<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
this may be just a 3-liter v6 under the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.350 
this may be just a 3-liter v6 under the
bonnet<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.160> because<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.730> Range<00:02:47.940> Rover<00:02:48.240> has

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
bonnet but because the Range Rover has

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.540 
bonnet but because the Range Rover has
lost<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:48.780> much<00:02:48.960> weight<00:02:49.020> as<00:02:49.710> I<00:02:49.830> said<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.160> 420

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
lost so much weight as I said it's 420

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.300 
lost so much weight as I said it's 420
kilos<00:02:51.120> which<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.360> roughly<00:02:52.290> five<00:02:52.650> big<00:02:52.980> blokes

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.150 
kilos which is roughly five big blokes
in<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.610> car<00:02:53.880> then<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.290> performance<00:02:55.590> level<00:02:56.100> is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
in a car then the performance level is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.850 
in a car then the performance level is
pretty<00:02:56.460> much<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> same<00:02:56.970> as<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.480> 4.4<00:02:58.230> v8<00:02:58.650> in

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860

aluminium<00:05:29.870> tech<00:05:30.140> which<00:05:30.320> makes<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.680> so<00:05:30.890> much

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
aluminium tech which makes it so much

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.560 
aluminium tech which makes it so much
lighter<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:31.580> much<00:05:31.700> more<00:05:31.880> efficient<00:05:32.240> and<00:05:32.330> so

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
lighter so much more efficient and so

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.930 
lighter so much more efficient and so
much<00:05:32.750> better<00:05:32.960> to<00:05:33.200> drive<00:05:33.470> it's<00:05:34.070> not<00:05:34.340> perfect

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
much better to drive it's not perfect

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.580 
much better to drive it's not perfect
for<00:05:34.970> example<00:05:35.420> it<00:05:35.810> could<00:05:35.990> really<00:05:36.170> still<00:05:36.470> be<00:05:36.560> a

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
for example it could really still be a

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.660 
for example it could really still be a
little<00:05:36.680> bit<00:05:36.830> more<00:05:37.010> space<00:05:37.280> in<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.490> back<00:05:37.520> and

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
little bit more space in the back and

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.670 
little bit more space in the back and

getting in and out just the wheel arch
it's<00:05:39.920> still<00:05:40.130> not<00:05:40.340> exactly<00:05:40.520> easy<00:05:41.200> it's<00:05:42.200> very

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
it's still not exactly easy it's very

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.110 
it's still not exactly easy it's very
expensive<00:05:42.920> much<00:05:43.310> more<00:05:43.490> expensive<00:05:43.730> than<00:05:43.940> the
