00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 The Berlin Philharmonic mourns 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.570
 claudio abbado and dedicate 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.230
 the concert of this evening under 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.570
 the direction of zubin mehta and the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.110
 longtime former chief conductor 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.949
 and memories of a wonderful 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.439
 people and great artists allowed 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:32.140
 I ask you to rise and one 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.140
 minute to think of him silently 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.409
 here in the milan scala 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.920
 in front of an empty public hall becomes equal 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.750
 the head of the milan scala but also 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.710
 the opera under the linden trees in berlin 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 daniel barenboim directors kick 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.229
 and we look at the second sentence 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.350
 beethoven's third symphony is playing the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.619
 mourning and thus with milan 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.360
 Claudio Abbado commemorates the house 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.950
 the milan will be the doors 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.470
 The Milanese scala are open one 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 will only hear the little one and the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.310
 milan claudio abbado have too much 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.520
 it is not just this that he owes 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 golden opera house dusted but he 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.789
 is with his music also in companies and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.039
 gone and really has workshops 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.070
 the classical music among the people 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.070
 brought 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.720
 so the scala went away from the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.550
 high from brazil to the big one 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.170
 audience as well as tonight though 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.200
 the big audience the top of the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.120
 cheap places always gathered 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.070
 Pull here today on the space together 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.260
 with all the other important and big ones 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.209
 I think that is an idea of 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.950
 audience that he would have liked 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.510
 mine that future notes today with it 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.050
 also would be lucky 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.050
 tell 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.670
 He has a lot of music so 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.040
 especially the berlin philharmonic very 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.989
 changed in the time was there and that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.439
 was of course after his long 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.659
 career for each dirigenten what 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.340
 insanely difficult is one 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.930
 Conduct orchestra and be 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.230
 to get the orchestra I believe that has 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.790
 very very good and on his very own 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.790
 kind of done 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.450
