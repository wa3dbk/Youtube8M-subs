the<00:00:51.120> tower<00:00:51.300> because<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.199> safe

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
the tower because it's not really safe

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.250

fire<00:01:05.309> again<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.000> looks<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.390> just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
fire again and it looks like you just

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.899 
fire again and it looks like you just
wasted<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> bunch<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.560> his<00:01:10.830> stuff<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.850> there

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
wasted a bunch of his stuff right there

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:22.780 
wasted a bunch of his stuff right there
so

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.040 

so<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> thoughts<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.300> bit<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.660> damage<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
so I thoughts a little bit of damage to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.090 
so I thoughts a little bit of damage to
them<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.440> probably<00:01:25.620> didn't<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:25.980> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
them there you probably didn't like that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.630 
them there you probably didn't like that
so<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:27.620> top<00:01:28.620> seems<00:01:28.980> to<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.340> doing<00:01:29.490> okay<00:01:31.640> but

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so much top seems to be doing okay but

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.620 
so much top seems to be doing okay but
who<00:01:33.150> knows<00:01:34.670> activate<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.790> rapid<00:01:36.120> fire<00:01:36.300> again

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
