00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 for you concepts are the comments 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.180
 of the match between roadrunners and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.220
 streaks of Monterrey by the glass of mx 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.510
 perhaps the comments below says 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.260
 description have the goals if what 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.130
 we want 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.820
 m 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.820
 He says 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.960
 in the comments if in the previous ones 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.300
 the games the monterrey plays and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.310
 when we said that dorón pabón is a 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.410
 game is a crack that rises according to 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.540
 I considered myself the best player in Mexico 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.830
 came the best front players 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.860
 that exists good today proves it 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.120
 boy did what he wanted despite 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.840
 that at the beginning was a little more the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.840
 Roadrunner and the Monterrey Archer 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.500
 and 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.070
 is let's say he was safe at the beginning 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.070
 but 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.059
 and a play on the left d 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.309
 candid perez in case by left 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.250
 sorry if I did not say good and eluded several 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.810
 players and puts a tremendous left foot that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.970
 the archer could not do anything that did not 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.729
 I can not be bad pinto the 1 to 0 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.149
 for the monterrey the logical thing was not coming 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.710
 the logical seemed like it was quiet 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:21.920
 the game but sergio roses does hit the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.860
 ball in the right hand of víctor 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.750
 branches and the referee ortiz decreed the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.500
 criminal so norberto did not become 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.070
 the tie for the roadrunners and 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.840
 he gets 11 the game seemed to be 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.580
 it complicated a little to the striped ones 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.290
 but if we are when very well so 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.670
 and of the hand of the program although it is a 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.100
 good luxury 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.310
 in the final stretch of the first half the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 Pretty Ortiz got another hand 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 within the area 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.140
 norland says cash at 42 minutes and 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.140
 it is placed 2 to 1 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.890
 the striped ones and they go in the discount on 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.270
 the second in Monterrey came out to define 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.679
 the match and 43 minutes 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.239
 arellano makes a pass for peacock and give 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.300
 a definition please I ask that the 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.510
 see a goal really showing all 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.690
 the skill all the technique and that of the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.090
 delicacy the delight of a player 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.840
 extraordinary like shaving so 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.080
 then there was adequate trap more 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.080
 and arellano with which 57 minutes 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.030
 let's say 3 to 1 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.000
 after 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Arellano 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.670
 and at 40 to 88 the monterrey 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.220
 also make a nice play for 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.450
 left a center and Luis madrigal of 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.819
 run result of 5 to 1 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.650
 let's say the win closed the volley of the 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.780
 scratched 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.780
 and got the three points in the cup 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.670
 we will see how it continues now they have a 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.170
 match in the league for the league but 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.930
 good monte root of the hand I already say 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.610
 from dorlán pabón and I an excellent 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.640
 match he won comfortably is the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.530
 result says it so I repeat them there 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.880
 down they have the goals to see them already 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.770
 I counted them more or less and notice the each 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360
 play that participates pavón I think that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.730
 for me the monterrey is going to be the champion 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.760
 of the league so I'm saying it now 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.820
 but we'll see there on the right above you 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.230
 you can subscribe to the channel and see you in 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.230
 the next mission drastic chau
