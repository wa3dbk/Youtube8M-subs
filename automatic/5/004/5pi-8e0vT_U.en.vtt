00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
anyway so I rushed him and I thought

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.280 
anyway so I rushed him and I thought
that<00:01:21.700> he<00:01:22.000> had<00:01:22.030> pushed<00:01:22.330> me<00:01:22.450> farther<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.990> second

son didn't hit so I thought that he

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.920 
son didn't hit so I thought that he
pushed<00:01:24.729> back<00:01:24.970> into<00:01:25.149> his<00:01:25.299> spawn<00:01:25.540> he<00:01:25.750> actually

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
attention to how your opponent plays I

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.870 
attention to how your opponent plays I
don't<00:01:47.140> usually<00:01:47.259> like<00:01:47.590> one<00:01:47.830> up<00:01:47.920> there<00:01:48.130> but

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
don't usually like one up there but

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.910 
don't usually like one up there but
because<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.869> know<00:01:49.960> he's<00:01:50.200> playing<00:01:50.440> aggressive

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
because you know he's playing aggressive

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.249 
because you know he's playing aggressive
that's<00:01:51.700> what<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:51.940> had<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> do<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:52.690> anyways<00:01:53.020> I

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
that's what I had to do so anyways I

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.570 
that's what I had to do so anyways I
think<00:01:53.649> he's<00:01:53.979> going<00:01:54.069> to<00:01:54.190> play<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.310> little<00:01:54.399> bit

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
think he's going to play a little bit

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.279 
think he's going to play a little bit
more<00:01:54.700> conservative<00:01:55.000> here<00:01:55.420> so<00:01:55.810> if<00:01:56.020> I'm<00:01:56.140> on

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
more conservative here so if I'm on

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.710 
more conservative here so if I'm on
defense<00:01:56.649> I'm<00:01:57.310> gonna<00:01:57.490> try<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:57.940> I<00:01:58.149> don't<00:01:58.659> know

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
defense I'm gonna try and I don't know

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.539
