of Leicester blast is brilliant it
really<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.389> I'm<00:00:12.660> not<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:13.049> saying<00:00:13.230> that

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
really is I'm not just saying that

really is I'm not just saying that
because<00:00:13.380> I'm<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.799> glass<00:00:14.009> blower<00:00:14.280> that's<00:00:14.610> an

because I'm a glass blower that's an

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.109 
because I'm a glass blower that's an
incredibly<00:00:15.480> versatile<00:00:16.080> material<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.730> it's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
incredibly versatile material and it's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.090 
incredibly versatile material and it's
one<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.330> those<00:00:18.510> things<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.590> common

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
one of those things it's it's so common

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.000 
one of those things it's it's so common
we<00:00:20.910> don't<00:00:21.090> see<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.410> from<00:00:22.619> an<00:00:22.710> artistic

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
we don't see it and from an artistic

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009 
we don't see it and from an artistic
point<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.640> view<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:24.480> almost<00:00:24.779> as<00:00:24.990> though

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
point of view it's almost as though

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.480 
point of view it's almost as though
whenever<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.500> make<00:00:25.650> something<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.279> glass

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
whenever you make something in glass

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.250 
whenever you make something in glass
you're<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.300> actually<00:00:27.480> sculpting<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you're not actually sculpting with the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.480 
you're not actually sculpting with the
material<00:00:28.769> that's<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.099> you're<00:00:29.250> sculpting

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
material that's like you're sculpting

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.690 
material that's like you're sculpting
with<00:00:29.789> late<00:00:30.410> there<00:00:31.410> used<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.099> lot<00:00:32.550> more

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
with late there used to be a lot more

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.610 
with late there used to be a lot more
glass<00:00:32.969> floors<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.600> universities<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.530> there

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
glass floors and universities and there

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.420 
glass floors and universities and there
are<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.800> these<00:00:34.890> days

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
are in these days

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.180 
are in these days
I<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:36.149> glassblowing<00:00:36.840> could<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I do think glassblowing could do with a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
I do think glassblowing could do with a
revival<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.149> can't<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.450> allowed<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.690> die<00:00:39.899> out

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
revival that can't be allowed to die out

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.319 
revival that can't be allowed to die out
this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.070> large-scale<00:00:41.340> condenser<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.210> this

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
this is large-scale condenser and this

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.810 
this is large-scale condenser and this
is<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.870> making<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.230> HTT

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
is what I'm going to be making for HTT

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.799 
is what I'm going to be making for HTT
there<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.940> comes<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.390> muted<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> half

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
there this comes in muted and a half

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
there this comes in muted and a half
lights<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> coil<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.190> around<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
lights with a coil it around this

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.020 
lights with a coil it around this
mandrel<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.629> turn<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.500> length<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.789> about

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
mandrel to turn that length and to about

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.709 
mandrel to turn that length and to about
that<00:00:51.930> sort<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> length<00:00:53.180> before<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.390> start<00:00:54.629> the

that sort of length before to start the

that sort of length before to start the
job<00:00:54.899> they're<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.739> regular<00:00:56.190> sunglasses<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
job they're not regular sunglasses that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
job they're not regular sunglasses that
coating<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.590> thing<00:00:58.859> called

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
coating on there is a thing called

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
coating on there is a thing called
Debian<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.510> does<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> filters

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
Debian and what that does is it filters

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.049 
Debian and what that does is it filters
out<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> sodium<00:01:01.859> glare<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:02.820> end<00:01:02.969> up

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
out the sodium glare so you don't end up

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
out the sodium glare so you don't end up
with<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.270> boiled<00:01:03.539> eyeball<00:01:03.960> feeling<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> end

nice it's like gaining a sense of wonder
so<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.100> actually<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.460> Romans<00:01:17.850> liver

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so it's actually the Romans liver

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.570 
so it's actually the Romans liver
responsible<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.049> making<00:01:19.189> transparent<00:01:20.189> glass

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
responsible for making transparent glass

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.730 
responsible for making transparent glass
because<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.630> failed<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> made<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> easier<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
because they failed it made it easier to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.350 
because they failed it made it easier to
appreciate<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> color<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> quality<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
appreciate the color and the quality of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.510 
appreciate the color and the quality of
their<00:01:24.509> wine<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.590> fits

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.070 

that<00:01:35.520> sounds<00:01:35.820> bad<00:01:35.970> actually

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
that sounds bad actually

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.760 
that sounds bad actually
that's<00:01:37.350> pretty<00:01:37.530> good<00:01:39.470> if<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.650> that

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
different joins on the end of this I'm

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.139 
different joins on the end of this I'm
going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> join<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.320> outside<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.920> inside

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
going to join the outside to the inside

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.120 
going to join the outside to the inside
so<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:48.600> bit<00:01:48.689> tricky<00:01:49.130> fingers

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so it's a little bit tricky fingers

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.070 
so it's a little bit tricky fingers
