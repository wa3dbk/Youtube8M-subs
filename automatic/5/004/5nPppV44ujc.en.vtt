legendary class on the loot side of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.370 
legendary class on the loot side of
things<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.360> don't<00:00:33.420> think<00:00:33.930> they're<00:00:34.110> gonna<00:00:34.170> be

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380

legendary<00:00:34.710> weapons<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.489> coming<00:00:35.730> out<00:00:35.790> I

loot<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:17.009> XP<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.939> could<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.150> worth<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> most

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
loot for XP this could be worth the most

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120 
loot for XP this could be worth the most
so<00:01:18.960> I'd<00:01:19.049> say<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.530> worth<00:01:20.009> at

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so I'd say it's going to be worth at

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.490 
so I'd say it's going to be worth at
least<00:01:20.189> no<00:01:20.549> 3k<00:01:20.970> maybe<00:01:21.210> even<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> 5k<00:01:22.080> wat<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
least no 3k maybe even up to 5k wat to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
least no 3k maybe even up to 5k wat to
see<00:01:22.650> how<00:01:22.770> much<00:01:22.920> XP<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.400> worth<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.330> that's

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
see how much XP it's worth but so that's

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
see how much XP it's worth but so that's

there's going to take it out of the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.639 
there's going to take it out of the
Supply<00:02:03.030> Drop<00:02:03.090> rotation<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.259> can't<00:02:04.439> earn

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
Supply Drop rotation so you can't earn

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.620 
Supply Drop rotation so you can't earn
these<00:02:04.829> anymore<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> when<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.119> look<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.479> them

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
these anymore and when you look at them

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210 
these anymore and when you look at them
in<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.960> inventory<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> say<00:02:08.039> like

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
in your inventory it's going to say like

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.130 
in your inventory it's going to say like
retired<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:09.179> no<00:02:09.270> longer<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.929> stuff

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
retired can no longer get you know stuff

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.680 
retired can no longer get you know stuff
like<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.770> basically<00:02:11.700> what<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> think<00:02:12.480> this

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
like that so basically what I think this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.000 
like that so basically what I think this
is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
is

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.649 
is
obviously<00:02:13.909> it's<00:02:14.000> gonna<00:02:14.090> make<00:02:14.239> those<00:02:14.420> items

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
obviously it's gonna make those items

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.539 
obviously it's gonna make those items
more<00:02:14.989> rare<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:15.830> think<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.159> idea<00:02:16.220> behind

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
more rare but I think the idea behind

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.699 
more rare but I think the idea behind
this<00:02:16.849> is<00:02:16.909> they're<00:02:17.269> taking<00:02:17.720> cut<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
this is they're taking cut of the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.619 
this is they're taking cut of the
crappier<00:02:19.189> things<00:02:19.430> out<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.909> can't<00:02:20.480> think

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
crappier things out like I can't think

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.630 
crappier things out like I can't think
of<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.810> nice<00:02:20.989> way<00:02:21.019> to<00:02:21.290> say<00:02:21.799> that<00:02:22.040> but<00:02:22.220> they're

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
of a nice way to say that but they're

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.309 
of a nice way to say that but they're
taking<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.120> stuff<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:23.510> nobody<00:02:23.659> wants<00:02:24.110> out

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
taking the stuff that nobody wants out

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.509 
taking the stuff that nobody wants out
so<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.769> better<00:02:24.920> chance<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.459> getting

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
so you have a better chance of getting

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.309 
so you have a better chance of getting
the<00:02:25.849> better<00:02:26.000> stuff<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:26.540> there's<00:02:26.689> more<00:02:26.959> kind

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
the better stuff and there's more kind

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.440 
the better stuff and there's more kind
of<00:02:27.349> like<00:02:27.439> room<00:02:27.799> in<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:28.310> Supply<00:02:28.610> Drop<00:02:28.670> rotation

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
of like room in the Supply Drop rotation

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.149 
of like room in the Supply Drop rotation
so<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.900> think<00:02:30.379> over<00:02:30.590> time<00:02:30.620> they're<00:02:30.980> going<00:02:31.099> to

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
so I think over time they're going to

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.500 
so I think over time they're going to
keep<00:02:31.250> on<00:02:31.459> taking<00:02:31.640> out<00:02:31.909> like<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> lot<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.450> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
keep on taking out like a lot of the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.059 
keep on taking out like a lot of the
Nigerian<00:02:33.110> stuff<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> lot<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.860> stuff

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
Nigerian stuff and a lot of the stuff

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.440 
Nigerian stuff and a lot of the stuff
that<00:02:34.099> people<00:02:34.700> are<00:02:34.909> just<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.360> know

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
that people are just like you know

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.809 
that people are just like you know
nobody<00:02:35.989> ever<00:02:36.170> uses<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.099> know<00:02:37.400> that's<00:02:37.730> just

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
nobody ever uses so I know that's just

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.860 
nobody ever uses so I know that's just
that's<00:02:38.120> what<00:02:38.360> they're<00:02:38.480> doing<00:02:38.659> there<00:02:38.780> and

that's what they're doing there and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.670 
that's what they're doing there and
