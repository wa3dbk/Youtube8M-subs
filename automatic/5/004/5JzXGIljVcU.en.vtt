we're<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.509> towards<00:01:15.810> almost<00:01:16.320> real-time<00:01:17.070> our

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
we're going towards almost real-time our

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
we're going towards almost real-time our
users<00:01:18.210> liked<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> very<00:01:18.600> much<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.170> yeah<00:01:19.439> we

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
users liked it very much because yeah we

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.140 
users liked it very much because yeah we
have<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> data<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.580> everything<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
have a lot of data and everything that

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.109 
have a lot of data and everything that
we<00:01:21.299> move<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.110> pure<00:01:22.500> data<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.790> good

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
we move to pure data is very good

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.510 
we move to pure data is very good
performance<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:24.720> good<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.500> more<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
performance is very good or more and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.609 
performance is very good or more and

customers so to be able to predict

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520 
customers so to be able to predict
exactly<00:01:35.310> where<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> trains<00:01:36.509> will<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
exactly where the trains will be and to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.890 
exactly where the trains will be and to
be<00:01:37.770> much<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.280> precise<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.360> customers

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
be much more precise for the customers

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.520 
be much more precise for the customers
when<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:41.009> their<00:01:41.400> shipments

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
when they will get their shipments

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.520 
when they will get their shipments
or<00:01:43.040> when<00:01:43.820> they<00:01:43.910> will<00:01:44.060> get<00:01:44.210> rail<00:01:44.810> cars<00:01:45.140> it's

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
or when they will get rail cars it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.590 
or when they will get rail cars it's
much<00:01:45.890> winder<00:01:46.220> precision<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.210> future

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
much winder precision for the future

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.990 
much winder precision for the future
yeah<00:01:48.200> we<00:01:49.000> would<00:01:50.000> like<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.450> move<00:01:51.580> more<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.610> more

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
yeah we would like to move more and more

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.810 
yeah we would like to move more and more
and<00:01:53.810> predictive<00:01:54.740> analytics<00:01:54.830> making<00:01:55.670> your

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
and predictive analytics making your

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.690 
and predictive analytics making your
decisions<00:01:56.390> based<00:01:56.900> on<00:01:57.140> data<00:01:57.310> instead<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.490> just

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
decisions based on data instead of just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.440 
decisions based on data instead of just
intuition<00:01:59.600> or<00:02:00.229> gut<00:02:01.010> feeling<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:01.610> better<00:02:01.940> so

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
intuition or gut feeling is better so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.240 
intuition or gut feeling is better so
that's<00:02:02.540> much<00:02:02.750> more<00:02:02.780> efficient<00:02:03.260> than<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.530> used

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
that's much more efficient than it used

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.520 
that's much more efficient than it used
to<00:02:04.310> be
