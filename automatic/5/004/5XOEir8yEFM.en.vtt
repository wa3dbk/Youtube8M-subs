00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.549
 let's calculate how many numbers of three 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.879
 figures are that they only possess among their 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.879
 numbers the numbers 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 a three-digit number that has these 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.820
 figures 0 1 2 3 4 5 series for example the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:26.810
 1 2 3 would also be in 1 2 3 which is the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.119
 123 in 2 3 4 that is the 234 also the 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.010
 224 or they can be repeated because this 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.010
 is a three-digit number that counts 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:44.140
 between your figures with 0 1 2 3 4 5 the 110 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.500
 the 555 is another observe that we do not 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.449
 serves the 0 1 2 is to make a first 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.550
 position can not be because this does not 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.489
 is a three-digit number is the 12 that 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.369
 it's a good two figure number this 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.869
 we will do it later then 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.869
 we have three positions 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.740
 and in these three positions we have to 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.270
 put 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.270
 these 1 2 3 4 5 6 numbers 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.060
 of all those numbers that we put 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.190
 we will have to remove the positions in 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.380
 which we have zeroed in the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.050
 hundreds because then there is a number 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.950
 three figures 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.860
 Thus 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.090
 Let's notice that order is important, 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.520
 it's the same 123 that 213 have the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.009
 same figures but change the position on 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.890
 number is different and there may be 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.890
 repetitions then we have to order 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.420
 is important and also that there may be 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.119
 repetitions 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.210
 therefore we are facing a problem of 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.439
 variations with repetition variations 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.350
 with repetition of six elements taken 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.670
 of three because we have three positions 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.670
 in threes 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.240
 which we will have to remove 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.240
 the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.560
 they have zero in the hundreds 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.850
 of all those numbers that we have put 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.140
 there we have to remove those that 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.140
 begin with zero 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.489
 that is, we are going to put it down here 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.950
 all those numbers have to be removed 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:35.760
 those who have this form being 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:37.560
 here the 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 can appear 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.450
 then we have to take away how many 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.019
 numbers there are of these we observe that the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.319
 number of the hundreds is fixed and we have 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.569
 six numbers for two positions and you can 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.260
 the same thing happened happened here 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.760
 order is important and can also 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.629
 have repetitions therefore here 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.659
 we have two elements 6 bone variations 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:04.170
 with repetition or order in repetition 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.970
 can give six numbers taken from 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.460
 Two by two 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.100
 then this the result of this 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.570
 operation is not the numbers three 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.930
 figures that can be formed with the 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.580
 figures 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.560
 well, variations with repetition of 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.540
 six elements taken three at a time and 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.750
 we apply the formula these six elevated 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.180
 to three 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.070
 fewer variations with six repetition 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.940
 items taken two by two and six 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:36.450
 elevated 2 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:40.950
 6 raised to 36 by 6 36 by 6 216 less 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.540
 6 raised to 2 which is 36 which is 6 to 7 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.990
 36 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.790
 this remains 180 then numbers of 3 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:53.700
 figures that only have between their figures 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.410
 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 that would be 180 numbers if 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.750
 we do not remember another way of doing it 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.900
 by counting simply with a little 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.660
 of sight it is clear the zero can not 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.050
 appear there then here we have five 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.050
 possibilities 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.290
 now of those 5 that we have put here 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.239
 here we will have six possibilities because 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.540
 there zero can appear the same 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.540
 what .. here 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.820
 then we have in total how they combine 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:29.210
 all these possibilities 5 by 6 owns 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.919
 56 30 30 by 6 180 another way to do it 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.530
 simply counting on but 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.530
 using it without using formula
