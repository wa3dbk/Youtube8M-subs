00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.660
 ipod touch plus all of them are 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.660
 free we start 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.910
 in the sixth position of our ranking 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.710
 it is located wood the walls a game 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.689
 quite complex that will challenge us to go 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.099
 overcoming a series of barriers that we 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.779
 We will find you along the way and 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.950
 we will have to move with swayze in 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.960
 screen to the left or right 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.629
 as appropriate to avoid 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.250
 crash and lose the game the 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.170
 difficulty is quite complex because 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.910
 to move the barriers we will have to 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.739
 do it in the opposite direction of 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.620
 our finger and this requires a lot 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.840
 concentration plus the more levels 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.309
 we overcome, it will be more difficult to overcome 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.390
 obstacles since the pace of the game 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.399
 will be very very high you dare in the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.739
 fifth position we place to return 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.329
 legends this game will put us on the skin 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.550
 of a basketball player with whom 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.980
 we will have to score baskets taking care 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.110
 much the power to which we launch the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.759
 ball the throwing power the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.380
 we adjust sliding down to 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.450
 up measuring a lot the route of the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.860
 ceip not to go over the arrow 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.710
 located in the lower left 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.950
 which tells us the exact power for 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.990
 dunk basket the game has two 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.880
 game modes an arcade mode without 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.649
 difficulty none 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.659
 and a mode of challenges with which 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.850
 we will be able to overcome challenges while 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.130
 we are developing the skills and the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.409
 physical aspect of our player a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.530
 simulator game that will amuse the most 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.990
 basketball fans in the room 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.490
 put is sling with a very game 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.979
 fun in which we will have to go 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.079
 ascending on screen giving momentum to 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.450
 our monkey towards the supports to the 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.490
 that can be hooked in addition by the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.560
 we will find a series 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.060
 of obstacles that we should avoid 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.610
 just as we will also have to try 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.549
 do not pull or let in this case it 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.590
 drop our monkey down this 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.020
 game will certainly remember more than one to 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.240
 the famous pinball of the time to those 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.039
 games where we should go earning points 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.409
 while we were selling our little ball 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.090
 preventing it from falling into the well as more or 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.090
 less the same a very very game 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.099
 recommended good we are getting closer to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.900
 first place among the podium of 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.410
 our ranking third position for 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.540
 play and 2 a super original game and that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.130
 that's why it deserves to be here since it's going 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.650
 to think a lot about everything 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.280
 when we advance levels the mechanics of 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.590
 game involves drawing on the screen 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.930
 necessary elements so that the two 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.209
 colored balls come together is a game 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.950
 as I say very original and whose difficulty 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.380
 It will increase with the passage of 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.480
 levels to the point that is what I 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.090
 has happened to me of not knowing what to draw 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.890
 to be able to join the balls 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.830
 dare to try and see how far 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.080
 arrives the second position is for angry 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.239
 2 birds the second part of the famous 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.220
 saga angry birds in this new delivery 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.040
 because today we find new levels 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.170
 new animations and some more graphics 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.720
 cares the mechanics of the game is the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.640
 we will have to destroy the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.860
 scenarios of the game to be eliminated 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.959
 to the enemies that try to steal in 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.430
 the nests of our birds I do not think 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.200
 I have to say much more about this 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.080
 game since without a doubt many what 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.110
 you will know and therefore also deserves 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.830
 be here in this ranking and now yes the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.260
 first position is for 1010 a game 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.510

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.830
 game will have hooked hours and hours 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.720
 today was the main objective 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.910
 of the game is to join lines of 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.240
 pieces to be able to eliminate them and 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.500
 to have 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.300
 space to be able to do more 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.310
