00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
some spell on or some enhancement magic

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.920 
some spell on or some enhancement magic
so<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:26.849> thought<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:27.180> some<00:02:27.390> hell<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.750> some

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
so I thought that's some hell of some

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780 
so I thought that's some hell of some
magic<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.440> mean<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.220> gambling

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
magic I mean so it's like gambling

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.970 
magic I mean so it's like gambling
either<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.540> works<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.440> stronger<00:02:31.830> I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
either if it works you get stronger I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.710 
either if it works you get stronger I
guess<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.489> it's<00:02:32.700> enhancement<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.630> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
guess because it's enhancement but if it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.440 
guess because it's enhancement but if it
doesn't<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.110> die<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.069> guess<00:02:35.849> if<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.180> works

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
doesn't you die so I guess if it works

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.759 
doesn't you die so I guess if it works
on<00:02:36.720> him<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.050> you're<00:02:37.170> trying<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.500> use<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.650> to

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
on him and you're trying to use it to

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.559 
on him and you're trying to use it to
kill<00:02:38.010> him<00:02:38.190> what<00:02:38.310> sucks<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:39.030> I'm<00:02:39.300> just
