 Hello, congratulations to all of May

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.230

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.080
 someone else is preparing for this but 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.900
 I wish you all a great mood and 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.350
 I hope your holidays will also be set 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.590

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.190
 and mine and today we will talk about one more 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.020
 product 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.830
 from my Korean package which 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.710
 called latte art milk 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.989
 moment pack so if you're interested 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.920
 to know my opinion about this tool to interfere 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.409
 yogis were partying and we will review 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.089
 investigational product cup mood and I did 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:01.879
 so called from above looks like this spoon 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.810
 fake but in fact this spoon 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.200
 excellent mask scoops out proper 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.330
 tube spoon is easily put back by the way 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.909
 spoon I use not only for this 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.789
 masks i use it all other means 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.759
 tony moth and because usually there 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:23.930
 there are no distributors limiters 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.469
 and not so comfortable so twist the top 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.000
 part 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:30.039
 ap ap again our limiter with the inscription 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.259
 tony moth 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:37.909
 the mask itself looks like it smells like me 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.710
 would really like her to smell 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.689
 vanilla pudding because she herself 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.700
 it is very similar to me and I can hardly 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.130
 forcing your brain not to give me 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.170
 teams eat her here you know when in 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.770
 childhood wanted green soap to bite 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 here it is about the same situation 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.350
 it smells a little light cream 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.799
 cream that's how I associate 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.109
 the smell of some quickly absorbed 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.850
 light cream that's about the same smell 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:12.950
 This mask I used twice in 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.780
 week and what can i tell you here 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.100
 this one is all the pudding you put on 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.160
 on your skin 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.920
 at first it produces a feeling of something 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.630
 super light super gentle and very 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.910
 very nice skin 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.010
 when i put this mask on my skin 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.130
 it feels like angels sing on 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.630
 heaven yes that's about the sound and 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.740
 skin just happy that mask 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.110
 contacts with her sometimes it seemed to me 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.730
 that mask is very fast 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.600
 drawn in by skin 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.600
 but then she somehow comes back to the skin 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.400
 You can say so after I 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.230
 it seemed like the proper time down the mask is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.690
 usually 10 minutes and 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.500
 first tried to wash it off 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.780
 warm water 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.970
 what can I tell you just warm water 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.930
 not an option it is advisable to use 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.140
 sponge 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.190
 because with all its lightness on 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.440
 view of smell and first impression when 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.860
 skin contact masochka pretty 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.830
 fat and this implies the next plus 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.920
 after you use it 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.550
 skin does not need to be further moisturized and 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.959
 one of the properties and and this is an opportunity 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.630
 better make up 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.209
 rather than without her and this is true 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.840
 really tonal cream excellent 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:44.500
 falls on the skin without any preparation and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.300
 primers when skin after shampoo 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.810
 pray 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.570
 the only thing I want to tell you 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.190
 if your skin is not perfect then I think 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.650
 that this product will be for you 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.810
 most of it is useless but how is it in 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.390
 basically nourishes the skin it is nothing 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.519
 overhears he cleans a little 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.239
 red spots but not so 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.870
 super super so meaning this 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:14.709
 information if your skin is far from 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.739
 if i buy this product again 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.959
 yes yes yes yes yes yes again sure 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.600
 Be sure to buy 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.130
 I really like her effect on my face 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.320
 skin and and just adores recommend to everyone 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.980
 latte art milk 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.160
 man in fact a tony moly remember this one 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.580
 I thought you could have a cup of it 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.610
 see on the Internet there is still 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.390
 is scrabic and peeling if they are wrong 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.720
 but my acquaintance began with a mask and 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.000
 I buy the mask again I hope the information 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.940
 which I told you was for you 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.800
 useful if you still have some 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.990
 questions you can always look into 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.120
 infobox and see information from 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.050
 official sites or some other 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.690
 kill review 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.770
 and that's it see you next 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.770
 video bye
