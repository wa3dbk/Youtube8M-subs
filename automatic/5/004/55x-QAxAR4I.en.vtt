00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 mod of textures dot com on the side 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.420
 you can compare matz ​​and textures 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.920
 and there should be a place in the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.509
 does not understand what it's about then 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.010
 just send it to me and me 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.930
 explain yourself in the next video 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 strictly speaking, that is not one 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.439
 place but there are three mods serve 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.119
 unit are one of them 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.279
 you are already in the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 above center of screen and that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.519
 has the muth a compass are 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.289
 right now we are still looking east now 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.040
 we look to the west and to the south 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.840
 North 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.880
 In the past, you had to find out about it 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.350
 always open the f3 menu and first time 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.629
 look where is it here at all 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.550
 south for people who do not know it 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 that makes it very annoying and with this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.390
 can you see right away in which 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.160
 watched direction you should this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.079
 black bars we now is straight 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.260
 not like then you can one even 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.030
 own picture in a configurator can 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 for example, your girlfriend as 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.510
 background in this compass aden 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.879
 as I said, there is this place from 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.640
 three share and the second is the ama 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.710
 steps mod at the us market for through 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.840
 a new strip at the bottom left corner back in 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 For now, this bar always shows 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.460
 the item that you have in hand 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.750
 Hold a bow to the sword scabbard 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.700
 and so on 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.080
 Moreover , it always shows the the mobility 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.299
 that is the durability of these 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.130
 Items at the diamond armor at the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.320
 bend how much power you have and how 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.790
 a lot of that still has but there 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 Of course not always your armor 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 wanted to take hand to see how much 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.710
 you can endure it completely 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.450
 Just wear it and it will always be 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.979
 displayed in the bar at the bottom and you 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.630
 see how long keeps your armor 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.070
 should you for example still one 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.140
 then wear it with you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.400
 always indicated next to it and at one 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.240
 there is still one second left 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.119
 renewal and that you see this number 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.100
 64 companies stands 385 385 is the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.659
 durability of the bow and 64 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.189
 the arrows still in the inventory 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.340
 then shoot a fall away then 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.649
 this number changes to 63 62 61 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.000
 and thus could easily check 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.189
 if you still have enough cases leads to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.290
 for a pvp fight like their determined 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.969
 all do not know to be very annoying always 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.619
 looks out of the game have the folder 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.509
 to look for when you change something 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 want in this mod and in this market 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.349
 comes with a ready-made config 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.730
 but the cool thing is you have 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.989
 one in their conflict that is we 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.470
 do not always have to leave the folder 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.840
 search 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.610
 Sun could be the jetta horst eggers 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.410
 enter config and then you come in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.730
 a new menu so you can go to 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.190
 example say that has layout but 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.570
 be horizontal or vertical if we 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.130
 Now make that vertical then you will 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.230
 know about each other and not 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.370
 more in this long bar advantage 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.230
 this is for example at new 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.940
 have a very large set interface 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.980
 I have the interface extra for this 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.900
 mod you should make it smaller 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.550
 for example, on car instead of on 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.620
 let it get very big 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.420
 and of course this vertical helps 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.730
 Do it a lot if we do it all now 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.230
 Just put it horizontally again 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.970
 and then we can see that 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.190
 this bar again in our mental 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.200
 bar passes and, for example, the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.190
 Baltic manages the first three slots 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.380
 covered and something like that is natural 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.690
 very cool and the last part of the fashion 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.040
 is the status effect mod of the name says 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.620
 actually already very much off and 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.270
 Although this mod gives you an overview 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.880
 which effects are currently on earnings 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.170
 its negative or positive effects 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.760
 Usually you get this course 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.950
 through potions or any 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.470
 other pug we 'll just take us 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.090
 push a swivel and you see 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.280
 right at the side is now displayed 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.940
 we have strength 2 the whole holds still 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.489
 a minute 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.140
 and that works as well as positive 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.130
 as well as with negative effects 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.620
 If we just ourselves 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.050
 poison see we have police and 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.390
 lest we die team one more 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.010
 regeneration day in and should be 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.510
 be somewhere near then you can 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.310
 We too and the tank take so fast 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.880
 We do not run away as much as possible 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.130
 to die 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.720
 like the workstation spot 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.489
 also the state effect comes with you 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.110
 a therefore supplied ingame config 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.489
 therefore we just almost take that 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.650
 same comment and that you take 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.720
 for it status effect config and also here 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.280
 comes back into the private menu where 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.890
 he can do anything you can 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.110
 can tell where your ad is displayed 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.090
 that means she is currently in 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.920
 the middle right how can they after 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.510
 slide down left that does not matter 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.310
 Above, yes, also shows where 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.780
 this config in your places is that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.860
 We are called here and want to ask 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.280
 you can also do it all in the folder 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.750
 do 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.549
 you can say if all this at all 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.170
 mist should be that means you can 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.160
 this complete mod handy 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.170
 exhibit 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.880
 you can make the background Boxun 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.979
 usually you have in the inventory about 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.600
 a box that means a lot 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.220
 space away we bring now 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.959
 then you see it is like that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.000
 a really big box and that takes 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.710
 Of course, as I said a lot of space away 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.180
 and may obscure important matters 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.009
 that's why it's standard 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.630
 issued like that and that's it 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.830
 again from today's conception i 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.449
 Of course I hope I could give you the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.919
 bring today's motto a bit closer 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.060
 the download link to it is as always 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.620
 below in the video description 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.150
 ghastly textures beginning 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.650
 a little bit if you have it then 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.819
 She likes to write in the comments and 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.440
