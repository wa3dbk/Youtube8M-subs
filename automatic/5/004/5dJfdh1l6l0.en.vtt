00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.240
 U 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.190
 Lyco needs me to work 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.900
 So do not ask me this saline like a fluffy leprosy 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.900
 That's a loan 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:34.130
 Etymology something Joe Mack 21 standing 52 of Michael's full-important potatoes 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.309
 Have you ever heard of Thunderbolt? 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.309
 Thunderbolt seems to be subtitled just below 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:54.320
 It has two usb 3.0 times more bandwidth than simply giving only data 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.320
 You can have multiple interfaces with a single cable 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.449
 Anyway, the way you can get to know Thunderbolt technology in Korea is the new Apple 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.979
 I just buy the products. 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.280
 But this instrument around almost since not just put that support them 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.630
 We only have to see Thunderbolt Port . 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.140
 Peripherals that can be purchased are Apple's external 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 Storage Devices and Apple Thunderbolt Desktop 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:28.190
 But what's the price? 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.190
 But I eopdae different receiving a salary 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.909
 I put my order right there . 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:41.039
 Which, when you use the Thunderbolt daring ride longevity Web Meeting 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.030
 I would not use one of these as a monitor stand. 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:47.509
 But here OMRON Reading 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:55.460
 I need a cable dedicated to this Thunderbolt. 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:57.729
 ìº‘ 60,000 This is a gold-plated process that will improve video quality and sound quality. 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.729
 Obvious 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:08.179
 But what did you do with it? Yes. 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:12.830
 I asked you this, but I tried the Thunderbolt in the lab . 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:17.080
 The mountain external storage vault today to show device also shows the speed even once 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.080
 I ask, but it can be called love. 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.890
 This external storage device has 6 terrestrial hard disks 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.880
 It's tied up in a raid five. 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:37.980
 Raid Five can be used as a single disk by bundling several disks. 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:42.330
 Each disk has parity information so that even if one disk is corrupted 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:47.580
 You can use a different disk to abort the broken list 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:50.780
 But if the capacity is reduced by one disk and two or more disks are corrupted 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.780
 Going to goal. 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.310
 Having lived through a utility to measure the speed in a letter read 600 megabytes per second 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.989
 I turned it over. 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:09.090
 Of course, Thunderbird is not worth the maximum bandwidth and ssd 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:14.130
 I do not know if it's a big figure if you use it with raid. 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.400
 For people who edit video like me, this capacity and speed are all 2 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.400
 All 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.019
 If so , play uncompressed video with 237 megabytes of color per second 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.019
 Let's see 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.860
 Our editing system is just uchu 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:41.249
 But if you use e external storage for Mac 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:47.400
 Air soft lead lead 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:52.639
 I've been using it for three years, but the average transfer rate is 237 megabytes, 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.639
 If you tie it with raid, it's enough speed. 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.159
 Oh, that today, experiment with it 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.879
 Only 4 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.980
 Actually, only the input and output rules have changed. 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:14.330
 At present, we can not find any particular difference from the weight 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.959
 There are very few support staffs , and Thunderbolt 2 has the maximum bandwidth 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:23.810
 I have not used storage devices. 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.760
 Next year, it shall also apply to Intel Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt really basic unryong 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:32.000
 What will happen 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:36.860
 I continued Ali right now realized handle the malicious comments Relax hasiguyo 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.230
 I do not ask you next. I'll bring you some fun items in the lab. 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.230
 Why do I suck, I went and won
