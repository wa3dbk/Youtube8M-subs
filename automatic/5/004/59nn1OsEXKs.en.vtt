00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
whole AC is off to the house because

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.699 
whole AC is off to the house because
basically<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.180> unit<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.660> on<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.410> side<00:02:39.680> of

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
basically the unit is on that side of

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.500 
basically the unit is on that side of
the<00:02:40.010> house<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.730> like<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.360> people

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
the house so the like that the people

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.410 
the house so the like that the people
are<00:02:41.750> running<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.200> plumbing<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:44.000> can<00:02:44.269> turn

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
are running the plumbing and I can turn

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.970 
are running the plumbing and I can turn
anything<00:02:44.480> on<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.019> have<00:02:45.260> power<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.739> side

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
anything on so I have power on this side

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.040 
anything on so I have power on this side
but<00:02:46.489> not<00:02:46.580> decide<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> AC<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:47.959> you

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
but not decide that the AC is on if you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.020 
but not decide that the AC is on if you
can<00:02:48.200> imagine<00:02:48.350> because<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.070> runs<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.400> know<00:02:49.550> 220

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
can imagine because it runs you know 220

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.180 
can imagine because it runs you know 220
and<00:02:50.239> they<00:02:50.780> just<00:02:50.959> whatever<00:02:51.709> reason<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.130> don't

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.270 
and they just whatever reason I don't
know<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:52.430> then<00:02:53.110> my<00:02:54.110> newly<00:02:54.320> bad<00:02:54.590> my<00:02:54.890> matching
