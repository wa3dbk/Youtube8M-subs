sonic Android mascot you see the antenna

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.110 
sonic Android mascot you see the antenna
take<00:01:52.010> place<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.490> ears<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:53.900> I<00:01:54.890> painted<00:01:55.430> the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
take place the ears and I painted the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.590 
take place the ears and I painted the
joints<00:01:56.600> into<00:01:56.750> his<00:01:56.960> arms

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
joints into his arms

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.700 
joints into his arms
so<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.660> constitute<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.170> little<00:02:00.350> bit<00:02:00.470> more<00:02:00.620> in

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
so to constitute a little bit more in

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.780 
so to constitute a little bit more in
symmetry<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.590> was<00:02:03.710> wondering<00:02:04.160> if<00:02:04.400> I<00:02:04.550> should

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
symmetry and I was wondering if I should

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.530 
symmetry and I was wondering if I should
pick<00:02:05.000> out<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.420> word<00:02:05.570> Android<00:02:06.470> on<00:02:06.740> his<00:02:06.950> back

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
pick out the word Android on his back

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.359 
pick out the word Android on his back
but<00:02:08.540> I'm<00:02:08.869> every<00:02:09.530> time<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:09.770> try<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:09.980> kept<00:02:10.250> on

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
but I'm every time I try I kept on

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.170 
but I'm every time I try I kept on
smudging<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:14.080> let's<00:02:15.080> compare<00:02:15.790> play<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.820> little

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
smudging so let's compare play a little

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.880 
smudging so let's compare play a little
I<00:02:17.330> enjoyed<00:02:17.600> mascot<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.320> some<00:02:18.470> other<00:02:18.590> metal
