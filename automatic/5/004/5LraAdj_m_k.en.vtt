00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.340
 Talk to people, welcome to another one. 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.290
 training day and today I'm here with 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.090
 beard present to you a way of 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.670
 construction that we call 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.920
 rapid expansion with drop of widow mines 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.920
 yes the dreaded widow maras 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.910
 in this building work you expand 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.320
 very early and at the same time prepare a 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.930
 very strong attack 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.610
 this attack is actually double you go 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.420
 make a frontal attack on the expansion of 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.920
 your opponent 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.920
 at the same time as an attack fits 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.870
 of grape mines at the main base of their 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.640
 objective with this attack and to 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.440
 your opponent's economy and take on 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.269
 map control you'll be fine 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.030
 aggressive at the beginning of the game 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.460
 but now comes the catch this gang 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.319
 strategy is not everything or nothing it is not 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.149
 Someone like you does not invest in 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.159
 improvements at the beginning of the game 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.929
 preserved economy that allows 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.850
 you are very aggressive at the beginning of 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.859
 play at the same time as you invest in 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.180
 economy 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.470
 So let's go inside the game. 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.030
 keep track of how you do step by step 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.039
 this strategy comes straight from the cup 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.960
 America and it was executed by our 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.149
 Brazilian sur it in the game 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.719
 played against the Colombian player omÃ£ 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.369
 Did you mention how a bit long you tip 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.990
 then take a look at the description of the 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.520
 video because it will always have a 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.659
 complete copy of construction order 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.759
 to facilitate your training at the beginning of the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.780
 game is well standard you produce special 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.399
 constantly 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.840
 always remembering to stay smart for 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.840
 do not take lock supply 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.439
 when you hit 10 supplies 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.950
 you start building a warehouse 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:48.479
 from supplies to 12 supplies 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.479
 You start building a barracks. 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.030
 at 15 you build a refinery 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.750
 and as soon as this barracks is ready 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.030
 Are you going to do three things first? 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.890
 will start production of soldiers 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.429
 then you build a deposit of 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.709
 supplies and at the control center by 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.090
 Last you 're getting ready you get to 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.090
 transformation to command the vital 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.980
 when the second soldier is ready 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.060
 it will be the 19 suffering you get to 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.470
 production of a reactor in the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.569
 You continue to produce this is without 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.110
 stop and at 20 and supplies is the time to 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.110
 make an expansion 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.069
 you do not for the production of vcs when 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.230
 you reach 22 of the supplies you 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.849
 begins the production of a factory in 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.099
 sequence the reactor is his headquarters 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.200
 ready you start the production of 22 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.739
 Soldiers you mend this with the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.900
 building a supply depot 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.040
 and in natural expansion you make a home 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.040
 kill to be safe 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.989
 you do not stop producing soldiers of 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.359
 two in two and as soon as the factory 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.250
 ready you produce a widow girl 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.099
 then you build a yard 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.730
 and you do not for the production of 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.319
 You also there in natural expansion is time 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.670
 to transform that control center 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:27.010
 in the vital room at 37 of supplies 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.439
 You make one more a widow mine at 42 you 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.000
 makes one more deposit of supplies and already 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.129
 with the production of sent ships 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.720
 and the federal salt shaker 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.189
 I'm here to become a soldier without 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.170
 stop 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.909
 With six minutes and forty games you 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.930
 leave the base with the soldiers you come 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.430
 accumulating 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.139
 the neighborhood will take up this subject later 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.109
 explain why this is important. 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.720
 moment you do not for the production of 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.280
 soldiers at all times and at 48 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.109
 supplies it's time to make one more 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.760
 deposit 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.329
 You make one more girl see your 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.720
 factory always coming to production 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.129
 of soldiers and sends 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.889
 guys on the map 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.540
 As soon as the ship is ready you send 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.829
 where your troops are in the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.970
 map is time to prepare the drug 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.849
 now you're almost ready to 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.919
 56 attack the supplies you do more 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.539
 a supply depot and two more 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.919
 barracks in its main base 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.870
 this will allow during the attack 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.050
 you to replenish your troops and 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.639
 continues to impose enemy pressure to 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.020
 leave everything ready for execution of the 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.639
 tac what comes next 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.150
 do you know us two refineries and more 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.830
 two tank of supply and now 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.330
 Let's have a beard that will detail how 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.330
 that should be executed if it attacks 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.039
 first you need to control the map 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.169
 at least ten soldiers the cylinder 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.169
 path and take control of the map 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.530
 After that we'll deal with you. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.960
 a ship loaded with the main base 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.340
 purpose is to have two girls 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.590
 widows in there 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.180
 In the meantime you take the soldiers 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.349
 forward of enemy natural expansion 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.349
 and prepares to attack 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.300
 you trope in the mineral line and so 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.780
 that the process is to defend you attack 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.780
 natural expansion 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.500
 transition that you are opening 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.330
 committed to the biological game then 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.490
 after the attack on the transition to 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.110
 barracks 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.030
 doing this increases your capacity 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.710
 to produce troops to strengthen the 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.600
 army and also allows you to 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.760
 search steroid injection shield 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.100
 combat you do not yet have 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.420
 to complete also several and build 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.350
 an engineering pole to improve 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.600
 attacks and mature exercises the staff let's 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.730
 stay tuned 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.980
 the prototype can attack early 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.150
 In case this attack a second house kills 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.650
 help in defense 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.980
 be sure to put the excess 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.960
 repairing this opening requires that you 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.820
 do several things at once 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.910
 so it's worth training a lot and if 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.860
 apply in the league from the six 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.910
 minutes it is essential to accumulate energy 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.680
 for scanning 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.670
 so you stay safe against an attack 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:19.550
 of dark templar and now 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.190
 strengths as you play 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.890
 aggressive imposes the rhythm of the match and 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.510
 control the map 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.780
 you often end up with the economy 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.850
 purpose and the game ends there 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.010
 The weak point how you are investing 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.230
 enough in soldiers does not do any 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:41.720
 enhancement a purpose opening of the 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:43.580
 nothing is the only threat this is it, guys 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.950
 this was the Terran opening with expansion 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.630
 quick and drop of widow aim and look only 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.650
 Next week we are going to 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.240
 preparing a material that will 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.120
 complement those construction works 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.880
 so stay tuned in and now you already 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.650
 It's time to release the verb, send it to 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.870
 This message is what you want to see 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.820
 do not program your opinion if you like 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.270
 I clicked the button, I liked it down there. 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.740
 anyway the important thing is we interact 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.480
 Thank you so much for watching and 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.710
 next week we'll see you again with 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.710
 another day of training
