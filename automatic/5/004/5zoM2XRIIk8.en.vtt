teeny series equation the Bible sucks

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:59.069 
teeny series equation the Bible sucks
we'll<00:01:56.889> take<00:01:57.069> one<00:01:57.219> of<00:01:57.249> them<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.749> we'll<00:01:58.749> put<00:01:58.960> it

the line I'm going to tie two and I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.740 
the line I'm going to tie two and I
think<00:02:23.320> if<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.650> push<00:02:24.310> down<00:02:24.340> top<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.270> match<00:02:25.540> my

think if I push down top of match my

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.500 
think if I push down top of match my

now what I need to do is tie a loop at
the<00:03:53.530> other<00:03:53.620> end<00:03:53.830> now<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:54.100> use<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> small<00:03:54.840> census
