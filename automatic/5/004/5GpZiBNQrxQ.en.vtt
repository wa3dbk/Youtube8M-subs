 totally free but well let's go now 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.250
 with the theme of this third program that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.110
 it's very very interesting I got a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.180
 comment on the YouTube video of the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.810
 second podcast in which a person me 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.490
 He said 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.380
 that after watching the video he had 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.110
 realized that what was preventing him 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.840
 learning to play the guitar was to get 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.640
 excuses I liked seeing that he had given 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.409
 account and that since then it was going to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.539
 put to work to combat the no 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.759
 make excuses the phrase he told me 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.280
 this person deals with a devastating issue and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.439
 is the procrastination the fact of leaving 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.810
 things you have to do today and 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.060
 passing them to another time is like 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.850
 Typical phrase of tomorrow when I quit smoking 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.710
 not tomorrow I start the regime or tomorrow 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.110
 I start doing sports in a way 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.000
 constant in order you have to be clear 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.619
 that tomorrow does not exist because in the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.890
 moment when you wake up a day 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.080
 next will no longer be tomorrow will be a 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.330
 new today and you'll have again the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.640
 need to leave things for more 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.170
 late this happens in practically all 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.450
 the areas of life not only in 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.549
 learn to play the guitar we go 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.470
 putting a series of objectives a 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.479
 series of goals and we have to go 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.580
 walking a path until you can 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.519
 achieve them and we have a tendency 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.319
 natural to leave all the steps that 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.500
 we have to continue to achieve these 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.800
 dreams and these goals for 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.660
 and do not kid yourself it's essential to work 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.730
 to get what you have 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.100
 proposed could hint at a 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.840
 bunch of lovely phrases taken from 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.790
 Hollywood movies in which 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.710
 they deal with these motivation and other issues 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.600
 but we 're not here, you and I, 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.580
 marvel us with words but 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.040
 we have to go to action directly 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.050
 and that's what we're going to do first 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.490
 place prioritizes a lot of people 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.100
 answered the question I asked in the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.980
 second podcast telling me that their 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.959
 daily obligations prevent them from dedicating 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.209
 the time that they really 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.670
 would like to devote to learning to play the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.120
 guitar of course the obligations 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.040
 they are a fundamental priority that is more 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.900
 clear that water learn to touch the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.000
 guitar that is in the background of 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.980
 that there is no doubt but I am convinced 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.200
 also that yes you can combine 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.390
 taking it into account that no 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.730
 you need more than ten minutes a day 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.680
 to learn to play the guitar a 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.870
 moment to learn to play the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.970
 guitar would be for example ten minutes 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.380
 before going to sleep normally is a 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.670
 space of time that is usually lost 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.099
 with the mobile 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.840
 they usually look at the computer or even 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.090
 with television is a time that 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.920
 we can take advantage perfectly for 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.840
 learn to play the guitar just 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.030
 ten minutes that can also come to you 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.770
 well to relax before going to the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.660
 bed if you really want to learn to 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.640
 play the guitar and these ten minutes 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.890
 before sleeping you think it's a good 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.470
 moment is to say but you can allow no 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.959
 you think it's something complicated do not hesitate 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.430
 touch in this time interval another 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.900
 option and I'm sure there will be 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.180
 people that it costs more to put in 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.930
 practice this option is to get up 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.519
 ten minutes before this is going to allow you 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.500
 spend 10 minutes playing the guitar 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.530
 before you start your obligations 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.060
 of the day can also be for example 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.100
 after eating and even if you're 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.709
 studying you can take advantage and touch the 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.959
 guitar in the rest spaces 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.840
 every hour or hour and a half if you study one 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.120
 hour or hour and a half you play 5 minutes to 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.310
 rest and you go back to the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.200
 studies and then you can continue 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.389
 returning to touch finally the important 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.150
 is that you try to find this space 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.260
 of time and work for it I already tell you 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.380
 they are just 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.300
 ten minutes a day and second notes in 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.270
 a folio on the mobile or any place 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.100
 that you can then easily access what 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.930
 is what you want to practice this is 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.850
 important that you do not do the day before 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.730
 It would be fantastic and if not when you get up 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.920
 form tomorrow you write it down for example today 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.350
 I want to practice a wheel of 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.660
 chords that I do not get that costs me no 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.870
 I know how to practice the matches I want 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.090
 practice those details but aim and 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.490
 then when you find and you get 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.190
 have that time of day to touch the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.140
 guitar you will not waste your time thinking 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.200
 to practice but you will catch the folio 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.120
 or him or the phone and you'll see what it is that 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.190
 you have to practice because it's what you 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.830
 you wanted and you know and you're going to go 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.540
 practice directly what you had 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.160
 pointed already there was in the turn of the 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.350
 question that I always ask at the end of 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.330
 all the podcast I want me to 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.100
 answer you can do it through the 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.590
 comments on the YouTube video of the 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.170
 third podcast or in the post on the 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.270
 military item puntocom that 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.850
 I can answer either one of you 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.400
 and even through email and 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.380
 question is the next one that you 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.240
 I would like you to try for the room 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.340
 program I have a lot of topics 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.500
 targeted but I would love to continue this 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.660
 trend in which you and the rest of the 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.600
 audience chooses the content to be treated 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.699
 as we have been doing based on all 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.650
 the answers that come to me in 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.270
 the previous podcast questions by 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.910
 what would be great if I studied the 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.229
 the rest that guides in all the content 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.460
 of this section 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.110
 nothing guitarist see you in the 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.810
