00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.480
 How tea 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:19.550
 This time as a sleeper to train 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:21.539
 Talk about whether it 's good or if it 's better to train when you're hungry 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.500
 I think I want to go 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.300
 First, when you say earlier from conclusion 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.090
 I think that both fit well in my opinion 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.800
 If you say why 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 I train when I am full 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.900
 Digestion in the stomach 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:49.050
 It is to be carried and the efficiency of digestion and absorption is born extremely 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:52.350
 You should not move your body vigorously for at least 30 minutes in the kitchen 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.289
 If you continue to exercise with poor digestion and absorption 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.289
 I can not lose my stomach and get proper energy 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.180
 Be careful with this too 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.900
 And 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.909
 On the contrary, it is good when the stomach is almost hungry 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.060
 The pedigree is falling 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.350
 Because it is 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.299
 If I do exercise there 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.299
 The adrenocortical hormone is intense 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.840
 This time 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.080
 I'm trying to raise my blood sugar level 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 Furthermore, this hormone breaks down the muscles 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.520
 It is a type of making 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.320
 If you say that 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:43.000
 This which burns while cutting down the existing body 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:47.770
 So it's no good if you're training but it's full or too hungry 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.620
 Energy is stored in the body enough to move enough 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:57.520
 It is best that there are too many townspeople . 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:01.830
 However, regarding the burnup of fat 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.830
 What is better if you are hungry and who is hungry 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.229
 I compared the experiment on how fat seems like during exercise 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.940
 Ward welfare friendship is better than full stomach 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.940
 Referred to as the metabolism of fat has increased 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.150
 If you want to burn fat from effectively, you're a hungry horner 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.150
 To play people 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:35.640
 However , if you exercise hard and exercise hard without sufficient fat 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:41.120
 It is not enough with fat alone, and after all pink is broken down as fuel 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.120
 Are extremely hungry but just because you want how much to reduce the fat 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.189
 Rather the reverse 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.189
 You should think that it will be this time 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.990
 So I will put together 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.580
 Banfuku-ji Temple is also the timing of training 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.580
 Subdivision welfare not good 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.080
 This is strictly the case, so you need to be very strict 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.970
 I do not think 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.180
 I sometimes do training when I am full, and I devise and train on the contrary 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.060
 Also 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.410
 It's ad hoc 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.620
 What do you do when you want to do training anyway 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.160
 It is most important 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:29.980
 Will not change after all if you do not stick to timing and do anything 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:33.180
 Your muscle training life referring to this story 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.180
 Please let me know 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.980
 Thank you for seeing to the real end then 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.980
 Or I would love to videos from
