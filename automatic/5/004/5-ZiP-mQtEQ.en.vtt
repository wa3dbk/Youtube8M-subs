00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
summer i love using them because it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.990 
summer i love using them because it
really<00:02:24.440> complements<00:02:25.040> an<00:02:25.190> already<00:02:25.700> bronze

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
really complements an already bronze

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.149 
really complements an already bronze
skin<00:02:26.390> tone<00:02:26.659> but<00:02:27.140> i<00:02:27.200> use<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.769> winter<00:02:27.920> too

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
skin tone but i use it in the winter too

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.030 
skin tone but i use it in the winter too
so<00:02:28.569> this<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:29.750> looks<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.049> same<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.650> same<00:02:30.680> type

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
so this it looks the same the same type

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.890 
so this it looks the same the same type
of<00:02:31.069> brush<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:33.769> pump<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.159> just<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.459> same

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
of brush and you pump it just the same

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.619
