00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.559
 we are with in mariotti and responsible 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.430
 of production guzzi motorcycle on the line of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.170
 California assembly is 24 steps 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.630
 step by step this bike is born 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.970
 tell us the exact engine that 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.520
 engine assembly department created 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.190
 the first step line comes to the head 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.760
 the engine is then mounted on the line 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:34.010
 to follow frame on the swingarm motor 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.140
 cardan handlebar front fork 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.430
 shock absorbers backside wheels 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.329
 at this point we arrived at 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.750
 twelfth step the bike is detached 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.850
 from the engine mount to wheel passes 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.370
 at this point supported by wheels like 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.879
 you can see from the pictures it is done 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.950
 the completion of the bike then 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.360
 silencers and exhaust covers 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.960
 fender tank handlebar handles 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.909
 and I go into how many people come 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.100
 involved and what is the capacity 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.709
 maximum production of your line 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.049
 then the line as we said is made by 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:15.569
 24 stations therefore the maximum capacity 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.619
 we keep it when we have 24 people 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:18.240
 line 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.880
 now that we are in a winter phase 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.520
 we have twelve people so each line 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.029
 operator makes the capacity two phases 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.110
 maximum 24 to 24 steps is around 

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:32.530
 at 40 bikes per day 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.540
 so every 10 12 minutes a motorcycle goes down 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.240
 from the line arrives in the final phase 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.150
 the gasoline needed for is loaded 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.370
 control and then the bikes all the bikes 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.350
 one hundred percent are tested at 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.479
 dynamometer is a roller bench 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.190
 on which we do the abs brake control 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.090
 all electronic systems 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.540
 cruise control the various light mappings 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.970
 stop brakes occurs that the whole bike 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.360
 from a dynamic point of view 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.140
 electronic functions perfectly from 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.680
 here the bike is considered finished 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.120
 goes down to go to the line of in dance 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.209
 we have 21 of thor which are two 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.830
 road testers that in a way 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.260
 statisticians pick up a motorcycle 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.739
 theoretically available to the dance and 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.010
 they do another check where 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.370
 occur all its correspondences 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.980
 to the homologation and they also make a brief 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.769
 road test section proper 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.430
 about thirty kilometers and that's it 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:42.610
 which serve precisely to praise tor for 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.500
 check that we are consistent 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.590
 in the quality of control I keep 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.480
 specify that in each step the operators 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.530
 therefore they work in self-control in every 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.360
 phase there are related operations 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.250
 to the clamp locking safety 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.680
 brake and lock that rotate like this 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.230
 this type that are certified 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.260
 to the operator the closures are all 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.840
 made with clear dynamometric calls e 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.450
 the operator is required to sign his own 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.100
 phase ensuring compliance with 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.830
 cycle and correct operations e 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.299
 tightening and a completely new bike 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.270
 like this one in particular with an engine 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.790
 all new 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.460
 requires more attention in the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.970
 final phase of the chain as a control 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.560
 we say that our control is 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.330
 extremely rigorous for the whole 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.860
 our production clearly when 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.890
 share with a new model 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.980
 the level of attention much higher 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.160
 precisely because we have to get to the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.830
 perfect training of operators la 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.800
 new death those who work must learn 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.290
 all its phases must be built 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.360
 equipment to facilitate the work for 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.300
 do this we do meetings 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.520
 weekly during which we go 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.410
 analyze the difficulties encountered in the 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.470
 assembly of any anomalies 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.890
 reported by the editors to make 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.070
 improvement broome shares and there 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.160
 carry a repeatability of the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.920
 assembly quality at the highest levels 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.770
 this is a practically infinite job 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.200
 since we tend to perfection ourselves every 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.209
 week we make a pareto of the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.830
 anomalies found as a function of 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.550
 we will attack the first spotlight 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.900
 problems involving the whole structure 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.110
 quality assembly technologies of 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.150
 process or foreman operators because 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.030
 for us the operator is an integral part 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.360
 to production this is a company 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.070
 almost tailor made and we are almost gods 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.320
 luxury artisans who want to do 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.180
 so great luxury products 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.710
 training thankfully I say 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.620
 great sense of belonging of the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.750
 operators for a workers to work 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.090
 motoguzzi is a satisfaction I say 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.130
 who know the manager at the establishment 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.380
 I feel the eagle a little tattooed on the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.600
 chest and this we find again in all 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.480
 our operators and this is the bike 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.540
 guzzi thanks in pleasure 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.540
 no
