00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.540 

so<00:01:55.750> then<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.230> I<00:01:56.500> rolled<00:01:56.770> them<00:01:56.950> up<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.370> I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
so then I just I rolled them up and I

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.190 
so then I just I rolled them up and I
put<00:01:57.760> them<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.120> fridge<00:01:58.390> before<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.870> cut<00:01:59.170> them

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
put them in the fridge before I cut them

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.380 
put them in the fridge before I cut them
so<00:01:59.680> they<00:01:59.950> didn't<00:02:00.250> like<00:02:00.340> fall<00:02:00.640> apart<00:02:00.940> I<00:02:01.150> found

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
so they didn't like fall apart I found

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.310 
so they didn't like fall apart I found
that<00:02:01.450> out<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.630> hard<00:02:01.750> way

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
that out the hard way

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.990 
that out the hard way
so<00:02:02.680> definitely<00:02:03.070> put<00:02:03.220> them<00:02:03.370> in<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.550> fridge<00:02:03.760> and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
so definitely put them in the fridge and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.760 
so definitely put them in the fridge and
then<00:02:04.180> cut<00:02:04.420> them<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.930> put<00:02:05.230> them<00:02:05.320> on<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.530> cookie

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
then cut them and put them on a cookie

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.430 
then cut them and put them on a cookie
sheet<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.280> bake<00:02:06.370> them<00:02:07.150> for<00:02:07.330> about<00:02:07.510> 12<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:08.050> 17

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
local craft store and I cut it into

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.440 
local craft store and I cut it into
triangles<00:03:16.280> with<00:03:16.550> these<00:03:16.700> scalloped<00:03:17.150> scissors

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
triangles with these scalloped scissors

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.080 
triangles with these scalloped scissors
which<00:03:17.660> made<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.989> look<00:03:18.140> even<00:03:18.620> cuter<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.700> cut

which made it look even cuter so I cut

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.690 
which made it look even cuter so I cut
out<00:03:20.360> enough<00:03:20.930> triangles<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.739> spell<00:03:22.040> back<00:03:22.400> to

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
out enough triangles to spell back to

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.199 
out enough triangles to spell back to
school<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.569> colors<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.140> rainbow<00:03:24.290> so

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.030 

the<00:03:32.209> next<00:03:32.480> thing<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:32.690> did<00:03:32.750> was<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.170> got<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.650> sharpie

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
the next thing I did was I got a sharpie

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.830 
the next thing I did was I got a sharpie
marker<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.580> I<00:03:34.790> just<00:03:35.060> wrote<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.510> letter<00:03:35.750> that

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
marker and I just wrote the letter that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.050 
marker and I just wrote the letter that
spelled<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.380> back<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.709> school<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.700> letter<00:03:37.970> per

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
spelled it back to school one letter per

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.600 
spelled it back to school one letter per
triangle<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.019> cut<00:03:39.260> out<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.590> they<00:03:40.340> ended

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
triangle that I cut out and they ended

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.880 
triangle that I cut out and they ended
up<00:03:40.760> looking<00:03:41.060> like<00:03:41.239> this<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.049> then<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.440> just

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
up looking like this and then I just

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.789 
up looking like this and then I just
wrote<00:03:43.670> all<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.299> letters<00:03:44.630> on<00:03:44.870> all<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.500> pieces

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
wrote all the letters on all the pieces

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:56.570 
wrote all the letters on all the pieces
of<00:03:46.190> triangle<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:46.940> cut<00:03:47.239> out

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.490 

next<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.700> use<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.210> hole<00:03:58.480> puncher<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.020> punch<00:03:59.260> holes

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
next I use a hole puncher to punch holes

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.680 
next I use a hole puncher to punch holes
in<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.770> top<00:04:00.010> corners<00:04:00.460> of<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.700> triangles<00:04:01.210> so<00:04:01.660> I

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
in the top corners of the triangles so I

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.380 
in the top corners of the triangles so I
could<00:04:02.200> weave<00:04:02.470> some<00:04:02.860> yarn<00:04:03.340> through<00:04:03.880> them<00:04:04.030> to

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
could weave some yarn through them to

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.380 
could weave some yarn through them to
make<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.720> become<00:04:05.050> a<00:04:05.260> banner<00:04:05.650> so<00:04:06.490> what<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:06.880> did<00:04:07.000> is

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
make it become a banner so what I did is

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.050 
make it become a banner so what I did is
what<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:07.720> basically<00:04:07.990> just<00:04:08.230> said<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.830> put<00:04:09.520> some

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
what I basically just said I put some

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.240 
what I basically just said I put some
yarn<00:04:10.420> through<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.990> holes<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.740> became<00:04:12.190> a

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
yarn through the holes and it became a

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:21.080 
yarn through the holes and it became a
banner

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.249

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
so what you're going to do next is this

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.470 
so what you're going to do next is this
peel<00:07:07.320> off<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.770> backing<00:07:08.040> of<00:07:08.370> that<00:07:08.580> cork<00:07:09.240> board

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.530 
and stick it on to the piece of
cardboard<00:07:11.010> that<00:07:11.280> you<00:07:11.430> cut<00:07:11.670> out<00:07:11.820> and<00:07:12.090> be<00:07:12.330> really

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
cardboard that you cut out and be really

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.540 
cardboard that you cut out and be really
careful<00:07:13.050> when<00:07:13.170> you<00:07:13.290> do<00:07:13.440> this<00:07:13.470> because<00:07:13.830> that

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
careful when you do this because that

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.400

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
then you're just going to a stick it

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.390 
then you're just going to a stick it
back<00:07:18.270> into<00:07:18.600> the<00:07:18.720> frame<00:07:19.020> and<00:07:19.320> you<00:07:19.860> have<00:07:20.370> a
