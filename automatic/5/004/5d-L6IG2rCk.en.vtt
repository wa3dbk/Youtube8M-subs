game<00:00:03.570> theory<00:00:03.840> today<00:00:04.740> we're<00:00:04.859> gonna<00:00:04.950> start<00:00:05.279> our

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
game theory today we're gonna start our

game theory today we're gonna start our
work<00:00:05.549> on<00:00:05.700> games<00:00:05.970> in<00:00:06.120> general<00:00:06.299> form<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.049> show

work on games in general form and show
how<00:00:07.379> make<00:00:07.589> strategies<00:00:08.069> can<00:00:08.309> be<00:00:08.340> invalid<00:00:09.349> we

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
how make strategies can be invalid we

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.360 
how make strategies can be invalid we
should<00:00:10.500> all<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.710> familiar<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
should all be familiar with the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.310 
should all be familiar with the
prisoner's<00:00:11.730> dilemma<00:00:11.910> by<00:00:12.300> now<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:13.049> something

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
prisoner's dilemma by now but something

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.690 
prisoner's dilemma by now but something
I<00:00:13.380> haven't<00:00:13.620> told<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.950> before<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
I haven't told you before is that the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.340 
I haven't told you before is that the
values<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.240> these<00:00:15.360> specific<00:00:15.900> numbers<00:00:16.199> are

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
values of these specific numbers are

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.120 
values of these specific numbers are
irrelevant

game<00:00:17.609> theory<00:00:17.910> only<00:00:18.000> cares<00:00:18.330> about<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> order

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
game theory only cares about the order

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.720 
game theory only cares about the order
of<00:00:19.050> preferences<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.100> can<00:00:20.220> actually<00:00:20.520> solve

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
of preferences so we can actually solve

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.880 
of preferences so we can actually solve
for<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> general<00:00:21.600> class<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.960> games<00:00:22.170> by<00:00:22.500> removing

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
preferences over the outcomes thus we're

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959

strategies<00:00:46.710> let's<00:00:47.309> start<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.670> player<00:00:47.820> 1<00:00:48.230> if

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
strategies let's start with player 1 if

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.930 
strategies let's start with player 1 if
player<00:00:49.469> 2<00:00:49.680> cooperates<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.370> player<00:00:50.579> 1<00:00:50.640> will

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
player 2 cooperates then player 1 will

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.080 
player 2 cooperates then player 1 will
want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> defect<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.110> greater<00:00:52.350> than<00:00:52.440> B<00:00:53.090> we

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
want to defect as a is greater than B we

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.959 
want to defect as a is greater than B we
know<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.420> because<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.750> says<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.050> right<00:00:55.079> there

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
know that because it says so right there

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.189 
know that because it says so right there
now<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.030> look<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.360> what<00:00:57.449> happens<00:00:57.750> when<00:00:57.960> player

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
now we look at what happens when player

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.830 
now we look at what happens when player
2<00:00:58.410> defects<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:59.640> player<00:00:59.940> 1<00:01:00.239> will<00:01:00.449> still<00:01:00.660> want

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
2 defects here player 1 will still want

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
2 defects here player 1 will still want
to<00:01:00.870> defect<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.469> he<00:01:01.590> prefers<00:01:01.890> C<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.280> D<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.090> in

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to defect as he prefers C to D so in

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
defection but let's just make sure that

defection but let's just make sure that
there<00:01:25.710> isn't<00:01:25.830> some<00:01:26.100> sort<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.340> mixed<00:01:26.549> strategy

that we need to find the mixed strategy
algorithm<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.740> start<00:01:35.130> by<00:01:35.610> defining<00:01:36.450> what

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
now we ask ourselves what player two's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.440 
now we ask ourselves what player two's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
equations remember a mixed strategy is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.300 
equations remember a mixed strategy is
supposed<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.740> make<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.069> opponent

supposed to make your opponent

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
supposed to make your opponent
indifferent<00:02:09.000> between<00:02:09.090> his<00:02:09.509> pure<00:02:09.810> strategies

so<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> utility<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.550> playing<00:02:11.819> each<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.239> those

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so the utility of playing each of those

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.140 
so the utility of playing each of those
strategies<00:02:12.690> must

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150

get the same for cooperating as she

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.470 
get the same for cooperating as she
would<00:02:17.709> for<00:02:17.920> defecting<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.519> from<00:02:19.390> the

previous<00:02:19.810> two<00:02:19.959> slides<00:02:20.200> we<00:02:20.470> know<00:02:20.650> what<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
payoff of each of those is as a function

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.449 
payoff of each of those is as a function

strategy will be invalid if you recall

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.900

from<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:52.989> premise<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:53.590> C<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.579> greater<00:03:54.849> than

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
from the premise that C is greater than

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.349 
from the premise that C is greater than
d<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.769> therefore<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.579> numerator<00:03:58.000> has<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.299> be

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
d and therefore the numerator has to be

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.849 
d and therefore the numerator has to be
positive<00:03:58.780> because<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.290> numerator<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.709> C

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
positive because the numerator is C

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.099 
positive because the numerator is C
minus<00:04:00.040> D<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:00.549> for<00:04:01.419> this<00:04:01.510> fraction<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:02.049> be

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
minus D so for this fraction to be

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.020 
minus D so for this fraction to be
greater<00:04:02.319> than<00:04:02.470> zero<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:03.220> denominator<00:04:03.430> must

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
greater than zero the denominator must

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.080 
greater than zero the denominator must
be<00:04:04.150> greater<00:04:04.359> than<00:04:04.419> zero<00:04:04.750> as<00:04:04.959> well<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:06.910> now<00:04:07.030> we

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
be greater than zero as well so now we

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.629 
be greater than zero as well so now we
test<00:04:07.389> that<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.829> rearrange<00:04:09.160> these

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
test that and we can rearrange these

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.839 
test that and we can rearrange these
terms<00:04:09.699> as<00:04:10.180> such<00:04:10.419> and<00:04:11.459> unfortunately<00:04:12.459> we<00:04:12.639> can't

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849

will<00:04:49.139> be<00:04:49.409> positive<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.099> therefore<00:04:50.580> we<00:04:51.000> do<00:04:51.090> not

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
will be positive and therefore we do not

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.760 
will be positive and therefore we do not
have<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.419> flip<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.780> inequality<00:04:51.840> as<00:04:52.379> we<00:04:52.530> would

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
have to flip the inequality as we would

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.730 
have to flip the inequality as we would
if<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.039> denominator<00:04:53.520> were<00:04:53.699> negative<00:04:54.060> and

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
if the denominator were negative and

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.350 
if the denominator were negative and
both<00:04:55.740> sides<00:04:56.009> of<00:04:56.129> the<00:04:56.250> equation<00:04:56.639> contain<00:04:57.000> AC

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
both sides of the equation contain AC

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.450 
both sides of the equation contain AC
minus<00:04:58.020> D<00:04:58.259> so<00:04:58.289> we<00:04:58.590> can<00:04:58.620> get<00:04:58.770> rid<00:04:58.889> of<00:04:58.919> those<00:04:59.159> and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
minus D so we can get rid of those and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.850 
minus D so we can get rid of those and
that<00:05:00.180> leaves<00:05:00.330> us<00:05:00.569> with<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.289> less<00:05:01.590> than<00:05:01.650> or

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
that leaves us with a is less than or

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.059 
that leaves us with a is less than or
equal<00:05:02.009> to<00:05:02.310> B<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:03.169> that<00:05:04.169> definitely<00:05:04.530> violates

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
equal to B and that definitely violates

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:06.980 
equal to B and that definitely violates
our<00:05:05.219> rule<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.669> says<00:05:05.969> that<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.449> must<00:05:06.810> be

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
our rule that says that a must be

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.420 
our rule that says that a must be
greater<00:05:07.199> than<00:05:07.289> B<00:05:07.560> so<00:05:07.830> we<00:05:07.949> know<00:05:07.979> that<00:05:08.099> this

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
greater than B so we know that this

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.540 
greater than B so we know that this
mixed<00:05:08.729> strategy<00:05:08.759> is<00:05:09.240> invalid<00:05:10.159> thus<00:05:11.159> we<00:05:11.430> have

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
mixed strategy is invalid thus we have

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.100 
mixed strategy is invalid thus we have
proven<00:05:11.879> that<00:05:12.030> there<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.300> no<00:05:12.419> mixed<00:05:12.719> strategy

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
proven that there is no mixed strategy

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.290 
proven that there is no mixed strategy
