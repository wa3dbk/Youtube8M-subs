overly skilled that have trouble getting

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.850 
overly skilled that have trouble getting
the<00:00:11.400> kill<00:00:11.700> streaks<00:00:12.059> like<00:00:12.330> myself<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.740> know

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the kill streaks like myself you know

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.020 
the kill streaks like myself you know
I'll<00:00:13.950> be<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> first<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.429> admit<00:00:14.549> I'm<00:00:14.849> not<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I'll be the first to admit I'm not the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.090 
I'll be the first to admit I'm not the
absolute<00:00:15.480> best<00:00:15.780> Call<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.049> Duty<00:00:16.320> player<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.770> can

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
absolute best Call of Duty player I can

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.340 
absolute best Call of Duty player I can
hold<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.400> own<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:18.180> definitely<00:00:19.020> getting<00:00:19.230> some

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
hold my own but definitely getting some

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.529 
hold my own but definitely getting some
of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> higher<00:00:19.650> kill<00:00:19.920> streaks<00:00:20.359> often<00:00:21.359> times

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
of the higher kill streaks often times

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.990 
of the higher kill streaks often times
it's<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.900> challenge<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.320> me<00:00:22.640> now<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.820> guys

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
it's a challenge for me now if you guys

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.150 
it's a challenge for me now if you guys
remember<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.539> modern<00:00:25.080> warfare<00:00:25.260> 3<00:00:25.529> there<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
remember in modern warfare 3 there is a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.790 
remember in modern warfare 3 there is a
class<00:00:26.519> set<00:00:26.849> called<00:00:27.119> support<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.650> was

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
class set called support and what was

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.320 
class set called support and what was
cool<00:00:28.980> about<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.250> class<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> kill

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
cool about that class was the kill

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.110 
cool about that class was the kill
streaks<00:00:30.660> stack<00:00:31.019> even<00:00:31.349> after<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> death<00:00:32.550> so

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
streaks stack even after a death so

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
streaks stack even after a death so
basically<00:00:33.450> what<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.750> means<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> points

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
basically what that means is the points

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.860 
basically what that means is the points
you<00:00:35.040> earn<00:00:35.250> towards<00:00:35.790> your<00:00:35.940> kill<00:00:36.120> streak<00:00:36.390> they

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
you earn towards your kill streak they

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.810 
you earn towards your kill streak they
don't<00:00:37.140> reset<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.860> died<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> normal

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
don't reset when you died like a normal

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.150 
don't reset when you died like a normal
kill<00:00:39.030> streak<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:40.140> carry<00:00:40.440> over<00:00:40.860> through

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
kill streak and they carry over through

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.549 
kill streak and they carry over through
your<00:00:41.340> deaths<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.910> will<00:00:42.149> eventually<00:00:42.559> get

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
your deaths and you will eventually get

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.160 
your deaths and you will eventually get
the<00:00:43.770> streak<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.360> let<00:00:45.480> me<00:00:45.570> show<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.809> how<00:00:45.989> that's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the streak so let me show you how that's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.459 
the streak so let me show you how that's
done<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.800> advanced<00:00:47.610> warfare<00:00:48.320> alright<00:00:49.320> so

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
done in advanced warfare alright so

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.840 
done in advanced warfare alright so
basically<00:00:49.649> there<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.250> four<00:00:50.550> different

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
basically there are four different

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.630 
basically there are four different
streaks<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.989> add<00:00:52.170> support<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
streaks that you can add support to the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.279 
streaks that you can add support to the
first<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.239> gonna<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> aerial<00:00:55.079> recon

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
first one is gonna be the aerial recon

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.979 
first one is gonna be the aerial recon
drone<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> first<00:00:57.360> streaks

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
drone that is one of the first streaks

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.709 
drone that is one of the first streaks
that<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> first<00:00:58.710> streak<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.510> not<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> big

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that is the first streak and not a big

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
that is the first streak and not a big
fan<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> streak<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.370> support

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
fan of streak but if you like to support

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
fan of streak but if you like to support
your<00:01:02.730> teammates<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> way<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.960> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
your teammates this is the way to go so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
your teammates this is the way to go so
basically<00:01:04.860> once<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.309> selected<00:01:05.729> you're

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
basically once it's selected you're

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
basically once it's selected you're
gonna<00:01:05.909> hit<00:01:06.150> Y<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.960> all<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.229> options<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
gonna hit Y and of all these options and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
gonna hit Y and of all these options and
most<00:01:08.070> important<00:01:08.520> you're<00:01:08.700> gonna<00:01:08.790> add<00:01:08.970> support

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
most important you're gonna add support

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
most important you're gonna add support
that<00:01:09.960> adds<00:01:10.200> 400<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> street<00:01:11.369> cost<00:01:11.640> but

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that adds 400 to the street cost but

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.520 
that adds 400 to the street cost but
like<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.840> said<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.500> reset<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> death

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
like I said will not reset with a death

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.109 
like I said will not reset with a death
all<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.680> next<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> UAV<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
all right next up is the UAV which is

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.700 
all right next up is the UAV which is
actually<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:18.659> useful<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.290> game

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
actually very useful in this game

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.530 
actually very useful in this game
depending<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.400> additions<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> put<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
depending on the additions you put on to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
depending on the additions you put on to
it<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.110> we've<00:01:22.290> got<00:01:22.500> two<00:01:22.590> support<00:01:22.979> we've<00:01:23.490> also

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
it so we've got two support we've also

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
it so we've got two support we've also
got<00:01:23.909> threat<00:01:24.210> detection<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.259> like

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
got threat detection which I really like

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.230 
got threat detection which I really like
in<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.710> game<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.130> paints<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> enemies<00:01:26.970> with

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
in this game it paints the enemies with

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.120 
in this game it paints the enemies with
the<00:01:27.270> east<00:01:27.630> sweep<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> UAV<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.860> only<00:01:29.040> do

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the east sweep of the UAV so not only do

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.560 
the east sweep of the UAV so not only do
they<00:01:29.220> show<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.640> mini-map<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
they show up on your mini-map but you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.890 
they show up on your mini-map but you
can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.900> them<00:01:31.079> through<00:01:31.710> walls<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.600> also<00:01:33.600> for

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
can see them through walls and also for

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.149 
can see them through walls and also for
what<00:01:34.020> we're<00:01:34.229> trying<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.009> would

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
what we're trying to do I would

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.490 
what we're trying to do I would
recommend<00:01:35.610> adding<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.119> extra<00:01:36.509> assist<00:01:37.049> points

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
recommend adding the extra assist points

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.410 
recommend adding the extra assist points
for<00:01:38.009> every<00:01:38.220> single<00:01:38.430> assist<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:39.030> an<00:01:39.090> extra

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
for every single assist you get an extra

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.020 
for every single assist you get an extra
50<00:01:39.780> assist<00:01:40.140> points<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.680> only<00:01:40.860> carries<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
50 assist points that only carries on to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.840 
50 assist points that only carries on to
your<00:01:42.270> next<00:01:42.479> Street<00:01:42.899> which<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.430> orbital

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
your next Street which is the orbital

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.960 
your next Street which is the orbital
care<00:01:45.149> package<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:46.320> adding<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.040> you've<00:01:47.790> just

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
care package now adding this you've just

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.569 
care package now adding this you've just
got<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> simply<00:01:48.630> click<00:01:48.869> support<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:50.280> also

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
got a simply click support and I also

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.090 
got a simply click support and I also
highly<00:01:51.090> recommend<00:01:51.119> adding<00:01:51.750> better<00:01:52.229> odds<00:01:52.590> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
highly recommend adding better odds that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.560 
highly recommend adding better odds that
increases<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> chances<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.210> getting<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
increases the chances of getting a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.870 
increases the chances of getting a
better<00:01:54.780> item<00:01:55.049> by<00:01:55.890> doing<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.729> get<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
better item by doing this you get a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.429 
better item by doing this you get a
chance<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> lot<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> high<00:01:58.110> level

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
score streaks that you normally would

not be able to earn or it would be very

we've got the remote terror now key

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.400 
we've got the remote terror now key
thing<00:02:09.300> about<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.599> remote<00:02:09.810> turret<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> is

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
thing about the remote turret it is

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.839 
thing about the remote turret it is
remote<00:02:10.709> meaning<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> need<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.459> manually

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
remote meaning you need to manually

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.230 
remote meaning you need to manually
control<00:02:12.180> it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
control it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.300 
control it
you<00:02:13.450> add<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.810> sensory<00:02:14.380> feature<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.100> which

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
you add the sensory feature to it which

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.790 
you add the sensory feature to it which
I<00:02:15.490> highly<00:02:15.970> recommend<00:02:16.240> doing<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.560> course

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
I highly recommend doing and of course

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.910 
I highly recommend doing and of course
adding<00:02:18.130> support<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.680> also

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
adding support to it and you can also

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.560 
adding support to it and you can also
add<00:02:21.190> up<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.520> three<00:02:21.790> additions

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
add up to three additions

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.370 
add up to three additions
I<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.230> 362<00:02:23.830> head<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:25.540> obvious<00:02:25.960> reasons

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
I like the 362 head for obvious reasons

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.300 
I like the 362 head for obvious reasons
the<00:02:26.560> turret<00:02:26.950> works<00:02:27.460> in<00:02:27.700> all<00:02:27.970> directions<00:02:29.310> so

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
the turret works in all directions so

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.160 
the turret works in all directions so
there<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.580> go<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:30.970> our<00:02:31.180> class<00:02:31.600> setup<00:02:32.020> or

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
there you go this is our class setup or

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.720 
there you go this is our class setup or
our<00:02:32.260> scorestreaks<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.430> four<00:02:33.700> of

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
our scorestreaks that we have four of

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.000 
our scorestreaks that we have four of
them<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.420> they<00:02:34.780> were<00:02:34.840> increased<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.710> cost

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
them so they were increased in cost

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.950 
them so they were increased in cost
because<00:02:36.460> they<00:02:36.610> are<00:02:36.730> support<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.720> should

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
because they are support but you should

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.750 
because they are support but you should
be<00:02:38.110> able<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.320> unlock<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.860> four<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.280> these<00:02:39.430> in

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
be able to unlock all four of these in

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.030 
be able to unlock all four of these in
one<00:02:40.330> game<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:41.110> should<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.530> able<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.710> do<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:41.980> I

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
one game you should be able to do that I

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.880 
one game you should be able to do that I
believe<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.410> what's<00:02:44.410> awesome<00:02:44.650> about

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.740 
believe in you and what's awesome about
that<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.640> orbital<00:02:45.940> care<00:02:46.150> package<00:02:46.600> with

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
that is the orbital care package with

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.390 
that is the orbital care package with
better<00:02:46.930> odds<00:02:47.140> more<00:02:47.830> than<00:02:47.950> likely<00:02:48.100> it's<00:02:48.340> gonna

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
better odds more than likely it's gonna

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.700 
better odds more than likely it's gonna
be<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> very<00:02:49.030> high<00:02:49.270> powered<00:02:49.690> streak<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:50.350> you'll

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
be a very high powered streak so you'll

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.020 
be a very high powered streak so you'll
get<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> chance<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.190> try<00:02:51.400> all<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.700> streaks<00:02:51.940> in

get a chance to try all the streaks in

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.520 
get a chance to try all the streaks in
the<00:02:52.060> game<00:02:52.270> plus<00:02:52.660> these<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.140> should<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.410> able

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
the game plus these you should be able

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.950 
the game plus these you should be able
to<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.740> yourself<00:02:53.890> four<00:02:54.880> streaks<00:02:55.420> every
