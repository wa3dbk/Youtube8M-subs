also so let's see how we make it to make
these<00:00:36.309> boxes<00:00:36.790> we<00:00:37.059> need<00:00:37.410> square<00:00:38.410> size<00:00:38.739> paper<00:00:39.070> if

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
these boxes we need square size paper if

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.010 
these boxes we need square size paper if
you<00:00:39.550> don't<00:00:39.730> have<00:00:39.880> square<00:00:40.210> size<00:00:40.390> paper<00:00:40.780> then

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
you don't have square size paper then

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.060 
you don't have square size paper then
you<00:00:41.170> can<00:00:41.760> cut<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:42.940> square<00:00:43.180> size<00:00:43.600> your<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.920> way

you can cut it square size your the way
I<00:00:45.219> cut<00:00:45.579> them<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:48.190> we<00:00:48.370> need<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:48.969> square<00:00:49.510> size

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
I cut them so we need to square size

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.130 
I cut them so we need to square size
paper<00:00:50.320> one<00:00:51.160> is<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.879> make<00:00:52.090> box<00:00:52.450> and<00:00:52.809> another

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
way you have to push this part inside

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:20.379 
way you have to push this part inside
and<00:03:10.150> then<00:03:11.500> hold<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:16.760> secure<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:20.269> have

and then hold it just secure it you have

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.369 
and then hold it just secure it you have
to<00:03:20.540> do<00:03:20.659> the<00:03:20.840> same<00:03:21.109> thing<00:03:21.409> from<00:03:21.799> this<00:03:22.400> side<00:03:22.760> off

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
to do the same thing from this side off

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.250 
to do the same thing from this side off
first<00:03:24.379> fold<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.129> like<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.599> then<00:03:26.599> take<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:26.989> net

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
first fold it like this then take a net

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.150 
first fold it like this then take a net
this<00:03:27.500> side<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.189> press<00:03:28.849> it<00:03:28.909> inside

and<00:03:34.570> fold<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.040> can<00:03:37.370> see<00:03:37.580> how<00:03:37.820> easy<00:03:38.090> it

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
and fold it so you can see how easy it

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.190 
and fold it so you can see how easy it
is<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:39.010> few<00:03:40.010> steps<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.670> your<00:03:41.480> box<00:03:41.720> is<00:03:41.930> ready

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
now if this is the box to make the lid

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.440 
now if this is the box to make the lid
we<00:03:45.530> need<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.830> loop<00:03:46.010> exactly<00:03:46.520> same<00:03:46.760> thing<00:03:47.030> but

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
we need to loop exactly same thing but

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.530 
we need to loop exactly same thing but
just<00:03:47.690> one<00:03:48.350> little<00:03:48.530> difference

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
just one little difference

just<00:04:06.129> before<00:04:07.129> this<00:04:07.400> is<00:04:07.579> a<00:04:07.610> middle<00:04:07.939> point<00:04:08.120> and

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
just before this is a middle point and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.110 
just before this is a middle point and
I'll<00:04:08.480> I'm<00:04:08.689> folding<00:04:09.019> it<00:04:09.319> a<00:04:09.590> bit<00:04:10.220> bit<00:04:10.489> for<00:04:10.760> metal

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
as you can see I have not folded it

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.510 
as you can see I have not folded it
whole<00:04:24.230> but<00:04:24.860> left<00:04:25.310> space<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.390> between<00:04:26.750> so<00:04:27.520> this

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
whole but left space in between so this

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.570 
whole but left space in between so this
is<00:04:28.730> what<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.570> have<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.960> do<00:04:30.170> to<00:04:30.800> make<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.370> lid

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
is what you have to do to make the lid

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.200 
is what you have to do to make the lid
from<00:04:32.170> both<00:04:33.170> side<00:04:33.530> like<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.760> way<00:04:34.910> I<00:04:34.940> have

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
from both side like the way I have

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.570 
from both side like the way I have
folded<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:35.810> now<00:04:36.410> I'm<00:04:36.680> going<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.070> fold<00:04:37.280> other

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
folded it now I'm going to fold other

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
folded it now I'm going to fold other
sides<00:04:38.350> same<00:04:39.350> way<00:04:39.650> not<00:04:40.340> till<00:04:40.610> middle<00:04:40.910> point

so as you can see I have not folded it

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.950 
so as you can see I have not folded it
whole<00:05:00.830> till<00:05:01.550> middle<00:05:01.790> point<00:05:02.120> but<00:05:02.390> I<00:05:02.630> have<00:05:02.720> left

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
whole till middle point but I have left

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.130 
whole till middle point but I have left
some<00:05:03.230> space<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:03.890> have<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.520> fold<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:05.140> before

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
some space you have to fold it before

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.270 
some space you have to fold it before
middle<00:05:06.860> point

middle point

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.150 
middle point
don't<00:05:07.610> touch<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:08.030> middle<00:05:08.300> point<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:12.710> rest<00:05:12.950> of

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
don't touch the middle point the rest of

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:24.970 
don't touch the middle point the rest of
the<00:05:13.310> steps<00:05:13.640> are<00:05:13.850> same<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:24.200> this<00:05:24.350> is<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.740> lid

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
the steps are same so this is the lid

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.280 
the steps are same so this is the lid
and<00:05:25.310> this<00:05:25.610> is<00:05:25.790> the<00:05:25.910> box<00:05:26.150> that<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:26.450> is<00:05:26.780> slightly

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
and this is the box that it is slightly

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.280 
and this is the box that it is slightly
bigger<00:05:28.010> than<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.310> box<00:05:28.670> so<00:05:29.480> that<00:05:29.510> we<00:05:29.840> can<00:05:30.050> cover

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
bigger than the box so that we can cover

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:38.860 
bigger than the box so that we can cover
the<00:05:30.560> box<00:05:30.770> with<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.100> lid<00:05:36.400> so<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.670> can<00:05:38.090> see<00:05:38.300> box
