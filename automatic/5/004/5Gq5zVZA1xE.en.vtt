00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
out there I've tried some from

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.069 
out there I've tried some from
drugstores<00:00:53.760> I've<00:00:54.030> tried<00:00:54.329> some<00:00:54.629> even

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
drugstores I've tried some even

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
drugstores I've tried some even
higher-end<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.949> more<00:00:56.129> expensive<00:00:56.460> than<00:00:56.910> this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
higher-end and more expensive than this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.380 
higher-end and more expensive than this
and<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.840> I'd<00:00:58.199> say<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:59.010> average<00:00:59.390> price

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390

for<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.750> deep<00:01:00.960> conditioner<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.890> this

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
for a deep conditioner because this

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
for a deep conditioner because this
isn't<00:01:02.430> something<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.969> use<00:01:03.329> every<00:01:03.719> day<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> use

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this like once a week or every once

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.060 
this like once a week or every once
every<00:01:06.180> other<00:01:06.210> week<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.590> lazy<00:01:07.830> and
