do a small left strafe jump preferably

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.139 
do a small left strafe jump preferably
that<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.710> get<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> light<00:02:02.159> weapon<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.939> this

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that you get a light weapon to do this

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.730 
that you get a light weapon to do this
because<00:02:03.390> heavy<00:02:03.869> weapons<00:02:04.290> aren't<00:02:04.469> really

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
because heavy weapons aren't really

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620

jumper<00:02:15.550> which<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.480> am<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.950> guess<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:18.880> say

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
jumper which I am I guess you can say

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.350 
jumper which I am I guess you can say
but<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.770> could<00:02:21.340> probably<00:02:21.490> hit<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.850> with<00:02:22.000> pretty

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
but I could probably hit it with pretty

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.320 
but I could probably hit it with pretty
much<00:02:22.510> any<00:02:23.170> gun<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.460> pretty<00:02:24.760> tricky<00:02:24.970> so

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
much any gun but it is pretty tricky so

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.380 
much any gun but it is pretty tricky so
I<00:02:25.360> suggest<00:02:25.900> using<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.320> really<00:02:26.620> light<00:02:26.800> weapon

very<00:04:16.330> big<00:04:16.600> purpose<00:04:16.989> but<00:04:17.169> I<00:04:17.230> just<00:04:17.440> thought<00:04:17.560> it

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
very big purpose but I just thought it

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.409 
very big purpose but I just thought it
was<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.799> neat<00:04:18.010> glitch<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.489> what<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.270> guys<00:04:19.359> need

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
was a neat glitch and what you guys need

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.680 
was a neat glitch and what you guys need
to<00:04:19.690> do<00:04:19.840> is<00:04:20.080> fall<00:04:20.260> down<00:04:20.500> from<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.770> balcony<00:04:21.690> jump

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
to do is fall down from the balcony jump

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.430 
to do is fall down from the balcony jump
on<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.880> seats

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
on to the seats

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.160 
on to the seats
like<00:04:25.890> laying<00:04:26.160> on<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.370> floor<00:04:26.420> then<00:04:27.420> lay<00:04:27.810> our

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
like laying on the floor then lay our

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.730 
like laying on the floor then lay our
jump<00:04:28.560> onto<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:28.950> rubble<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:30.020> then<00:04:31.020> jump<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.530> to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
jump onto the rubble and then jump on to

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.190 
jump onto the rubble and then jump on to
the<00:04:31.860> balcony<00:04:32.010> once<00:04:32.700> you've<00:04:32.880> done<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.200> run

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
the balcony once you've done that run

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.650 
the balcony once you've done that run
over<00:04:34.470> here<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.070> back<00:04:36.000> side<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
over here to the back side of the

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.760 
over here to the back side of the
barrier<00:04:36.900> where<00:04:37.580> they<00:04:38.580> some<00:04:39.120> reason<00:04:39.660> did<00:04:40.650> not

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
barrier where they some reason did not

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.730 
barrier where they some reason did not
put<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.010> barrier<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.490> there<00:04:41.990> which<00:04:42.990> was<00:04:43.230> kind<00:04:43.680> of

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
put a barrier on there which was kind of

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.160 
put a barrier on there which was kind of
just<00:04:43.920> I<00:04:44.220> don't<00:04:44.520> know<00:04:44.700> stupid<00:04:45.420> of<00:04:45.660> them<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:46.020> do

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
just I don't know stupid of them to do

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.590 
just I don't know stupid of them to do
but<00:04:46.490> I'm<00:04:47.490> kind<00:04:47.790> of<00:04:47.850> glad<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.060> they<00:04:48.300> didn't

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
but I'm kind of glad that they didn't

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.960 
but I'm kind of glad that they didn't
but<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.350> can<00:04:49.500> walk<00:04:49.740> on<00:04:49.950> all<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.460> barrier

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
but you can walk on all the barrier

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.650 
but you can walk on all the barrier
stuff<00:04:51.360> up<00:04:51.540> here<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:52.460> this<00:04:53.460> was<00:04:53.670> a<00:04:53.700> little<00:04:54.060> spot

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
stuff up here and this was a little spot

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.240 
stuff up here and this was a little spot
I<00:04:54.690> found<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.260> just<00:04:55.290> need<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.740> do<00:04:55.890> a<00:04:55.920> small

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
I found you just need to do a small

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.040 
I found you just need to do a small
strafe<00:04:56.610> jump<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:57.150> if<00:04:57.390> you<00:04:57.510> guys<00:04:57.660> cannot

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
strafe jump and if you guys cannot

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.470 
strafe jump and if you guys cannot
strafe<00:04:58.410> jump<00:04:58.440> if<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.250> guys<00:04:59.580> stand<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.390> the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
strafe jump if you guys stand on the

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.690 
strafe jump if you guys stand on the
railing<00:05:00.810> into<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.080> run<00:05:01.380> jump<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:02.220> can<00:05:02.430> make<00:05:02.580> it

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
railing into a run jump you can make it

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.240 
railing into a run jump you can make it
just<00:05:02.940> as<00:05:03.060> easy<00:05:03.320> but<00:05:04.320> what<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.830> found<00:05:05.010> is<00:05:05.220> that

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
just as easy but what I found is that

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.560 
just as easy but what I found is that
you<00:05:05.400> can<00:05:05.520> come<00:05:05.670> back<00:05:05.820> here<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.090> there's<00:05:06.480> a

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
you can come back here and there's a

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.450 
you can come back here and there's a
little<00:05:06.930> indention<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:07.860> has<00:05:07.980> like<00:05:08.160> a<00:05:08.190> little

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
little indention that has like a little

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.120 
little indention that has like a little
hole<00:05:08.670> rubble<00:05:09.240> crap<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.020> ceiling<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:10.860> I

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
hole rubble crap in the ceiling and I

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.720 
hole rubble crap in the ceiling and I
just<00:05:12.060> found<00:05:12.330> that<00:05:12.570> you<00:05:12.660> could<00:05:12.810> Crouch<00:05:13.730> this

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
just found that you could Crouch this

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.340 
just found that you could Crouch this
glitch<00:05:15.270> doesn't<00:05:15.630> serve<00:05:15.780> too<00:05:15.960> much<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.260> a

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
glitch doesn't serve too much of a

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.020 
glitch doesn't serve too much of a
purpose<00:05:16.740> but<00:05:16.980> if<00:05:17.190> your<00:05:17.400> friends<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:17.940> like
