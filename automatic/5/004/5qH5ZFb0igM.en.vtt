at all in my first video and I've got to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.479 
at all in my first video and I've got to
say<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.539> price<00:01:00.840> crash<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.500> already<00:01:01.859> started<00:01:02.370> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
think a lot of people realized that lot

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.240 
think a lot of people realized that lot
of<00:01:05.400> any<00:01:05.729> forms<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.240> sides<00:01:06.720> broken<00:01:07.200> price<00:01:07.409> but

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
of any forms of sides broken price but
it<00:01:08.700> could<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.570> blessing<00:01:10.110> some

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the high price range and that's because

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.830 
the high price range and that's because
the<00:01:52.020> team<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> season<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.939> because

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the team of the season like because

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.780 
the team of the season like because
everyone's<00:01:55.049> scared<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> self<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
everyone's scared to self and

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.570 
everyone's scared to self and
don't<00:01:58.600> get<00:01:58.780> me<00:01:58.870> wrong<00:01:58.930> it's<00:01:59.320> extremely<00:02:00.160> rescue

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
don't get me wrong it's extremely rescue

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.870 
don't get me wrong it's extremely rescue
so<00:02:00.970> like<00:02:01.570> I<00:02:02.020> wouldn't<00:02:02.830> be<00:02:02.890> constantly<00:02:03.490> abused

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
so like I wouldn't be constantly abused

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.820 
so like I wouldn't be constantly abused
that<00:02:04.060> matter<00:02:04.300> because<00:02:04.750> s<00:02:04.960> really<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:05.560> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
that matter because s really it's the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.160 
that matter because s really it's the
risk<00:02:06.220> involved<00:02:06.610> like<00:02:07.330> that's<00:02:07.750> his<00:02:07.930> rough

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
risk involved like that's his rough

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.930 
risk involved like that's his rough
price<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.619> minute<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.340> could

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
price of minute so that it could

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.110 
price of minute so that it could
actually<00:02:10.300> be<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.350> pretty<00:02:11.380> good<00:02:11.650> deal<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.160> but

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
actually be a pretty good deal that but

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.410 
actually be a pretty good deal that but
it's<00:02:13.900> extremely<00:02:14.470> risky<00:02:14.860> because<00:02:15.190> if<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.180> saw

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
it's extremely risky because if you saw

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.180 
it's extremely risky because if you saw
when<00:02:16.660> they<00:02:16.780> did<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.110> appt<00:02:17.230> 2<00:02:17.410> episode<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:18.130> was

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
when they did the appt 2 episode it was

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.100 
when they did the appt 2 episode it was
about<00:02:18.400> 10<00:02:18.700> on<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.850> mark<00:02:19.090> he'll<00:02:19.300> inform<00:02:19.510> aunty

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
about 10 on the mark he'll inform aunty

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.230 
about 10 on the mark he'll inform aunty
Lopez<00:02:20.500> there's<00:02:20.950> now<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.190> think<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:21.790> counted<00:02:22.180> six

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
scared to sell at low prices price

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.040 
scared to sell at low prices price
includes<00:02:26.290> 40k<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.210> just<00:02:28.450> ridiculous

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
because people are scared so I did

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.760 
because people are scared so I did
commit<00:02:31.150> insane<00:02:31.600> profits<00:02:32.050> there<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.320> actually

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
also another vector which will be

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.810 
also another vector which will be
working<00:02:37.570> each<00:02:37.690> streaming<00:02:38.110> wealth<00:02:38.320> is

probably gold late right I've got to

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.480 
probably gold late right I've got to

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
messed up here I think don't need disc

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.229 
messed up here I think don't need disc
up<00:03:10.180> 350<00:03:11.610> wait<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.640> sec<00:03:12.940> I'm<00:03:14.610> right<00:03:15.610> so<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.850> little

anyway<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:17.260> back<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.590> discard<00:03:17.890> method<00:03:18.160> it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
anyway going back to discard method it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.090 
anyway going back to discard method it
will<00:03:18.400> work<00:03:18.519> extremely<00:03:19.090> well<00:03:19.650> because<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.830> lot

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
will work extremely well because a lot

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.000 
will work extremely well because a lot
of<00:03:21.130> people<00:03:21.370> will<00:03:22.120> be<00:03:22.180> like<00:03:22.600> selling<00:03:23.350> will<00:03:23.890> be

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
of people will be like selling will be

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.160 
of people will be like selling will be
like<00:03:24.190> just<00:03:24.940> tracking<00:03:25.330> their<00:03:25.600> Pleasant<00:03:25.750> mark<00:03:26.049> I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
like just tracking their Pleasant mark I

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.229 
like just tracking their Pleasant mark I
think<00:03:26.350> can<00:03:26.500> work<00:03:26.620> better<00:03:26.830> with<00:03:27.160> gold<00:03:27.549> res<00:03:27.940> wait

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
think can work better with gold res wait

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.020 
think can work better with gold res wait
so<00:03:28.480> let<00:03:28.690> me<00:03:28.780> just<00:03:28.989> see<00:03:29.140> since<00:03:29.470> they<00:03:30.370> do<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:30.790> for

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
so let me just see since they do so for

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.210 
so let me just see since they do so for
that<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.390> why<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:32.110> don't<00:03:32.830> know<00:03:32.890> I'd<00:03:33.100> never

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
that so why I don't know I'd never

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.780 
that so why I don't know I'd never

comments if you want me to do that so I

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.390 
comments if you want me to do that so I
again<00:05:22.139> as<00:05:22.259> I<00:05:22.289> said<00:05:22.380> last<00:05:22.560> episode<00:05:23.099> you<00:05:23.130> want<00:05:23.310> to

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
again as I said last episode you want to

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.640 
again as I said last episode you want to
really<00:05:23.580> be<00:05:23.759> trading<00:05:24.120> with<00:05:24.240> conceivable<00:05:24.870> 1<00:05:25.530> i'd

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
really be trading with conceivable 1 i'd

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.320 
really be trading with conceivable 1 i'd
really<00:05:25.919> recommend<00:05:26.039> it<00:05:26.400> isn't<00:05:26.759> picked<00:05:26.940> up<00:05:27.120> too

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
really recommend it isn't picked up too

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.800 
really recommend it isn't picked up too
much<00:05:27.509> and<00:05:27.690> it's<00:05:28.320> quite<00:05:28.650> rare<00:05:28.889> in<00:05:28.949> packs<00:05:29.810> that's

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
much and it's quite rare in packs that's

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.450 
much and it's quite rare in packs that's
the<00:05:30.990> wrong<00:05:31.169> thing<00:05:31.800> i'm<00:05:32.130> thinking<00:05:32.280> the

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
the wrong thing i'm thinking the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.070 
the wrong thing i'm thinking the
completely<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:32.970> wrong<00:05:33.000> thing<00:05:33.330> but<00:05:33.900> what<00:05:34.020> you

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
completely the wrong thing but what you

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.990 
completely the wrong thing but what you
want<00:05:34.199> to<00:05:34.289> look<00:05:34.380> up<00:05:34.590> one<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.729> would<00:05:35.820> really

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
want to look up one that would really

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.360 
want to look up one that would really
work<00:05:36.150> quite<00:05:36.630> well<00:05:36.659> its<00:05:37.380> chemistry<00:05:37.740> styles<00:05:38.250> and

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
work quite well its chemistry styles and

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.310 
work quite well its chemistry styles and
like<00:05:38.460> i<00:05:38.610> said<00:05:38.669> last<00:05:38.909> time<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.570> worked<00:05:40.020> well

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
like i said last time it worked well

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.219 
like i said last time it worked well
with<00:05:40.349> like<00:05:40.889> catalyst<00:05:41.729> shadow<00:05:42.419> and<00:05:42.780> hunter

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
with like catalyst shadow and hunter

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.140 
with like catalyst shadow and hunter
there's<00:05:43.860> some<00:05:44.099> other<00:05:44.219> one<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:44.639> magical<00:05:45.060> and

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
there's some other one so magical and

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.659 
there's some other one so magical and
look<00:05:45.300> i<00:05:45.389> don't<00:05:45.570> know<00:05:45.870> i<00:05:45.960> think<00:05:46.199> the<00:05:47.190> ones<00:05:47.430> that

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
look i don't know i think the ones that

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.969 
look i don't know i think the ones that
go<00:05:47.789> for<00:05:47.969> roughly<00:05:48.240> around<00:05:48.389> like<00:05:48.960> five<00:05:49.409> like

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
go for roughly around like five like

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.930 
go for roughly around like five like
this<00:05:50.370> one<00:05:51.650> my<00:05:52.650> thinking<00:05:52.949> she's<00:05:53.280> been<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.430> retard

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
this one my thinking she's been a retard

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.180 
this one my thinking she's been a retard
here<00:05:54.120> I<00:05:54.330> think<00:05:55.020> you<00:05:55.169> could<00:05:55.349> pick<00:05:55.530> these<00:05:55.710> up<00:05:55.770> at

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
here I think you could pick these up at

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.189 
here I think you could pick these up at
this<00:05:56.610> grad<00:05:56.849> 150<00:05:57.449> and<00:05:57.570> then<00:05:57.659> obviously<00:05:57.810> sell

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
this grad 150 and then obviously sell

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.620 
this grad 150 and then obviously sell
them<00:05:58.289> off<00:05:58.349> for<00:05:58.500> our<00:05:58.620> 700<00:05:59.460> quite<00:06:00.120> so<00:06:00.240> it's<00:06:00.389> just

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
them off for our 700 quite so it's just

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.649 
them off for our 700 quite so it's just
really<00:06:01.229> easy<00:06:01.590> math<00:06:01.919> bidding<00:06:02.340> engine<00:06:02.820> I<00:06:02.969> think

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
really easy math bidding engine I think

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.649 
really easy math bidding engine I think
that<00:06:03.750> goes<00:06:04.169> throughout<00:06:04.460> 1k<00:06:05.460> yeah<00:06:05.699> so<00:06:06.300> probably

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
that goes throughout 1k yeah so probably

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.209 
that goes throughout 1k yeah so probably
pick<00:06:06.840> these<00:06:06.960> up<00:06:07.020> during<00:06:07.469> team<00:06:07.680> of<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:07.889> season

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
pick these up during team of the season

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.570 
pick these up during team of the season
for<00:06:08.340> roughly<00:06:08.669> around<00:06:09.050> 500<00:06:10.050> 450<00:06:10.680> coins<00:06:11.190> and

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
for roughly around 500 450 coins and

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.920 
for roughly around 500 450 coins and
it's<00:06:11.940> just<00:06:12.120> because<00:06:12.270> people<00:06:12.419> are<00:06:12.630> packing

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
it's just because people are packing

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.519 
it's just because people are packing
them<00:06:13.050> listen

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
them listen

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.009 
them listen
straight<00:06:13.829> back<00:06:14.009> up<00:06:14.039> for<00:06:14.399> 150<00:06:15.149> coins<00:06:15.359> and<00:06:15.929> it

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:16.019 
straight back up for 150 coins and it

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:17.329 
straight back up for 150 coins and it
could<00:06:16.109> just<00:06:16.199> easily<00:06:16.499> pick<00:06:16.799> them<00:06:16.949> up<00:06:17.039> and<00:06:17.189> i'll

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:17.339 
could just easily pick them up and i'll

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:20.269 
could just easily pick them up and i'll
sell<00:06:17.639> them<00:06:17.819> just<00:06:18.479> after<00:06:18.719> two<00:06:19.109> not<00:06:19.649> just<00:06:19.859> after

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.279 
sell them just after two not just after

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.699
