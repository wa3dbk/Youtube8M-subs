00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.640 

as<00:00:17.920> much<00:00:18.310> as<00:00:18.520> I<00:00:18.670> like<00:00:18.940> that<00:00:19.570> little<00:00:19.780> stroke

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
as much as I like that little stroke

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.820 
as much as I like that little stroke
that<00:00:21.040> created<00:00:21.520> see<00:00:21.790> the<00:00:22.570> stock<00:00:23.110> for<00:00:23.380> that<00:00:23.500> leaf

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
that created see the stock for that leaf

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.850 
that created see the stock for that leaf
and<00:00:24.640> probably<00:00:25.029> change<00:00:25.300> that<00:00:25.630> because<00:00:26.260> it'll

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
and probably change that because it'll

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.230 
and probably change that because it'll
be<00:00:26.950> easier<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.369> change<00:00:27.550> that<00:00:27.939> one<00:00:28.060> I<00:00:28.119> think

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
be easier to change that one I think

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.810 
be easier to change that one I think
then<00:00:28.689> to<00:00:28.720> change<00:00:29.020> that<00:00:29.320> other<00:00:29.500> longleaf<00:00:30.310> the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
then to change that other longleaf the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.609 
then to change that other longleaf the
ones<00:00:31.420> that<00:00:31.689> are<00:00:31.930> going<00:00:32.140> both<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.439> same

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
ones that are going both the same

00:00:32.619 --> 00:01:28.440 
ones that are going both the same
direction

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.500 

you<00:01:29.450> notice<00:01:29.720> with<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.500> lot<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.550> try<00:01:32.360> not

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
you notice with a lot of this I try not

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.060 
you notice with a lot of this I try not
to<00:01:32.570> overwork<00:01:33.230> The<00:01:33.440> Strokes

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
to overwork The Strokes

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.820 
to overwork The Strokes
I'll<00:01:34.520> get<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.150> paint<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:36.170> want<00:01:36.440> on<00:01:36.560> there

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
I'll get the paint that I want on there

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.030 
I'll get the paint that I want on there
and<00:01:37.040> then<00:01:37.730> as<00:01:38.540> often<00:01:38.960> as<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.440> can

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
and then as often as I can

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.090 
and then as often as I can
I<00:01:40.070> try<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:40.880> lay<00:01:41.120> down<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:42.410> shape<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:43.010> want

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
I try to lay down the shape that I want

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.200 
I try to lay down the shape that I want
in<00:01:43.520> one<00:01:43.790> stroke<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.480> then<00:01:45.380> vary<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.700> pressure

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
in one stroke and then vary the pressure

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.390 
in one stroke and then vary the pressure
that<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.510> put<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.990> stroke<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:48.620> it<00:01:48.770> it

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
that I put on that stroke so that it it

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.950 
that I put on that stroke so that it it
naturally<00:01:50.740> levels<00:01:51.740> off<00:01:51.920> or<00:01:52.220> tapers<00:01:53.030> off<00:01:53.210> it

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
naturally levels off or tapers off it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.840 
naturally levels off or tapers off it
helps<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.500> create<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.040> more<00:01:55.100> natural<00:01:55.670> feeling

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
helps to create a more natural feeling

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.030 
helps to create a more natural feeling
better<00:01:56.270> edges<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.990> more<00:01:57.560> natural

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
better edges and more natural

00:01:58.040 --> 00:03:06.130 
better edges and more natural
three-dimensional<00:01:58.790> quality<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.330> it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.509 

sometimes<00:03:06.769> you'll<00:03:06.920> see<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.099> little<00:03:07.280> bit<00:03:07.459> of

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
sometimes you'll see a little bit of

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.030 
sometimes you'll see a little bit of
something<00:03:08.120> appear<00:03:08.840> magically<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.799> side

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
something appear magically to the side

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.830 
something appear magically to the side
or<00:03:10.310> something<00:03:10.519> that's<00:03:10.849> just<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:11.209> claimed<00:03:11.750> to

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
or something that's just I claimed to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.600 
or something that's just I claimed to
brush<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.290> didn't<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.069> you'd<00:03:13.280> want<00:03:13.489> to

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
brush and didn't think you'd want to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.380 
brush and didn't think you'd want to
waste<00:03:14.390> your<00:03:14.510> time<00:03:14.890> having<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.400> video

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
waste your time having that in the video

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.990 
waste your time having that in the video
so<00:03:18.049> if<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.170> see<00:03:18.470> things<00:03:18.860> change<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.640> haven't

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
so if you see things change you haven't

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.569 
so if you see things change you haven't
missed<00:03:20.360> anything<00:03:20.659> still<00:03:21.620> got<00:03:21.739> all<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.950> paint

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
missed anything still got all the paint

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.309 
missed anything still got all the paint
in<00:03:22.730> there<00:03:22.879> the<00:03:23.030> brushstrokes<00:03:23.540> all<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.140> sort

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
in there the brushstrokes all that sort

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.160 
in there the brushstrokes all that sort
of<00:03:24.379> thing<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:25.010> took<00:03:25.610> out<00:03:26.019> everything<00:03:27.019> else

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
of thing I just took out everything else

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:45.720 
of thing I just took out everything else
that<00:03:27.980> was<00:03:28.099> a<00:03:28.129> waste<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.519> your<00:03:28.610> time<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:29.030> watch

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.240 

all<00:03:46.270> right<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.599> notice<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.200> top<00:03:48.040> of

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
all right so you notice that the top of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.630 
all right so you notice that the top of
that<00:03:48.400> stem<00:03:48.790> kind<00:03:49.569> of<00:03:50.069> disappeared<00:03:51.069> into<00:03:51.400> the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
that stem kind of disappeared into the

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.470 
that stem kind of disappeared into the
background<00:03:52.420> it's<00:03:53.200> because<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.590> values<00:03:54.010> and

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
background it's because the values and

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.850 
background it's because the values and
color<00:03:55.480> temperatures<00:03:55.930> are<00:03:56.080> too<00:03:56.319> closely

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
color temperatures are too closely

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.300 
color temperatures are too closely
aligned<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.450> need<00:03:58.599> to<00:03:58.690> punch<00:03:59.379> that<00:03:59.650> up<00:03:59.860> give

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
aligned so I need to punch that up give

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.680 
aligned so I need to punch that up give
it<00:04:00.459> more<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:01.030> bring<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.080> out<00:04:02.230> away<00:04:02.440> from<00:04:02.620> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
it more to bring it out away from the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.100 
it more to bring it out away from the
background<00:04:07.920> instead<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:09.069> adding<00:04:09.430> white<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.930> it

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
background instead of adding white to it

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.270 
background instead of adding white to it
which<00:04:11.349> is<00:04:11.769> going<00:04:12.099> to<00:04:12.299> kill<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.420> color<00:04:13.599> mark<00:04:13.930> I

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
which is going to kill the color mark I

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.069 
which is going to kill the color mark I
warmed<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.340> up<00:04:15.459> added<00:04:15.970> more<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.389> cadmium

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
warmed it up added more the cadmium

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:31.390 
warmed it up added more the cadmium
yellow<00:04:17.620> medium

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.409 

and<00:04:31.790> wow<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:32.780> was<00:04:33.139> way<00:04:34.040> too<00:04:34.760> thick<00:04:34.790> for<00:04:35.389> a

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
and wow that was way too thick for a

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.750 
and wow that was way too thick for a
hollyhock<00:04:36.080> stem<00:04:36.380> especially<00:04:37.190> for<00:04:37.370> with<00:04:37.550> what

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
hollyhock stem especially for with what

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.370 
hollyhock stem especially for with what
I'm<00:04:37.880> trying<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.150> do<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.479> want<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.960> much<00:04:39.110> more

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
I'm trying to do I want a much more

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.510 
I'm trying to do I want a much more
subtle<00:04:40.250> play<00:04:41.240> of<00:04:41.449> shapes<00:04:42.290> and<00:04:42.560> highlights<00:04:43.250> and

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
subtle play of shapes and highlights and

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.980 
subtle play of shapes and highlights and
values<00:04:44.270> in<00:04:44.449> here

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:05:00.060 

I<00:04:56.790> really<00:04:57.790> want<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.000> have<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.750> background<00:04:59.710> a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
I really want to have a the background a

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.990 
I really want to have a the background a
nice<00:05:00.840> delineated<00:05:01.840> shape<00:05:02.410> between<00:05:03.340> those

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
nice delineated shape between those

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.660 
nice delineated shape between those
parts<00:05:04.660> of<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.870> plant<00:05:05.140> I<00:05:05.440> want<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.460> feel

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
parts of the plant I want that to feel

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.980 
parts of the plant I want that to feel
more<00:05:06.820> like<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.120> background<00:05:07.510> back<00:05:07.750> there

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
more like the background back there

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.920 

but<00:05:43.950> then<00:05:44.100> if<00:05:44.220> I<00:05:44.310> put<00:05:44.520> it<00:05:44.610> in<00:05:44.700> one<00:05:44.910> area<00:05:45.120> I<00:05:45.450> need

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
throughout the painting so that it feels

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.400 
throughout the painting so that it feels
