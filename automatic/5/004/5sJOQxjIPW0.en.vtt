00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
we can row down these things you can get

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.939 
we can row down these things you can get
rid<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.960> face<00:00:30.140> limit<00:00:31.140> let<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.320> set<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.679> first

I'm<00:00:53.190> gonna<00:00:53.340> build<00:00:53.609> a<00:00:53.760> gate<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.239> down<00:00:54.629> over

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
I'm gonna build a gate right down over

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:05.359 
I'm gonna build a gate right down over
here<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.260> well<00:01:03.799> we're<00:01:04.799> exactly<00:01:05.040> where<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
here as well we're exactly where to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.480 
here as well we're exactly where to
build<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.890> these<00:01:07.890> guys<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.190> gonna<00:01:08.280> come

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
build that one these guys are gonna come

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.960 
build that one these guys are gonna come
up<00:01:08.640> here<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> build<00:01:09.720> another<00:01:10.020> gate<00:01:11.240> here<00:01:13.970> I'll

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
up here and build another gate here I'll

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.070 
up here and build another gate here I'll
keep<00:01:15.149> people<00:01:15.450> from<00:01:15.570> anything<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:18.080> these

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
keep people from anything there these

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.600 
keep people from anything there these
are<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.470> some<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.680> gaps<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.369> need<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
are just some little gaps that need to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.100 
are just some little gaps that need to
be<00:01:20.640> plugged<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:24.720> enemy<00:01:24.960> AI

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
be plugged up and the way the enemy AI

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
be plugged up and the way the enemy AI
works<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.820> will<00:01:26.970> only<00:01:27.149> attack<00:01:29.479> they

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
works is they will only attack they

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.499 
works is they will only attack they
won't<00:01:30.720> attack<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:31.610> gates<00:01:32.610> they'll<00:01:33.300> only

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
won't attack these gates they'll only

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.010 
won't attack these gates they'll only
attack<00:01:33.929> walls<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.460> delete<00:01:35.819> a<00:01:36.210> section

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
attack walls and if we delete a section

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.630 
attack walls and if we delete a section
of<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:37.440> walls<00:01:39.890> basically<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.130> make<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
of the walls basically just make the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
of the walls basically just make the
enemy<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.030> want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.330> come<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:46.350> gonna<00:01:46.470> uh

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
enemy not want to come as it's gonna uh

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.050 
enemy not want to come as it's gonna uh
knock<00:01:46.800> these<00:01:47.009> down

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.529 

this<00:01:56.060> will<00:01:56.210> keep<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.479> enemies<00:01:56.780> off<00:01:56.929> our<00:01:57.109> back

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.179 

and<00:02:02.539> I've<00:02:02.990> heard<00:02:03.170> sometimes<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:03.829> method

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
and I've heard sometimes this method

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.550 
and I've heard sometimes this method
doesn't<00:02:04.369> work<00:02:04.520> exactly<00:02:05.299> as<00:02:05.569> planned<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:06.469> I'm

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
doesn't work exactly as planned so I'm

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.770 
doesn't work exactly as planned so I'm
going<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:07.069> wait<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.490> out<00:02:07.609> and<00:02:07.939> see<00:02:08.330> if<00:02:08.599> this

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
going to wait it out and see if this

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.100 
going to wait it out and see if this
actually<00:02:08.989> works<00:02:12.310> sure<00:02:13.900> let's<00:02:14.900> get<00:02:14.989> our

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
actually works sure let's get our

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.150 
actually works sure let's get our
villagers<00:02:15.440> back<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.950> town<00:02:16.190> here<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.950> sure

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
villagers back in the town here we sure

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.470 
villagers back in the town here we sure
okay<00:02:24.549> so<00:02:25.549> we're<00:02:25.670> gonna<00:02:25.760> bring<00:02:25.970> our<00:02:26.090> guys<00:02:26.239> down

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.759 
okay so we're gonna bring our guys down
here<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.900> just<00:02:27.049> start<00:02:27.260> getting<00:02:27.440> some

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
here and just start getting some

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.979 
here and just start getting some
resources<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:31.250> we've<00:02:31.760> blocked<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.150> off<00:02:32.269> and

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
resources now we've blocked it off and

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.199 
resources now we've blocked it off and
the<00:02:33.140> enemy<00:02:33.440> AI<00:02:33.620> will<00:02:34.129> not<00:02:34.430> attack<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:35.000> gates

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the enemy AI will not attack the gates

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.990 
the enemy AI will not attack the gates
they<00:02:35.690> may<00:02:36.019> focus<00:02:36.230> on<00:02:36.530> walls<00:02:36.860> for<00:02:37.459> some<00:02:37.640> reasons

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
they may focus on walls for some reasons

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.970 
they may focus on walls for some reasons
and<00:02:38.150> not<00:02:38.780> gates<00:02:39.079> so<00:02:39.319> if<00:02:39.379> you<00:02:39.500> just<00:02:39.620> block<00:02:39.799> these

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
and not gates so if you just block these

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.349 
and not gates so if you just block these
off<00:02:40.129> with<00:02:40.280> gates<00:02:40.519> they're<00:02:40.730> just<00:02:40.910> gonna<00:02:41.030> run

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
off with gates they're just gonna run

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.670 
off with gates they're just gonna run
circles<00:02:41.599> around<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.379> they're<00:02:42.470> not<00:02:42.500> gonna

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
circles around it and they're not gonna

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.910 
circles around it and they're not gonna
be<00:02:42.739> able<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:42.950> do<00:02:43.099> anything

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.160 

I<00:02:48.950> already<00:02:49.460> see<00:02:49.730> them<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:50.120> kind<00:02:50.240> of<00:02:50.330> know<00:02:50.930> Jeb
