manicure<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> basic<00:00:54.600> white

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
manicure and I just do the basic white

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.260 
manicure and I just do the basic white
tips<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.370> usually<00:00:56.520> blog<00:00:56.879> about<00:00:57.000> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
tips and I don't usually blog about that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
tips and I don't usually blog about that
because<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> little<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.079> boring<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
because it's a little bit boring and I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.189 
because it's a little bit boring and I
guess<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> guys<00:01:00.570> probably<00:01:00.750> would<00:01:00.960> want<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
guess you guys probably would want to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.139 
guess you guys probably would want to
hear<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> decided<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.000> do

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
hear about it but I decided to do

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.060 
hear about it but I decided to do
something<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.629> little<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.989> different<00:01:04.559> today<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
something a little bit different today I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.820 
something a little bit different today I
went<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.270> got<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> colored<00:01:07.200> tips

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
went and I actually got the colored tips

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.539 
went and I actually got the colored tips
um<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.799> they're<00:01:10.799> pretty<00:01:11.010> interesting

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
um so they're pretty interesting

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
um so they're pretty interesting
actually<00:01:11.850> when<00:01:12.630> my<00:01:12.930> boyfriend<00:01:13.140> came<00:01:13.470> home<00:01:13.680> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
actually when my boyfriend came home and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
actually when my boyfriend came home and
saw<00:01:13.979> them<00:01:14.220> he<00:01:14.400> goes<00:01:14.580> oh<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.850> god<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.360> do

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
saw them he goes oh my god would you do

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.160 
saw them he goes oh my god would you do
and<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> he's<00:01:17.580> not<00:01:17.970> exactly<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.540> huge<00:01:18.900> fan<00:01:19.140> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and so he's not exactly a huge fan of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.080 
and so he's not exactly a huge fan of
them<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.250> they're<00:01:20.369> kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> fun<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
them but I think they're kind of fun I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
them but I think they're kind of fun I
think<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.570> retrospect<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.979> would<00:01:23.400> have

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
think in retrospect I would have

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.070 
think in retrospect I would have
probably<00:01:23.610> gotten<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.060> different<00:01:24.390> color<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.869> got

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
probably gotten a different color I got

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.210 
probably gotten a different color I got
this<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> bronzy<00:01:26.130> color<00:01:26.390> right<00:01:27.390> now<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
this kind of bronzy color right now and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
this kind of bronzy color right now and
to<00:01:29.220> me<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.520> actually<00:01:29.670> almost<00:01:29.970> looks<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.390> little

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
to me it actually almost looks a little

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.330 
to me it actually almost looks a little
bit<00:01:30.810> dirty<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.189> was

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
bit dirty and that's not what I was

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010 
bit dirty and that's not what I was
going<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.420> thought<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
going for but I thought it would be a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.270 
going for but I thought it would be a
good<00:01:34.200> color<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> thought<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.950> would<00:01:35.130> go

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
good color because I thought it would go

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.530 
good color because I thought it would go
with<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> lot<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> different<00:01:35.820> clothes<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
with a lot of different clothes and I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
with a lot of different clothes and I
wouldn't<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> worry<00:01:37.170> about<00:01:37.290> colors

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
wouldn't have to worry about colors

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
wouldn't have to worry about colors
clashing<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.869> way<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> they<00:01:40.290> do

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
clashing so I'm the way that they do

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.590 
clashing so I'm the way that they do
these<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.340> any<00:01:41.369> other<00:01:41.670> gel<00:01:42.270> nails

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.149 
these is just like any other gel nails
this<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.439> actually<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.860> polish<00:01:44.399> its<00:01:45.530> gel<00:01:46.530> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
this is actually not polish its gel it's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
this is actually not polish its gel it's
the<00:01:47.340> powder<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.240> gel<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that's a bronzy sparkly powder and then

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230 
that's a bronzy sparkly powder and then
um<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> whole<00:01:53.610> thing<00:01:53.640> they<00:01:54.030> kind
