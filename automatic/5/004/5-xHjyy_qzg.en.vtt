00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 miracle the invasion of iraq was due 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.460
 two factors first concerns weapons 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.349
 mass destruction 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.639
 There is an opinion that hardliners 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.309
 in the bush administration 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.379
 white house vice president imposed on us 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.660
 this position is a myth 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.119
 we really thought that at saddam 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.859
 there are chemical weapons opportunities for 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.199
 making biological weapons 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.480
 that he plans to resume nuclear 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.240
 the program was not necessary 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.270
 impose on us these ideas we thought so 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.969
 even before bush became president my 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.620
 Clinton reported all this information 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.700
 such was our beliefs and it 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 turned out to be wrong 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.710
 if I brought all the documents here with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.870
 information that came in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.360
 intelligence services and gave you the opportunity 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.700
 view the paper you would also come to 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.010
 concluded that Saddam Hussein had a weapon 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.199
 mass destruction you also said 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.989
 would that all the evidence is essentially 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.590
 indirect many data has been collected yet 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.629
 until 1998 when the un commission 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.850
 observing the destruction of weapons 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.760
 left the country and one of the key 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 moments in this case the fact is that in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.840
 his disposal once really 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.840
 was a weapon of mass destruction and he 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.930
 applied it against iran and its own 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.390
 people you would come to this conclusion but 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.340
 our mistake was to follow us 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.380
 it was necessary to say mister president we 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.960
 We think that Saddam Hussein has a weapon 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.909
 mass destruction but we are not sure 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.310
 one hundred percent because all these 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.680
 the data is absolutely convincing 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 it would be a completely different groove and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.110
 question that is asked to all candidates for 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.270
 presidency if you knew something 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 we know today would you begin 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.119
 war in iraq the question is not entirely relevant 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.200
 and because with hindsight we are all strong 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.549
 context in which you had to act 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.710
 President Bush 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.229
 I don't want to justify now or 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.540
 condemn made and then the decision is simple 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.969
 I will describe the situation at all 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.149
 The September 11 terrorist attack recently took place. 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.229
 which killed three thousand people 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.700
 primary responsibility of the us president 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.550
 protect your people 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.690
 Cheese tells him that Saddam Hussein 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.240
 there are weapons of mass destruction 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.760
 the enemy of the united states 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.650
 enemy of the united states and this man 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.080
 supported by international 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.540
 political organizations not al-qaida 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.630
 but to the Palestinian factions which 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.580
 organized terrorist attacks in Israel 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.400
 the president thinks that's the enemy he has 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.280
 weapons of mass destruction cheese reports 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.480
 that he will create nuclear weapons he 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.280
 direct him against us 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.360
 or she will fall into the hands of terrorists 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.320
 who will apply it again against us 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.080
 that was the context 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.120
 After all, not only the president, not only he 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.640
 ultimately leaned toward the idea that this 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.170
 the only correct step was also decided 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.820
 and most congress members 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.940
 acquainted with all the circumstances 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.010
 with context as i said it was two 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.990
 main decision makers on iraq 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.140
 the first is associated with weapons of mass 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.410
 defeat 2 with the relationship between 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.820
 iraq and al-qaida have some connection 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.270
 between iraq and al-qaida 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.730
 after the events of September 11, 2001 it 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.280
 there was a legitimate question which 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.980
 all asked themselves whether there is a connection between 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.040
 iraq and al-qaida are there any links between 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.440
 Iran and al-Qaida after long 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.420
 clarifying the many ups and downs 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.300
 we finally come to the conclusion that bye 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.520
 the relationship between Iraq and al-Qaeda is not Iraq 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.080
 did not help al-qaida with the organization 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.540
 September 11 attacks 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.140
 iraq couldn't predict these 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.380
 developments 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.330
 iraq did not support him 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.340
 some members have made such a statement 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.070
 administrations began to put pressure on us 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.019
 mention may be worth while to recall Che You 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.989
 analyze the situation again 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.480
 it seems to us that you are mistaken they are so on us 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.489
 put pressure on me being an analyst at all 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.310
 first encountered such pressure 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.920
 but we stood our ground we did 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.640
 then what is expected from us taxpayers for 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.600
 what are they paying 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.150
 that there is something just like a judge 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.330
 Penalty points in baseball and. 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.090
 and the president supported us vice president 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.820
 and his entourage have put pressure but 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.950
 the president supported he told us i know 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.950
 what is weighing on you a lot but i want to 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.230
 you played honestly and further after the events 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.750
 September 11th we fight effectively 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.480
 terrorism but there is another in this war 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.000
 component ideological as not 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.550
 allow radicalization of youth as 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.710
 stop this process there is already a speech 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.420
 goes about the long term because 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.820
 it comes to social and economic 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.520
 and political issues as well 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.520
 religious issues and here we are 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.810
 play an extremely minor role in 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.060
 religiously we have no 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.490
 authority because we do not know everyone 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.260
 subtleties of Islam these topics should 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.720
 discuss Islamic religious figures 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.050
 and Muslims themselves are preachers with 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.520
 believers teachers with students 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.370
 so in this component of the war with 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.590
 terrorism we have not succeeded there is no 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.930
 doubt that counterterrorism 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.150
 us operations lead to additional 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.860
 radicalization of the population I do not 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.020
 came across studies in which 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.080
 specific statistics would be contained 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.990
 but there is no doubt about it 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.580
 the question is what are our options 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.680
 I have already talked about the terrorists who 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.510
 aim to kill us and with which you need 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.460
 do something if you use 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.980
 bombers collateral losses 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.160
 will be more or less more 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.110
 and if you use cruise missiles too 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.880
 more and if you send there 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.830
 US special forces 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.770
 it means risking our lives 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.390
 soldier get drone the most 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.550
 effective weapon to fight 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.190
 al-qaida which we have ever had 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.200
 I am absolutely sure that with their help we 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.850
 prevented the attack in the usa and western 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.740
 Europe, I do not doubt it 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.990
 UAVs are the most accurate weapons in 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.920
 our arsenal 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.560
 collateral damage when using them 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.740
 certainly not zero but close to zero 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.710
 yes there is information of great attendant 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.140
 damage and she is exaggerated from where she is 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.060
 This propaganda is taken by those 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.340
 who wants us to turn their 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.340
 military operations including al-qaida
