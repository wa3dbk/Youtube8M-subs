00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.490 
did not even play the second half
because<00:02:01.490> God<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> would<00:02:03.000> hate<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.329> us<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
because God I would hate to us in it so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
because God I would hate to us in it so
so<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.579> say<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.180> bit<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.600> face<00:02:06.780> on

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so you say that a little bit of face on

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.199 
so you say that a little bit of face on
that<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.670> realistically<00:02:08.670> people<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.090> going

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that but realistically people is going

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.360 
that but realistically people is going
to<00:02:09.270> look<00:02:09.390> back<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.569> say<00:02:10.220> Louisville<00:02:11.220> got

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to look back and say Louisville got

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.230 
to look back and say Louisville got
dominated<00:02:11.849> when<00:02:12.120> Randall<00:02:12.510> didn't<00:02:12.750> even<00:02:12.959> play

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
dominated when Randall didn't even play

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.990
