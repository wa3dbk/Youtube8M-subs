then<00:00:11.309> downloading<00:00:12.309> a<00:00:13.139> project<00:00:14.139> called<00:00:14.379> bunny

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
then downloading a project called bunny

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.770 
then downloading a project called bunny
mark<00:00:15.309> and<00:00:15.489> then<00:00:15.610> running<00:00:15.789> that<00:00:16.059> on<00:00:16.090> the<00:00:16.390> iOS

so<00:00:35.980> we'll<00:00:36.399> be<00:00:36.550> downloading<00:00:37.149> the<00:00:37.329> Mac<00:00:38.079> a<00:00:38.409> zip

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
so we'll be downloading the Mac a zip

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.430 
so we'll be downloading the Mac a zip
file<00:00:39.309> and<00:00:39.579> then<00:00:40.449> I've<00:00:40.870> already<00:00:41.079> gone<00:00:41.289> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.439 

alright<00:00:59.739> so<00:01:00.010> that's<00:01:00.159> done<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:00.909> the<00:01:01.059> next<00:01:01.239> bit

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
alright so that's done so the next bit

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.200 
alright so that's done so the next bit
of<00:01:01.539> software<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.049> need<00:01:02.289> is<00:01:03.030> Xcode

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
of software you need is Xcode

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.080 
of software you need is Xcode
so<00:01:04.480> you<00:01:04.570> can<00:01:04.720> just<00:01:04.900> get<00:01:05.080> that<00:01:05.260> from<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.090> iTunes

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
so you can just get that from the iTunes

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.070 
so you can just get that from the iTunes
Mac<00:01:07.540> store<00:01:07.900> it's<00:01:08.560> just<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.860> free<00:01:09.070> download<00:01:09.550> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
Mac store it's just a free download and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.660 
Mac store it's just a free download and
I've<00:01:11.080> also<00:01:11.260> already<00:01:11.530> gone<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.040> downloaded

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
I've also already gone and downloaded

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.610 
I've also already gone and downloaded
and<00:01:12.820> installed<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.420> again<00:01:14.140> it's<00:01:14.320> pretty

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
and installed that again it's pretty

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.650 
and installed that again it's pretty
simple<00:01:15.040> so<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.310> don't<00:01:15.850> need<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.120> explain<00:01:16.210> that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
simple so I don't need to explain that

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.410 
simple so I don't need to explain that
and<00:01:16.900> then<00:01:17.800> let's<00:01:18.190> go<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.550> bunny<00:01:18.850> mark<00:01:20.250> just

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.350 

just<00:01:25.420> look<00:01:25.600> for<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.950> at<00:01:30.100> this<00:01:30.220> so<00:01:30.970> this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
just look for it there at this so this

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.180 
just look for it there at this so this
is<00:01:31.800> enemy<00:01:32.800> bunny<00:01:33.040> mark<00:01:33.310> it's<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:34.950> nice<00:01:35.950> little

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
is enemy bunny mark it's a nice little

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.870 
is enemy bunny mark it's a nice little
benchmark<00:01:37.030> for<00:01:37.390> enemy<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:39.160> see<00:01:39.310> how<00:01:39.460> fast<00:01:39.700> it

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
benchmark for enemy to see how fast it

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.880 
benchmark for enemy to see how fast it
can<00:01:40.030> render<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:41.080> we'll<00:01:41.230> just<00:01:41.410> go<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.710> download

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
can render so we'll just go and download

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.020 
can render so we'll just go and download
the<00:01:42.430> zip<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.790> that<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:45.130> I've<00:01:45.580> ready<00:01:45.790> go

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
the zip of that and then I've ready go

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.770 
the zip of that and then I've ready go
and<00:01:46.740> extract<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:47.980> to<00:01:48.010> my<00:01:48.250> desktop<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.060> that's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
and extract it to my desktop so that's

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.660 
and extract it to my desktop so that's
like<00:01:49.990> all<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.290> software<00:01:50.830> he<00:01:50.980> now<00:01:51.130> needs<00:01:51.370> so

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
like all the software he now needs so

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.350 
like all the software he now needs so
let's<00:01:51.850> open<00:01:51.970> up<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.450> terminal<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.850> just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
let's open up a terminal and we just

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.320 
let's open up a terminal and we just
need<00:01:55.510> to<00:01:55.630> make<00:01:55.780> sure<00:01:56.020> we<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.880> commands<00:01:58.180> were

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
need to make sure we the commands were

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.430 
need to make sure we the commands were
about<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.630> run<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:58.960> want<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.200> run<00:01:59.440> them<00:01:59.680> in<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
about to run we want to run them in the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.240 
about to run we want to run them in the
folder<00:02:02.440> where<00:02:02.640> m<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.670> n<00:02:04.050> m<00:02:05.050> ml<00:02:05.440> file<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.980> so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
folder where m and n m ml file is so

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.680 
folder where m and n m ml file is so
we'll<00:02:06.400> just<00:02:06.580> change<00:02:06.790> into<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.240> bunny<00:02:07.420> mark

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
we'll just change into the bunny mark

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.809 
we'll just change into the bunny mark
directory<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.649> can<00:02:08.679> see<00:02:09.039> we've<00:02:09.220> got<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.550> bill

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
directory you can see we've got a bill

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.650 
directory you can see we've got a bill
dot<00:02:10.149> n<00:02:10.360> ml<00:02:11.080> file<00:02:11.470> there<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.160> so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
dot n ml file there and so

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.810 
dot n ml file there and so
then<00:02:13.960> all<00:02:14.110> we<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.560> do<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:15.040> type<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
then all we have to do is type the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.320 
then all we have to do is type the
commands<00:02:16.810> enemy<00:02:17.520> tests<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.730> then<00:02:19.150> in

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
commands enemy tests and then in

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.650 
commands enemy tests and then in
quotations<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.620> name<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.450> mail

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
quotations the name of that in a mail

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.800 
quotations the name of that in a mail
file<00:02:23.130> then<00:02:24.130> we<00:02:24.160> won't<00:02:24.610> be<00:02:24.670> targeting<00:02:25.120> iOS<00:02:25.510> and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
file then we won't be targeting iOS and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.490 
file then we won't be targeting iOS and
the<00:02:25.990> simulator<00:02:27.570> if<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.750> were<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.260> do

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the simulator if you were to just do

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.040 
the simulator if you were to just do
type<00:02:30.340> build<00:02:30.670> instead<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.150> test<00:02:31.390> then<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> would

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
type build instead of test then it would

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.110 
type build instead of test then it would
just<00:02:32.080> compile<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.980> Xcode<00:02:33.430> project<00:02:33.610> because

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
just compile the Xcode project because

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.170 
just compile the Xcode project because
we're<00:02:34.240> doing<00:02:34.420> test<00:02:34.690> it's<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.800> then<00:02:36.180> run

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
we're doing test it's going to then run

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.690 
we're doing test it's going to then run
the<00:02:37.330> X<00:02:37.810> compile<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.590> Xcode<00:02:38.950> project<00:02:39.100> for<00:02:39.580> us

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the X compile the Xcode project for us

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.470 
the X compile the Xcode project for us
and<00:02:39.970> hopefully<00:02:40.480> open<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.800> simulator<00:02:42.480> so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
and hopefully open up the simulator so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.370 
and hopefully open up the simulator so
just<00:02:44.230> like<00:02:44.640> when<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.820> compile<00:02:46.750> for<00:02:46.930> Android

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
just like when you compile for Android

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.040 
just like when you compile for Android
takes<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.800> little<00:02:47.920> bit<00:02:48.070> of<00:02:48.130> time<00:02:49.120> initially<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
takes a little bit of time initially to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.560 
takes a little bit of time initially to
when<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.680> first<00:02:50.890> compile<00:02:51.390> but<00:02:52.390> shouldn't

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
when you first compile but shouldn't

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:03.230 
when you first compile but shouldn't
take<00:02:52.750> too<00:02:52.780> long

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.400 

all<00:03:03.840> right<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.290> that's<00:03:04.530> done<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.130> yep<00:03:05.730> up<00:03:06.410> pops

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
all right so that's done and yep up pops

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.680 
all right so that's done and yep up pops
bunny<00:03:07.950> mark<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.550> iOS<00:03:08.970> simulator<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.570> you

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
bunny mark on the iOS simulator and you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.690 
bunny mark on the iOS simulator and you
can<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.990> actually<00:03:10.050> runs<00:03:10.440> pretty<00:03:11.100> well<00:03:11.250> on

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
can see it actually runs pretty well on

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.940 
can see it actually runs pretty well on
the<00:03:11.910> simulator<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:14.640> yes<00:03:14.880> if<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.500> want<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.680> then

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
the simulator so yes if you want to then

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
the simulator so yes if you want to then
try<00:03:17.670> running<00:03:18.060> on<00:03:18.270> android<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> look<00:03:19.620> at<00:03:19.710> my

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
try running on android have a look at my

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.360 
try running on android have a look at my
android<00:03:20.970> video<00:03:21.180> because<00:03:21.720> there's<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.680> couple

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
android video because there's a couple

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.040 
android video because there's a couple
of<00:03:23.580> other<00:03:23.730> things<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.270> had<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.570> do<00:03:24.720> for<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:24.990> I

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
of other things we had to do for that I

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.880 
of other things we had to do for that I
haven't<00:03:25.290> tried<00:03:25.410> running<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.860> on<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.010> Mac<00:03:26.310> but

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
haven't tried running it on a Mac but

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.140 
haven't tried running it on a Mac but
there's<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.980> dll<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.670> you'll<00:03:29.790> probably<00:03:29.940> have

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
there's a dll that you'll probably have

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.740 
there's a dll that you'll probably have
to<00:03:30.210> rename<00:03:30.540> anyway<00:03:31.260> thank<00:03:31.620> you
