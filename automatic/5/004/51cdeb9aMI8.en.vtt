quite warm you can see here white

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.839 
quite warm you can see here white

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
balance indicating a lot of red up there

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.849 
balance indicating a lot of red up there
so<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.240> roads<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:27.930> yellow<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:28.710> we

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
press the AV button we bring up the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.420 
press the AV button we bring up the
quick<00:00:33.030> menu<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> middle

quick menu and you see in the middle
push<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.059> white<00:00:36.239> balance<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.750> push<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> set

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
push for white balance I push the set

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
push for white balance I push the set
button<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.250> takes<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.640> white<00:00:38.820> balance<00:00:39.210> from

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
button and it takes a white balance from

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060 
button and it takes a white balance from
whatever<00:00:39.600> features<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> foreground<00:00:40.829> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
whatever features in the foreground I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
whatever features in the foreground I
try<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> white<00:00:41.910> roof<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.480> gray<00:00:42.780> roof

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
try to get the white roof or gray roof

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.080 
try to get the white roof or gray roof
and<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> road<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.610> much

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and now you can see the road is much

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.319 
and now you can see the road is much
better<00:00:49.039> next<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:50.910> at<00:00:51.000> frames

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
better next up we have a look at frames

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.110 
better next up we have a look at frames
per<00:00:51.629> second<00:00:52.050> override<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.980> time-lapse<00:00:53.579> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
per second override for time-lapse so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.110 
per second override for time-lapse so
instead<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.480> using<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.140> shutter<00:00:55.500> counter<00:00:56.120> with

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
instead of using a shutter counter with

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.209 
instead of using a shutter counter with
the<00:00:57.149> shutter<00:00:57.510> constantly<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> down

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the shutter constantly going up and down

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.959 
the shutter constantly going up and down
up<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.730> down

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
up and down

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.240 
up and down
taking<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> new<00:01:00.539> photos<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.770> simply

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
taking the new photos you can simply

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.520 
taking the new photos you can simply
remap<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.439> frames<00:01:04.580> recorded<00:01:05.580> per<00:01:05.729> second

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
remap the frames recorded per second

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.480 
remap the frames recorded per second
into<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.619> video<00:01:07.860> file

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
into a video file

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
into a video file
so<00:01:08.909> I've<00:01:09.030> wound<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:09.600> down<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> 3<00:01:10.200> frames

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
so I've wound it right down to 3 frames

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.130 
so I've wound it right down to 3 frames
per<00:01:10.770> second<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.880> pop<00:01:15.150> into<00:01:15.509> record<00:01:15.990> mode

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
per second and we pop into record mode

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.109 
per second and we pop into record mode
and<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.909> it's

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and you can see that because it's

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
and you can see that because it's
saturating<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> sensor<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.560> light<00:01:19.799> we

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
saturating the sensor with more light we

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.210 
saturating the sensor with more light we
have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> wind<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.060> iris<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:22.799> I'll<00:01:23.040> just

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
have to wind down the iris so I'll just

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.280 
have to wind down the iris so I'll just
put<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.520> finger<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> AV<00:01:24.540> button<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
put my finger on the AV button there and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.810 
put my finger on the AV button there and
I'm<00:01:25.350> taking<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.979> Whichard<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.729> f-22

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.830 

hit<00:01:30.390> record<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> starts<00:01:33.720> off

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
hit record you can see it starts off

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.490 
hit record you can see it starts off
dark<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.500> picks<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.159> light<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.500> eventually

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
dark as it picks up light and eventually

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.290 
dark as it picks up light and eventually
it<00:01:37.800> records<00:01:38.310> slow<00:01:39.120> slurry<00:01:39.720> flat<00:01:40.170> frames<00:01:41.300> and

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
it records slow slurry flat frames and

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.359 
it records slow slurry flat frames and
when<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.570> play<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:43.020> back<00:01:43.260> of<00:01:43.890> course<00:01:44.160> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
when you play them back of course you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300 
when you play them back of course you
get<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.580> much<00:01:44.820> faster<00:01:45.300> playback<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:47.130> very

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
get a much faster playback it's very

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.330 
get a much faster playback it's very
difficult<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.760> stand<00:01:47.940> still<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.600> while<00:01:48.660> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
difficult to stand still for a while and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.430 
difficult to stand still for a while and
record<00:01:50.340> time-lapse<00:01:50.940> I'm<00:01:51.900> not<00:01:52.110> much<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.259> a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
record time-lapse I'm not much of a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.420 
record time-lapse I'm not much of a
tripod<00:01:54.229> okay<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.920> playback

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
tripod okay so here we go with playback

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.930 
tripod okay so here we go with playback
that's<00:01:57.270> much<00:01:57.600> quicker<00:01:58.790> Shh

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.300 

now<00:02:02.940> I<00:02:03.300> thought<00:02:03.960> what<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.590> join<00:02:05.009> two

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
now I thought what about we join two

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
now I thought what about we join two
features<00:02:05.850> together<00:02:06.000> frames<00:02:06.660> per<00:02:06.840> second

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
features together frames per second

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.740 
features together frames per second
override<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.710> ISO<00:02:08.160> reduction<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
override and ISO reduction that is to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.920 
override and ISO reduction that is to
reduce<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.500> brightness<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> image<00:02:12.030> where

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
reduce the brightness of the image where

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.780 
reduce the brightness of the image where
there<00:02:13.080> are<00:02:13.200> overexposed<00:02:13.830> regions<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
there are overexposed regions like the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.140 
there are overexposed regions like the
sky<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:16.080> there's<00:02:16.380> actually<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:17.070> large<00:02:17.790> wheel

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
sky now there's actually a large wheel

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.420 
sky now there's actually a large wheel
