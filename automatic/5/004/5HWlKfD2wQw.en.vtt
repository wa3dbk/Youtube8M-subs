power off your device so let's go ahead

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.620 
power off your device so let's go ahead

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
and do that and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.230 
and do that and
before<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.230> do<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.440> next<00:02:33.680> step<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:35.210> next

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
before we do the next step and the next

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.090 
before we do the next step and the next
step<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.720> putting<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.050> in<00:02:36.140> dfu<00:02:36.290> mode<00:02:36.620> which<00:02:37.070> is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
step is putting it in dfu mode which is

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.450 
step is putting it in dfu mode which is
I<00:02:37.520> guess<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.180> trickiest<00:02:38.510> step<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.040> all<00:02:40.250> that

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
I guess the trickiest step and all that

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.090 
I guess the trickiest step and all that
entails<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:41.540> holding<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.440> power<00:02:42.590> button<00:02:42.710> down

for<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.440> ipad<00:04:18.799> too<00:04:19.370> soon<00:04:20.140> looking<00:04:21.140> forward<00:04:21.380> to

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
for the ipad too soon looking forward to

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.600 
for the ipad too soon looking forward to
that

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.760 

and<00:04:27.720> probably<00:04:28.720> stop<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.139> video<00:04:29.229> here<00:04:29.410> for<00:04:29.740> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
and probably stop the video here for a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.559 
and probably stop the video here for a
minute<00:04:29.919> and<00:04:30.099> just<00:04:30.160> show<00:04:30.789> you<00:04:30.849> how<00:04:31.000> city<00:04:31.300> is<00:04:31.449> on

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
minute and just show you how city is on

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.689 
minute and just show you how city is on
it<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.840> it's<00:04:31.960> on<00:04:32.139> four<00:04:32.979> point<00:04:33.460> three<00:04:33.490> point

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
it and it's on four point three point

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.230 
it and it's on four point three point
one<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.409> then<00:04:35.409> just<00:04:35.800> restyling<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.729> apps<00:04:36.909> and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
one and then just restyling the apps and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:05:31.050 
one and then just restyling the apps and
it's<00:04:37.599> just<00:04:37.780> like<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.080> was

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.570 

sorry<00:05:31.720> this<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.050> very<00:05:32.230> exciting<00:05:32.410> but<00:05:32.950> just

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
sorry this is a very exciting but just

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.920 
sorry this is a very exciting but just
figured<00:05:33.820> I'd<00:05:33.880> let<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.120> whole<00:05:34.210> thing<00:05:34.240> run<00:05:34.630> just

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
figured I'd let the whole thing run just

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.030 
figured I'd let the whole thing run just
so<00:05:35.020> you<00:05:35.080> can<00:05:35.200> see<00:05:35.350> how<00:05:35.380> it<00:05:35.500> takes<00:05:35.740> probably

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
so you can see how it takes probably

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.550 
so you can see how it takes probably
about<00:05:36.450> three<00:05:37.450> minutes<00:05:37.660> maybe<00:05:37.990> four<00:05:38.290> minutes

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
about three minutes maybe four minutes

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:48.540 
about three minutes maybe four minutes
and<00:05:38.770> be<00:05:39.220> done<00:05:39.400> I<00:05:46.680> photos<00:05:47.680> popping<00:05:48.190> up<00:05:48.310> here<00:05:48.460> in

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
and be done I photos popping up here in

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.430 
and be done I photos popping up here in
the<00:05:48.610> background<00:05:49.060> so<00:05:50.100> that's<00:05:51.100> good<00:05:52.440> divide

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
the background so that's good divide

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.980 
the background so that's good divide
slide<00:05:53.770> unlock<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:56.700> where<00:05:57.700> is<00:05:57.970> it<00:05:58.180> say<00:05:58.810> or

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
slide unlock and where is it say or

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.659 
slide unlock and where is it say or
cydia<00:06:02.340> so<00:06:03.340> you<00:06:03.460> can<00:06:03.610> see<00:06:03.790> that's<00:06:04.570> there<00:06:04.870> and

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
cydia so you can see that's there and

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.950 
cydia so you can see that's there and
I'll<00:06:06.669> just<00:06:06.910> go<00:06:07.060> ahead<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:09.510> let<00:06:10.510> that<00:06:10.660> open

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
I'll just go ahead and let that open

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.930 
I'll just go ahead and let that open
then<00:06:11.260> I'll<00:06:11.380> show<00:06:11.410> that<00:06:11.830> I<00:06:12.280> am<00:06:12.639> on<00:06:12.850> the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
then I'll show that I am on the

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.780 
then I'll show that I am on the
four-point<00:06:13.360> 3.1<00:06:13.930> firmware<00:06:17.639> it's<00:06:18.639> actually

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
four-point 3.1 firmware it's actually

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.480 
four-point 3.1 firmware it's actually
takes<00:06:19.240> video<00:06:19.600> a<00:06:19.950> decent<00:06:20.950> amount<00:06:21.010> of<00:06:21.160> time<00:06:21.340> to

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
takes video a decent amount of time to

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:31.710 
takes video a decent amount of time to
open<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.790> first<00:06:22.030> time<00:06:22.240> so

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:39.560 

and<00:06:32.350> the<00:06:32.440> user<00:06:32.620> yeah<00:06:32.950> I<00:06:32.980> think<00:06:33.930> and<00:06:36.420> Bhutan<00:06:37.420> and

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
and the user yeah I think and Bhutan and

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:47.310 
and the user yeah I think and Bhutan and
there<00:06:40.570> you<00:06:40.750> go<00:06:40.780> there<00:06:41.650> it<00:06:41.800> is<00:06:45.900> and<00:06:46.900> be<00:06:47.140> sure<00:06:47.170> to

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
there you go there it is and be sure to

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.400 
there you go there it is and be sure to
pack<00:06:47.560> up<00:06:47.770> here<00:06:48.040> on<00:06:48.190> SHSH<00:06:49.060> blobs<00:06:49.090> for<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:50.320> new

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
pack up here on SHSH blobs for the new

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.220 
pack up here on SHSH blobs for the new
firmware<00:06:50.620> and<00:06:51.070> you<00:06:51.460> also<00:06:51.720> might<00:06:52.720> want<00:06:52.780> to<00:06:53.140> go

you've<00:06:57.940> every<00:06:58.330> jailbroken<00:07:00.210> about<00:07:01.210> a<00:07:01.570> consume

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290 
you've every jailbroken about a consume

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.790 
you've every jailbroken about a consume
that<00:07:03.420> clearly<00:07:04.420> we're<00:07:04.780> on<00:07:04.900> the<00:07:05.050> four<00:07:05.560> point

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
that clearly we're on the four point

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.820 
that clearly we're on the four point
three<00:07:05.860> point<00:07:06.010> one<00:07:06.280> so<00:07:06.790> that's<00:07:07.150> pretty<00:07:07.390> much<00:07:07.480> it

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830
