00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:26.300
 made out of nowhere 'circle in the raw color with 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:31.270
 crochet needle to 3 mm 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:36.879
 let's make our initial fit man 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.879
 and another 29 chains 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.220
 like 29 chains we will start the 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.650
 career 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.540
 one two three chains to start 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.770
 height from the high point our first 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.390
 Hight point 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.500
 let's throw the thread enter on the fourth 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:14.020
 from the needle and make the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.580
 second high point tie the wire 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.820
 enter in the same place 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.090
 the third high point 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.649
 we made three high points inside the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.990
 first wire we will throw the wire 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:35.050
 on the next 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:39.340
 repeat the group with three high points 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.830
 second high point in the same place 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.380
 third high point 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.390
 Let's pass the wire insert in the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:54.130
 the front chain and repeat the group 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.130
 with three high points 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.500
 thread the cord into the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.380
 the front chain and repeat the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.770
 group a high point 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.740
 insert the second point in the same place 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.040
 high places in the same place 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.690
 the third high point let's do this 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.410
 three high points within each 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:33.019
 until the end of your career. 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:38.709
 to stay like this, we arrived at the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:43.360
 career with three points high on the last 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:47.750
 Let's run the wire and pull 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.610
 cut our wire here for the finish 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:58.280
 Do you realize that the crochet is rolled up? 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:01.850
 alone with your sale 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.019
 Let's just wrap our crochet with 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:14.870
 the right side facing us, let's go 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:18.829
 simply roll to roll us 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.690
 You can either punch the 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:28.130
 sewing needle or use the glue to 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:32.690
 fabric that I believe to be more 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.850
 It is practical to glue to fabric 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.170
 needle 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.739
 there are many models of flowers 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.959
 coiled 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.400
 this model is one of the simplest and most 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.829
 beautiful 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.100
 you may be applying your 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:56.739
 flower with several leaves in 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:01.070
 groups or in isolation may be 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:06.250
 mixing with the large flowers or until 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.250
 even replacing the buttons
