is<00:01:30.450> such<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> fantastic<00:01:31.380> director<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.920> does<00:01:32.070> all

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
is such a fantastic director he does all

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.370 
is such a fantastic director he does all
that<00:01:32.369> hard<00:01:32.610> work<00:01:32.700> behind<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> scenes<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that hard work behind the scenes and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.320 
that hard work behind the scenes and
then<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> comes<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> our<00:01:35.400> stuff<00:01:35.700> he

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
then when it comes to our stuff he

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330 
then when it comes to our stuff he
focuses<00:01:36.720> entirely<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> acting<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.979> he

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
focuses entirely on the acting and so he

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
focuses entirely on the acting and so he
didn't<00:01:38.820> involve<00:01:39.030> us<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.420> process<00:01:39.510> at<00:01:39.840> all

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
didn't involve us in that process at all

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.760 
didn't involve us in that process at all
we<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.409> loved

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
we which I loved
