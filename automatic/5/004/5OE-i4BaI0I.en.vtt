00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
around corners so I thought maybe and XR

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.000 
around corners so I thought maybe and XR
1200<00:01:52.140> would<00:01:52.260> be<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> trick<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:52.890> they're

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
1200 would be the trick but they're

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.030
