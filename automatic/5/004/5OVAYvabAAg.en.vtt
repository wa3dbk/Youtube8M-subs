 put pearl we will put color 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.150

 red with mate will not follow long enough 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.350

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.980
 well it stays like this I do not know a common white 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.050
 cream does not look very good then 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.970
 wheels you put brown desert since 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.490

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.770

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.240
 combination still liked quite 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.250
 I do not know whether to stay in the first 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.170

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.690

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.340
 we said that just like matte red 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.650
 brown I do not know what is very good 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.500
 the guys here we have it we're going to 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.600
 the third of today then guys from 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.390
 main we're going to metallized 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.580
 the brown as always in mentalize 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.680
 then once we put it to brown 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.330
 pond we are going we have clarified and going to 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.820
 highlight this brown is worth to be 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.950
 handsome handsome we are going to put him pearly 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.630
 as he is saying black and white vale 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.970
 then when we have already put the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.640
 white ice we go to the secondary to 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.250
 secondary color and we look for the brown 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.990
 of colorado and how the boy starts to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.610
 be a pretty pretty color 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.470
 only with these two combinations of 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.690
 colors that are very easy to make 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.670
 I liked it because I liked it 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.290
 is that it almost becomes golden I do not know 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.480
 now names with that have water water 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.100
 then the wheels you have to leave 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.230
 as the previous color is brown 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.660
 desert and here two guys we already have it 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.400
 the sun is that I do not know if I like this more 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.410
 or the first is worth it that these colors 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.180
 I like them quite enough, you can 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.820
 put the smoke like me and as you see 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.160
 is a very very beautiful color sometimes with 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.980
 the sun because I do not know seems like a golden 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.020
 more off a golden matt I do not know that I 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.430

 that for these two combinations of 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.680
 colors is already being a handsome color 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.600
