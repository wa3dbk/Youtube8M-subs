00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
diet year-round and it wouldn't bother

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.160 
diet year-round and it wouldn't bother
me<00:02:08.710> in<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:08.979> least<00:02:09.070> like<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.850> just<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.330> understand

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
me in the least like I just I understand

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.980

now<00:02:11.350> how<00:02:11.500> John<00:02:12.150> his<00:02:13.150> ripped<00:02:13.450> all<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.660> time

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
now how John his ripped all the time

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.040 
now how John his ripped all the time
it's<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.740> way<00:02:14.920> he<00:02:14.950> had<00:02:15.640> set<00:02:15.970> his<00:02:16.000> metabolism<00:02:16.540> i

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
it's the way he had set his metabolism i

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.480
