to take our wire we're just going to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.230 
to take our wire we're just going to
start<00:01:26.970> wrapping<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.540> around<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.350> body<00:01:32.240> first

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
next thing we need to do is we need to

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.400 
next thing we need to do is we need to
tie<00:03:53.890> in<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:54.250> legs<00:03:58.049> we're<00:03:59.049> just<00:03:59.200> going<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.349> use

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
tie in the legs we're just going to use

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.930 
tie in the legs we're just going to use
some<00:03:59.560> Partridge<00:04:00.160> for<00:04:00.400> this<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.489> just<00:04:03.519> strip

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
some Partridge for this and I just strip

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.500 
some Partridge for this and I just strip
off<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.739> few<00:04:05.739> fibers<00:04:06.220> for<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.519> legs<00:04:06.760> just<00:04:07.360> like

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
off a few fibers for the legs just like

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.330 
off a few fibers for the legs just like
so<00:04:08.099> we're<00:04:09.099> going<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.310> tie<00:04:09.459> those<00:04:09.730> in<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:12.220> each

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
so we're going to tie those in on each

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.830 
so we're going to tie those in on each
side<00:04:12.580> usually<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.060> just<00:04:13.150> leave<00:04:13.480> them<00:04:13.599> kind<00:04:13.810> of

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
side usually I just leave them kind of

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.830 
side usually I just leave them kind of
long<00:04:14.049> at<00:04:14.260> first<00:04:15.000> my<00:04:16.000> first<00:04:16.180> time<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.720> just

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
long at first my first time and just

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.520 
long at first my first time and just
like<00:04:17.079> that

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
like that

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.140 
like that
oopsie<00:04:18.540> do<00:04:19.540> that<00:04:19.720> again<00:04:19.870> here<00:04:20.729> time<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:21.940> long

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
oopsie do that again here time and long

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.280 
oopsie do that again here time and long
and<00:04:22.389> then<00:04:22.479> what<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:22.690> can<00:04:22.720> do<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.169> can

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
and then what you can do is you can

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.810 
and then what you can do is you can
actually<00:04:23.650> pull<00:04:25.530> pull<00:04:26.530> them<00:04:26.740> pull<00:04:27.370> them<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.729> the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
actually pull pull them pull them to the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.629 
actually pull pull them pull them to the
length<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.630> want<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.070> just<00:04:30.220> take<00:04:30.460> them

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
length that you want so I just take them

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.510 
length that you want so I just take them
and<00:04:33.450> pull<00:04:34.450> them<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.870> desired<00:04:35.650> length<00:04:35.950> got

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
and pull them to the desired length got

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.800 
and pull them to the desired length got
to<00:04:36.580> be<00:04:36.639> careful<00:04:36.789> not<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.120> make<00:04:37.300> them<00:04:37.389> too<00:04:37.450> long

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
to be careful not to make them too long

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:47.659 
to be careful not to make them too long
I<00:04:40.260> do<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.440> on<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.860> other<00:04:42.130> side<00:04:42.490> as<00:04:42.669> well

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
and you got to be careful not to overdo

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.480 
and you got to be careful not to overdo
it<00:04:49.960> here<00:04:50.229> you<00:04:50.350> don't<00:04:50.440> want<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.740> make<00:04:51.130> them<00:04:51.280> too

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
it here you don't want to make them too

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.480 
it here you don't want to make them too
leggy<00:04:51.760> just<00:04:52.270> enough<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:55.860> give<00:04:56.860> them<00:04:56.950> some<00:04:57.190> legs
