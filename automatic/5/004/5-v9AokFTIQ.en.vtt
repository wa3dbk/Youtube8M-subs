00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
that this series is the writer took like

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.140 
that this series is the writer took like

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
because the characters it seems are

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.340 
because the characters it seems are
pretty<00:03:19.060> there<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.630> there<00:03:20.810> not<00:03:20.959> that

have their own ideology and I all know
it<00:03:36.080> did<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.670> mean<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:38.030> could<00:03:38.209> see<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.570> from<00:03:38.720> the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
it did it I mean I could see it from the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.990 
it did it I mean I could see it from the
beginning<00:03:39.019> use<00:03:39.890> kind<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.400> like<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.760> but<00:03:40.970> I

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
beginning use kind of like that but I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.460 
beginning use kind of like that but I
was<00:03:41.180> hoping<00:03:41.330> like<00:03:41.690> as<00:03:41.900> we<00:03:42.080> get<00:03:42.260> more

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
was hoping like as we get more

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.610 
was hoping like as we get more
characters<00:03:43.310> in<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:43.580> it<00:03:44.480> would<00:03:44.660> balance

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
characters in that it would balance

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.830 
characters in that it would balance
itself<00:03:46.100> out<00:03:46.220> because<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.880> mean<00:03:47.090> having<00:03:47.630> a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
itself out because I mean having a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.759 
itself out because I mean having a
cliche<00:03:48.290> hero<00:03:49.040> grip<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.610> fine<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:51.230> is<00:03:51.380> if<00:03:51.590> the

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
cliche hero grip is fine this is if the

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.620 
cliche hero grip is fine this is if the
support<00:03:52.220> characters<00:03:52.730> are<00:03:52.880> not<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.239> cliche

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
support characters are not that cliche

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.420 
support characters are not that cliche
then<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.019> kind<00:03:54.230> of<00:03:54.290> draws<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.739> in<00:03:54.950> they're

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
then it kind of draws you in they're

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.070 
then it kind of draws you in they're
taking<00:03:55.580> too<00:03:55.940> much<00:03:56.120> from<00:03:56.330> other<00:03:56.510> things<00:03:56.870> they

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
taking too much from other things they
