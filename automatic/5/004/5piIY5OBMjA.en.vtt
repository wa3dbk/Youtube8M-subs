00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.900
 It is said that you never really know yourself, 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.400
 until they are deprived of liberty. 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.200
 I wonder. 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.000
 How well do you know yourself? 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.700
 Sentenced! Proceed to the reception area. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.100
 626 convicted 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.700
 Killer! 

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.601
 Buccaneer! 

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:26.202
 Traitor! 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.600
 You can leave freely. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.300
 But as you soon experience, 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.300
 even freedom has its price! 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800
 Fighting clothing locked and closed. 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.600
 He will carry his jail with him. 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.600
 This bloodshed will be your new cell. 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
 Don't make a mistake! 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.200
 War is coming, 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.900
 with all its glory, 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.900
 and with all the horrors. 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.500
 Mr. Findley, 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.600
 your freedom is waiting. 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.800
 Hell has had time.
