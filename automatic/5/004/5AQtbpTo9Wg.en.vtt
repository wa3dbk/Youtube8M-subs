happen but um now maybe it's getting
more<00:01:03.100> beneficial<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.940> consider<00:01:04.299> it<00:01:04.479> button<00:01:05.460> g4

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460

and<00:01:56.499> g5<00:01:56.859> and<00:01:56.920> g6<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.420> kind<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.719> aggressive<00:01:58.960> play

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
and g5 and g6 so kind of aggressive play

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.149 
and g5 and g6 so kind of aggressive play
against<00:01:59.950> my<00:02:00.100> grandmother<00:02:00.310> opponent<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.439> as<00:02:02.770> a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
against my grandmother opponent so as a

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.550 
against my grandmother opponent so as a
nifty<00:02:03.640> move<00:02:03.670> from<00:02:04.119> brooke<00:02:04.749> v8<00:02:05.049> so<00:02:05.289> maybe<00:02:05.469> is

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
nifty move from brooke v8 so maybe is

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.110 
nifty move from brooke v8 so maybe is
going<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.740> take<00:02:05.859> be<00:02:06.039> for<00:02:06.280> an<00:02:06.369> 85<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:11.200> h5<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:12.160> don't

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
going to take be for an 85 so h5 I don't

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.520 
going to take be for an 85 so h5 I don't
know<00:02:13.180> maybe<00:02:13.450> it's<00:02:13.720> too<00:02:13.900> slow<00:02:14.170> we're<00:02:14.350> going<00:02:14.470> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
know maybe it's too slow we're going to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.060 
know maybe it's too slow we're going to
find<00:02:14.740> out

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.130 

so<00:02:18.070> here<00:02:18.400> night<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.970> four<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.390> always<00:02:19.660> Quincy

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
so here night a four is always Quincy

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.570 
so here night a four is always Quincy
six<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.650> don't<00:02:20.830> think<00:02:21.010> that's<00:02:21.070> particularly

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
six I don't think that's particularly

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.700 
six I don't think that's particularly
brilliant<00:02:22.140> night<00:02:23.140> d5<00:02:24.720> night<00:02:25.720> takes<00:02:26.020> ed<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
brilliant night d5 night takes ed the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.020 
brilliant night d5 night takes ed the
bishops<00:02:27.010> trapped<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:28.300> if<00:02:28.390> Bishop<00:02:28.600> takes<00:02:28.960> ed

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
bishops trapped so if Bishop takes ed

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.700 
bishops trapped so if Bishop takes ed
I'm<00:02:31.030> not<00:02:31.390> really<00:02:31.630> sure<00:02:31.750> what's<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.470> on

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
I'm not really sure what's going on

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.990 
I'm not really sure what's going on
there<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:34.420> do<00:02:34.930> get<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.260> light<00:02:35.440> squared<00:02:35.770> Bishop

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
there I do get the light squared Bishop

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.090 
there I do get the light squared Bishop
but<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.450> five<00:02:37.930> maybe<00:02:38.440> night<00:02:38.680> see<00:02:38.950> one

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
but then if a five maybe night see one

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
but then if a five maybe night see one
maybe<00:02:39.520> that's<00:02:39.760> okay<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.700> appellant<00:02:43.000> might

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
maybe that's okay the appellant might

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.000 
maybe that's okay the appellant might
get<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.360> night<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.170> see<00:02:44.350> five<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:44.830> i

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
h3 looks as though it could be tasty the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.370 
h3 looks as though it could be tasty the
tastiest<00:03:58.570> position<00:03:58.840> i<00:03:58.900> had<00:03:59.110> for<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.320> while

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
tastiest position i had for a while

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.830 
tastiest position i had for a while
against<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.860> gym<00:04:00.100> opponent<00:04:00.730> anyway<00:04:01.240> because

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
against the gym opponent anyway because

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.040 
against the gym opponent anyway because
then<00:04:02.020> i<00:04:02.080> say<00:04:02.260> queen<00:04:02.560> f2b<00:04:02.980> six<00:04:03.970> night<00:04:04.600> takes<00:04:04.930> of

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
then i say queen f2b six night takes of

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.250 
then i say queen f2b six night takes of
a<00:04:05.080> queen<00:04:05.410> age<00:04:05.620> 72<00:04:06.070> f<00:04:06.280> 7<00:04:06.610> mating<00:04:07.140> so<00:04:08.140> i<00:04:08.170> think

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
a queen age 72 f 7 mating so i think

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.750
