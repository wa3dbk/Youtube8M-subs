hard to aim so i'm not really sure how

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.410 
hard to aim so i'm not really sure how
much<00:03:59.109> that's<00:03:59.350> gonna<00:03:59.440> play<00:03:59.650> into<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.070> gameplay

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.410 
doesn't do it that much but you know
once<00:04:09.280> in<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.519> while<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.850> will<00:04:09.970> when<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.239> map

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
once in a while it will when the map

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.720 
once in a while it will when the map
sinks<00:04:10.780> just<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:11.049> little<00:04:11.290> bit<00:04:11.440> but<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.370> says<00:04:12.549> here

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
sinks just a little bit but it says here

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.009 
sinks just a little bit but it says here
that<00:04:12.760> actually<00:04:13.060> does<00:04:13.420> shake<00:04:13.690> very<00:04:13.930> violently

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019

actually a sniper's nest but there's a
light<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.770> always<00:04:57.190> shines<00:04:57.580> on<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:58.180> we'll

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
light that always shines on it so we'll

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.000 
light that always shines on it so we'll
see<00:04:58.480> how<00:04:58.510> that<00:04:58.660> plays<00:04:58.930> into<00:04:59.170> the<00:04:59.350> gameplay<00:04:59.590> and

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010
