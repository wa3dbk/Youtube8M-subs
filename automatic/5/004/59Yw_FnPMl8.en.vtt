I<00:00:22.180> am<00:00:22.330> going<00:00:22.510> to<00:00:22.570> spray<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:22.930> little<00:00:23.140> bit<00:00:23.290> of

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
I am going to spray a little bit of

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.590 
I am going to spray a little bit of
water<00:00:23.710> just<00:00:23.890> to<00:00:24.310> keep<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.700> flyaways<00:00:25.210> down<00:00:26.039> and

water just to keep the flyaways down and

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.600 
water just to keep the flyaways down and
then<00:00:28.600> all<00:00:28.840> you<00:00:29.050> want<00:00:29.260> to<00:00:29.410> do<00:00:29.530> is<00:00:29.800> decide<00:00:30.310> which

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
then all you want to do is decide which

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.249 
then all you want to do is decide which
way<00:00:30.820> you're<00:00:31.000> going<00:00:31.150> to<00:00:31.180> be<00:00:31.330> twisting<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:31.990> hair

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
way you're going to be twisting the hair

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.740 
way you're going to be twisting the hair
you<00:00:33.010> can<00:00:33.190> twist<00:00:33.399> it<00:00:33.640> clockwise<00:00:33.879> or

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
you can twist it clockwise or

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.800 
you can twist it clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:37.030> you<00:00:37.120> split<00:00:37.480> it<00:00:37.660> in<00:00:37.780> half

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
counterclockwise so you split it in half

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.440 
counterclockwise so you split it in half

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
twists right there and then just let it

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.959 
twists right there and then just let it
drop<00:01:06.149> twist<00:01:07.149> it<00:01:07.329> again<00:01:08.310> grab<00:01:09.310> another<00:01:09.609> piece

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
drop twist it again grab another piece

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.289 
drop twist it again grab another piece
from<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.420> top<00:01:11.549> put<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:12.670> through<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.030> middle

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
to do it the same way you did the first

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.050

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and then just add in the same hairs that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:03:09.130 
and then just add in the same hairs that
you<00:02:32.460> took<00:02:32.730> from<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.060> top

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.980 

okay<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.640> finished<00:03:11.000> style<00:03:11.360> it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
only took a couple of minutes and I

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.230 
only took a couple of minutes and I
think<00:03:13.880> it's<00:03:14.030> pretty<00:03:14.210> cute

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.030
