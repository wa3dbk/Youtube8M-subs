00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:04.770
 another sign of the sound time on an istomin cart and kubot winner at the bo 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.299
 it is to this day the city orders 00 of 2 00 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.469
 in the rhythm 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.619
 so in slow motion 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:32.239
 this is going to pose a computing factor france 02 20 00 3 from 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.239
 zero 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 because it starts like this too much 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.270
 we will play the bass line sambre always keeping the mine fayat them 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.200
 three fingers here 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.470
 we will play the bass console line ie a first record of 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.280
 third quarter 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.510
 the staple of liver so first rope first place 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.950
 zero 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.900
 from 2% to 16 euros 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 and a little something that we have to play a role 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 5 to 4 6 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 it's not because we do 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 so always the same 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.620
 at a time we are doing we will get arrested 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.430
 there is in front 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.840
 we will play 000 torcy 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.070
 3 in vain 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.070
 pompom comes back on freedom 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.050
 so the room there is a bit tense we will go on the water energy 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 the bass line in five years same talent 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.429
 as a player 0 3 2 010 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.079
 so it's left to a fan base around the world 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.379
 the happy the minesweeper is the hottest deal 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.379
 1 1 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.599
 the conference meet at 10 6 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.599
 in fact we go from the bass line so we keep in plain sight 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.629
 so concretely 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.629
 entry 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.989
 m and we end up with him 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.409
 so we saw just now 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.239
 another in plates 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.239
 so that that day 1000 devices 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.479
 outside asia 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.449
 and so here we will play so the baseline of this report adding a weight 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.449
 in the rope on the third string ie 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.999
 from Paris 0 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.379
 after this month 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.379
 I will add here what will give us 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.639
 partition 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.829
 that's a lot more 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.829
 the columbo 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.689
 m after we will leave on the miners 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.289
 as soon as the mining 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:48.999
 after we go on a chord that makes 0 2 0 to leave or not 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.639
 high and a half 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.149
 the chorus 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.019
 m and there we return to the intro 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:22.649
