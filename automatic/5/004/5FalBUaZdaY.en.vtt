individual I think they would do pretty
well<00:01:02.680> I<00:01:02.949> think<00:01:03.010> they<00:01:03.730> could<00:01:03.940> take<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.269> gold

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.190 
well I think they could take the gold
because<00:01:05.050> I<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.180> people<00:01:07.450> i<00:01:07.630> watch<00:01:07.960> and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
they have a lot of stamina to keep

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.420

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.780 
and other country alone I'm not taking
anything<00:01:17.080> from<00:01:17.259> them<00:01:17.470> but<00:01:17.890> from<00:01:18.520> what<00:01:18.640> I've

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
anything from them but from what I've

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.540 
anything from them but from what I've
seen<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:19.300> seen<00:01:19.960> Filipino<00:01:20.590> players<00:01:20.830> play<00:01:21.280> all

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.300 
seen I seen Filipino players play all
day<00:01:21.580> all<00:01:22.000> night<00:01:22.210> I<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:23.560> Billy's<00:01:23.920> should<00:01:24.130> be

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
day all night I think Billy's should be

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.190 
day all night I think Billy's should be
in<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.580> Olympics<00:01:25.030> because<00:01:25.570> there<00:01:26.080> are<00:01:26.140> so

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
in the Olympics because there are so

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.050 
in the Olympics because there are so
many<00:01:26.350> sports<00:01:26.740> out<00:01:26.950> there<00:01:27.160> that<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.640> kind<00:01:27.970> of

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
many sports out there that is kind of

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.300 
many sports out there that is kind of
similar<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.420> pull<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.800> takes<00:01:30.039> a<00:01:30.130> lot<00:01:30.280> of

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
similar to pull it takes a lot of

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.180 
similar to pull it takes a lot of
physical<00:01:30.759> aspect<00:01:31.330> mental<00:01:31.780> aspect<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:33.009> I

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
physical aspect mental aspect and I

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.980 
physical aspect mental aspect and I
think<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.520> would<00:01:33.640> be<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.729> good<00:01:34.119> thing<00:01:34.180> for<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.810> lot

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
think it would be a good thing for a lot

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.270 
think it would be a good thing for a lot
of<00:01:35.080> these<00:01:35.140> countries<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.710> come<00:01:35.890> together<00:01:36.039> and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
of these countries to come together and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.350 
of these countries to come together and
see<00:01:36.490> who<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.240> best<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:38.440> my<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:40.270> know

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
see who is the best and in my you know

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.699 
see who is the best and in my you know
my<00:01:40.390> guess<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.959> would<00:01:41.229> say<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:41.470> the

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
my guess I would say that the

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:43.290 
my guess I would say that the
Philippines<00:01:41.950> would<00:01:42.280> take<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.640> gold<00:01:42.789> because

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
Philippines would take the gold because

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.779 
Philippines would take the gold because
I've<00:01:43.479> seen<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:44.649> many<00:01:44.709> good<00:01:45.100> players<00:01:45.310> from<00:01:45.640> the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
I've seen so many good players from the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.029 
I've seen so many good players from the
Philippines<00:01:46.209> starting<00:01:46.959> from<00:01:47.140> 10<00:01:47.410> starting

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
Philippines starting from 10 starting

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.400 
Philippines starting from 10 starting
from<00:01:48.160> five<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:48.459> I<00:01:49.240> see<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:49.780> much<00:01:49.869> potential<00:01:50.259> so

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
from five and I see so much potential so

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.199 
from five and I see so much potential so
I<00:01:50.590> think<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:51.009> will<00:01:51.190> help<00:01:51.369> their<00:01:51.729> countries

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
I think this will help their countries

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:53.940 
I think this will help their countries
and<00:01:52.390> other<00:01:52.539> countries<00:01:52.810> if<00:01:53.229> they<00:01:53.410> did<00:01:53.709> bring

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
and other countries if they did bring

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.280 
and other countries if they did bring
the<00:01:54.069> goal
