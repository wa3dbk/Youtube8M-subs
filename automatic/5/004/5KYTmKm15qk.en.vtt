00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.310
 we have several places in the 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.870
 restaurant that every time we do 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.760
 three very distinct parts so one 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.930
 part the age where people how are we 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.660
 currently here we sit on 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.490
 sofas low tables will really take 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.260
 some more restaurants 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.430
 traditional so with tables 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.740
 normal and it's outside can 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.360
 after a little further part this 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.650
 we will call salon vip we could 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.790
 close with curtains so great 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.740
 but if I had a meeting 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.090
 you feel a little quieter 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.260
 the burial of the boy of the eight young 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.210
 girls here we can close the curtains 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.160
 and it really has to be isolated from 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.020
 restaurant serves intimist side 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.129
 much more tonight the intimate side 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.870
 who tell me what tell me is when 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.120
 even as I said a customer a 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.670
 little more business a little closer 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.410
 so it's the market is not the same 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.940
 so it's much more 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.489
 enlightened by cons is that evening 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.289
 everything is tightened candles are drawn 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.579
 dimmed light and then that would be what the 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.589
 little intimate side this little side 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.650
 open found at two very very cypresses 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:10.000
 well cozy that's how we go 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.130
 realize now so at a pavement of 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.620
 his nose only to chorizo this champagne 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.720
 we will start with the sauce that 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.509
 take more time so the same on and 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.759
 chiseled we will add about 10 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.930
 15 champagne titles at the level of 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.890
 champagne the choice is important where you 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.360
 can take me what you want 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.979
 you what is at your fingertips 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.270
 or if it's the same and champagne lead 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.700
 touching between 15 and 16 hours and 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.570
 bottles up to 30 40 euros so that's 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.860
 not worth it to put a big 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.290
 vintage to make a champagne sauce 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.390
 to stay on a bottle at 12.13 euros 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.579
 which will be very very good we will 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.229
 put on fire and we will carry 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.030
 to boil gently for 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.979
 accompaniment then so we have 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.140
 prepared the courgettes previously 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.210
 washed of course that we will pay in 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.860
 two to be able to slice them 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.390
 not too finely because after the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.229
 cooking it will turn into puree 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.360
 it's because we are looking for 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.710
 knowing that the column is going to melt is worth 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.039
 better go on a zucchini by 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.110
 person in garnish 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.939
 we will put them in paul and also 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.899
 a nonstick skillet if possible 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.840
 will allow you to hang on 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.050
 or with zucchini olive oil we go 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.720
 to heat up all that then 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.460
 we will start the zucchini so its 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.200
 share against a fairly fast cooking 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.150
 to inhabit 40 proto and that they 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.920
 will become mashed we will let it go 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.130
 a little bit of salt a little bit of 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.130
 pepper 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.860
 yeah put a little bit and shot for 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.860
 the go 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.130
 no such payment once the oil 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.830
 olive and a little bit of up- close 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.580
 after 160 and 180 grams per person 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.290
 I recommend since the level 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.180
 serving it's fine we'll start 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.590
 to be colored side belly always 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.150
 start with the side we will see in 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 first at the level of the plate for 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.020
 avoid a maximum of tampered with 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.370
 weights are being cooked yet we 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.420
 will return only once and after 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.610
 we'll let the leather finish all 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.200
 gently once it is colored so 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.550
 we wanted to do it can not they 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.540
 not excluded but I advise you to 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.880
 tergnier with who are around 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.000
 182 the time precisely to finish it 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.080
 zucchini and repair the champagne 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.230
 accuses shallots 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.780
 we will create mehdi felt of crem on 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.800
 will bring to a boil quickly 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.870
 zucchini arrived at the end of cooking 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.360
 they are well colored are still a 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.870
 little crunchy that's what we're looking for 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.220
 to carry on the side while waiting 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.290
 so robien cream and let reduce 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.610
 in half that they can take a 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.709
 smoothness and it becomes a little 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.239
 thicker and then we'll go up to 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.760
 butter we go the bodies for pretty much 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.080
 between 115 g of butter and then helpless 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.790
 g nickname of the father are connectable 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.940
 especially alas on bright fire 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.110
 we whip once it's worth removing 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.110
 fire did not give enough 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.010
 so there after five minutes pulls 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.209
 the salmon and we're going to put by 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.620
 on the chorizo 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.030
 we just have to hand over three 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.240
 minutes the time I'm at the bottom 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.270
 a little bit above 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.470
 the fort so the dish level by 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.730
 against the level of chorizo ​​I you 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.390
 advise more to put a sou rizo 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.560
 strong an extra-strong advantage of the fort 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.390
 it's going to bring you a little 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.730
 pungent motte denounced at the level 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.290
 of the recipe the doubs by cons he goes 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.910
 to be really too bland we're not going 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.320
 therefore necessarily feel so much stay 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.060
 on a fort and second council 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.230
 herman cut it in thin slices because 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.489
 that too big to make you really 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.840
 too much fat and it's going to be really 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.800
 difficult to eat so really tried 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.780
 to cut in thin slices 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.330
 but here is a good as pink at the fort 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.590
 will not be very well like that so after 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.160
 three minutes we go out the salmon 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.020
 from the oven we can see that chorizo 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.980
 has slightly melted has passed a little on 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.930
 this gentleman who will wear them to a 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.880
 little special flavor so there we 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:46.770
 can set the plate to deposit 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.770
 zucchini sauce all around 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.030
 it's my parent above and after for 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.690
 finish if you have flat parsley or 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.030
 on a small push small decor that 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.320
 will always have a nicer plate a 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.320
 Small greatest sailors to finish 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.450
 so for the beach so offers you a 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.180
 little windfall taste we will stay on a 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.070
 dry white wine that will go very well with the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.660
 salmon not too much fun either the 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.090
 aromas and still chorizo ​​in the 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.430
 dish you have a champagne brush so 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.380
 really stay sober so the 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.680
 small blowdown a dry white wine will be very 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.680
 good with
