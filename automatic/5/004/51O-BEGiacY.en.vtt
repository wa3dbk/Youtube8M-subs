00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
as I think especially the result we had

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
as I think especially the result we had
and<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.699> want<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> probably<00:01:00.210> bit<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and also they want a probably bit of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
and also they want a probably bit of
revenge<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.590> boys<00:01:01.770> beating<00:01:02.070> them

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
revenge from that the boys beating them

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
revenge from that the boys beating them
in<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.309> world<00:01:02.489> cup<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.600> pearcy<00:01:04.049> you'll

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

be hoping to maybe get two more runs up
against<00:01:07.020> things<00:01:07.229> yeah<00:01:07.979> hopefully<00:01:08.189> I'd<00:01:08.659> begun

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
against things yeah hopefully I'd begun

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
against things yeah hopefully I'd begun
to<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.350> himself<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.770> more<00:01:10.920> involved<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to get himself it more involved in the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.080 
to get himself it more involved in the
game<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.810> attack<00:01:13.380> wise<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.100> box<00:01:14.580> wise<00:01:14.850> we

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
game of the attack wise in a box wise we

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
game of the attack wise in a box wise we
can<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.900> bit<00:01:16.080> more<00:01:16.229> threatening<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
can be bit more threatening and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.520 
can be bit more threatening and
hopefully<00:01:17.390> get<00:01:18.390> off<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> trinary<00:01:19.110> i<00:01:19.320> think

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
hopefully get off the trinary i think

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.469 
hopefully get off the trinary i think
but<00:01:19.740> um<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.130> think<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.640> round<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.240> needed
