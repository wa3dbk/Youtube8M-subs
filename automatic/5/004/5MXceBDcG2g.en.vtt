I've left joy and you have to make sure
it's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> hundred<00:01:09.300> percent<00:01:09.390> dry<00:01:09.860> because<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it's a hundred percent dry because you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.110 
it's a hundred percent dry because you
don't<00:01:11.220> want<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> solid<00:01:11.670> eight<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.910> peel<00:01:12.090> it

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
don't want the solid eight to peel it

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.630 
don't want the solid eight to peel it
all<00:01:12.330> off<00:01:13.370> then

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.810 

I<00:01:18.080> was<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.350> my<00:01:19.500> cell<00:01:19.680> type<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.190> lot

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I was like to have my cell type a lot

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.380 
I was like to have my cell type a lot
longer<00:01:21.380> then<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.530> actually<00:01:22.680> need<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.390> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
longer then I actually need it to be and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
longer then I actually need it to be and
a<00:01:24.990> good<00:01:25.140> way<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> making<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.979> little<00:01:26.220> less

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
a good way of making it a little less

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.480 
a good way of making it a little less
sticky<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.300> just<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.320> case<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.800> haven't<00:01:29.040> let

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
sticky so just in case you haven't let

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.600 
sticky so just in case you haven't let
your<00:01:29.640> nail<00:01:30.330> polish<00:01:30.510> 100<00:01:30.990> said<00:01:31.170> dry<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.460> can

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
your nail polish 100 said dry you can

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.770 
your nail polish 100 said dry you can
make<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.000> bit<00:01:33.150> less<00:01:33.300> sticky<00:01:33.510> by

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
make it a little bit less sticky by

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.600 
make it a little bit less sticky by
sticking<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.350> hand<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:36.080> peeling<00:01:37.080> it<00:01:37.170> off

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
sticking at your hand and peeling it off

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.130 
sticking at your hand and peeling it off
that<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:39.710> it's<00:01:40.710> less<00:01:41.040> likely<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.670> take<00:01:42.140> any

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that way it's less likely to take any

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.660 
that way it's less likely to take any
nail<00:01:43.650> varnish<00:01:43.950> off<00:01:44.570> say<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:47.000> stick<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
nail varnish off say you stick it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.240 
nail varnish off say you stick it
another<00:01:50.670> half<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.330> nail

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.260 

making<00:01:55.030> sure<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.180> took<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.600> around<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:56.110> top

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
making sure you took it around the top

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.950 
making sure you took it around the top
and<00:01:58.270> stick<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.690> down<00:01:58.900> on<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.200> key<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.410> go

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.280 

luckily<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.100> shouldn't<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.549> nice<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.940> messy

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
luckily you shouldn't be nice and messy

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:14.080 
luckily you shouldn't be nice and messy
so<00:02:07.290> I'm<00:02:07.440> taking<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:10.440> by<00:02:10.770> barry<00:02:10.979> m<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:13.200> just

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so I'm taking in do by barry m and just

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.309 
so I'm taking in do by barry m and just
painting<00:02:15.090> over

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:33.260 

bit<00:02:22.950> one<00:02:23.159> side

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.520 

like<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:35.130> then<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:36.030> leave<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.290> dry

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
like so and then you leave that to dry

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.920 
like so and then you leave that to dry
and<00:02:38.370> then<00:02:39.350> I'd<00:02:40.350> suggest<00:02:40.560> doing<00:02:40.950> another<00:02:41.250> coat

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
and then I'd suggest doing another coat

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.090 
and then I'd suggest doing another coat
before<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.170> peel<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.500> nerve<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.770> to

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
before you peel the nerve on to

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.370 
before you peel the nerve on to
facilitate<00:02:44.640> off<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.690> i'll<00:02:45.810> leave<00:02:45.960> that<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.260> dry

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
facilitate off so i'll leave that to dry

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.490 
facilitate off so i'll leave that to dry
for<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.710> bit<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.600> made<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> little<00:02:49.230> bit<00:02:49.380> of

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
for a bit if you made a little bit of

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.110 
for a bit if you made a little bit of
mess<00:02:49.710> like<00:02:49.920> i<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.420> take<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.630> q-tip<00:02:52.850> soaked<00:02:53.850> in
