once you get that you can sort of lift
this<00:00:22.980> up<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.310> bit<00:00:23.550> if<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.060> reach<00:00:24.269> inside<00:00:24.720> the

mine's<00:00:29.670> pretty<00:00:30.269> clean<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.689> changed<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
mine's pretty clean I just changed it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.720 
mine's pretty clean I just changed it
recently<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.360> KN<00:00:33.930> air<00:00:34.079> filter<00:00:34.469> I

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
recently and it is a KN air filter I

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.889 
recently and it is a KN air filter I
highly<00:00:35.730> suggest<00:00:35.910> picking<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> these<00:00:36.840> up

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
highly suggest picking one of these up

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.190 
highly suggest picking one of these up
this<00:00:37.649> way<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.370> wash<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.200> reuse

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
this way you can just wash and reuse

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.680 
this way you can just wash and reuse
them<00:00:40.739> whenever<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.149> dirty<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.510> don't

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
them whenever they get dirty you don't

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.240 
them whenever they get dirty you don't
have<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> continues<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.350> keep<00:00:43.649> buying<00:00:43.890> air

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
have to continues to keep buying air

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.510 
have to continues to keep buying air
filters<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.710> reason<00:00:46.950> why<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.190> course<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
filters the reason why of course you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
filters the reason why of course you
want<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> change<00:00:47.969> an<00:00:48.090> air<00:00:48.210> filter<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:49.050> so

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
want to change an air filter is one so

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.760 
want to change an air filter is one so
you<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.500> better<00:00:49.620> gas<00:00:49.950> mileage<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.870> two<00:00:51.870> so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you get better gas mileage and two so

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.459 
you get better gas mileage and two so
you<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.879> actually<00:00:54.510> pretty<00:00:55.079> much<00:00:55.110> gives<00:00:55.379> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you have actually pretty much gives you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.529 
you have actually pretty much gives you
more<00:00:55.620> horsepower<00:00:56.129> because<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.239> making

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
more horsepower because it's not making

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.360 
more horsepower because it's not making
it<00:00:57.750> sluggish<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.160> we're<00:00:59.280> putting

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it sluggish at all so if we're putting

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.660 
it sluggish at all so if we're putting
it<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.699> in<00:01:00.020> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> lift<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.829> bit<00:01:01.980> go

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it back in you can lift this up a bit go

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.260 
it back in you can lift this up a bit go
in<00:01:02.820> from<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> side<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.630> slowly

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:19.770 

put<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:13.900> there

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.929 

make<00:01:20.780> sure<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.080> lift<00:01:21.799> it<00:01:21.979> up<00:01:22.040> with<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:23.350> now<00:01:24.939> if

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
make sure you lift it up with it now if

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.460 
make sure you lift it up with it now if
you<00:01:26.000> take<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.270> look<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:27.049> want<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.259> make<00:01:27.350> sure

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
you take a look you want to make sure

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.140 
you take a look you want to make sure
that<00:01:27.619> seals<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.220> like<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.610> make<00:01:28.820> sure<00:01:28.850> it's

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
that seals just like that make sure it's

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.490 
that seals just like that make sure it's
not<00:01:29.270> all<00:01:29.330> bowed<00:01:29.720> or<00:01:29.750> nothing

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
not all bowed or nothing

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.020 
not all bowed or nothing
the<00:01:30.740> reason<00:01:30.979> why<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.159> when<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.549> lift<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:31.850> up

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
the reason why is when you lift this up

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.800 
the reason why is when you lift this up
and<00:01:32.350> your<00:01:33.350> receding<00:01:33.830> it<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:35.420> want<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.690> make

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
and your receding it you want to make

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.289 
and your receding it you want to make
sure<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.290> aren't<00:01:36.530> crushing<00:01:37.130> any<00:01:37.970> of<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
sure that you aren't crushing any of the

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:46.649 
sure that you aren't crushing any of the
seals<00:01:44.500> so<00:01:45.500> once<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:45.710> get<00:01:45.799> it<00:01:45.920> back<00:01:46.070> on<00:01:46.250> there

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
seals so once you get it back on there
