i got close but I've not been able to
hit<00:01:26.880> him<00:01:27.000> yet<00:01:27.119> I've<00:01:27.450> tried<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> ultimate<00:01:28.259> long

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
hit him yet I've tried the ultimate long

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
hit him yet I've tried the ultimate long
shots<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> guy<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
shots with this guy and it is it is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300 
shots with this guy and it is it is
amazing<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.590> him<00:01:31.740> he<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.159> some

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
amazing to do with him he for some

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.160 
amazing to do with him he for some
reason<00:01:32.579> seems<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.060> spot-on<00:01:33.390> Healy's<00:01:33.960> gets

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
reason seems to be spot-on Healy's gets

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.179 
reason seems to be spot-on Healy's gets
near<00:01:34.380> when<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.680> tried<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:34.979> all<00:01:35.040> my<00:01:35.100> other

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
near when I tried with all my other

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.890 
near when I tried with all my other
players<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.790> go<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.479> far<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> right

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
players that like go so far to the right

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.530 
players that like go so far to the right
or<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.560> far<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> left<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.759> him<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.270> at

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
or so far to the left but with him I at

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.319 
or so far to the left but with him I at
least<00:01:39.689> I'm<00:01:39.900> hitting<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> crossbar<00:01:40.850> or<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
least I'm hitting the crossbar or the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.990 
least I'm hitting the crossbar or the
side<00:01:42.570> rail<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.369> hopefully<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.850> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
side rail so hopefully I can get that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.039 
side rail so hopefully I can get that
down<00:01:45.090> i'm<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> keep<00:01:45.540> practicing<00:01:45.960> I'm

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
down i'm going to keep practicing I'm

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.030 
down i'm going to keep practicing I'm
not<00:01:46.140> gonna<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.439> seems<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> go

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
not gonna this seems not going to go

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.109 
not gonna this seems not going to go
anywhere<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> while<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.640> might<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
anywhere for a while this might be the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
anywhere for a while this might be the
team<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:48.479> i'm<00:01:48.600> giving<00:01:48.840> away<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.079> teams

team as i'm giving away all my teams
that<00:01:49.770> i<00:01:49.939> plan<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:50.970> keeping<00:01:51.920> here<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that i plan on keeping here in the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.399 
that i plan on keeping here in the
middle<00:01:53.430> center<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.790> position<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.329> have

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
middle center my position we have

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.139 
middle center my position we have
Robinho<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> lot<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.950> people<00:01:56.070> don't<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.030> him

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
Robinho a lot of people don't like him

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.700 
Robinho a lot of people don't like him
there<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.689> informed<00:01:58.140> card<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.500> i<00:01:58.530> need

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
there it's as informed card but i need

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.780 
there it's as informed card but i need
that<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.250> chemistry<00:01:59.549> if<00:01:59.640> I've

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that there for the chemistry if I've

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.370 
that there for the chemistry if I've
moved<00:02:00.119> Ramirez<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.750> middle<00:02:01.049> which<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.290> who

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
moved Ramirez to the middle which is who

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.080 
moved Ramirez to the middle which is who
I<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> right-center<00:02:02.579> my

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
I have it here at the right-center my

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.520 
I have it here at the right-center my
position<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> chemistry<00:02:04.170> goes<00:02:04.350> down

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
position then the chemistry goes down

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.889 
position then the chemistry goes down
and<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.340> believe<00:02:05.939> Ramirez<00:02:06.299> only<00:02:06.450> has<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.600> 7

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and I believe Ramirez only has a 7

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.119 
and I believe Ramirez only has a 7
chemistry<00:02:07.229> which<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> work

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
chemistry which I do not want to work

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.650 
chemistry which I do not want to work
with<00:02:08.160> right<00:02:08.489> now<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.239> left<00:02:09.479> back

90 pays great for a left-back love that
guy<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.630> then<00:02:16.720> chiellini<00:02:17.170> I've<00:02:17.349> had<00:02:17.530> him<00:02:17.680> on

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
guy and then chiellini I've had him on

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.620 
guy and then chiellini I've had him on
so<00:02:17.980> many<00:02:18.099> teams<00:02:18.459> he<00:02:18.700> may<00:02:18.819> not<00:02:19.000> be<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.209> pace<00:02:19.360> yes

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
so many teams he may not be the pace yes

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.720 
so many teams he may not be the pace yes
but<00:02:19.810> he<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.319> strong<00:02:20.980> overall<00:02:21.400> great

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
but he is just strong overall great

him<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.520> team<00:02:24.790> went<00:02:25.660> out<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:25.870> got<00:02:25.930> the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
him on the team went out and got the

uniform Thiago Silva did not have to put
him<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.150> formation<00:02:28.569> he<00:02:28.690> still<00:02:28.900> kept<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.200> nine

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
him in formation he still kept the nine

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.500 
him in formation he still kept the nine

a beast 94 defending get his informed
card<00:02:34.690> if<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.110> think<00:02:35.350> there<00:02:35.470> might<00:02:35.560> be<00:02:35.620> a

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
card if you can I think there might be a

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.780 
card if you can I think there might be a
high<00:02:35.890> rate<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.130> one<00:02:36.310> than<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.550> but<00:02:36.760> I

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
high rate of one than that but I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.940 
high rate of one than that but I
couldn't<00:02:37.060> afford<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:38.290> then<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.500> decided<00:02:38.800> to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
couldn't afford it and then I decided to

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.979 
couldn't afford it and then I decided to
replace<00:02:39.250> Danny<00:02:39.640> Alva's<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.269> Mike<00:02:40.569> on<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> lot

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
replace Danny Alva's with Mike on a lot

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.150 
replace Danny Alva's with Mike on a lot
of<00:02:41.080> people<00:02:41.230> might<00:02:41.350> say<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:41.590> crazy<00:02:41.890> he's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
of people might say that's crazy he's

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.009 
of people might say that's crazy he's
not<00:02:42.310> as<00:02:42.430> Pacey<00:02:42.700> but<00:02:43.030> he's<00:02:43.150> still<00:02:43.390> fast<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.870> me

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
not as Pacey but he's still fast to me

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.290 
not as Pacey but he's still fast to me
