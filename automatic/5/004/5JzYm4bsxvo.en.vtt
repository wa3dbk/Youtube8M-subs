00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:16.619
 in just a minute but here so 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.019
 relevant as they are I am car 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.179
 tourist and welcome to this new 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.599
 tutorial on this occasion how often 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:27.300
 download and install 64 bit and so 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.999
 be able to assign you more blue ram memory 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.169
 minecraft although already more sir first 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.179
 would like it would be a video 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.700
 with even the pinches who want 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.220
 leave in low k means 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.530
 but good first thing they have to 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.990
 know 3 how much ram memory has assigned 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.990
 the americas ok then that's why in 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.580
 any game we are going to press f 3 that 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.200
 as you know it is what causes 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.520
 come out all these weird numbers that 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.350
 are all minecraft data 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.440
 and good to us the one that interests us 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.630
 is this part of up here is worth 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.110
 example to me it comes out that I have 989 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.470
 megabytes of ram memory allocated what 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.480
 it would be with ram gb's worth for 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.710
 what is the use of increasing the ram to 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.870
 minecraft what helps us so that the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.250
 minecraft have more memory to lock 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.560
 your data and we are the least worth 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.960
 this for example can be more noticeable 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.470
 for people who play with mods or 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.300
 those who have maps with a lot of rest 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:35.600
 so then the first thing we have to do 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.310
 know to install this to be able to 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.090
 assign more ram memory plus minecraft 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.729
 is if our operating system is 64 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.150
 bits is obviously worth this just for 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.160
 windows 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.540
 good for that then let's close here 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.720
 our minecraft from here we already know that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.880
 has a gb of ram assigned we 're going to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.790
 go to home and where does it say team let's go 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.110
 to give you right click and properties here 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.230
 we are going to be all the properties of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.190
 our team and here we will leave what 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.270
 type of systems 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.580
 here in mine tells me that the system 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.490
 operating 64 bits that means 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.790
 that if we can do it for 32 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.840
 Unfortunately, it can not be done 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.910
 ok taking advantage of that we are here 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.370
 we're also going to see how much ram memory 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.770
 we have installed for later 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.930
 know how much ram we are going to assign him vale 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.540
 I here have 6 gigabytes when 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.100
 we close this and we go to the link that 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.660
 I'll leave you in the description of 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.510
 video 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.570
 in this link here we're going to go where 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.270
 says 64-bit offline windows ok 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.100
 then we click and we will 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.130
 download after we are 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.840
 download well, you know, they install it 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.580
 next next next you want 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.420
 sell reform to the devil for a simple 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.740
 program if you already know everything routine 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.780
 I'm not going to do it anymore because he lived what 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.190
 I have value and it is to make them lose 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.270
 minus the time that we are going to cancel 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.600
 let's close then let's open a 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.680
 notebook any such common no 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.200
 no matter what 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.099
 and well let's paste what I left them in 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.099
 the description of the video 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.540
 here that once stuck this what 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.189
 let's change are these four 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.640
 team numbers and these four 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.739
 numbers here is worth in this we are going to 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.560
 change what memory would come 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.510
 maximum that is going to pull our mind in 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.830
 my case that I have got to be vice of 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.550
 ram and I like to play a lot with bots 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.910
 this I'm going to put 4 thousand 96 that 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.740
 would be 4 gb of ram maximum ok and 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.250
 now I 'm going to put the minimum that would be 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.810
 substituting these four zeros from here 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.050
 and at the minimum I'm going to put it 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.650
 3.072, you can put less 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.640
 I recommend that you do it maximum 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.040
 two gigabytes and minimum this gigabyte if 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.780
 is that we do not play with our nuts for 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.120
 normal minecraft matches and with 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.920
 subtract so it's not so necessary to have 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.350
 so much branch assigned ok after the show 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.150
 we are going to go to the route of our 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.370
 minecraft in my case I have it here in 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.019
 my desk folder here where 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.049
 is our minecraft is and a 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.820
 clarification this will only serve for the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:27.150
 executable of already worth be original or 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.580
 pirate is going to give the same but he has to 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.800
 be the villar executable is worth then 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.670
 we are going to give you right click properties 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.689
 and here where is the location we are going to 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.180
 copy it 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.449
 if you are 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.710
 accept and close that it no longer serves us 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.330
 nothing 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.490
 let's copy 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.439
 is the location of the file between 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.729
 quotes is between the first and the 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.009
 second 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.770
 let's copy the location and we're going to 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.550
 add 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.460
 the name of the file in my case is 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:08.520
 Minecraft 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:11.340
 S &amp; P point is already valid and ready here 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.710
 we have our complete file now 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.900
 all we have to do is 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.580
 save it as we will keep good 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.900
 we're going to keep nothing else like that because 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.849
 if it would not be saved as a file of 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.950
 abnormal text so we're going to give it in 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:29.370
 save as 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:30.870
 let's leave it on the desk is and you 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.100
 let's put a name the one we want 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.100
 put minecraft 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.020
 the ram and now the most important thing what 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.380
 let's put as point to ok 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:48.500
 remember that at this point if you do not go 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:51.110
 is going to work this is worth to get fat 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.350
 and ready as you can see it is here we can 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.689
 close this without problems and now what 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.330
 only thing that we are going to do 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:01.720
 is 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.879
 double click on this file and we were 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.530
 will open this black eyelash like 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.889
 when they open an emulator this is worth 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.990
 it means that it works here says that 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.110
 is already cabling four gigabytes maximum 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.060
 of ram and 3000 voucher of this program that 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.979
 is the one that you put between 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.539
 quotes remember not to erase 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.120
 quotes if not it will not open the 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:23.960
 file location now it's going to 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.270
 open minecraft too 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.169
 Now let's verify that if we have 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:34.400
 the 4 gb of assigned ram we are going to enter 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:40.539
 try to finish and we expect a 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.539
 moment ready for this very 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.539
 and well let's see let's see if the 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.660
 magic works let's give the trip 3 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:51.419
 and if it seems like yes you can 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.240
 see here already assigned 3 thousand 640 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:57.030
 megabytes trump is usually worth while 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.610
 I have put more than I put him 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.620
 were 4 gigabytes as the the minecraft 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.290
 take a little less 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.310
 ok so if you see that it's less than what 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.290
 you assigned him because you do not know 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.460
 worry in any way is not going to be 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:15.240
 much the difference is worth it and that would be 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.680
 everything in this tutorial now they have their 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.840
 minecraft with more ram memory allocated 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.240
 remember that whenever you want to open 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.550
 the minecraft with more ram what they have 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.430
 to open the file bat is this point 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.060
 ok if you want to open the minecraft with your 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.490
 Normal run can open the baker 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.139
 directly that of the executable and how 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.620
 they do not see the little window that is 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:39.150
 assigning more ram worth and good that's going to 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.280
 be all for this video I hope that you 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.700
 have liked that it has helped them and 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.230
 please also help them in leaving their 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.780
 law that is very important and sincerely 

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:51.000
 It helps us a lot to know that this 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.650
 Desmadre is this the store with both 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.750
 others are worth here I'm going to leave you a 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.720
 little button to subscribe 

00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:00.120
 if they want and we'll see you 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.930
 until another here teak dismissal arturito 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.930
 go away
