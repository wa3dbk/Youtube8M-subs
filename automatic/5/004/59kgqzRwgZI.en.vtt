00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.099
 hi guys i'm blake you today 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.139
 I'm here to explain where to find the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.269
 minigun that is the deadly machine in gta 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.980
 5 before making a sign on the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.690
 map to this point that the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.449
 the left side of the map just outside 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.039
 of the gallery and once marked 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.900
 this point before reaching it vi 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 I highly recommend finding a car 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.500
 you will not need a car on average fast 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.359
 as fast as a zonda but what do you know 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 that now in iron to find any audio 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.070
 a sweaty car on average fast 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.329
 like a comet once collected 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.129
 this car I recommend you look for 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 the first city ​​where Michael lives 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.879
 reach at this point that you are 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 marked from here you will have to take one 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 small chase a little as you see in the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.329
 video and go as fast as possible 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.649
 against the right side of the tunnel 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.030
 you will not have to take any part 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.370
 you simply have to take this 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.260
 kind of scooter ramp on earth who 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.510
 will act as a ramp and if you take one 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.190
 speed is sufficient to succeed at 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.870
 bypass the barriers this reason 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.789
 because I needed it because you needed a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.350
 average fast car with the bike not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.450
 try to do it because you mix internet 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 and once inside the base 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 military as you wish you can find 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.270
 helicopters can collect planes but 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.040
 if you want the minigun go on until 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.259
 this gate does not reach the net ed 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 enter the stars right now 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.119
 will go up to 4 stars start of verve 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.259
 the military and the police then stay 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.340
 very careful 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.680
 once entered the gate b 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.299
 advice to invest the first soldiers 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.220
 that will come out so make me a little easier 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.659
 the things once killed to present 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.450
 inside the building always standing 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.180
 very careful started to climb the stairs 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.040
 after doing what s six plans if 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 almost seven floors you will find this fort 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.280
 which can then be opened on the floor 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.509
 you will find the mini that is yours 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240
 machine and mortal it seems to me that there 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.189
 initially contains 500 points 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.759
 sorry 500 shots you can 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.649
 recharge from camus nation will not be 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.420
 mandatory to leave alive from this base 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.159
 military also because they will kill them 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.960
 you are reborn net in a hospital 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.000
 any and the mini gang of will remain 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.320
 your inventory found in the part 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.270
 left, for example, the lance 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.799
 then select rocket launchers 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.659
 the part without incorrect inventory 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.069
 with the arrow until he found one 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.869
 Once you have the big mini it will stay 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.819
 in your possession even if they run out 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.120
 shots the houses end up and colleagues like 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.530
 to live 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.569
 as instead said you can go to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.750
