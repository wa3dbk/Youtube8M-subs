00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
first of which pretty much cured all the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.700 
first of which pretty much cured all the
major<00:01:12.420> bugs<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.930> talked<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.560> full

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
further improved performance bringing it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.109 
further improved performance bringing it

of us who have used CyanogenMod before

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.510 
of us who have used CyanogenMod before
it's<00:01:24.869> usually<00:01:25.140> pretty<00:01:25.619> fast<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.310> some

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it's usually pretty fast but for some

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.749 
it's usually pretty fast but for some
reason<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.450> never<00:01:27.659> quite<00:01:28.170> reaches<00:01:28.979> or<00:01:29.220> matches

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
reason it never quite reaches or matches

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
in fact I noted the color temperature

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.349 
in fact I noted the color temperature
looked<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> little<00:04:11.250> warm<00:04:11.549> anyway<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.209> that's

looked a little warm anyway but that's

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.089 
looked a little warm anyway but that's
not<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.569> manufacturing<00:04:13.260> defect<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.769> just<00:04:13.950> a

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
not a manufacturing defect it's just a

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.190 
not a manufacturing defect it's just a
different<00:04:14.609> panel<00:04:14.819> but<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.450> thing<00:04:15.599> is<00:04:15.630> if<00:04:15.959> they

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
different panel but the thing is if they

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.170 
different panel but the thing is if they
do<00:04:16.260> ship<00:04:16.709> out<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> phone<00:04:17.190> with<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.579> defect<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
do ship out a phone with the defect and

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.640 
do ship out a phone with the defect and
someone<00:04:18.539> wants<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.840> return<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.620> a

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
someone wants to return it for a

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.409 
someone wants to return it for a
replacement<00:04:19.979> they<00:04:20.729> don't<00:04:21.030> have<00:04:21.269> any

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
replacement they don't have any

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.540 
replacement they don't have any
replacements<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:22.380> yeah<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.159> comes<00:04:23.340> down<00:04:23.490> to

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
replacements so yeah it comes down to

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.060 
replacements so yeah it comes down to
the<00:04:23.940> scarce<00:04:24.270> availability<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.830> phone

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
end that yeah it turns out they really

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.409 
end that yeah it turns out they really
do<00:04:53.949> care<00:04:54.129> about<00:04:54.189> updating<00:04:54.639> a<00:04:54.819> software<00:04:55.240> and

do care about updating a software and
they're<00:04:55.569> going<00:04:55.659> to<00:04:55.750> keep<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:55.990> up<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.139> date<00:04:56.259> and

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
they're going to keep it up to date and

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.140 
they're going to keep it up to date and
it's<00:04:56.919> made<00:04:57.099> a<00:04:57.129> lot<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.310> progress<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.939> they

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
it's made a lot of progress and they

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.480 
it's made a lot of progress and they
fixed<00:04:58.509> tons<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.229> bugs<00:04:59.409> and<00:04:59.710> then<00:05:00.129> there's<00:05:00.310> the

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
low end where it's still kind of hard to

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.040 
low end where it's still kind of hard to
