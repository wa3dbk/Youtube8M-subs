00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 good morning everyone in general we are 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.990
 in minecraft 1 point others let's see 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.300
 a minimum to txiki mod or micro mod that 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 just add a little something but it's pretty 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.880
 crossbow made by mister crime fish o 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.170
 something like that is called so always 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.650
 start doing parkour in the trees 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.650
 I do not know why 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.600
 is made by that man who has done 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.220
 and some other quite famous and has 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.020
 started doing this and the truth is that 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.320
 it looks pretty good now just because 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.770
 is here as I say it is very green 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.760
 mode adds a skate 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.250
 where we put ourselves here for example 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 come and I tried an organ at the time 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.969
 of skateboarding and in fact added many things 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.739
 He added as ramps and maybe that was 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.879
 all super played and in the end does not tell 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.039
 review because you could not use it almost but 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.369
 here the man more graphic this than ever 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.369
 I remember 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:07.710
 that's good if my head turns me 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.569
 forward and with a little bit more other 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.909
 time a little more you do not have to keep it 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.220
 he is just giving a touch again more 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.900
 and if we give it a lot there is the speed 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.820
 maximum that reaches we can jump with it 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.820
 it's very cool, it also slows down 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:39.470
 we do not have it here it's pretty green 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.380
 but if we go at full speed and you 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.479
 we stop giving the time you see starts to 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.610
 stop that is a detail that has 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.100
 I really liked the 10 days I like to give 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.810
 with the effective leg we can jump like 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.380
 I say and if we jump and we give 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.290
 left or right follows 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.000
 I am the Tony Hawk of Minecraft and the tail 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.600
 It is very cool as I say it is very green 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.600
 in fact 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.830
 if we do for you that I have to fail 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.290
 if we do it wrong first the position 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 of the character I love to be put in 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.480
 plan as if we were doing it 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.100
 it's really cool and if we do this 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.080
 here but bad for example there are see us 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.810
 it's like we fall off the skateboard or 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.990
 those little good things a long time not 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.880
 there is if I want it to look good there is that is 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.490
 less done the script if we do wrong the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.010
 trick for now you can only do that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.110
 but it is as I say it is very cool 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.780
 done backwards and forwards not 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.819
 does nothing simply 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.360
 backwards it does not seem that it was so 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.360
 little bit 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.960
 It's a little weird but it's super cool 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.240
 let's try a little thing that I have 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.360
 curiosity as I say is this man 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.910
 we make tremendous is used we always do 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.470
 very good and I felt like I wanted 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.470
 try this if I do this like this 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.910
 may be offered because that kind of 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.160
 details of what is done is a trick 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.890
 battered skate or being able to do tricks 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.560
 or that the character is this side or 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.030
 it is noticeable that the uncle has good 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.870
 ideas let's try 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.880
 and I want to know if I can provide 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.800
 simply 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.740
 I 've never been a big skate fan 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.030
 not much less but I find it curious to 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.840
 this uncle 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.840
 let's give it 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.980
 well and so for example to do this 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.730
 longer but not next to the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.100
 water ok let's try your skate 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.720
 with me 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.870
 Well, you can 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.170
 because I am here 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.610
 so it can be a little weird the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.610
 effect must be said 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.689
 but now it does leave me but it leaves me 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.280
 double but because we are going very slow if 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.710
 we go very fast he would not let me get 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.940
 so do not fall 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.650
 I want you to slow down 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.080
 there you see now we can see the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.540
 head 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.120
 the grace would be like this in this position and 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.820
 greene giving 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.380
 I believe but good for now as I say 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.130
 the mote is very green we are going to 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.430
 try 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.680
 I'm excited but as you can see 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.860
 very curious is stopped and as I say 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.639
 this man we make very good so 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.319
 we are going to have to go looking 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.860
 because I 'm sure he gets to do things 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:38.090
 very cool but very safe and alain is worth 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.080
 let's see what I'm curious about 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.370
 know how it goes with different materials 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.360
 this is that it is cooler so it has not been like this 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.909
 we go 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.909
 let's go 2000 gay family skater 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.990
 Y 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:00.980
 not to slip 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.860
 even though 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.520
 we do not really go the same it's fine 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.169
 it also goes very slow because of the solution 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.289
 of reality the speed is the same 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:17.539
 I do not know but it 's not bad 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.539
 this reason because I do not let myself be assaulted 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.539
 Let's see 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.580
 the solution does not let me jump the 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.330
 movement because 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.330
 here yes 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.630
 when the solution does not let me jump the 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.120
 movement in the ice follows that 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.490
 We're here, you see, it jumps straight and when 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.840
 low follows the path a little weird 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.450
 but well this is what the mod adds 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.060
 as you see a very kid mode today 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.009
 we go with the shift we go down simply 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:51.349
 let's put another here 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:53.509
 as he gave it neither nor that it arrives is super 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:56.029
 cool but good you have the description 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.589
 as I say it is for 1.8 as it is now 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.409
 just add this and you do not have kraft eo ni 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:03.499
 nothing but later on this guy is going to 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.569
 be something cool safe is also the ones that 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:08.949
 has always been super tough but 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.949
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.930
 bye
