 I lose nothing with recording a little bit 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.460
 forget so this is another game that 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.409
 it went viral 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.409
 I'm not sure if I play it 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.500
 what cells can not my examination be 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.110
 sciences deals about cells up 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.040
 the viruses come out great I'll be studying 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.040
 while I play 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.340
 as I understand it, I have to put on a 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.469
 name to see 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.409
 sj all against the one because they stay away 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.619
 stay away do not approach cj the expert 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.840
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha yes sure this is your 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.420
 First game, I'm an expert 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.420
 in cells to see what the cytoplasm is 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.520
 good in my exams the word comes out 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.010
 I quote and it means that I should write the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.380
 words asked by the question and plasma 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.310
 it's a very big TV that means that 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.130
 a person is quoting a plasma 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.030
 better I stay away from you not going to be 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.940
 contagious that you wanted to tell me 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.280
 well I do not care how I ate another 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.900
 player did not know that the cells were doing 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.900
 that and get away 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.140
 I'll eat that little guy get away if he reads 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.740
 fresh mitochondria 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.069
 rays ate me now I must put another 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.069
 first name 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.500
 Now I have returned to be the best 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.780
 First of all to make me my where 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.830

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.830
 I'm not going to tell you 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.780
 that this thing is giant I wonder 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.210
 how many hours a day do you play these 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.310
 people from homes that you are the 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.800
 next be eaten 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.800
 Fresh core not again 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.970
 I put a link and it came out green xd 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.540
 come here in your dreams the cells do not 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.510
 I dream well to notice that will help me 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.970
 my exam I'm so responsible I'm 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.380
 studying I am a good student a 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.380
 little more and I'll get over sweet 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.530
 come here I will not do it so the 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.430
 cells can also be divided 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.190
 will write it down ha ha ha ha cj it's pathetic what 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.190
 what are you doing, not you, what are you? 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.100

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.060

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.260
 excuse me I do not insult you I'm sorry 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.790
 you lost all your dignity 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:09.050
 cj perhaps I had it but not but you gave me 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.740
 sorry and I wanted to tell you that I can not 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.860
 believe that I lost with cj wait like 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.790
 they know it's me alone you could play 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.920
 so bad hey that hurt good people we should 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.200
 devising a plan to eat makes us 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.600
 I suggest we make a team between 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.510
 all and so we defeat him you know that 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.480
 I can hear you not 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.510
 and I think I screwed up because I will not leave 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.880
 that eat me come here cj we do not want 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.980
 nuts in this game and the first time 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.300
 you played this game you were 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.389
 well 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.389
 I'll get him caught in 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:55.629
 cheat surprise that does not work if it's 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.629
 in the game technically it is not cheating 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.530
 well cj is your turn get up and tell me 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.140
 everything you know about cells with 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.150
 Professor Professor, the cells are 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.400
 small circles of different colors 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.110
 which they eat among themselves for 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.420
 to be able to get bigger and win the 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.190
 leaving the body then they can 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.400
 divide when they are sufficiently 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.870
 large and thus better attack others 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:14.330
 they are about a strange place where there 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.330
 many small pictures there fight 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.849
 what is the cytoplasm 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.220
 good in my exams the word comes out 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.710
 I quote and it means that I should write the 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.110
 words asked by the question and plasma 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:33.539
 it's a very big TV that means that 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.539
 a person is quoting a plasma 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:40.970
 congratulations cj repro enough so 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.490
 you'll have summer vacations that's not 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:46.340
 it's just said everything correctly 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.970
 that's how you said correctly how is the 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.370
 agrarian game the teacher plays a carrion and 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.919
 guess who the teacher is 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.500
 students are in my class because they are 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.389
 lazy and not having studied that happens to them 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.060
 those who do not take the study in 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:04.610
 serious very well student I want you 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.840
 present and then to the 20 exams 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.840
 different materials
