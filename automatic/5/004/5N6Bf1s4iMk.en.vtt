00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.559
 what my condition a tutorial what suits me 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.369
 I want to show him today 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.020
 7m can if Pechstein you know it so 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.400
 not on the PC but a praise has drawn 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.710
 on according to own ideas in Photoshop transfers 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.590
 so painting easier can try under it for example 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.730
 but it was not unfriendly to me that my idea had been completely and completely 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:36.450
 Not 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.850
 And to make it even better in the East 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.580
 around the Maritime Office Nied 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.740
 August they want to call 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.160
 so as he suited this method really well 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.730
 there's a header internet for these guys or these guys there and 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.520
 with a report the internet is not 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.680
 I've never been the one who came up with that 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.030
 I like looking for myself 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.350
 Infineon is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.050
 It is conceivable that we can use that 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.520
 not only here 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 She uses these plans 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.120
 I drew that analogously 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.120
 It is still quite good, I think 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.500
 and he 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.060
 it shares 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.430
 just as Lukoil knows that, I will look, too 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.329
 First of all, they have to face some with flowers 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.650
 Brightness and contrast clear 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.080
 not used but not much change 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 Repeat the process times several times 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.370
 always marriage 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.370
 set the contrast as high as possible 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.149
 so the device is out of this waiting 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.930
 us this percent what this Kollig a few with the Minister quite like 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.920
 she with me 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440
 Coming from Ahaus 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.020
 gradually 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.880
 still really nice 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.949
 becomes brilliant black 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.969
 and that wisdom lift right because it's good that mine gives me 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.809
 were so nice and how is speedy unit 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.319
 the more demanded than art 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.039
 so as not to overthrow 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.449
 tailor-made 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.149
 Percent but also from us 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:28.269
 very easily 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.719
 so 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.929
 Copy 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:35.180
 I now stood with them so fit 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.180
 and seven scope theirs 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.019
 Women exercise in mostly document opens 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.609
 the chapel is 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.289
 therein 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.429
 the crime had the right kiss 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.429
 expresses formation and 2 or culture and construction 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.509
 to insert 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.509
 so March had only the first from 1 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.809
 around 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:03.179
 that looks pretty good but they are not so open yet extreme that 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.179
 which you can edit that is sometimes work you could do that 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.849
 Eagle 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.659
 Percent to become what it is meanwhile hardly to stop 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.779
 doing it best reduces it to the level it always does 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.199
 the CD everything 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.419
 press copy again 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.289
 to reminder control products barely 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.609
 Pluess 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.619
 and there is deception here next to levels on knees 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.460
 with one on it 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.720
 because he raised the bifa at least one percent Roodt once yellow name 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.669
 Percent remains 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.529
 at com + plus is just gray 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.150
 Preetz I have you here a new channel yes 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.809
 will automatically be called alpha1 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.669
 with control and 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.359
 or controls v you can down there 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.069
 insert Picture 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.579
 and now often there are corrections 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.579
 and and animals that arise negatively 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.230
 then he goes back to the original honorable of the rally 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:13.499
 more back 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:15.499
 it is not that easy 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.309
 "If I make one here 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.509
 and what he is dead now pretty brutal in the vocal fire 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:25.279
 and way it is 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:29.299
 Percent Ric Grech is the best keyboard shortcut you can do 

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:31.509
 otherwise endless work 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.840
 now it creates a new level 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.840
 one can also be the smallest 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.330
 Do not lose GÃ¼nther overseas 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.960
 and the clock 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.789
 it is exceptions 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.789
 we had 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.620
 and now you can all come together united, that's what we're all about 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.529
 just created 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.210
 and then it happened 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.210
 You have now, as it were, your own exit 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.729
 this kind of Leinster 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.180
 on the 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.120
 and all we are doing now - is to package these plans 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.029
 beautiful black spots and 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.210
 to fill the whole selection with black paint 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.990
 if you like 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.479
 the selection is on 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.559
 then the beautiful ABL has 1 percent 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:32.559
 Everything about what is transparent 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.969
 of course, the big advantage of this is that it's just below it 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.779
 can create and in this level 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.319
 prompt moment 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.889
 of course I could not have the fan-hearts in this plane 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.289
 to forget 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.319
 to put the whole thing back on RBB Â«Favre 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.400
 and this time, Ziege simply did not count it on a plane, it does not even exist 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.550
 to reduce 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.189
 Klopp is the short tank times to Rand 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.199
 yes and then you can be sorry 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.249
 in any color 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:06.349
 here reason, according to Howman 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.270
 without 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.630
 that you pollute the outlines percent 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.369
 very simple thing 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:17.759
 to do nicely 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.189
 and percent I hope he has already held 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.020
 that's 10 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.819
 it's a bit awkward at the beginning 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.069
 but and really takes care of it very fast 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.029
 and if he did it two or three times, no 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.110
 is this 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.830
 a hand movement but here 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.089
 then the mecca no longer 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:41.729
 b um 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.070
 Thank you gratefully and I am pleased if you liked it 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.539
 that he's quiet about love comments there 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.490
 when the Celts show me where I also work a few each participated 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.719
 I'm always happy 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.719
 when I see that I could help someone 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.099
 are you
