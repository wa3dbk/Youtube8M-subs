00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
though I love the fur is painted

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.190 
though I love the fur is painted
slightly<00:04:51.720> shiny<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:53.270> I'm<00:04:54.270> really<00:04:54.690> not<00:04:54.930> so

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
slightly shiny and I'm really not so

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.870 
slightly shiny and I'm really not so
much<00:04:55.380> into<00:04:55.740> this<00:04:55.860> shiny<00:04:56.220> look<00:04:56.520> especially

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
much into this shiny look especially

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.719 
much into this shiny look especially
since<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.750> rest<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.290> figure<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:58.950> Matt<00:04:59.400> I
