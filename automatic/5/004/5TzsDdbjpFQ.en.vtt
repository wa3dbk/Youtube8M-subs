and<00:00:09.150> how<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.510> hook<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.679> let's<00:00:10.860> get

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
and how to hook it up so let's get

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.410 
and how to hook it up so let's get
started

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.060 

the<00:00:18.199> first<00:00:18.410> thing<00:00:18.619> you're<00:00:18.740> going<00:00:18.859> to<00:00:18.920> notice

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
the first thing you're going to notice

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.480 
the first thing you're going to notice
about<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.580> HD<00:00:19.939> blade<00:00:20.150> is<00:00:20.480> how<00:00:20.630> flat<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.019> is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
about the HD blade is how flat it is

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.920 
about the HD blade is how flat it is
because<00:00:22.490> we've<00:00:22.699> used<00:00:22.939> a<00:00:23.060> technology<00:00:23.449> to

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
because we've used a technology to

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.380 
because we've used a technology to
sandwich<00:00:24.289> silver<00:00:24.980> elements<00:00:25.640> between<00:00:26.060> two

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
sandwich silver elements between two

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.630 
sandwich silver elements between two
pieces<00:00:26.539> of<00:00:26.750> laminate<00:00:27.259> so<00:00:28.070> what<00:00:28.220> you<00:00:28.310> get<00:00:28.489> is<00:00:28.609> a

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
pieces of laminate so what you get is a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.150 
pieces of laminate so what you get is a
super<00:00:28.970> flat<00:00:29.359> antenna<00:00:29.810> that's<00:00:30.649> using<00:00:31.070> a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
super flat antenna that's using a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.250 
super flat antenna that's using a
traditional<00:00:31.340> design<00:00:32.000> for<00:00:32.870> high<00:00:33.020> gain

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
traditional design for high gain

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.160 
traditional design for high gain
reception<00:00:34.269> we've<00:00:35.269> already<00:00:35.449> established<00:00:36.110> that

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
reception we've already established that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.869 
reception we've already established that
the<00:00:36.350> HD<00:00:36.530> blades<00:00:36.949> a<00:00:37.100> pretty<00:00:37.339> cool<00:00:37.550> looking

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
the HD blades a pretty cool looking

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.060 
the HD blades a pretty cool looking
antenna<00:00:38.269> but<00:00:38.750> what<00:00:38.930> really<00:00:39.199> matters<00:00:39.500> is<00:00:39.920> how

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
antenna but what really matters is how

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.009 
antenna but what really matters is how
well<00:00:40.339> it<00:00:40.519> works<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.329> don't<00:00:41.510> take<00:00:41.629> my<00:00:41.690> word<00:00:41.989> for

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
well it works so don't take my word for

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.819 
well it works so don't take my word for
it<00:00:42.290> let's<00:00:42.409> hook<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:42.800> up<00:00:42.949> and<00:00:43.100> find<00:00:43.339> out<00:00:44.470> okay<00:00:45.470> we

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
it let's hook it up and find out okay we

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.720 
it let's hook it up and find out okay we
have<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.070> HD<00:00:46.579> blade<00:00:46.820> here<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.930> an<00:00:48.140> HDTV<00:00:48.949> I'm

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
have the HD blade here and an HDTV I'm

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.799 
have the HD blade here and an HDTV I'm
gonna<00:00:49.910> hook<00:00:50.030> them<00:00:50.180> up<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.420> see<00:00:50.600> how<00:00:50.750> many

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
gonna hook them up and see how many

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.099 
gonna hook them up and see how many
channels<00:00:51.350> we<00:00:51.469> can<00:00:51.500> pull<00:00:51.829> in<00:00:52.239> first<00:00:53.239> step<00:00:53.420> let's

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
channels we can pull in first step let's

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.640 
channels we can pull in first step let's
hook<00:00:54.260> up<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.469> cable

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.340 

and<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:01.670> next<00:01:01.850> step<00:01:02.090> is<00:01:02.330> do<00:01:02.780> at<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.020> other<00:01:03.170> end

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
and the next step is do at the other end

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.700 
and the next step is do at the other end
of<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.560> cable<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.250> TV<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:05.780> do<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.140> you'll

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
of the cable to the TV to do that you'll

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.250 
of the cable to the TV to do that you'll
connect<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.670> input<00:01:07.820> label<00:01:08.450> of<00:01:08.510> an<00:01:08.750> T

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
connect it to the input label of an T

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.010 
connect it to the input label of an T
for<00:01:09.560> antenna<00:01:09.890> or<00:01:10.460> cable<00:01:10.970> TV<00:01:13.600> now<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.780> we<00:01:14.870> have

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
for antenna or cable TV now that we have

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.260 
for antenna or cable TV now that we have
the<00:01:15.140> antenna<00:01:15.470> hooked<00:01:15.740> up<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.130> TV<00:01:16.310> it's

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
the antenna hooked up to the TV it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.880 
the antenna hooked up to the TV it's
time<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.630> find<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.930> proper<00:01:18.290> placement<00:01:18.560> for

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
time to find the proper placement for

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.680 
time to find the proper placement for
the<00:01:19.010> antenna<00:01:19.369> this<00:01:19.970> is<00:01:20.030> something<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:20.540> can

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
the antenna this is something you can

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.750 
the antenna this is something you can
play<00:01:20.840> around<00:01:20.990> with<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.979> best<00:01:22.190> locations

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
play around with but the best locations

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.990 
play around with but the best locations
are<00:01:22.910> usually<00:01:23.210> up<00:01:23.420> high<00:01:23.720> on<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.290> wall<00:01:24.560> or<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:25.850> can

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
are usually up high on a wall or you can

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.690 
are usually up high on a wall or you can
lay<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.270> flat<00:01:26.560> for<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.710> I'm<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.160> confident<00:01:28.580> in

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
lay it flat for this I'm so confident in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.950 
lay it flat for this I'm so confident in
the<00:01:28.760> antenna<00:01:29.000> that's<00:01:29.119> gonna<00:01:29.330> toss<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.750> right

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
the antenna that's gonna toss it right

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.719 
the antenna that's gonna toss it right
here<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.619> let's<00:01:30.770> see<00:01:30.920> how<00:01:31.070> many<00:01:31.130> channels<00:01:31.610> we

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
here and let's see how many channels we

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.080 
here and let's see how many channels we
pull<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.830> okay<00:01:33.830> we've<00:01:33.979> got<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.310> TV<00:01:34.670> hooked<00:01:34.880> up

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
pull it okay we've got the TV hooked up

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.570 
pull it okay we've got the TV hooked up
to<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.360> antenna<00:01:35.770> now<00:01:36.770> we<00:01:36.830> have<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.430> do<00:01:37.550> a

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
to the antenna now we have to do a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.870 
to the antenna now we have to do a
channel<00:01:38.060> scan<00:01:38.470> every<00:01:39.470> TV<00:01:39.680> is<00:01:39.920> different<00:01:40.130> but

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
channel scan every TV is different but

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.330 
channel scan every TV is different but
basically<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.630> go<00:01:41.810> into<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.320> menu<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.830> TV

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
basically you go into the menu of the TV

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.290 
basically you go into the menu of the TV
and<00:01:43.750> then<00:01:44.750> find<00:01:45.110> channels<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:46.119> then<00:01:47.119> there's

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
and then find channels and then there's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.780 
and then find channels and then there's
an<00:01:47.390> option<00:01:47.450> called<00:01:47.960> scan<00:01:48.770> for<00:01:49.040> channels<00:01:49.070> Auto

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
an option called scan for channels Auto

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.870 
an option called scan for channels Auto
scan<00:01:50.330> or<00:01:50.570> auto<00:01:50.990> search<00:01:53.229> also<00:01:54.369> very<00:01:55.369> important

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
scan or auto search also very important

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.540 
scan or auto search also very important
make<00:01:56.300> sure<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:56.630> select<00:01:56.869> antenna<00:01:57.560> not<00:01:58.039> cable

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
make sure you select antenna not cable

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.469 
make sure you select antenna not cable
TV<00:01:59.680> this<00:02:00.680> process<00:02:01.190> can<00:02:01.399> take<00:02:01.430> up<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.910> 10

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
TV this process can take up to 10

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.300 
TV this process can take up to 10
minutes<00:02:02.690> but<00:02:03.170> usually<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.800> only<00:02:03.920> takes<00:02:04.220> a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
minutes but usually it only takes a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:12.160 
minutes but usually it only takes a
couple
