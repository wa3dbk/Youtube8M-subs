00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hide your phones cape 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.920
 Internet connection in less than two weeks 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.020
 or 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.929
 in a few days watch talks will be released 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.179
 with the new hacker hero aidan pearce 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.190
 and we looked at something 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.389
 since the announcement of hot stocks 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.389
 everything happens 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.040
 Watchdog has been at the scene since 2009 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.079
 ubisoft montreal in development 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.760
 not a bad address for the guys 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.470
 and girls already have some 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.629
 high caliber made for example 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.650
 splinter cell the prince of persia 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.339
 trilogy diverse rainbow six litter 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:07.630
 Assassin's creed and of course already 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:10.690
 logo and now watchdog already the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.300
 Announcement at the e3 2012 was a 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.430
 bang because she can completely 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.810
 surprisingly and makes it deeper 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.940
 laid jaw after just dance 4 dem 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.770
 obligatory assassin's creed and 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.259
 typical e3 embarrassments too strong that 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.530
 shown gameplay material by hot 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.690
 stocks extremely positive out how cool 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.250
 the sound on our smartphone 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.320
 let's leave the mobile network 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.550
 collapse meet an ihs 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.550
 Moody Asian 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.250
 then we hear phone calls drop off 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.690
 and yet two important ones remained in 2012 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.150
 ask open when and for which 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.340
 Platforms seems that at all 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.280
 that is not the case at all 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.100
 after ps3 or xbox 360 level off one 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.530
 little reminder at this time 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.900
 again something about the xbox one was still 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.600
 known beyond the playstation 4 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.600
 Thus, only the pc and the bis remained 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.840
 date only next gen console the view 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.900
 But seriously somebody has somebody 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.680
 believed that the e3 demo on the julis 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.540
 sorry but only a short time after the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.060
 press conference finally came over 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.550
 twitter a semi official answer the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.550
 shown demo ran on a pc 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.770
 then there were several months 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.080
 long silence about Ubisoft's action 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.880
 adventure but now it belongs 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.580
 the good sound of everyone 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.200
 game development the advance 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.610
 unannounced info by small 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.070
 misadventures and not 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.790
 trusted employees 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.660
 become 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.470
 so it managed a gamestop flyer on 15 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.360
 february 2013 on the main page of 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.750
 kotaku.com to see was the fact 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.600
 answer to two our question 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.560
 Christmas 2013 was there and for everyone 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.870
 consoles 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.830
 besides, the talk was about a truly 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.830
 nexgen adventure was on a ps4 xbox 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.200
 and wii u version indicated four days 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.020
 later the new version appeared 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.330
 Amazon announced a day later Ububoft 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.730
 at Sony's press conference with a 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.380
 new demut stocks single launchtitel 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.560
 for the ps4 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.720
 later also became the xbox version 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.880
 confirmed the gamer in a good mood 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.300
 So make your pre-orders 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.130
 But stop only one month before 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.770
 release of the new next consoles 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.750
 ubisoft moved the big launch title 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.150
 in the spring of 2014 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.980
 the reason you needed even more 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.490
 time the desired quality 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.660
 reach or around the competitor gta 5 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.600
 Dodge anyway , the message struck 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.090
 To bel date a massive hysteria 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.060
 pure a classic nerd rage in 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.799
 reinform from the otherwise racing games crew 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.209
 by the way was also moved but 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.750
 that did not interest anyone 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.120
 in a bad mood it was 2014 directly 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.370
 continue instead of a new release date 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.180
 is from the stamping of the eu version 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.490
 spoken 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.980
 but do not worry her neglected 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.960
 nintendo in the aftermath became yours 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.950
 only a few months 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.260
 postponed 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.060
 the reason the resources of the team 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.830
 have been refocused with that 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.380
 employees and the community of players 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.910
 We benefit equally from this 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.370
 translate this press release times 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.410
 just for you that is in the clear text 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.580
 no one will buy it and we will 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.740
 do not deserve it 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.050
 on 6 march it was finally time 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.370
 ubisoft delights us with a new one 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.300
 release date of 27 may 2014 should be 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.850
 so be 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.240
 matching it there was a story trailer 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.610
 This once again made for furore 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.130
 times, however, in a negative way and 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.500
 wise, technically, hot dogs looks 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.260
 suddenly worse around worlds than 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:24.280
 in material shown so far seriously 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.810
 take a look at this 2012 2014 2012 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.150
 2014 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.010
 oh well, that's why it does it 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.650
 new material playfully continues 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.690
 a damn good impression as well 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.729
 we finally got a few scenes out 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.740
 the multiplayer mode to face the 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.169
 should be seamless in the nearly 40 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.000
 insert an hour-long singles campaign 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.130
 and next to classically oriented 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.260
 play modes a copy of the hate 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.860
 beloved invader from dark souls 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.590
 contain 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.510
 in addition, let many positive 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.440
 previews on a real blockbuster 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.020
 to hope 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.690
 So dear children let you be told 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.320
 good graphics does not make a good one for a long time 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.000
 game 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.380
 and even if mott stocks in the 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.600
 past two years 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.210
 a proper pr rollercoaster ride 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.250
 has laid down as he looks forward to gambling 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.250
 us on it 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.470
 so if you have read the video title 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.270
 then you saw that it was the whole one 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.010
 way to release means that is one 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.420
 a little new idea that we have 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.440
 not quite worked out yet 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.000
 For example, we are still at all 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.920
 not sure if that's also the ideal 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.110
 The title for this is maybe catching 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.670
 increase in any case, write in 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.710
 the comments what you think of the idea 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.600
 So keep a game of the quasi 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.700
 Announcement it is then in the trade 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.800
 to sum up a bit 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.750
 in any case but also if you still 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.860
 a horny field was right 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.370
 I think somehow cool myself 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.140
 not yet 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.940
 and of course should definitely be in 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.680
 The comments write down her hot 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.810
 stocks whether I'll pick that up 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.240
 You may be skeptical if he really does 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.250
 content is just asking in the whole 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.930
 comments there is a lot of space 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.970
 and there you can, for example, too 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.380
 give a thumbs up to us and if 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.040
 you have not done it yet the abo 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.040
