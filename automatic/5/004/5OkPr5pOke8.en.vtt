pretty<00:00:56.699> solid<00:00:57.149> solid<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.930> their<00:00:58.109> main

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
pretty solid solid but their main

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.260 
pretty solid solid but their main
strength<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.370> their<00:00:59.489> sides<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.969> trying<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
strength is their sides and trying to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.700 
strength is their sides and trying to
get<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.449> offensive<00:01:00.780> boys<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> get<00:01:01.469> putbacks
