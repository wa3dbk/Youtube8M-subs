some<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.070> Pokemon<00:00:20.520> merchandise<00:00:21.000> I'm

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
some of my Pokemon merchandise I'm

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
some of my Pokemon merchandise I'm
starting<00:00:21.810> out<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.080> guy<00:00:22.380> because<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
starting out with this guy because I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.370 
starting out with this guy because I
just<00:00:23.189> previously<00:00:23.400> done<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> video<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.630> putting

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380

just previously done a video of putting
him<00:00:25.529> together<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> figured<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.539> would<00:00:27.660> be

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
him together so I figured that would be

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.790 
him together so I figured that would be
a<00:00:27.810> good<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> start<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:29.929> so<00:00:30.929> let's<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.679> on

with<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.570> this<00:00:33.570> might<00:00:34.410> turn<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.680> whole

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
with this this might turn this whole

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.340 
with this this might turn this whole
thing<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.899> there<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:36.960> go<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.260> can

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.870 
live in Texas and it's very very humid
so<00:05:09.290> if<00:05:09.530> you<00:05:09.860> know<00:05:09.980> worst<00:05:10.190> comes<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.490> worst<00:05:10.580> I

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
so if you know worst comes to worst I

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.500 
so if you know worst comes to worst I
can<00:05:10.940> just<00:05:11.150> glue<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:11.480> on<00:05:11.920> but<00:05:13.330> that's<00:05:14.330> really

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
can just glue it on but that's really

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.530 
can just glue it on but that's really
the<00:05:14.690> only<00:05:14.720> dislike<00:05:15.290> that<00:05:15.500> I<00:05:15.560> have<00:05:15.770> about<00:05:16.070> him

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
the only dislike that I have about him

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.800 
the only dislike that I have about him

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
he otherwise he's very well

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.810 
he otherwise he's very well
maybe<00:05:19.020> for<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.770> figure<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.490> have<00:05:20.669> to

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
maybe for a figure that you have to

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.520 
maybe for a figure that you have to
build<00:05:21.030> he<00:05:21.360> has<00:05:21.570> very<00:05:21.870> nice<00:05:22.139> detail<00:05:24.050> in<00:05:25.050> the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
build he has very nice detail in the

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.260 
build he has very nice detail in the
knee<00:05:25.770> of<00:05:25.830> course<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.190> two<00:05:26.400> stands<00:05:26.760> and<00:05:27.060> stuff

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
like that again this is something that I

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.159 
like that again this is something that I

are just starting out collecting since

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.409 
are just starting out collecting since
he's<00:05:33.180> not<00:05:33.389> very<00:05:33.690> expensive<00:05:34.230> at<00:05:34.320> all<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:35.419> he's

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
he's not very expensive at all and he's

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.450 
he's not very expensive at all and he's
relatively<00:05:37.200> easy<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.740> find<00:05:37.950> I'll<00:05:38.190> go<00:05:38.340> ahead
