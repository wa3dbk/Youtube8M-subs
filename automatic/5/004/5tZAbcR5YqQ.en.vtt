removing these all right this point we

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
removing these all right this point we
can<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.489> ahead<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.789> stall<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> hitch<00:00:54.239> with

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
can go ahead and stall the hitch with

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
can go ahead and stall the hitch with
the<00:00:54.420> fasteners<00:00:55.079> towards<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> end<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.010> the

the fasteners towards the end of the
vehicle<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.329> good<00:00:57.600> idea<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.050> an

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
vehicle and it's good idea to have an

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.599 
vehicle and it's good idea to have an
extra<00:00:58.140> set<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> hands<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.219> slow<00:00:59.460> on

extra set of hands with just one slow on
the<00:00:59.699> wide<00:00:59.850> side<00:01:00.379> we'll<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.829> temporarily

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the wide side we'll just temporarily

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.649 
the wide side we'll just temporarily
install<00:01:02.579> those<00:01:02.670> bolts

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.609 

let's<00:01:09.659> forget<00:01:09.780> your<00:01:10.020> hitch<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.470> what

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
let's forget your hitch up there what

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.510 
let's forget your hitch up there what
we're<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.280> ahead<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
we're going to do is go ahead and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.039 
we're going to do is go ahead and
actually<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> centered<00:01:12.450> first<00:01:12.780> so

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
actually get it centered first so

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
actually get it centered first so
because<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.680> drilling<00:01:14.040> holes<00:01:14.250> out

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
because we got drilling holes out

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.789 
because we got drilling holes out
towards<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> front<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.240> vehicle<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.869> we

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
towards the front of the vehicle and we

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
towards the front of the vehicle and we
have<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.009> get<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> straight<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.090> off<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
have to get it straight right off the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.330 
have to get it straight right off the
bat<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.720> there's<00:01:18.869> no<00:01:19.020> holes<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:20.040> adjust

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
bat because there's no holes to adjust

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
bat because there's no holes to adjust
it<00:01:20.460> after<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.790> drill<00:01:21.000> our<00:01:21.090> holes<00:01:21.299> well<00:01:21.780> go

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it after we drill our holes well go

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.120 
it after we drill our holes well go
ahead<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.080> standard<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> way<00:01:22.530> want<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.979> we

happen next they'll take down the hitch

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
happen next they'll take down the hitch
it<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.170> run<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.380> whole<00:01:31.500> option<00:01:31.979> 9/16

quarter inch hole drilled out a chav
away<00:01:41.369> it'll<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> larger<00:01:42.570> two<00:01:42.689> 9/16

away it'll go to larger two 9/16
actually<00:01:44.310> leave<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.640> half-inch<00:01:45.090> right<00:01:45.329> now

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
actually leave a half-inch right now

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
actually leave a half-inch right now
then<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:46.200> bit<00:01:46.320> easier<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> 9/16

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
then a little bit easier to go to 9/16

00:01:47.460 --> 00:02:07.719 
then a little bit easier to go to 9/16

that<00:02:10.200> enlarged<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.769> hole<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.670> accept<00:02:12.030> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that enlarged this hole to accept a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.119 
that enlarged this hole to accept a
hardware<00:02:12.510> basically<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.709> large

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
hardware basically you get to large

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.949 
hardware basically you get to large
enough<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.459> get<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.700> piece<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.720> plate

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
enough to get this piece of the plate

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.100 
enough to get this piece of the plate
inside<00:02:16.319> there<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.830> also<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.750> head<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
inside there and also the head of the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.839 
inside there and also the head of the
bolt<00:02:19.260> there's<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.099> variety<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.489> different<00:02:20.640> ways

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
bolt there's a variety of different ways

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.150 
bolt there's a variety of different ways
you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.590> most<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> time<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.040> could

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
you can do this most the time you could

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.979 
you can do this most the time you could
drought<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> series<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.299> half<00:02:24.569> inch<00:02:24.750> holes

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
drought a series of a half inch holes

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.479 
drought a series of a half inch holes
around<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.069> make<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.310> big<00:02:26.459> enough

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
around this just to make it big enough

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.460 
around this just to make it big enough
to<00:02:26.730> run<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> bolt<00:02:27.239> through<00:02:27.420> price<00:02:28.079> of<00:02:28.260> metal

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
to run the bolt through price of metal

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.199 
to run the bolt through price of metal
all<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.620> way<00:02:28.769> also<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.640> could<00:02:29.819> actually<00:02:30.000> use

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
all the way also you could actually use

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.500 
all the way also you could actually use
a<00:02:30.269> cold<00:02:30.599> chisel<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.260> air<00:02:31.500> chisel<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.239> notch<00:02:33.239> it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
a cold chisel or air chisel and notch it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.509 
a cold chisel or air chisel and notch it
out<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.660> little<00:02:33.870> bit<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:35.099> get<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> same

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
out a little bit to to get the same

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.009 
out a little bit to to get the same
effect<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.390> chip<00:02:36.989> away

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
effect and you just have to chip away

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.960 
effect and you just have to chip away
the<00:02:37.530> excess<00:02:38.099> steel<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.730> get<00:02:38.849> your

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
the excess steel just to get your

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.210 
the excess steel just to get your
hardware<00:02:39.299> inside<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.959> think<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.739> might<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:40.950> easy

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
hardware inside I think it might be easy

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.619 
hardware inside I think it might be easy
it's<00:02:41.459> all<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> way<00:02:41.790> around<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.299> go<00:02:42.420> ahead

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
it's all the way around just go ahead

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.539 
it's all the way around just go ahead
and<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:43.049> yourself<00:02:43.140> rather<00:02:43.590> one<00:02:44.220> inch<00:02:44.370> or<00:02:44.519> inch

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
and get yourself rather one inch or inch

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.670 
and get yourself rather one inch or inch
and<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.849> quarter<00:02:45.000> hole<00:02:45.299> saw<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.410> drilled

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and a quarter hole saw and if drilled

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.170 
and a quarter hole saw and if drilled
out<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.129> nice<00:02:47.310> even<00:02:47.670> finish<00:02:47.819> when

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
out you have a nice even finish when

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.789 
out you have a nice even finish when
you're<00:02:48.299> done<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.959> easily<00:02:49.230> touch<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.680> up

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
you're done you can easily touch it up

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.800 
you're done you can easily touch it up
so<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:50.849> see<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.030> left<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.390> little<00:02:51.540> ring<00:02:51.780> here

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
so you can see I left a little ring here

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.449 
so you can see I left a little ring here
to<00:02:52.049> show<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.290> what<00:02:52.319> we're<00:02:52.560> taking<00:02:52.709> out<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.430> a

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
to show you what we're taking out it's a

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.069 
to show you what we're taking out it's a
good<00:02:53.610> idea<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.910> get<00:02:54.000> as<00:02:54.180> close<00:02:54.299> as<00:02:54.420> possible<00:02:54.629> to

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
good idea to get as close as possible to

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.020 
good idea to get as close as possible to
a<00:02:55.200> hole<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.769> have<00:02:56.250> enough<00:02:56.430> steel<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.819> keep

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
a hole and have enough steel just keep

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.150 
a hole and have enough steel just keep
your<00:02:57.150> bit<00:02:57.359> from<00:02:57.540> coming<00:02:57.959> out<00:02:58.079> but<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.950> want<00:02:59.100> to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
your bit from coming out but you want to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.530 
your bit from coming out but you want to
use<00:02:59.310> up<00:02:59.459> as<00:02:59.549> much<00:02:59.700> as<00:02:59.880> original<00:03:00.239> hole<00:03:00.420> as

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
use up as much as original hole as

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.289 
use up as much as original hole as
possible<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:01.739> way<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:01.920> lose<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.579> little

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
possible that way you lose as little

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.729 
possible that way you lose as little
steel<00:03:03.840> as<00:03:04.109> possible<00:03:06.170> with<00:03:07.170> our<00:03:07.260> hole<00:03:07.530> made

actually<00:03:08.310> on<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.430> passenger<00:03:08.819> side<00:03:09.000> we

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
actually on the passenger side we

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.580 
actually on the passenger side we
actually<00:03:09.389> offset<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.810> little<00:03:09.930> bit<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.290> stay

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
actually offset a little bit you stay

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.470 
actually offset a little bit you stay
away<00:03:10.739> from<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.950> heater<00:03:11.099> hose<00:03:11.299> let's<00:03:12.299> go<00:03:12.389> ahead

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and fish our wire through we're just

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.620 
and fish our wire through we're just
using<00:03:13.829> some<00:03:14.160> good<00:03:14.430> old<00:03:14.549> stove<00:03:14.819> wire<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.510> can

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
using some good old stove wire you can

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.180 
using some good old stove wire you can
use<00:03:15.690> safety<00:03:16.170> wire<00:03:16.319> anything<00:03:16.769> it'll<00:03:16.920> hold<00:03:17.040> its

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
use safety wire anything it'll hold its

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.740 
use safety wire anything it'll hold its
shape<00:03:17.250> once<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.790> can<00:03:18.030> wrap<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.239> around<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.510> bolt

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750

half-inch hole the wire might get hung

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.580 
half-inch hole the wire might get hung
up<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.120> there<00:03:36.329> we'll<00:03:36.870> go<00:03:36.959> around<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.470> get

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
up in there we'll go around so to get

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.020 
up in there we'll go around so to get
the<00:03:37.680> plate<00:03:37.919> nice<00:03:38.099> and<00:03:38.310> flat<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.819> know<00:03:38.970> you

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the plate nice and flat and you know you
