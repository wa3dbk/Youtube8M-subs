00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello it's steve home universe du 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.150
 keeper points like your shop in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.650
 line of goalkeepers today I 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.250
 will introduce you to the new glove nike 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.410
 confidences 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.439
 so what a range gain of the collection 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.020
 2013 at nike or to start the 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.070
 design and ultra sophisticated like you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.900
 can see it there are a lot of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.460
 new little details that are not 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.420
 present on the other great tales of 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.050
 so mark the apple the palm and in 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.600
 expandable latex 6 mm it will provide 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.760
 excellent adhesion a very good 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.949
 control of the ball and will reduce the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.479
 impact shocks 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.400
 the apple is long so for a 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.690
 better protection of the wrist 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.430
 also at this level there is going 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.080
 have the customization area if 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.400
 you never want to mark your name or 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.290
 your number for example the top of the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.750
 glove so it's a combination to the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.780
 both latex and textiles 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.619
 country so for excellent comfort and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.879
 very good very good flexibility 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:05.489
 so it's at the level of the closure that 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.620
 nike called innovate so there is no 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.080
 only a Velcro band 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.180
 traditional and one to two so the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 Velcro band there and a little ours 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.090
 additional at that level for a 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.010
 best fit the seams are 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.680
 flat 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.560
 there is just the thumb that rolled for 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.900
 better performance on the top 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.600
 we also have power technology 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.010
 punch so here it's for 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.800
 point clearances a lot more 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.500
 secure and better a better 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.050
 way to stop the flights the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.120
 biovein technology 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.950
 on all the fingers in fact the 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.380
 fingers are going to be ready curbet to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.409
 the origin in a near position 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.060
 caught to facilitate the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.620
 ball shots so that's also going 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.540
 reduce the tensions that are exerted on 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.130
 the hand and to finish especially the glove he 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.320
 there are small perforations of pizzas 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.800
 aeration that will allow a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.080
 better and breathability and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.240
 who will avoid the hand to sweat 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.990
 so here I love design 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.130
 I like the colors flashed 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.950
 so I strongly recommend styles 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.780
 gains in my opinion will suit you 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.070
 perfectly 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.580
 here it was steve from universe du 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.580
