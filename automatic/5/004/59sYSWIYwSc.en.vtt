the things that you want to think about

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.340 
the things that you want to think about
is<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.360> food<00:00:48.600> group<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> start

is what food group do you want to start
with<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.250> find<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> focus<00:00:51.030> on

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
with it and I find it's good to focus on

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.910 
with it and I find it's good to focus on
the<00:00:51.449> food<00:00:51.629> groups<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.110> take<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> longest<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the food groups that take the longest to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.549 
the food groups that take the longest to
prepare<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:54.090> food<00:00:54.390> groups<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.350> just

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
prepare or food groups that you just

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.950 
prepare or food groups that you just
would<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.100> eating<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> let's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
would like to be eating more of so let's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.900 
would like to be eating more of so let's
say<00:00:58.140> Whole<00:00:58.440> Grains<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:59.070> example<00:00:59.550> that's<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
say Whole Grains for example that's a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.090 
say Whole Grains for example that's a
food<00:01:00.239> group<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.690> people<00:01:01.289> probably<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.920> want

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
food group that people probably do want

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
food group that people probably do want
to<00:01:02.190> eat<00:01:02.340> more<00:01:02.520> frequently<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.480> they<00:01:03.600> also

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
to eat more frequently but they also

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.420 
to eat more frequently but they also
take<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> long<00:01:04.199> time<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.530> cook<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> person

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
take a long time to cook so a person

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.130 
take a long time to cook so a person
might<00:01:05.460> batch<00:01:05.880> cook<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.330> huge<00:01:06.600> container<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
might batch cook a huge container of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
might batch cook a huge container of
brown<00:01:07.320> rice<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.490> freeze<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
brown rice and then freeze that in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.210 
brown rice and then freeze that in
individual<00:01:09.630> portions<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.470> perhaps

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
individual portions or perhaps

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
individual portions or perhaps
vegetables<00:01:11.939> most<00:01:12.240> people<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.659> eat<00:01:12.840> them

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
vegetables most people don't eat them

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.320 
vegetables most people don't eat them
frequently<00:01:13.290> enough<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.430> they<00:01:14.760> prepare

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
frequently enough and so they prepare

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390 
frequently enough and so they prepare
things<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.840> large<00:01:16.590> pot<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.979> vegetable

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
things like a large pot of vegetable

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100 
things like a large pot of vegetable
soup<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> vegetable<00:01:18.090> casserole<00:01:18.840> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
soup or a vegetable casserole and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.899 
soup or a vegetable casserole and
getting<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:19.920> manageable<00:01:20.369> portions

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
getting that into manageable portions

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.710 
getting that into manageable portions
can<00:01:21.299> make<00:01:21.450> dinner

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
can make dinner

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.770 
can make dinner
a<00:01:21.869> heck<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> lot<00:01:22.229> easier<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> there's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> few

servings and lately my favorite is using
buffington<00:01:32.240> standard<00:01:33.240> muffin<00:01:33.570> tin<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.110> about

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
buffington standard muffin tin is about

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.920 
buffington standard muffin tin is about
a<00:01:34.590> half<00:01:35.009> cup<00:01:35.040> serving<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> foods<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
a half cup serving and a lot of foods a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
a half cup serving and a lot of foods a
single<00:01:37.350> serving<00:01:37.650> are<00:01:37.799> 1/2<00:01:38.040> cup<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> find

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
single serving are 1/2 cup so I find

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.940 
single serving are 1/2 cup so I find
that<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.720> works<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.409> well<00:01:40.650> for

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that that works really well for

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.819 
that that works really well for
something<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.729> vegetable<00:01:42.450> soup

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
something like vegetable soup

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.929 
something like vegetable soup
particularly<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.009> pureed<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
particularly if it's pureed I like to

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.220 
particularly if it's pureed I like to
take

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
take

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.800 
take
suits<00:01:45.830> directly<00:01:46.370> from<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.760> blender<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:47.360> then

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
suits directly from the blender and then

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.870 
suits directly from the blender and then
pour<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.260> into<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:49.040> half<00:01:49.190> cup<00:01:49.430> portions

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
pour that into the the half cup portions

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.600 
pour that into the the half cup portions
of<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.090> muffin<00:01:50.420> tin<00:01:51.010> when<00:01:52.010> freezing<00:01:52.340> in<00:01:52.520> a

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
of a muffin tin when freezing in a

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.790 
of a muffin tin when freezing in a
muffin<00:01:52.940> tin<00:01:52.970> pretty<00:01:53.870> much<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.230> can<00:01:54.380> freeze<00:01:54.620> to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
muffin tin pretty much you can freeze to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.400 
muffin tin pretty much you can freeze to
all<00:01:54.950> these<00:01:55.160> within<00:01:55.760> I'd<00:01:56.090> say<00:01:56.270> an<00:01:56.330> hour<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:57.260> goes

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
all these within I'd say an hour it goes

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.470 
all these within I'd say an hour it goes
directly<00:01:57.710> into<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.250> freezer<00:01:58.520> not<00:01:59.060> covered

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
directly into the freezer not covered

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.180 
directly into the freezer not covered
and<00:01:59.720> then<00:02:00.110> after<00:02:00.410> it's<00:02:00.530> completely<00:02:00.860> frozen

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
and then after it's completely frozen

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.160 
and then after it's completely frozen
I'll<00:02:01.610> usually<00:02:01.820> just<00:02:02.060> transfer<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.140> a

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
I'll usually just transfer that to a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.350 
I'll usually just transfer that to a
sheet<00:02:03.410> pan<00:02:03.620> so<00:02:04.810> head<00:02:05.810> over<00:02:06.940> silicon<00:02:07.940> bakery

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
sheet pan so head over silicon bakery

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.120 
sheet pan so head over silicon bakery
would<00:02:08.510> be<00:02:08.660> great<00:02:08.990> for<00:02:09.230> this<00:02:09.380> because<00:02:09.860> that's

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
would be great for this because that's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.310 
would be great for this because that's
pretty<00:02:10.700> flexible<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.270> easy<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.750> pop<00:02:11.960> that<00:02:12.140> out

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
pretty flexible and easy to pop that out

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.230 
pretty flexible and easy to pop that out
but<00:02:12.920> if<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.040> don't<00:02:13.220> have<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.670> usually<00:02:14.120> you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
but if you don't have that usually you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.200 
but if you don't have that usually you
can<00:02:14.480> pop<00:02:15.350> out<00:02:15.530> single<00:02:16.340> servings<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.940> knock<00:02:17.090> it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
can pop out single servings and knock it

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.210 
can pop out single servings and knock it
onto<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.510> sheet<00:02:17.690> pan<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.710> then<00:02:18.830> once<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.100> have

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
onto the sheet pan so then once you have

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.000 
onto the sheet pan so then once you have
your<00:02:19.310> single<00:02:19.490> servings<00:02:20.650> those<00:02:21.650> can<00:02:21.920> go

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
your single servings those can go

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.790 
your single servings those can go
directly<00:02:22.370> into<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.760> ziploc<00:02:23.180> gallon<00:02:23.540> bag<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:24.680> do

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
directly into a ziploc gallon bag you do

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.410 
directly into a ziploc gallon bag you do
want<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.040> make<00:02:25.160> sure<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.700> label<00:02:26.000> things

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420

help<00:02:41.650> some<00:02:42.650> folks<00:02:43.130> are<00:02:43.430> nervous<00:02:43.700> about<00:02:43.910> having

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
help some folks are nervous about having

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.990 
help some folks are nervous about having
plastic<00:02:44.980> contacting<00:02:45.980> their<00:02:46.130> food<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.610> another

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
plastic contacting their food so another

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.520 
plastic contacting their food so another
method<00:02:47.210> where<00:02:47.600> you<00:02:47.690> could<00:02:47.840> still<00:02:48.050> use<00:02:48.110> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
method where you could still use the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.870 
method where you could still use the
gallon<00:02:48.890> bags<00:02:49.100> because<00:02:49.520> they're<00:02:49.640> pretty

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
gallon bags because they're pretty

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.510 
gallon bags because they're pretty
convenient<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.480> flexible<00:02:50.680> would<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.130> take

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
convenient and flexible would be to take

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.760 
convenient and flexible would be to take
apart<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:52.970> paper<00:02:53.240> and<00:02:53.660> make<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> pouch<00:02:54.080> which

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
apart to a paper and make a pouch which

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.530 
apart to a paper and make a pouch which
also<00:02:54.980> helps<00:02:55.400> with<00:02:55.580> labeling<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.270> can<00:02:56.420> write

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
also helps with labeling you can write

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.120 
also helps with labeling you can write
directly<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.140> parchment<00:02:57.620> paper<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.010> put

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
directly on the parchment paper and put

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.930 
directly on the parchment paper and put
the<00:02:58.220> food<00:02:58.370> inside<00:02:58.730> there<00:03:00.459> another<00:03:01.459> method

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
the food inside there another method

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.350 
the food inside there another method
that<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.120> like<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.600> use<00:03:02.810> for<00:03:03.440> freezing<00:03:03.800> things

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
that I like to use for freezing things

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.660 
that I like to use for freezing things
is<00:03:05.360> our<00:03:05.690> ice<00:03:05.840> cream<00:03:06.050> scoop<00:03:06.380> method<00:03:06.770> standard

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
is our ice cream scoop method standard

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.760 
is our ice cream scoop method standard
ice<00:03:07.910> cream<00:03:08.150> scoop<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.630> also<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.200> half<00:03:09.560> cup

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
ice cream scoop is also a half cup

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.320 
ice cream scoop is also a half cup
serving<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:10.700> if<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.880> have<00:03:11.030> foods<00:03:11.239> that

serving and so if you have foods that
are<00:03:11.510> sticky<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:12.260> hot<00:03:12.920> cereal<00:03:13.340> in<00:03:13.520> this<00:03:13.640> case

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
are sticky like hot cereal in this case

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.750 
are sticky like hot cereal in this case
we<00:03:14.000> have<00:03:14.120> some<00:03:14.330> cooked<00:03:14.600> oatmeal<00:03:15.400> if<00:03:16.400> you're

we have some cooked oatmeal if you're

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.880 
we have some cooked oatmeal if you're
using<00:03:17.180> things<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:17.959> sticky<00:03:18.830> rice<00:03:19.100> or<00:03:20.890> that's

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
using things like sticky rice or that's

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.740 
using things like sticky rice or that's
mashed<00:03:22.190> potatoes<00:03:22.700> actually<00:03:23.150> freeze<00:03:23.420> quite

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
mashed potatoes actually freeze quite

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.690 
mashed potatoes actually freeze quite
well<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:24.950> would<00:03:25.070> do<00:03:25.220> those<00:03:25.430> half<00:03:25.670> a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
well and so you would do those half a

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.850 
well and so you would do those half a
cup<00:03:25.940> portions<00:03:26.390> load<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.930> up<00:03:27.050> into<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.380> pan<00:03:27.680> in

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
cup portions load it up into a pan in

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.890 
cup portions load it up into a pan in
our<00:03:27.980> sheet<00:03:28.220> pan<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:28.730> then<00:03:29.180> put<00:03:29.330> again<00:03:29.720> that

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
our sheet pan and then put again that

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.420 
our sheet pan and then put again that
directly<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.410> freezer<00:03:30.650> no<00:03:30.950> need<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.250> cover

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
directly in the freezer no need to cover

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.870 
directly in the freezer no need to cover
it<00:03:31.670> once<00:03:32.270> that's<00:03:32.510> frozen<00:03:32.810> again<00:03:33.880> transferring

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
it once that's frozen again transferring

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.979 
it once that's frozen again transferring
it<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.209> ziplock<00:03:36.020> bag<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.820> also<00:03:37.820> find<00:03:38.750> that

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
it to the ziplock bag I also find that

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.320 
it to the ziplock bag I also find that
there<00:03:39.170> are<00:03:39.230> some<00:03:39.410> foods<00:03:39.770> such<00:03:40.670> as<00:03:40.700> legumes

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
there are some foods such as legumes

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.510 
there are some foods such as legumes
that<00:03:41.720> freeze<00:03:42.020> well<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.770> a<00:03:42.830> sheet<00:03:43.130> pan<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.310> a

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
that freeze well on a sheet pan in a

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.790 
that freeze well on a sheet pan in a
single<00:03:43.850> layer<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.780> legumes<00:03:45.110> can<00:03:45.260> take<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.560> long

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
single layer so legumes can take a long

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.860 
single layer so legumes can take a long
time<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.220> cook<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.700> might<00:03:47.239> batch<00:03:47.450> cook<00:03:47.750> an

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
time to cook I might batch cook an

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.660 
time to cook I might batch cook an
entire<00:03:48.170> bag<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.500> chick<00:03:48.890> peas<00:03:48.920> or<00:03:49.280> black<00:03:49.459> beans

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.470 
entire bag of chick peas or black beans
and<00:03:50.150> then<00:03:50.450> read<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.110> food<00:03:51.380> out<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.120> single

and then read that food out in a single

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.530 
and then read that food out in a single
layer<00:03:54.310> allow<00:03:55.310> them<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.609> freeze<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.209> then<00:03:56.299> once

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
layer allow them to freeze and then once

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.300 
layer allow them to freeze and then once
that<00:03:56.750> froze<00:03:57.019> is<00:03:57.380> frozen<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.799> can<00:03:57.980> just<00:03:58.160> take

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
that froze is frozen you can just take

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.800 
that froze is frozen you can just take
it<00:03:58.340> out<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.670> kind<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.090> crack<00:03:59.390> it<00:03:59.510> like<00:03:59.630> an<00:03:59.720> ice

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810

cube tray it all crumbles up loose and
then<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.600> have<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.870> gallon<00:04:03.680> bag<00:04:03.859> of<00:04:04.250> loose

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
then you have a gallon bag of loose

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.069 
then you have a gallon bag of loose
chickpeas<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.660> scoop<00:04:05.900> out<00:04:06.019> the

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
chickpeas so you can scoop out the

amount that you want the final method
that<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.500> will<00:04:09.739> sometimes<00:04:10.220> use<00:04:10.549> is<00:04:10.940> if<00:04:11.299> you<00:04:11.329> have

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
that I will sometimes use is if you have

you have a freezer up top these plastic

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.690 
you have a freezer up top these plastic
shubin's<00:05:11.900> are<00:05:12.080> pretty<00:05:12.290> good<00:05:12.440> size<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.550> you

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
shubin's are pretty good size and you

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.900 
shubin's are pretty good size and you
might<00:05:13.880> then<00:05:14.380> use<00:05:15.380> smaller<00:05:15.710> bags<00:05:16.010> of<00:05:16.220> food<00:05:16.430> so

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
might then use smaller bags of food so

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.370 
might then use smaller bags of food so
if<00:05:17.000> there's<00:05:17.150> some<00:05:17.330> tsukimi<00:05:17.870> from<00:05:18.080> my<00:05:18.200> garden

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
if there's some tsukimi from my garden

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.620 
if there's some tsukimi from my garden
last<00:05:18.740> year<00:05:19.010> if<00:05:19.490> I<00:05:19.580> had<00:05:19.730> small<00:05:20.030> containers<00:05:20.450> like

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
last year if I had small containers like

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.930 
last year if I had small containers like
this<00:05:20.870> I<00:05:21.200> might<00:05:21.710> just<00:05:21.920> use<00:05:21.950> one<00:05:22.340> bin<00:05:22.550> for<00:05:22.790> all

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
this I might just use one bin for all

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.710 
this I might just use one bin for all
precooked<00:05:23.570> vegetable<00:05:24.139> items<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:25.690> have<00:05:26.690> a

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
precooked vegetable items I have a

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.629 
precooked vegetable items I have a
side-by-side<00:05:27.200> at<00:05:27.740> home<00:05:27.950> so<00:05:28.160> I<00:05:28.190> tend<00:05:28.490> to<00:05:28.520> use

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
side-by-side at home so I tend to use

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.740 
side-by-side at home so I tend to use
very<00:05:28.850> large<00:05:29.150> bins

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
very large bins

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.050 
very large bins
so<00:05:30.290> I<00:05:30.320> would<00:05:30.650> put<00:05:30.889> load<00:05:31.370> this<00:05:31.520> up<00:05:31.700> with<00:05:31.910> all

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
so I would put load this up with all

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.120 
so I would put load this up with all
different<00:05:32.300> starches<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.110> that<00:05:33.200> would<00:05:33.320> be<00:05:33.440> one

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
different starches and that would be one

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.250 
different starches and that would be one
drawer<00:05:34.370> in<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.580> freezer<00:05:34.930> we<00:05:35.930> have<00:05:36.050> another

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
drawer in the freezer we have another

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.620 
drawer in the freezer we have another
one<00:05:36.500> for<00:05:36.680> fruits<00:05:36.980> and<00:05:37.280> one<00:05:37.370> for<00:05:37.580> vegetables<00:05:38.090> so

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
one for fruits and one for vegetables so

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.730 
one for fruits and one for vegetables so
when<00:05:38.870> you're<00:05:38.990> trying<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.200> put<00:05:39.380> together<00:05:39.500> a
