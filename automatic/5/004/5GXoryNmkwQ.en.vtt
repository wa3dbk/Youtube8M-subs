that<00:02:19.349> I'm<00:02:19.499> going<00:02:19.829> to<00:02:19.920> use<00:02:20.489> for<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.999> bow<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
that I'm going to use for the bow and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.970 
that I'm going to use for the bow and
I've<00:02:22.650> got<00:02:22.889> three<00:02:23.249> different<00:02:23.400> ribbons<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.950> I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
I've got three different ribbons see I

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.849 
I've got three different ribbons see I
can<00:02:26.219> make<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:27.060> filler<00:02:30.109> to<00:02:31.109> floor<00:02:31.469> three

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
can make one filler to floor three

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.280 
can make one filler to floor three
fillers<00:02:32.249> right<00:02:32.519> here<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.870> what<00:02:34.049> I'll<00:02:34.170> probably

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
fillers right here so what I'll probably

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.580 
fillers right here so what I'll probably
do<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.769> do<00:02:35.189> a<00:02:35.299> solid<00:02:36.299> color<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.379> bottom

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
do is do a solid color on the bottom

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.330 
do is do a solid color on the bottom
just<00:02:38.489> pinch<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.329> middle<00:02:40.129> and<00:02:41.129> then

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
just pinch it in the middle and then

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.309 
just pinch it in the middle and then
we'll<00:02:41.629> just<00:02:42.629> overlap<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:44.340> dotted<00:02:44.909> ribbon

like<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.799> mean<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.519> make<00:02:50.700> them<00:02:50.939> in<00:02:51.180> like

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
like so I mean you can make them in like

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.800 
like so I mean you can make them in like
how<00:02:52.379> we<00:02:52.439> do<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.069> pinwheels

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.860 

just<00:02:57.810> pinch<00:03:00.409> and<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.829> do<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.219> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
or you can just put them one on top of

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.149 
or you can just put them one on top of
the<00:03:06.510> other<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.379> just<00:03:07.439> kind<00:03:07.859> of<00:03:09.019> layer<00:03:10.019> them

the other and just kind of layer them

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.699 
the other and just kind of layer them
pinch<00:03:11.159> in<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> middle<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:13.079> secure<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.650> like

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
pinch in the middle and secure it like

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.649 
pinch in the middle and secure it like
that<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.549> we're<00:03:14.969> going<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.150> do<00:03:15.269> three<00:03:15.629> of

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
that and we're going to do three of

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.929 
that and we're going to do three of

of my ribbon fillers ready now I just

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.979 
of my ribbon fillers ready now I just
need<00:03:24.629> to<00:03:24.989> figure<00:03:25.709> out<00:03:25.859> what<00:03:26.340> else<00:03:27.120> we're<00:03:27.840> going

and then next you're going to come and
just<00:05:03.060> flip<00:05:04.060> open<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:05.310> loops<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:08.310> then<00:05:09.310> you

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
just flip open the loops and then you

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.940 
just flip open the loops and then you
can<00:05:09.610> spread<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.090> out<00:05:10.350> and<00:05:11.350> that's<00:05:11.470> how<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.740> make

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
can spread it out and that's how I make

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.240 
can spread it out and that's how I make
that<00:05:12.540> okay<00:05:13.540> now<00:05:14.110> comes<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.560> fun<00:05:14.710> part<00:05:14.950> we're

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
that okay now comes the fun part we're

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.640 
that okay now comes the fun part we're
just<00:05:15.400> going<00:05:15.640> to<00:05:15.760> insert<00:05:16.120> everything<00:05:16.650> in

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
just going to insert everything in

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.740 
just going to insert everything in
between<00:05:18.100> our<00:05:18.130> loops<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.910> to<00:05:19.030> do<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:19.390> just

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
between our loops and to do that just

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.080 
between our loops and to do that just
tug<00:05:20.380> on<00:05:20.530> your<00:05:20.680> loops<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:21.190> open<00:05:21.430> them<00:05:21.550> out<00:05:21.700> and

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
tug on your loops to open them out and

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.510 
tug on your loops to open them out and
where<00:05:22.330> you've<00:05:22.480> got<00:05:22.660> your<00:05:22.900> elastic<00:05:23.620> just

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
where you've got your elastic just

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.120 
where you've got your elastic just
rewrap<00:05:25.090> your<00:05:25.750> layers<00:05:26.850> with<00:05:27.850> more<00:05:28.120> elastic<00:05:28.780> and

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
rewrap your layers with more elastic and

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.600 
rewrap your layers with more elastic and
there<00:05:30.130> is<00:05:30.220> no<00:05:30.400> wrong<00:05:30.730> way<00:05:31.210> or<00:05:32.050> right<00:05:32.530> way<00:05:32.800> to

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
there is no wrong way or right way to

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.410 
there is no wrong way or right way to
this<00:05:33.790> Bo<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.450> just<00:05:34.630> make<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:34.900> your<00:05:35.680> own<00:05:35.740> way

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
this Bo you just make it your own way

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.870 
this Bo you just make it your own way
I'm<00:05:37.420> going<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.200> first<00:05:38.560> start<00:05:39.190> inserting<00:05:39.550> my

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
I'm going to first start inserting my

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.760 
I'm going to first start inserting my
ribbon<00:05:40.210> pieces<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:40.990> I'm<00:05:41.260> probably<00:05:41.440> just

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
ribbon pieces and I'm probably just

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.190 
ribbon pieces and I'm probably just
going<00:05:42.010> to<00:05:42.130> put<00:05:42.310> this<00:05:42.460> up<00:05:42.640> at<00:05:42.790> 3<00:05:43.120> just<00:05:43.930> in<00:05:44.080> these

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
going to put this up at 3 just in these

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.500 
going to put this up at 3 just in these
middle<00:05:44.620> 3<00:05:44.920> loops<00:05:45.190> here<00:05:46.230> so<00:05:47.230> I'll<00:05:47.290> put<00:05:47.560> one<00:05:47.800> here

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
middle 3 loops here so I'll put one here

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.920
