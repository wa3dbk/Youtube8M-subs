special features of our ink again we're

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.580 
special features of our ink again we're
marketing<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.450> sixty<00:03:44.870> second<00:03:45.230> white<00:03:45.410> and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
marketing the sixty second white and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.480 
marketing the sixty second white and
cure<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.130> Firebird<00:03:46.820> textile<00:03:47.270> inks<00:03:51.340> going<00:03:52.340> right

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
cure a Firebird textile inks going right

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:01.380 
cure a Firebird textile inks going right
into<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.820> heat<00:03:52.970> press<00:03:53.180> here<00:03:53.420> we<00:03:53.510> go

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:10.730 

or<00:04:02.390> another<00:04:02.660> sheet<00:04:02.930> here<00:04:03.140> together

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.920 

so<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> temperature<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.150> press<00:04:12.360> again<00:04:12.750> is

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
so the temperature of the press again is

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.750 
so the temperature of the press again is
set<00:04:13.110> at<00:04:13.200> 330<00:04:13.800> degrees<00:04:15.590> we<00:04:16.590> have<00:04:16.620> somewhat<00:04:17.550> of<00:04:17.580> a

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
set at 330 degrees we have somewhat of a

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.280 
set at 330 degrees we have somewhat of a
light<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.180> medium<00:04:18.300> amount<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.990> pressure<00:04:19.200> on

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
the heat press and the idea is to let

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.110 
the heat press and the idea is to let
some<00:04:22.110> of<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.440> moisture<00:04:22.950> escape<00:04:23.580> after<00:04:23.970> the

some of the moisture escape after the

some of the moisture escape after the
