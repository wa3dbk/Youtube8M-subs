 Yes I saw you said the magic wedding ceremony One stroke of that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.800
 I will leave the entrance ceremony with this this is Mr. Lord 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.030
 I feel like it 's Japan 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.830
 Well this is Ma-timed tank that is Narimashitara if Raku NOZU there was towards the front 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:42.960
 It was true, but hey, Japan is wide and pure domestically 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.530
 Keeping making tanks in this way The maintenance of such technology itself is actually a deterrent 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.730
 But 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.510
 This Hitoma type tank Nakamaru 4th grader 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.260
 In fact, the person is 90 type tank of this type before 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:00.250
 Well, it is also this very large but I know the Ground Self-Defense Force Migidai players 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.299
 It is expensive because it is heavy, so it is deployed only in Hokkaido. 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.750
 There is no 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.200
 Even though it's also towards the part of course Fujiä¹ƒå¯Œmechanic school in 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.990
 Big 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.180
 However, I can use this as the head of the dealer 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:18.569
 More compact and cheaper than my sister 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:25.379
 It is amazing 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:29.849
 It will be this Hitomai type tank that fulfills the requirements Nea really 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:34.349
 Japan's only fourth-generation Hu high-tech tank 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:38.560
 There is no such fourth-generation Hu ultra-tech tank in the world 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.170
 Once upon a time the tank was said to be a mass of iron, but in fact 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.750
 Now a tank 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.810
 It's a mass of high tech 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:52.100
 It means that it is supposed to say that all the world's strongest tanks are already 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.100
 I saw it
