00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
my right tackle number 71 also that was

equation also this is a flea-flicker

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.690 
equation also this is a flea-flicker
because<00:01:02.699> no<00:01:03.449> defensive<00:01:04.409> lineman<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.460> front

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
they will walk into and animation so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890

why it appears that the AI defensive

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.219 
why it appears that the AI defensive
line<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:41.670> seems<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.390> throw<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.899> offensive

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
can be created that he's blocking

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.259 
can be created that he's blocking
because<00:02:14.560> he<00:02:14.680> doesn't<00:02:14.890> do<00:02:15.159> that<00:02:15.190> he<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:16.030> walks
