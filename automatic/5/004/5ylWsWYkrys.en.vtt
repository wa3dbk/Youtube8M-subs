00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.700
 faith even though you heard coming back 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 with more life of mother craft that the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.610
 dying channel minecraft that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.949
 that show the forbidden game what ever 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.730
 I would go back well I do not know 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 I'll make this video more to ask. 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.570
 for you the opinion about the return of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.949
 Michael said that there are not a lot of people 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.490
 watching the videos is because anyway I 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.830
 I was unemployed for a long time but in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.649
 especially those who have right there liked 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.290
 ask your opinion but the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.280
 minecraft you guys think back with the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.250
 unicredit some suggestions of being a 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.200
 has already given me the hint of making a 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.590
 Sir, you're going to stop me from surviving. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.489
 I forgot the name now that is the word word 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.760
 in georgia ball was there so I had the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 type the world a window has several 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.129
 jars scattered everywhere 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.500
 separated by viruses in a bottle 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.799
 It is the one that has to survive within the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.320
 bottle eventually come out of the bottle 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:14.310
 Such a short cut I do 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 this kind of map I already did the sky bock was 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.930
 series plus the biggest success of the channel 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.670
 this also in farm and the short one likes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.740
 make this type of map type so 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.290
 but I have is the wanted to know the opinion 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.909
 of you and I liked loads and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.960
 manicure stadium so much is 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.360
 bizarre 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.659
 I do not understand anything about this game anymore 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.090
 get great guetta zombie 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.970
 I 've heard noise about him but public 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.270
 There's a lot of new things, right? 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.890
 I have no idea what to do 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.329
 born again but there is always a lot 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.920
 new thing but in no where 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.380
 start and I've already seen capped the absurd guinea 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.970
 I believe that this super seven cycle 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.399
 Yes, I did 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.369
 completely as if this is the way the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.830
 anhydrous was to be tough 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.120
 so the guy who put this function that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.400
 in the game 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.510
 I do not know why I do not understand why 10 more 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.250
 interesting that it has several 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.489
 ways that you change the trend 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.709
 it looks like an old television is but it is not 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.300
 and always have to whenever it has a sound 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.640
 that I took a fright on the way to 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.670
 first time the pressure type a sound 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.250
 zombie I told you, it's happening. 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.160
 back to normal 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.850
 I think this is not normal 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.200
 the stocking up completely and sickly and 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:51.810
 want or not normal yet 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.610
 It's just the guy that guy got his hands on the people. 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.269
 at the time he did it here I want it 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.489
 I was enjoying the idea a bit. 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.150
 imagining at the guys' meeting there 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:07.230
 had an idea rather absurd or 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.560
 playing congratulations year in the game is to change the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.340
 way the player sees minecraft anyway 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.840
 was under the effect of some 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.000
 for him to know 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.829
 way here for sure but at least folks 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.410
 That's when you know your opinion and 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.480
 as I said I want tips too right 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.940
 depending on what I 'm going to do 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.340
 I liked you if you said what you have 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.440
 Once again, Mexico, for me to stay. 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.410
 completely lost in the thigh having two 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.269
 seeds want you mind 5 cane 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.090
 sugar is awesome that people 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.160
 is in an absurd development here already 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.389
 we can spend the first night is so 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.970
 midnight infamous slab so that 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.700
 Do you want to find interesting in the sector? 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.519
 and I'll give you a lookup 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.980
 First I'll see the reception of you. 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.760
 while the minecraft what I imagine 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.790
 that is positive 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.500
 He grew up as the craft he started. 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.760
 as unicredit determined as unicredit 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.209
 not finished, right? 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.140
 It's not finished yet, but I 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.220
 I think that's all I have to do. 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:16.329
 Talking about today is so personal, and I went 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.630
 this money that has a fever 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.270
 who is is now stopped absurd right you do not have 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.340
 more of this pulp not the scenario already 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.370
 changed also change room 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.949
 now the best scheme in the field to 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.190
 Gaucho team came out a manifesto here was 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:35.919
 just do the opera in sanna that you can 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.870
 to face far damn thing to look 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.250
 crazy I'll go back to think 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.840
 it was like this 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.199
 So I'll leave my subscription 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.199
 It ended the same way around here and I went
