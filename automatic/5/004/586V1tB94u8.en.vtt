00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.000 
soap to get all of the oil off my
fingertips<00:00:50.840> because<00:00:51.079> we're<00:00:51.710> essentially

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
fingertips because we're essentially

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.040 
fingertips because we're essentially
using<00:00:52.399> really<00:00:52.550> fancy<00:00:52.940> stickers<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:53.690> we<00:00:53.899> want

using really fancy stickers and we want

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.360 
using really fancy stickers and we want
to<00:00:54.140> make<00:00:54.230> sure<00:00:54.379> those<00:00:54.559> get<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.739> nice<00:00:54.949> clean

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
to make sure those get a nice clean

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.090 
to make sure those get a nice clean
surface<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:56.300> stick<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.750> I've<00:00:57.050> also<00:00:57.500> used<00:00:57.859> an

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
surface to stick to I've also used an

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.689 
surface to stick to I've also used an
alcohol<00:00:58.519> wipe<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:59.210> wipe<00:00:59.480> off<00:00:59.960> all<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.679> my<00:01:00.980> nails

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
I am mixing and matching so I'm using

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.600 
I am mixing and matching so I'm using
two<00:01:05.870> separate<00:01:06.320> half<00:01:06.680> sheets<00:01:07.250> these<00:01:07.460> have

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
two separate half sheets these have

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.140 
two separate half sheets these have
already<00:01:07.700> been<00:01:07.820> cut<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.240> half<00:01:08.270> I'm<00:01:09.259> using<00:01:09.770> an

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
already been cut in half I'm using an

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.880 
already been cut in half I'm using an
animal<00:01:11.150> print<00:01:11.390> as<00:01:11.600> well<00:01:11.780> as<00:01:11.869> one<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.110> our<00:01:12.200> tints

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
animal print as well as one of our tints

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.550

and as you can see this is what I have

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.640 
and as you can see this is what I have
left<00:01:15.710> over<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.280> far<00:01:16.490> after<00:01:17.390> doing<00:01:17.750> most<00:01:18.079> of<00:01:18.380> my

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
left over so far after doing most of my

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.760 
left over so far after doing most of my
fingers<00:01:19.400> here's<00:01:20.329> another<00:01:20.570> little<00:01:20.780> tip<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:21.320> keep

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
fingers here's another little tip I keep

a<00:01:22.040> cheat<00:01:22.369> sheet<00:01:22.400> where<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.119> write<00:01:23.390> down<00:01:23.600> which

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
a cheat sheet where I write down which

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.859 
a cheat sheet where I write down which
wrap<00:01:24.259> fits<00:01:24.920> each<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.430> my<00:01:25.579> fingers<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.840> I

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
wrap fits each of my fingers so that I

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.810 
wrap fits each of my fingers so that I
don't<00:01:27.140> have<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.439> think<00:01:27.710> each<00:01:27.950> time<00:01:28.310> which<00:01:28.579> one

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
don't have to think each time which one

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.420 
don't have to think each time which one
I<00:01:28.850> need<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.299> use<00:01:29.680> um<00:01:30.680> if<00:01:30.860> it's<00:01:31.009> your<00:01:31.130> first<00:01:31.250> time

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
I need to use um if it's your first time

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.230 
straight up the center of the wrap to
give<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.230> nice<00:03:51.440> tight<00:03:51.860> seal<00:03:52.190> back<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.150> the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
give it a nice tight seal back to the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.220 
give it a nice tight seal back to the
cuticle<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.960> I'm<00:03:54.350> gonna<00:03:54.500> do<00:03:54.710> that<00:03:54.860> around<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
cuticle and I'm gonna do that around the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.850 
cuticle and I'm gonna do that around the
size<00:03:58.420> so<00:03:59.420> our<00:03:59.660> goal<00:03:59.990> is<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.530> get<00:04:00.650> all<00:04:00.830> the

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
size so our goal is to get all the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.800 
size so our goal is to get all the
bubbles<00:04:01.220> out<00:04:01.490> all<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:02.740> air<00:04:03.740> out<00:04:04.450> pushing<00:04:05.450> out

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
bubbles out all of air out pushing out

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.610 
bubbles out all of air out pushing out
and<00:04:06.530> up<00:04:07.040> we<00:04:07.730> want<00:04:07.910> all<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.210> bubbles<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:09.440> come

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
and up we want all the bubbles to come

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.840 
and up we want all the bubbles to come
out<00:04:09.740> instead<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.040> getting<00:04:10.100> truck<00:04:10.460> in<00:04:10.700> the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
out instead of getting truck in the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.760 
out instead of getting truck in the
middle<00:04:11.090> now<00:04:11.600> here's<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.840> little<00:04:11.990> bonus<00:04:12.170> tip<00:04:12.380> I

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
bubbles in there that would have taken

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.200 
bubbles in there that would have taken
care<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.430> them<00:04:27.100> you<00:04:28.100> can<00:04:28.250> see<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.430> have<00:04:28.730> excess

I don't trim it exactly to my nail I

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.300 
I don't trim it exactly to my nail I
just<00:04:34.160> trim<00:04:34.400> off<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.920> bulk<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:39.190> cuz<00:04:40.190> we're

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
just trim off the bulk of it cuz we're

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.340 
just trim off the bulk of it cuz we're
gonna<00:04:40.400> file<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.090> fit<00:04:41.300> pop<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.080> back<00:04:42.110> in

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
gonna file it to fit pop it back in

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.890

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
I always recommend trying the rice bag

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.770 
I always recommend trying the rice bag
now<00:05:27.980> as<00:05:28.130> you<00:05:28.280> can<00:05:28.460> see<00:05:28.520> this<00:05:29.330> is<00:05:29.510> literally

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
now as you can see this is literally

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.460 
now as you can see this is literally
shrink<00:05:30.320> wrapped<00:05:30.560> itself<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:32.600> my<00:05:32.750> nail<00:05:32.960> but<00:05:33.440> I

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
shrink wrapped itself to my nail but I

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.180 
shrink wrapped itself to my nail but I
have<00:05:33.620> excess<00:05:34.100> here<00:05:34.400> at<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.640> top<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:35.890> would<00:05:36.890> let

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
have excess here at the top I would let

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.070 
have excess here at the top I would let
this<00:05:37.340> wrap<00:05:37.580> cool<00:05:37.850> all<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.150> way<00:05:38.330> so<00:05:38.450> typically

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
this wrap cool all the way so typically

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.380 
this wrap cool all the way so typically
I<00:05:39.110> would<00:05:39.320> do<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.560> other<00:05:39.790> index<00:05:40.790> finger<00:05:41.210> and

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
I would do the other index finger and

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.350 
I would do the other index finger and
leave<00:05:41.870> this<00:05:42.020> one<00:05:42.230> alone<00:05:42.290> and<00:05:42.860> then<00:05:43.760> after<00:05:44.240> I've

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
leave this one alone and then after I've

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.570 
leave this one alone and then after I've
got<00:05:44.510> them<00:05:44.660> both<00:05:44.690> on<00:05:45.200> this<00:05:45.560> wrap<00:05:45.800> is<00:05:45.980> cooled<00:05:46.310> all

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
got them both on this wrap is cooled all

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.940 
got them both on this wrap is cooled all
the<00:05:46.970> way<00:05:47.090> I'm<00:05:47.390> gonna<00:05:47.960> be<00:05:48.110> ready<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.410> file<00:05:48.680> off
