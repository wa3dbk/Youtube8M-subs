one of the nice things about the pivot

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.059 
one of the nice things about the pivot
is<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.360> actually<00:03:02.660> run<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.799> a

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
is that you can actually run it in a

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.820 
is that you can actually run it in a

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
couple different modes you can run it

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.559 
couple different modes you can run it
like<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.220> side<00:03:07.549> by<00:03:07.730> side<00:03:07.760> machine<00:03:08.360> like<00:03:08.540> you

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
like a side by side machine like you
