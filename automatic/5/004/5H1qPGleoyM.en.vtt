00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.300
 sometimes 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.629
 hello my name is marta fernandez and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.210
 I want to show a very easy reality 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.489
 with natural Greek yogurt last night for 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.910
 this recipe we are going to occupy a potato the 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.690
 let's cut into slices not so have 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.070
 more or less thick and we're going to cut it and 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.140
 let's make some delicious potatoes in the light 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.120
 back is very good for roasting 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.030
 example to accompany meats power 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.040
 see yourself to move the area then 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.460
 let's have a piece of paper 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.979
 aluminum cut into square shape 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.970
 we are going to put the potato on paper 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.410
 trying to keep the shape 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.750
 and so with fernando care we're going to 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.390
 put between each slice a little bit of 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.250
 these ingredients the onion our 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.230
 opinion is the tomato they will give you for 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.940
 others played then the potato is going to go 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.330
 cooking among all these we go with 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.840
 these flavors let's put a little bit of 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.950
 Pepper 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.240
 and you also add more salts 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.490
 there too 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.939
 a little bit more than what you think 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:47.399
 any lapse may be necessary if 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:52.320
 we do not have back and this would add a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.500
 little bit of natural yogurt wants to give 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.240
 exquisite creaminess and it will not allow 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.800
 our potatoes in the teques 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.290
 we do for example to berlin 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.290
 port we are going to start to put 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.739
 and for the touch we are going to add some 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.739
 cubes of butter on the potato 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.060
 and we are going to do it 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.620
 and ready a recipe will be set very 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.630
 papaya tear baked the head and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.200
 very carefully 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.610
 we open the paper and to take it to the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.070
 table we are going to put a little bit of 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.230
