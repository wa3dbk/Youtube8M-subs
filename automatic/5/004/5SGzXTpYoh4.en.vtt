00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
and the rain back was not so good should

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.830 
and the rain back was not so good should
be<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.780> diagonal<00:01:27.439> steps<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.790> wasn't<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.659> was

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
be a diagonal steps it wasn't and it was

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.359 
be a diagonal steps it wasn't and it was
not<00:01:30.049> straight<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:31.430> there<00:01:31.640> she<00:01:32.450> was<00:01:33.440> not<00:01:33.740> was

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
below five so he went down to just seven

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.420 
below five so he went down to just seven
to<00:01:38.420> eight<00:01:38.509> percent<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.979> was<00:01:43.159> very<00:01:43.690> close<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.990> 80

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
to eight percent it was very close to 80

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.270 
to eight percent it was very close to 80

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
and the zigzag very light in front

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.010 
and the zigzag very light in front
especially<00:04:05.370> inside<00:04:06.370> for<00:04:07.030> leg<00:04:07.270> to<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.720> right

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
especially inside for leg to the right

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:15.070

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.150 

and<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.800> look<00:04:16.420> coveting<00:04:17.420> ground<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.890> flying

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
and I look coveting ground in the flying

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:30.360 
and I look coveting ground in the flying
change

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.909 

a<00:04:30.460> little<00:04:31.300> hectic<00:04:31.479> little<00:04:32.110> bit<00:04:32.199> intense<00:04:32.590> and

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
a little hectic little bit intense and

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.390 
a little hectic little bit intense and
the<00:04:33.400> first<00:04:33.669> change<00:04:34.290> was<00:04:35.290> not<00:04:35.680> quite<00:04:35.979> through

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
the first change was not quite through

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.170 
the first change was not quite through
but<00:04:37.270> he<00:04:37.419> still<00:04:37.780> I<00:04:38.110> think<00:04:38.740> we<00:04:38.979> give<00:04:39.460> him<00:04:39.580> at

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
but he still I think we give him at

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:51.730 
but he still I think we give him at
least<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.540> seven<00:04:40.900> was<00:04:41.560> about<00:04:41.860> that

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:05:01.020 

spirit<00:04:53.110> okay<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.979> he's<00:04:56.169> still<00:04:57.169> on<00:04:57.610> about<00:04:58.610> 75%

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
spirit okay and he's still on about 75%

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.960 
spirit okay and he's still on about 75%
and<00:05:02.030> yeah<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.800> lost<00:05:04.039> little<00:05:04.340> bit<00:05:04.430> high<00:05:04.669> legs

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
and yeah it lost little bit high legs

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.499 
and yeah it lost little bit high legs
together<00:05:05.240> once<00:05:05.720> tried<00:05:06.759> so<00:05:07.759> it<00:05:07.880> was<00:05:08.030> not<00:05:08.180> and

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
together once tried so it was not and

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.550 
together once tried so it was not and
also<00:05:09.440> for<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.800> Pirates<00:05:10.220> have<00:05:10.849> a<00:05:10.880> cop<00:05:11.210> co

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
also for the Pirates have a cop co

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.390 
also for the Pirates have a cop co
efficient<00:05:12.560> too<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.789> that's<00:05:15.160> more<00:05:16.160> expensive

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
efficient too so that's more expensive

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.820 
efficient too so that's more expensive
to<00:05:16.789> make<00:05:17.090> mistakes<00:05:17.630> when<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:18.650> have<00:05:18.800> a

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.590 

and<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.230> passage<00:05:31.620> could<00:05:31.950> be<00:05:32.070> not<00:05:32.850> so<00:05:33.270> much

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
and the passage could be not so much

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.140 
and the passage could be not so much
forward<00:05:34.050> in<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.470> future<00:05:34.650> to<00:05:35.490> improve<00:05:35.850> it<00:05:36.030> but

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
forward in the future to improve it but

forward in the future to improve it but
it's<00:05:36.360> still<00:05:36.810> it's<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.320> good<00:05:37.500> pasar<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:38.370> now<00:05:39.300> you

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
it's still it's a good pasar and now you

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:52.879 
it's still it's a good pasar and now you
can<00:05:39.630> see<00:05:39.660> you<00:05:40.620> have<00:05:40.710> palin<00:05:41.070> say<00:05:41.600> sorry<00:05:42.950> six

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.890 

it's<00:05:53.490> been<00:05:53.729> horses<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.270> have<00:05:54.360> a<00:05:54.419> lot<00:05:54.569> of<00:05:54.599> energy

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
it's been horses I have a lot of energy

it's been horses I have a lot of energy
they<00:05:55.860> can't<00:05:56.129> go<00:05:56.400> forward<00:05:57.919> then<00:05:58.919> we'll<00:05:59.159> try

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
they can't go forward then we'll try

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.170 
they can't go forward then we'll try
sometimes<00:06:00.030> to<00:06:00.270> put<00:06:00.509> kind<00:06:01.110> of<00:06:01.469> oedipal<00:06:02.099> legs<00:06:02.370> to
