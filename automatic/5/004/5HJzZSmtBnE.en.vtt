the worst part was just drinking this
stuff<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.659> was<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.990> bad<00:01:43.200> because

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
stuff and I think it was so bad because

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.370 
stuff and I think it was so bad because
you<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> haven't<00:01:44.729> eaten<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
you know I haven't eaten you know in a
couple<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> days<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.790> know<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.329> day<00:01:48.479> two

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
couple of days you know this is day two

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.870
