00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
well if it's so much position there

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.479 
well if it's so much position there
really<00:03:43.569> should<00:03:43.900> be<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.049> head<00:03:44.290> but<00:03:44.890> they<00:03:44.980> haven't

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489
