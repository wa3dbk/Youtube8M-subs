E zinc and copper it can actually help

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.000 
E zinc and copper it can actually help
reduce<00:02:24.480> reduce<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.720> risk<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.260> vision<00:02:26.770> loss

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
reduce reduce the risk of vision loss

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.230 
reduce reduce the risk of vision loss
due<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.910> age-related<00:02:28.660> macular<00:02:29.500> degeneration

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
due to age-related macular degeneration

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.660 
due to age-related macular degeneration
so<00:02:31.240> now<00:02:31.510> Aran's<00:02:31.960> 2<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.530> studying<00:02:32.920> lutein<00:02:33.490> and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
so now Aran's 2 is studying lutein and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.450 
so now Aran's 2 is studying lutein and
zeaxanthin<00:02:33.850> which<00:02:34.840> are<00:02:35.050> both<00:02:35.170> carotenoids<00:02:36.160> as

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
zeaxanthin which are both carotenoids as

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.390 
zeaxanthin which are both carotenoids as
well<00:02:36.640> as<00:02:36.790> omega-3<00:02:37.510> fatty<00:02:37.780> acids<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.560> both

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
well as omega-3 fatty acids and both

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.090 
well as omega-3 fatty acids and both
lutein<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.270> zeaxanthin<00:02:40.420> have<00:02:41.350> shown<00:02:41.620> promise

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
lutein and zeaxanthin have shown promise

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.060 
lutein and zeaxanthin have shown promise
in<00:02:42.190> other<00:02:42.460> studies<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.570> protect<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.470> macula

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
in other studies to protect the macula

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.300 
in other studies to protect the macula
against<00:02:45.580> damaging<00:02:46.150> blue<00:02:46.570> light<00:02:46.840> and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
against damaging blue light and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.000 
against damaging blue light and
therefore<00:02:48.310> help<00:02:48.580> protect<00:02:49.200> your<00:02:50.200> vision<00:02:50.590> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
therefore help protect your vision and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.160 
therefore help protect your vision and
your<00:02:51.250> eyesight<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.970> slow<00:02:52.300> down<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:53.080> know

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
your eyesight and slow down you know

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.750 
your eyesight and slow down you know
possibly<00:02:53.560> slow<00:02:53.710> down<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.250> effects<00:02:54.580> of

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
possibly slow down the effects of

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.080 
possibly slow down the effects of
macular<00:02:55.000> degeneration<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.770> if<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.460> have<00:02:57.940> been

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
macular degeneration so if you have been

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.210

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
if you are at high risk for the eye

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.720 
if you are at high risk for the eye
