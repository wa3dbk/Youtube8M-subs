a<00:01:58.729> quick<00:01:59.960> analogy<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.079> guess<00:02:01.380> would<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
a quick analogy I guess would be the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.050 
a quick analogy I guess would be the
general<00:02:03.780> play<00:02:04.259> time<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.070> game<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.549> elder

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
general play time of a game like elder

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.559 
general play time of a game like elder
scrolls<00:02:06.420> five<00:02:06.890> Skyrim<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.849> probably

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
scrolls five Skyrim would be probably

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.050 
scrolls five Skyrim would be probably
hundreds<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.470> hundreds<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.250> hours<00:02:11.580> because

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
hundreds and hundreds of hours because

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.250 
hundreds and hundreds of hours because
there's<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.720> much

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
there's so much

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.649 
there's so much
to<00:02:13.439> do<00:02:13.620> whereas<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> clear<00:02:14.730> time<00:02:15.000> would<00:02:15.420> only

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
to do whereas the clear time would only

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.580 
to do whereas the clear time would only
be<00:02:16.049> in<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.329> 2025<00:02:18.329> our<00:02:18.590> range

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
be in you know like the 2025 our range

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.309 
be in you know like the 2025 our range
if<00:02:20.040> you're<00:02:20.730> taking<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.269> slow<00:02:21.599> probably

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
if you're taking it slow probably

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.220 
if you're taking it slow probably
because<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.370> main<00:02:23.549> story<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.900> Elder

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
because the main story in the Elder

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.890 
because the main story in the Elder
Scrolls<00:02:25.620> games<00:02:25.920> typically<00:02:26.549> isn't<00:02:26.909> very<00:02:27.569> long

Scrolls games typically isn't very long
at<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:29.659> what<00:02:30.659> is<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.560> problem<00:02:31.890> well<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
at all so what is the problem well the

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.539 
at all so what is the problem well the
problem<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.170> only<00:02:34.560> two<00:02:34.950> hours<00:02:34.980> long

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
problem is that it's only two hours long

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.149 
problem is that it's only two hours long
and<00:02:35.849> if<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.480> buy<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.750> physical<00:02:37.470> copy<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:38.010> the

and if you buy the physical copy of the

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.210 
and if you buy the physical copy of the

game then you're expected to pay forty

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.410 
game then you're expected to pay forty
dollars<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.049> can<00:02:43.620> save<00:02:43.980> some<00:02:44.010> money<00:02:44.420> and

came out if the main story only took me

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.740

like five hours to complete or something
I<00:03:40.459> would<00:03:41.459> seriously<00:03:41.959> reconsider<00:03:42.959> buying<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
I would seriously reconsider buying the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.189 
I would seriously reconsider buying the
game<00:03:43.799> just<00:03:44.639> because<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.329> not<00:03:45.359> enough<00:03:46.079> of

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
game just because that is not enough of

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.030 
game just because that is not enough of
a<00:03:46.349> core<00:03:46.829> game<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.849> justify<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.510> price<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.410> mean

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
a core game to justify the price I mean

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.520 
a core game to justify the price I mean
it<00:03:50.389> what<00:03:51.389> you're<00:03:51.540> looking<00:03:51.690> at<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.079> effectively

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
it what you're looking at is effectively

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.710 
it what you're looking at is effectively
you<00:03:52.739> know<00:03:52.829> after<00:03:53.040> taxes<00:03:53.819> just<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.540> buy<00:03:54.660> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
you know after taxes just to buy the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.050 
you know after taxes just to buy the
digital<00:03:55.019> version<00:03:55.440> you're<00:03:55.799> working<00:03:56.220> at<00:03:56.459> least

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
digital version you're working at least

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.509 
digital version you're working at least
like<00:03:57.449> you<00:03:57.959> know<00:03:58.079> three<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.620> half<00:03:58.650> hours<00:03:59.220> at

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
like you know three and a half hours at

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.449 
like you know three and a half hours at
minimum<00:04:00.209> wage<00:04:00.419> and<00:04:00.840> that's<00:04:01.530> just<00:04:01.680> ludicrous

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
minimum wage and that's just ludicrous

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.619 
minimum wage and that's just ludicrous
and<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:04.310> mean<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.519> actually<00:04:06.090> would<00:04:06.150> probably<00:04:06.540> be

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
and I mean it actually would probably be

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.780 
and I mean it actually would probably be
closer<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.109> like<00:04:07.319> four<00:04:07.560> hours<00:04:07.590> after<00:04:08.370> taxes

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
closer to like four hours after taxes

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.149 
closer to like four hours after taxes
but<00:04:09.090> whatever<00:04:09.599> anyways<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.739> know<00:04:10.769> that

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
but whatever anyways you know that

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.559 
but whatever anyways you know that
doesn't<00:04:11.400> matter<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.849> point<00:04:12.060> remains<00:04:12.150> that

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
doesn't matter the point remains that

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.469 
doesn't matter the point remains that
you<00:04:12.870> at<00:04:13.019> would<00:04:13.229> have<00:04:13.409> to<00:04:13.620> work<00:04:13.919> more<00:04:14.909> to<00:04:15.269> earn

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
you at would have to work more to earn

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.360 
you at would have to work more to earn
enough<00:04:15.720> money<00:04:15.900> than<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.829> were<00:04:16.979> most

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
enough money than what you were most

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.339 
enough money than what you were most
likely<00:04:17.489> going<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.090> get<00:04:18.479> out<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:19.109> game

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
likely going to get out of the game

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.240 
likely going to get out of the game
which<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.690> ridiculous<00:04:21.690> now<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.650> am<00:04:22.830> going<00:04:22.860> to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
which is ridiculous now I am going to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.360 
which is ridiculous now I am going to
try<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.580> get<00:04:23.639> my<00:04:23.789> hands<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.510> copy<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:25.020> this

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
try and get my hands on a copy of this

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.140 
try and get my hands on a copy of this
most<00:04:26.370> likely<00:04:26.760> through

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
most likely through

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.460 
most likely through
fly<00:04:27.540> or<00:04:27.900> something<00:04:28.530> like<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.770> so<00:04:29.720> i<00:04:30.720> will<00:04:31.440> be

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
fly or something like that so i will be

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.740
