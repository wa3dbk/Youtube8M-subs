00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
but maybe hard to figure out two

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.810 
but maybe hard to figure out two
different<00:00:26.109> things<00:00:26.380> so<00:00:26.650> you<00:00:27.279> getting<00:00:27.550> in<00:00:27.670> there

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
was for them to figure it out because

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.220 
was for them to figure it out because
there's<00:00:40.000> so<00:00:40.120> much<00:00:40.239> stuff<00:00:40.480> going<00:00:40.540> on<00:00:40.899> and<00:00:41.140> it

line rhythm that syncopate

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.450 
line rhythm that syncopate
and<00:00:46.210> flows<00:00:46.780> now<00:00:47.649> these<00:00:47.800> think<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.100> patients

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460
