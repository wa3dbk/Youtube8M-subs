smoothly near enough exactly how Gears

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.379

the big question though will free full
return<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.299> think<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.990> should<00:01:57.439> purely<00:01:57.920> just

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
return I think it should purely just

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.010 
return I think it should purely just
because<00:01:58.429> if<00:01:58.700> played<00:01:58.999> out<00:01:59.270> on<00:01:59.299> symmetrical

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.899 
because if played out on symmetrical
