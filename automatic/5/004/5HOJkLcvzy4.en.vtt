00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.949 

all<00:00:12.139> right<00:00:12.259> um<00:00:12.559> start<00:00:13.160> out<00:00:13.280> that<00:00:13.400> shadow<00:00:13.639> there

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
all right um start out that shadow there

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.130 
all right um start out that shadow there
so<00:00:14.959> you<00:00:15.019> wanna<00:00:15.199> start<00:00:15.349> by<00:00:15.440> drawing<00:00:15.769> a<00:00:16.129> line

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
so you wanna start by drawing a line

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.630 
so you wanna start by drawing a line
that<00:00:18.140> is<00:00:18.289> going<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:18.650> become<00:00:18.919> the<00:00:19.070> top<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.520> the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
that is going to become the top of the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.569 
that is going to become the top of the
eyelid<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:22.750> this<00:00:23.750> can<00:00:23.930> be<00:00:23.989> kind<00:00:24.140> of<00:00:24.259> tricky

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
eyelid and this can be kind of tricky

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.299 
eyelid and this can be kind of tricky
because<00:00:25.579> it<00:00:25.820> really<00:00:26.060> has<00:00:26.210> to<00:00:26.980> figure<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.189> out

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:28.309 
because it really has to figure it out

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:31.299 
because it really has to figure it out
as<00:00:28.550> you<00:00:29.059> draw<00:00:29.300> it<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:30.040> if<00:00:31.040> you're<00:00:31.160> watching

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
as you draw it and if you're watching

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.520 
as you draw it and if you're watching
this<00:00:31.669> you<00:00:32.540> don't<00:00:32.660> know<00:00:32.930> what<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.260> finished

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
this you don't know what the finished

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.779 
this you don't know what the finished
thing<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.770> going<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:34.039> end<00:00:34.190> up<00:00:34.309> like<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:34.700> you

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
thing is going to end up like so you

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.770 
thing is going to end up like so you
don't<00:00:35.000> know<00:00:35.149> what<00:00:35.450> to<00:00:36.250> sort<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.399> hope<00:00:37.969> or<00:00:38.300> sort

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
don't know what to sort of hope or sort

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.900 
don't know what to sort of hope or sort
of<00:00:38.840> accommodate<00:00:39.379> to<00:00:39.649> we're<00:00:40.579> drawing<00:00:40.789> the

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
of accommodate to we're drawing the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.360 
of accommodate to we're drawing the
first<00:00:41.180> step<00:00:41.360> because<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.690> don't<00:00:41.899> know<00:00:42.370> what's

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
first step because you don't know what's

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.290 
first step because you don't know what's
gonna<00:00:43.520> happen<00:00:43.670> next

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
gonna happen next

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.260 
gonna happen next
it's<00:00:44.540> kind<00:00:44.720> of<00:00:44.780> like<00:00:45.460> cookbooks<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:46.760> have<00:00:47.090> to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
it's kind of like cookbooks you have to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.810 
it's kind of like cookbooks you have to
read<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.480> whole<00:00:47.630> recipe<00:00:47.810> before<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:48.560> do<00:00:48.820> the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
read the whole recipe before you do the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.580 
read the whole recipe before you do the
first<00:00:50.030> step<00:00:50.270> because<00:00:50.450> you<00:00:50.840> need<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.230> know<00:00:51.260> I

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
first step because you need to know I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.880 
first step because you need to know I
don't<00:00:52.579> know<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:52.790> just<00:00:53.230> it's<00:00:54.230> easier<00:00:54.530> if<00:00:54.739> you

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
don't know it just it's easier if you

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.350 
don't know it just it's easier if you
watch<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.250> whole<00:00:55.370> thing<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.790> then<00:00:55.940> you'll<00:00:56.210> go

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
watch the whole thing and then you'll go

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.120 
watch the whole thing and then you'll go
oh<00:00:56.510> okay<00:00:57.140> that's<00:00:57.290> why<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:57.559> needed<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:58.040> it

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
oh okay that's why I needed to do it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.270 
oh okay that's why I needed to do it
that<00:00:58.250> way<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.470> mine<00:01:00.470> looks<00:01:00.710> kind<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.040> weirdly

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
that way so mine looks kind of weirdly

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.469 
that way so mine looks kind of weirdly
shaped<00:01:01.630> just<00:01:02.630> bear<00:01:02.870> with<00:01:02.899> me<00:01:03.309> alright<00:01:04.479> we're

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
shaped just bear with me alright we're

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.319 
shaped just bear with me alright we're
going<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.689> add<00:01:05.899> in<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:08.020> eyeball<00:01:10.210> part<00:01:11.210> itself

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
going to add in the eyeball part itself

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.480 
going to add in the eyeball part itself
now<00:01:14.329> for<00:01:14.569> this<00:01:14.719> I<00:01:14.990> I'm<00:01:15.859> going<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.189> be<00:01:16.310> showing

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
now for this I I'm going to be showing

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.840 
now for this I I'm going to be showing
most<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:18.280> don't<00:01:19.280> know<00:01:19.340> if<00:01:19.429> you<00:01:19.490> guys<00:01:19.609> know

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
most of it I don't know if you guys know

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.279 
most of it I don't know if you guys know
but<00:01:19.999> I<00:01:20.060> like<00:01:20.209> to<00:01:20.359> draw<00:01:20.539> a<00:01:20.569> line<00:01:20.749> sort<00:01:21.170> of

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
but I like to draw a line sort of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.389 
but I like to draw a line sort of
oval-shaped<00:01:21.829> at<00:01:22.490> least<00:01:22.670> by<00:01:22.909> nonhuman<00:01:23.689> ones<00:01:24.399> so

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
oval-shaped at least by nonhuman ones so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.510 
oval-shaped at least by nonhuman ones so
keeping<00:01:25.639> that<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:25.939> mind<00:01:30.130> guess<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.340> whole

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
keeping that in mind guess this whole

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.989 
keeping that in mind guess this whole
thing<00:01:31.819> is<00:01:31.939> sort<00:01:32.060> of<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.299> eyelid<00:01:32.719> eye

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
thing is sort of the eyelid eye

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.489 
thing is sort of the eyelid eye
so<00:01:35.240> now<00:01:35.389> that<00:01:35.479> we<00:01:35.600> have<00:01:35.749> that<00:01:35.929> we're<00:01:36.200> going<00:01:36.350> to

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
so now that we have that we're going to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.029 
so now that we have that we're going to
draw<00:01:36.649> on<00:01:36.709> the<00:01:36.829> eyebrow<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.270> basically<00:01:39.259> this

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
draw on the eyebrow and basically this

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.190 
draw on the eyebrow and basically this
follows<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.659> shape<00:01:41.689> of<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:44.329> eye<00:01:44.359> except<00:01:45.049> it

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
follows the shape of the eye except it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.309 
follows the shape of the eye except it
kind<00:01:45.529> of<00:01:45.590> slopes<00:01:45.889> up<00:01:46.159> on<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.429> end<00:01:47.109> because<00:01:48.109> you

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
kind of slopes up on the end because you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.559 
kind of slopes up on the end because you
want<00:01:48.709> there<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.039> be<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.399> good<00:01:49.759> amount<00:01:50.179> of<00:01:50.270> space

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
want there to be a good amount of space

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.449 
want there to be a good amount of space
between<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.259> eye<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.770> eyebrow<00:01:52.099> and<00:01:52.279> I'm

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
between the eye and the eyebrow and I'm

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.190 
between the eye and the eyebrow and I'm
going<00:01:52.609> to<00:01:52.670> start<00:01:52.909> shading<00:01:53.179> over<00:01:53.990> in<00:01:54.049> this

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
going to start shading over in this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:08.160 
going to start shading over in this
square<00:01:56.799> sort<00:01:57.799> of<00:01:57.919> in<00:01:58.099> a<00:01:58.219> circular<00:01:58.520> way

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.479 

almost<00:02:09.170> like<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.410> eye<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.770> sphere<00:02:12.489> blending

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
almost like the eye is a sphere blending

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.250 
almost like the eye is a sphere blending
it<00:02:13.610> into<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.970> center<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.080> can

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
it into the center and then just you can

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.930 
it into the center and then just you can
just<00:02:18.440> use<00:02:18.590> your<00:02:18.739> finger<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.130> sort<00:02:19.489> of<00:02:19.580> blend<00:02:19.790> it

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
just use your finger to sort of blend it

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.710 
just use your finger to sort of blend it
so<00:02:20.120> it's<00:02:20.270> not<00:02:20.420> completely<00:02:20.989> white<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:25.720> then

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
so it's not completely white and then

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.990 
so it's not completely white and then
you<00:02:26.780> can<00:02:26.930> darken<00:02:27.170> up<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.319> eyebrow<00:02:27.709> -<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:28.250> did<00:02:28.910> by

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
you can darken up the eyebrow - I did by

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.460 
you can darken up the eyebrow - I did by
shading<00:02:29.239> over<00:02:29.540> here<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:33.110> want<00:02:33.260> us<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.350> be

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
shading over here you want us to be

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.330 
shading over here you want us to be
darkest<00:02:33.860> up<00:02:34.040> against<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> brow<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.190> its

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
darkest up against the brow so its

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.770 
darkest up against the brow so its
darkest<00:02:40.670> that's<00:02:40.880> near<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.780> brow<00:02:41.959> Oh<00:02:43.660> for<00:02:44.660> that

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
darkest that's near the brow Oh for that

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.630 
darkest that's near the brow Oh for that
if<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.080> want<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.260> draw<00:02:45.380> on<00:02:45.410> eyelid<00:02:48.280> lines<00:02:49.280> you

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
if you want to draw on eyelid lines you

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.110 
if you want to draw on eyelid lines you
can<00:02:49.819> sort<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.090> mark<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.850> then<00:02:56.000> it

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
can sort of mark that in and then it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.140 
can sort of mark that in and then it
sort<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.390> fades<00:02:56.630> into<00:02:56.959> nothing<00:02:57.940> over<00:02:58.940> here

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
sort of fades into nothing over here

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.610 
sort of fades into nothing over here
except<00:02:59.569> on<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.780> end<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.080> sort<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.350> comes<00:03:00.500> down

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
except on the end it sort of comes down

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.490 
except on the end it sort of comes down
again<00:03:00.920> because<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.540> widest<00:03:03.290> point

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
again because that is the widest point

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.400 
again because that is the widest point
of<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.799> brow<00:03:03.980> bone<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.959> eyebrow<00:03:06.200> curves

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
of the brow bone and the eyebrow curves

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.360 
of the brow bone and the eyebrow curves
up<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:06.980> sort<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.310> leave<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:09.370> makes

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
up so you sort of leave it that makes

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.670 
up so you sort of leave it that makes
any<00:03:10.700> sense<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.870> then<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:18.260> sort<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.500> bring

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
any sense and then just sort of bring

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.240 
any sense and then just sort of bring
this<00:03:18.829> down<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:24.109> then<00:03:24.230> use<00:03:24.350> your<00:03:24.440> eraser<00:03:24.709> to

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
this down and then use your eraser to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:36.720 
this down and then use your eraser to
make<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.970> line<00:03:26.239> really<00:03:26.450> crisp

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.670 

and<00:03:37.730> then<00:03:37.850> darken<00:03:38.300> right<00:03:38.569> against<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.440> line

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
and then darken right against the line

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:51.130 
and then darken right against the line
the<00:03:40.670> top<00:03:40.910> line<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.420> lid<00:03:41.690> here<00:03:50.020> just<00:03:51.020> like

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
the top line of the lid here just like

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.170 
the top line of the lid here just like
that<00:03:52.060> then<00:03:53.060> again<00:03:53.270> you<00:03:53.450> can<00:03:53.540> use<00:03:53.660> your<00:03:53.810> finger

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
that then again you can use your finger

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.449 
that then again you can use your finger
slightly<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.709> then<00:03:57.860> sort<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.130> give<00:03:58.250> dimension

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
slightly and then sort of give dimension

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.990 
slightly and then sort of give dimension
to<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.120> eyelid<00:03:59.630> by<00:04:00.560> making<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.280> darker<00:04:01.640> line<00:04:01.790> on

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
to the eyelid by making a darker line on

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.610 
to the eyelid by making a darker line on
the<00:04:02.180> top<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:08.239> now<00:04:08.300> we're<00:04:09.200> going<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.500> add

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
the top and now we're going to add

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.900 
the top and now we're going to add
another<00:04:09.770> eyelash<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:12.950> do<00:04:13.400> that<00:04:13.430> we're

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
another eyelash so to do that we're

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.400 
another eyelash so to do that we're
going<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.150> bring<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.600> off<00:04:14.920> sort<00:04:15.920> of<00:04:16.010> right<00:04:16.190> here

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
going to bring it off sort of right here

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.229 
going to bring it off sort of right here
you<00:04:18.410> really<00:04:18.680> have<00:04:18.859> to<00:04:19.100> think<00:04:19.489> about<00:04:19.820> your<00:04:20.120> own

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
you really have to think about your own

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.610 
you really have to think about your own
drawing<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.810> what<00:04:20.989> would<00:04:21.140> look<00:04:21.290> right<00:04:21.440> on

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
drawing and what would look right on

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:31.260 
drawing and what would look right on
yours<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:24.290> it's<00:04:24.890> almost<00:04:25.070> like<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.610> triangle

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.300 

and<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:33.200> gonna<00:04:33.350> create<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.740> sort<00:04:33.980> of<00:04:34.040> shadow

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
and it's gonna create a sort of shadow

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:42.340 
and it's gonna create a sort of shadow
onto<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.910> lid<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:38.290> mean<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.440> eyeball<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:42.229> now
