00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.510
 under school on the way we find ourselves 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.520
 the memorial integration which is the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.890
 healing of life memory then in 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:34.310
 this intervention healing method 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.860
 the speaker guides the subject from 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.750
 a difficulty named by the subject 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.150
 comes up with a memory that 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.780
 seems to be recurrent in these lives 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.090
 something that seems to be coming back 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.550
 repeat it in relationships 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.760
 in love this is for example a 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.239
 difficulty having children 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.879
 something that seemed to be present is 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.600
 sometimes present maybe so 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.480
 much larger than just this life 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.090
 that you and I are living then it's 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.360
 sure we could talk about memory 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.820
 alive and in his living memories 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.030
 who are lodged in our body is the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.170
 plays if so-called memories of 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.560
 so-called previous life so do you 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.479
 and I believe in these visits 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.340
 previous is it possible 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.939
 that right now that we are living 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.250
 you and I this life we ​​also lived 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.450
 other lives is what in our 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.259
 body can lodge memories of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.110
 other lives 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.000
 so at first I did not believe that 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.430
 it is to exist these memories of life 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 previous until the day when when I 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.399
 lived in new york there are of that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.500
 years and I guided people to 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.740
 release their tension from their armor 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.670
 in their body several people 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.490
 appointed me while freeing myself from 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.789
 tensions of their bodies memories of 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.090
 other lives with emotion with images 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.300
 visuals with kinesthetic sensation 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.760
 with sewer odors and there I was 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.560
 a bit before the evidence that our 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.920
 unconscious was perhaps very well 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.640
 done and that in form 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.239
 molik that this existence and occurred or 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.310
 in is not important what is the 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.860
 more important is that in form 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.410
 symbolic 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.230
 the individual who relives the memory sees her again 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.360
 point to the line 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.760
 so that's where else of that 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.150
 more than twenty years ago that exists 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.019
 method of intervention on the memories 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.950
 called alive and that his house 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.440
 in our cells 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.170
 it can be memories of our city 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.480
 trail terrine these are can be 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.030
 memories of our birth or of 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.250
 first years of life of which one 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.480
 is not necessarily a conscience 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.049
 but who are lodged in our body 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:18.100
 so this method called integration 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:21.400
 memory and she lives with the help of a 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.340
 intervener obviously who was initiated 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.310
 to this method trained and who can 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.579
 guide the individual both in a 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.970
 dialogue with his unconscious but also 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:37.660
 and that's very important to act on 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.769
 the subtle bodies that surrounds our 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.230
 physical body 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.470
 our magnetic field our body 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.950
 etheric our emotional body our 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.370
 mental body and even a dimension of the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.060
 body called karmic is so 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.380
 in this memory intervention 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.630
 living integration of his memoirs he 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.350
 there is a healing dimension that is 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.269
 very important because the purpose is not to 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.989
 lift memories only to lift 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.080
 memories 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.900
 the goal 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.470
 and raise memories because 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.090
 that they are raised first 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.840
 because they are already awake in 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.840
 we and also help the individual to 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.540
 heal his memories 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.240
 how I perceived myself by living this 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.700
 what is what 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.820
 I learn from this experience 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.730
 what are the conclusions that I have 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.920
 fired and that influence day my life 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.910
 how can I transform his 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.760
 conclusions this is a very dimension 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.790
 important that we do not find 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.700
 always in the exploration of memories 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.430
 are offered by many other methods 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.730
 this method is specific in 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.150
 herself under school on the way she 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:05.930
 is specific to healing and passes 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.250
 just exploration exploration and 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.210
 healing was called integration 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.720
 memorial 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.720
 thank you so much
