we're<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.840> calling<00:00:25.109> me<00:00:25.380> ro<00:00:27.349> created<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> boat

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
we're just calling me ro created a boat

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.270 
we're just calling me ro created a boat
that<00:00:29.550> run<00:00:31.099> like<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> steam<00:00:32.550> engine<00:00:33.980> but<00:00:34.980> instead

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
that run like a steam engine but instead

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.440 
that run like a steam engine but instead
of<00:00:35.340> using<00:00:35.899> steam<00:00:36.899> from<00:00:37.320> water<00:00:38.239> he<00:00:39.239> actually

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
of using steam from water he actually

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.250 
of using steam from water he actually
used<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.020> closed<00:00:40.410> system<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:42.260> basically

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
used a closed system that basically

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.340 
used a closed system that basically
boiled<00:00:44.129> gasoline<00:00:46.190> turned<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.399> vapor<00:00:48.350> like

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
boiled gasoline turned it to vapor like

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.779 
boiled gasoline turned it to vapor like
steam<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.120> compression<00:00:51.600> chamber<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
steam and in a compression chamber and

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
steam and in a compression chamber and
run<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> three<00:00:54.090> cylinder<00:00:54.390> motor<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.699> more

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
run a three cylinder motor on it more

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.000 
run a three cylinder motor on it more
how<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.960> cool<00:00:59.149> I<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.829> was

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
how that is just so cool I just this was

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.929 
how that is just so cool I just this was
emailed<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:04.040> by<00:01:05.040> by<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> my

emailed to me by by one of my

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.510 
emailed to me by by one of my
subscribers<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.979> had<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> share<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
subscribers and I just had to share it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.710 
subscribers and I just had to share it
with<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.950> but<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.369> invention<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.119> mean<00:01:12.540> it's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
with you but the invention I mean it's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.130 
with you but the invention I mean it's
just<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.350> incredible<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:15.570> basically<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
just really incredible it's basically a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.140 
just really incredible it's basically a
three<00:01:16.619> cylinder<00:01:17.840> steam<00:01:18.840> engine<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:20.640> uses

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
three cylinder steam engine that uses

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.399 
three cylinder steam engine that uses
the<00:01:21.450> gasoline<00:01:23.479> it's<00:01:24.479> he<00:01:25.170> actually

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the gasoline it's he actually

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.609 
the gasoline it's he actually
pressurized<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.490> tank<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.960> foot

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
pressurized the tank with a little foot

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.660 
pressurized the tank with a little foot
pump<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> gasoline<00:01:32.189> went<00:01:32.400> into<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pump then the gasoline went into a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.749 
pump then the gasoline went into a
chamber<00:01:33.650> where<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> little<00:01:35.009> bit<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> gas<00:01:35.460> is

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
chamber where a little bit of the gas is

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.830 
chamber where a little bit of the gas is
used<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> burner<00:01:38.090> like<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.750> know

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
used as a burner like as in you know

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.700 
used as a burner like as in you know
like<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> stove<00:01:40.619> burner<00:01:40.890> uh<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
like a stove burner uh just just a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
like a stove burner uh just just a
little<00:01:43.920> type<00:01:44.040> burner<00:01:44.340> inside<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> chamber

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
little type burner inside the chamber

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.660 
little type burner inside the chamber
and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.890> series<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> coils<00:01:49.189> up<00:01:50.189> through

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
and then a series of coils up through

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.469 
and then a series of coils up through
that<00:01:50.700> chamber<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.930> would<00:01:52.259> heat<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
that chamber that would heat up and

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.429 
that chamber that would heat up and
basically<00:01:54.479> turn<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> gas<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.590> vapor<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
basically turn that gas to vapor and

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.240 
basically turn that gas to vapor and
then<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.619> vapor<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:59.579> power<00:02:01.250> that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
then that vapor would power that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.280 
then that vapor would power that
three-cylinder<00:02:03.060> engine

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
three-cylinder engine

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.860 
three-cylinder engine
and<00:02:04.560> then<00:02:05.460> after<00:02:05.790> i<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:06.000> done<00:02:06.030> power<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.720> that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
and then after i was done power and that

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.300 
and then after i was done power and that
went<00:02:07.200> through<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.470> through<00:02:07.800> another<00:02:08.009> pipe

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
went through it through another pipe

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.730 
went through it through another pipe
which<00:02:08.670> was<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.330> these<00:02:09.869> diagrams<00:02:10.380> looks<00:02:10.590> like

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
which was in these diagrams looks like

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.020 
which was in these diagrams looks like
it<00:02:10.860> was<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> under<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.490> boat<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
it was kind of under the boat in the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.030 
it was kind of under the boat in the
water<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.690> cool<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.050> back<00:02:13.170> down<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.710> turn<00:02:13.920> it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
water to cool it back down to turn it

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.990 
water to cool it back down to turn it
back<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.940> liquid<00:02:15.240> form<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.730> then<00:02:17.730> just

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
back to a liquid form and then just

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.760 
back to a liquid form and then just
reuse<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.570> gasoline<00:02:18.990> over<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.470> over<00:02:19.560> again

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
reuse that gasoline over and over again

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.360 
reuse that gasoline over and over again
the<00:02:20.760> only<00:02:21.000> gas<00:02:21.210> it's<00:02:21.510> actually<00:02:21.840> being<00:02:22.080> used<00:02:22.370> is

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
the only gas it's actually being used is

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.450 
the only gas it's actually being used is
a<00:02:23.460> little<00:02:23.790> bit<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.940> gas<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.150> actually<00:02:24.780> burns

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
a little bit of gas that actually burns

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.170 
a little bit of gas that actually burns
runs<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.610> burner<00:02:27.980> wow<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.340> an<00:02:29.490> incredible

the<00:02:50.700> other<00:02:50.880> side<00:02:51.030> comes<00:02:51.300> back<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.630> liquid<00:02:53.330> well

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
actually one of the first AC units was

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.630 
actually one of the first AC units was
using<00:03:03.360> gas<00:03:03.570> by<00:03:04.080> turning<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.530> vapor<00:03:04.800> it

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
using gas by turning it the vapor it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.500 
using gas by turning it the vapor it
goes<00:03:05.820> cold<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:07.850> that's<00:03:08.850> actually<00:03:09.209> how<00:03:09.330> they

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
goes cold and that's actually how they

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.770 
goes cold and that's actually how they
started<00:03:10.470> cooling<00:03:10.650> things<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.610> gas<00:03:11.880> but<00:03:12.209> but

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
started cooling things with gas but but

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.120 
started cooling things with gas but but
this<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.080> incredible<00:03:13.620> I'd<00:03:13.709> like<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.980> said

the story straight he created this back

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.890

in<00:03:58.470> in<00:03:58.650> those<00:03:58.950> days<00:03:59.160> they<00:04:00.150> required<00:04:00.570> a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
in in those days they required a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.300 
in in those days they required a
licensed<00:04:01.470> steam<00:04:01.830> engine<00:04:02.220> controller<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:04.310> this

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
licensed steam engine controller so this

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.430 
licensed steam engine controller so this
was<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.519> way<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.790> get<00:04:06.360> away<00:04:06.570> from<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:06.900> license

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
was a way to get away from that license

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.530 
was a way to get away from that license
steam<00:04:07.799> engine<00:04:08.190> controller<00:04:08.610> because<00:04:09.209> it

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
steam engine controller because it

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.009 
steam engine controller because it
actually<00:04:09.720> wasn't<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.410> steam<00:04:11.280> engine<00:04:11.459> as<00:04:12.019> they

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
actually wasn't a steam engine as they

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.690 
actually wasn't a steam engine as they
knew<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.230> back<00:04:13.500> then<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:14.070> this<00:04:14.280> was<00:04:14.489> basically

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
knew it back then and this was basically

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.960 
knew it back then and this was basically
turning<00:04:15.209> gas

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
turning gas

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.190 
turning gas
and<00:04:16.290> fueling<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:18.700> steam<00:04:19.120> engine<00:04:19.420> it<00:04:20.110> was

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
and fueling that steam engine it was

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.509 
and fueling that steam engine it was
still<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.380> steam<00:04:20.620> engine<00:04:20.739> but<00:04:21.100> not<00:04:21.280> like<00:04:21.489> a

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
still a steam engine but not like a

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.330

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
whole concept of using that gasoline

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.340 
whole concept of using that gasoline
turning<00:04:51.820> at<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:51.940> vapor<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.540> then<00:04:52.750> reusing

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
turning at the vapor and then reusing

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.080 
turning at the vapor and then reusing
the<00:04:53.470> gasoline<00:04:55.140> just<00:04:56.140> it's<00:04:56.680> pretty<00:04:56.800> neat<00:04:57.100> so
