00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.080
 how to play with hello everyone 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.370
 and we're already in the fourth chapter you know 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.960
 how they see the champions but not like that 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.480
 they leave the face because this one comes to play 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:20.369
 against the champions 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.539
 today rise the rebel sorcerer our 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.840
 Mr. Star this week has been my 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.010
 order of dragon but before a small 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.730
 enemy summary 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.710
 we start with your strengths 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.300
 your electric discharge Runic prison and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.590
 thunderstorm are a kit of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.590
 brutal skills that make her be 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 strong in all phases of the game 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.260
 has a line phase is very strong 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.850
 because it 's good both one against one 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 like two against two the only way to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.410
 be better than him is to overcome him the number 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.150
 is a distance tank champion to makes 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.449
 a lot of damage and also that damage 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.320
 sharp we go an authentic beast 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.850
 obviously with two stronger as 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.680
 uses your definitive forces of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.260
 slackness suction spell speed of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.890
 movement damage in area something more 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.199
 and now its weak points 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.940
 It depends a lot on your objects if you stay 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.520
 behind is a champion who brings very little 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.930
 the equipment is quite easy to bleach 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.850
 since he has no ability 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.590
 that allows him to escape once he stays 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.960
 without flash it is a very easy target 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.640
 until you get your catalyst is a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.470
 very soft character and it depends on his 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 positioning so a failure will 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.490
 can cost life in the phase of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 lines a change of lines that forces you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.600
 to be against two or to accompany the jungle 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 it greatly prolongs its early game so 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.080
 It affects you a lot when it comes to being useful in 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.560
 half of the game 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.180
 and now we finally go with the tips 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.130
 rise is undoubtedly one of the champions 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.900
 more annoying in general at the beginning of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.220
 the game will accuse us without stopping so 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.050
 the crystalline bottle can be good 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.700
 idea together with life positions and 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.990
 obviously the teleportation itself 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.030
 we lose the exchanges to be able to return 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.940
 quickly and with more objects like 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 example more potions the moment of 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.180
 end with rise is the beginning the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.100
 starting your start is always with a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.930
 sapphire and two positions is to say that it is 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
 of paper we must coordinate with 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.630
 our jungle so that they do that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.560
 early and finish him as soon 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.820
 possible 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.040
 we took out once with him online 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.050
 we can try to sink it completely as 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.520
 well, very easy if the line is 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.320
 advanced and rise back against the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.030
 transport we just have to wait for it and 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.950
 go back to finish him over everything has been 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.660
 spent of study previously 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.280
 at the same time that rise is one of the most 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.080
 easy to bleach is also very good 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.519
 receiver they give to you once their 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.599
 jungle just have to hold us a 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.849
 second with double ups to be able 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.440
 put us in many problems one of the 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.060
 things that will look for the rise is to freeze 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.650
 the line near your tower so that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.239
 we have to get closer and have a corridor 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.640
 to persecute us because his jungle comes 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.160
 for us the cooling is the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 key in rise and at the same time deceive the wy 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.980
 the et have two more than ten 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.049
 seconds of the first level 1 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.760
 which is pretty but remember for its 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.110
 passive each time they use spells reduces 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.080
 the rest of cooling in a second 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.090
 so calculate with candy against which 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.459
 we should play against rise does not have 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.230
 earls properly said but and nar 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.090
 imaoka and they hold it pretty well 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.849
 besides that they are good receivers of guns 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.230
 rise and has been against subtracted wants 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.010
 know how to play against the champions more 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.120
 Annoying soon more like playing against 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.560
 remember that you choose the following 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.269
 champion countered if you have 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.160
 problems with mouse and in turn 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.360
 look at the previous chapters if it has 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.360
 liked it I like it
