depends on the incense itself 20 so and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.920 
depends on the incense itself 20 so and
the<00:01:27.479> different<00:01:28.700> bandings<00:01:29.700> yeah<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.720> by

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the different bandings yeah it's just by

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.100 
the different bandings yeah it's just by
the<00:01:30.990> thickness<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> scope<00:01:31.860> oh<00:01:32.130> ok<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.659> just

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the thickness of the scope oh ok so just

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
the thickness of the scope oh ok so just
so<00:01:34.320> i<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.590> visualize<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:36.030> your

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
so i can visualize this so you have your

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.830 
so i can visualize this so you have your
camera<00:01:36.420> set<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.680> somewhere<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.840> then

tripod<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> macro<00:01:54.750> lens<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.290> take<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
tripod with the macro lens and take it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
tripod with the macro lens and take it
to<00:01:55.710> take<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> shop<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.430> experiment<00:01:57.270> yeah

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to take the shop and experiment yeah

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.060 
to take the shop and experiment yeah
right<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.950> why<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.399> power<00:01:59.640> smells<00:02:00.540> great

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
right now why is the power smells great

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.609 
right now why is the power smells great
why<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.310> power<00:02:02.460> suit<00:02:02.990> important<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.170> doing

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
why is the power suit important in doing

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.709 
why is the power suit important in doing
something<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.579> really<00:02:06.299> really

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
something like that it's really really

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.440 
something like that it's really really
fundamental<00:02:07.409> because<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.310> doesn't<00:02:08.729> wash<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
fundamental because it doesn't wash the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.469 
fundamental because it doesn't wash the
light<00:02:09.660> everywhere

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
light everywhere

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.839 
light everywhere
it<00:02:10.569> just<00:02:10.810> focuses<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.560> beam<00:02:11.769> where<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.580> want

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
it just focuses the beam where you want

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.110 
it just focuses the beam where you want
it<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.239> that's<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.349> so<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.190> other<00:02:15.310> words<00:02:15.549> if

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
it and that's it so in other words if

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.490 
it and that's it so in other words if
you<00:02:16.330> didn't<00:02:16.569> use<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.720> parish<00:02:17.080> knew<00:02:17.260> there

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
you didn't use a parish knew there

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.440 
you didn't use a parish knew there
wouldn't<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.799> black<00:02:18.010> behind<00:02:18.190> your<00:02:18.489> smoke<00:02:18.790> yeah

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
wouldn't be black behind your smoke yeah

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.630 
wouldn't be black behind your smoke yeah
exactly<00:02:19.750> exactly<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.220> wouldn't<00:02:21.489> get

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
exactly exactly and you wouldn't get

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.839 
exactly exactly and you wouldn't get
that<00:02:21.670> crisp<00:02:22.620> lighting<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.890> incense<00:02:24.610> smoke

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
that crisp lighting of the incense smoke

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.789 
that crisp lighting of the incense smoke
that<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.540> can<00:02:25.870> otherwise<00:02:26.230> just

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
that you that you can otherwise just

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.400 
that you that you can otherwise just
using<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.160> regular<00:02:27.360> flash<00:02:28.360> because<00:02:28.810> if<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.260> was

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
using a regular flash because if it was

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.140 
using a regular flash because if it was
diffused<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.129> wouldn't<00:02:30.400> be<00:02:30.459> crisp<00:02:30.760> that's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
diffused it wouldn't be crisp that's

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.580 
diffused it wouldn't be crisp that's
right<00:02:31.299> right<00:02:31.599> so<00:02:31.840> that's<00:02:32.019> interesting<00:02:32.500> I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
right right so that's interesting I

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.350 
right right so that's interesting I
never<00:02:32.739> thought<00:02:32.920> about<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.190> use<00:02:33.549> before<00:02:33.910> what

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
never thought about that use before what

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.420 
never thought about that use before what
made<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.569> think<00:02:34.690> about<00:02:34.989> lighting<00:02:35.890> up<00:02:36.129> smoke

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
made you think about lighting up smoke

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.210 
made you think about lighting up smoke
and<00:02:36.610> turning<00:02:36.879> them<00:02:36.940> into<00:02:37.120> shapes<00:02:37.390> just

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
and turning them into shapes just

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.949 
and turning them into shapes just
playing<00:02:39.220> around<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.700> got<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> brand<00:02:40.510> new<00:02:40.599> macro
