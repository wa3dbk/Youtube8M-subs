Holloway's<00:00:01.290> let's<00:00:01.709> take<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> look<00:00:02.340> at<00:00:02.510> sealed

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
Holloway's let's take a look at sealed

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.280 
Holloway's let's take a look at sealed
air<00:00:04.160> fill<00:00:05.160> layer<00:00:05.400> extreme<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.240> these<00:00:06.450> are<00:00:06.660> new

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
air fill layer extreme and these are new

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.810 
air fill layer extreme and these are new
packaging<00:00:08.010> material<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:10.490> got<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
packaging material that I got in the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.230 
packaging material that I got in the
last<00:00:12.750> few<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.320> my<00:00:13.530> packaging<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.639> was<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> quite

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
last few of my packaging it was a quite

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.500 
last few of my packaging it was a quite
interesting<00:00:15.920> again<00:00:16.920> quite<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> unique<00:00:18.000> idea

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
interesting again quite a unique idea

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.160 
interesting again quite a unique idea
you<00:00:19.380> just<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.770> fill<00:00:20.010> layer<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.430> these<00:00:20.640> are<00:00:20.820> big

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
you just a fill layer in these are big

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.920 
you just a fill layer in these are big
packets<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:23.359> package<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.680> with<00:00:25.680> any<00:00:25.920> item<00:00:26.279> and

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
packets and package it with any item and

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.109 
packets and package it with any item and
once<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.199> reaches<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> destination<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.939> can

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
once it reaches the destination they can

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.420 
once it reaches the destination they can
just<00:00:30.650> boost<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.099> packets<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.270> recycle<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
just boost the packets and recycle the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.450 
just boost the packets and recycle the
plastic<00:00:35.450> film<00:00:38.690> again<00:00:39.800> this<00:00:40.800> video<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
plastic film again this video how to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.540 
plastic film again this video how to
transport<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.270> large<00:00:43.100> packaging<00:00:44.100> material

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
transport a large packaging material

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.130 
transport a large packaging material
around<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.289> think<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.620> company<00:00:47.070> buys<00:00:47.430> them

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
around I think the company buys them

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.380 
around I think the company buys them
just<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> packets<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.600> pumps<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.809> before

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
just as a packets and pumps here before

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.450 
just as a packets and pumps here before
shipping<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> package<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.170> way<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.280> can

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
shipping the package that way they can

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.209 
shipping the package that way they can
minimize<00:00:56.789> shipping<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.899> also<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> less

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
minimize shipping and it also is a less

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.310 
minimize shipping and it also is a less
weight<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.420> gives<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.840> very<00:01:04.170> good

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
weight and that gives a very good

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.820 
weight and that gives a very good
protection<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.729> really

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
protection as you can see it's really

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.630 
protection as you can see it's really
hard<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.040> crush<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.780> when<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.640> once

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
hard to crush this and when it's once

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 
hard to crush this and when it's once
it's<00:01:12.020> reaches<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.530> destination<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.400> can

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it's reaches the destination you can

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.320 
it's reaches the destination you can
just<00:01:14.760> pop<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.630> bubble<00:01:16.430> or<00:01:17.430> pop<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> packet

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
just pop the bubble or pop the packet

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.679 
just pop the bubble or pop the packet
and<00:01:18.570> recycle<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> film<00:01:20.270> they<00:01:21.270> won't<00:01:21.450> have

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and recycle the film they won't have

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.320 
and recycle the film they won't have
some<00:01:21.990> mine<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:22.740> recycling<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
some mine for now recycling if you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.999 
some mine for now recycling if you
forget<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:29.659> it's<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:31.009> unique

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
forget a lot of it and it's a unique

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.640 
forget a lot of it and it's a unique
idea<00:01:32.430> which<00:01:32.880> I've<00:01:33.090> seen<00:01:33.420> usually<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
idea which I've seen usually we see the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.640 
idea which I've seen usually we see the
small<00:01:34.770> bubble<00:01:35.369> zones<00:01:35.810> but<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> think<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
small bubble zones but I think this is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.200 
small bubble zones but I think this is
more<00:01:39.170> customizable<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:42.890> lightweight<00:01:43.890> too

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
more customizable and lightweight too

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.429 
more customizable and lightweight too
compared<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> also<00:01:46.049> views

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
compared to that one and it also views

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.550 
compared to that one and it also views
really<00:01:47.399> good<00:01:47.549> protection<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
really good protection because the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
really good protection because the
packets<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.460> hold<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.030> air<00:01:51.299> quite<00:01:51.600> well

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
packets really hold the air quite well

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.200 
packets really hold the air quite well
as<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.159> any<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> use<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
as you can see if any one I use it as a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.469 
as you can see if any one I use it as a
pillow<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:57.049> let<00:01:58.049> me<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.380> show<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> how<00:01:59.479> good

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
pillow and let me just show you how good

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.569 
pillow and let me just show you how good
the<00:02:01.280> packet<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.509> take<00:02:03.930> quite<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> lot<00:02:04.469> of

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
the packet is it can take quite a lot of

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.449 
the packet is it can take quite a lot of
as<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.700> means<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:06.000> trying<00:02:06.299> my<00:02:06.659> hardest<00:02:07.459> still

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
as it means I'm trying my hardest still

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.320 
as it means I'm trying my hardest still
it's<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.849> bursting

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
it's not bursting

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.830 
it's not bursting
let<00:02:12.330> me<00:02:12.540> try<00:02:12.860> both<00:02:13.860> my<00:02:14.130> hands<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.270> if<00:02:15.420> that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
let me try both my hands and see if that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.140 
let me try both my hands and see if that
helps

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
helps

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.620 
helps
even<00:02:18.150> now<00:02:18.390> poking<00:02:19.220> doesn't<00:02:20.390> affect<00:02:21.390> as<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
even now poking doesn't affect as you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.750 
even now poking doesn't affect as you
can<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.930> even<00:02:24.590> got<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> bump<00:02:25.950> still<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.580> doesn't

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
can see even got a bump still it doesn't

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.600 
can see even got a bump still it doesn't
burst<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.960> need<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.380> really<00:02:28.770> put<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> lot<00:02:29.460> of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
burst you need to really put a lot of

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.970 
burst you need to really put a lot of
pressure<00:02:30.260> as<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.380> can<00:02:31.530> see<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.920> is

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
pressure as you can see and this is

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.550 
pressure as you can see and this is
another<00:02:35.550> type<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.820> material<00:02:36.690> I've<00:02:36.810> found

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
another type of material I've found

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.110 
another type of material I've found
recently<00:02:39.410> rather<00:02:40.410> than<00:02:40.620> single<00:02:41.400> small

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
recently rather than single small

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.280 
recently rather than single small
bubbles<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:43.380> have<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> row<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.550> bubbles<00:02:45.290> again

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
bubbles they have a row of bubbles again

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.500 
bubbles they have a row of bubbles again
I<00:02:46.410> think<00:02:46.620> these<00:02:46.770> are<00:02:46.830> filled<00:02:47.310> at<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.910> shippers

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
I think these are filled at the shippers

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.060 
I think these are filled at the shippers
side<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:50.390> they<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.630> how<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.750> buy<00:02:52.680> huge

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
side so they don't know how to buy huge
