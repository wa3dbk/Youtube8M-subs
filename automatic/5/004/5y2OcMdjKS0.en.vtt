00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 tomorrow people welcome to big world 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.200
 and welcome to the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.719
 third part at the 600 euro gamer pc 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.860
 build your own guide 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.570
 this time we will house that 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.330
 prepare for it later, of course 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 also the mainboard cpu cpu-cooler what 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.900
 We assembled in the second part 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 have to use there 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 Of course, there is the hdd 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.760
 install the optical drive and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.760
 last but also the power supply a lot of fun 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.230
 Again, everyone should work again 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.329
 with clean and fat-free hands 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.399
 to be performed as well is the earth 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.530
 to a free position at a heating 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.110
 or at a p / e of a socket not 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.719
 to forget about later the mainboard cpu 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.610
 cpu cooler and memory in the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.710
 To be able to install housing first 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.989
 the housing will be prepared 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.850
 For this purpose, the housing is opened around itself 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.649
 an overview of the included 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.480
 installation materials and the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.670
 cable inside to get 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.710
 the side panels are over the rendel 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 unscrewed screws at the rear and removed 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.810
 the io blinds in the scope of delivery of 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.710
 Mainboards is included from the inside 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.990
 pressed in the corresponding opening 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.270
 the cool master n 300 is an optical one 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.100
 drive must first install 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.049
 the front panel will be deducted 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.460
 This happens with relatively much power 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.650
 but still with caution 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 now the aperture for the 5 can be 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.880
 taken from quarter inch drive shaft 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.250
 and the dvd drive are inserted 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.650
 because the housing to fix the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.750
 drive has several holes 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.030
 The front panel is now plugged in again 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.210
 to properly drive the DVD drive 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
 position and with the housing 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.450
 fastened screws 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.070
 Here we are against the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.759
 screwless installation system 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.740
 decided 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.990
 on the one hand, this makes for the dvd 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.149
 Drive a trusting impression 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.610
 on the other hand next to optical drives 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.619
 like to have high speeds at their 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.320
 noise then through too much play 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.899
 can be strengthened the hard disk 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.329
 Find further and place in the housing 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.799
 should be one of the n 300 as possible 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.570
 lower drive bays for the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.429
 use hard disk so that the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.619
 drawn air of the overlying 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.450
 Fans unhindered by the housing 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.250
 can flow 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.860
 to suffer from temperature problems 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.360
 normally never have disks here 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.280
 we use the hard disk with the screws 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.349
 loose installation system attached 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.209
 Unused plastic clips should be out 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.340
 the housing will be removed as these are the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.440
 overall noise could amplify 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 now the spacers for the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.940
 Mainboard screwed in mostly stands like 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.130
 here at the cool master n 300 on the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.400
 mainboard tray which holes for which 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.830
 mainboard size so atx micro atx or 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.930
 mini atx with a spacer 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.209
 must be provided as you are in 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.739
 fourth part can see atx mainboards 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.690
 may also be narrower 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.730
 that's why the sitting on the edge 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.160
 Spacers are also unnecessary 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.410
 In some cases, we can also house them 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.480
 here at n 300 is cool master 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.579
 a small tool at laid with what 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.900
 The spacers also great with 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.709
 a a Phillips screwdriver 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.870
 screw 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.060
 Now the power supply can be used 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.130
 this will be installed so that 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.810
 fan down shows thus will 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.940
 Power supply separately ventilated 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.890
 the power supply is now with the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.590
 mainboard or power supply included 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.480
 screws over cross fastened the cables 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.190
 of the power supply can finally by 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.489
 The opening of the mainboard tray is plugged 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.489
 become 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.730
 Finally, for the next step 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.069
 for something orderly you should 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.560
 all disturbing cables to housing temporarily 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.560
 fasten or at least tie together 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.100
 the mainboard at the tu cpu cooler and 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.120
 Memory can now be unhindered 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.010
 be used so that was it now 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.840
 here first of the third part we have 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.569
 the housing prepared so far that we 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.800
 the mainboard sang cpu cpu cooler and 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.019
 the main memory 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.690
 in the next part then in the housing 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.090
 can bring a little tip yet 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.340
 Definitely have a look in here 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.660
 the installation time of the housing there 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.760
 is then described which screws 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.769
 You can use what for 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.319
 circumstances like ours now not always 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.170
 quite as accurate but it's worth it 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.329
 In any case, that 's it for now 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.859
 here with the third part looks at the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.169
 fourth part wants to see things like us 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.360
 then as already said the mainboard there 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.130
 bring in with cpu cpu cooler and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.410
 RAM then of course, too 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.930
 install the video card and the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.310
 all cable management do what 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.930
 Now here first of me if you 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.970
 the video has fallen then give us 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.650
 but a thumbs up visit us 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.960
 on our channel there are still 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.140
 more of the whole stuff and of course 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.390
 also on facebook 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.020
 otherwise diligently comment on what 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.020
 now here from me
