00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.880 
of the other pods I've gotten from Jim
it<00:02:17.190> does<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.820> fairly<00:02:18.690> refreshing<00:02:19.500> feel

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
it does have this fairly refreshing feel

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.010 
it does have this fairly refreshing feel
to<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.280> though<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:21.150> know<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> couple<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.780> pods

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
to it though you know a couple of pods

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.130 
to it though you know a couple of pods
in<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> past<00:02:22.530> I've<00:02:23.360> tried<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.480> make<00:02:24.660> some<00:02:24.959> kind

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
in the past I've tried to make some kind

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.960 
in the past I've tried to make some kind
of<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.380> comparison<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> cucumber<00:02:26.940> or

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
of a comparison to a cucumber or

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.470 
of a comparison to a cucumber or
zucchini<00:02:28.640> I'm<00:02:29.640> getting<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.000> little<00:02:30.150> bit<00:02:30.390> of

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
zucchini I'm getting a little bit of

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.980 
zucchini I'm getting a little bit of
that<00:02:30.770> but<00:02:31.770> not<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.190> much<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.660> other<00:02:33.810> two

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
that but not as much as the other two

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.080 
that but not as much as the other two
pods<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.530> had<00:02:34.740> with<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.790> which<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.030> said

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
pods that I had with in which I said

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.560 
pods that I had with in which I said
what<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.900> said<00:02:37.970> cucumber<00:02:38.970> zucchini<00:02:39.000> you

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
what I just said cucumber zucchini you

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.820 
what I just said cucumber zucchini you
never<00:02:39.810> would<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.380> never<00:02:40.650> would<00:02:40.800> have

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
never would have you never would have

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.290 
never would have you never would have
thought<00:02:40.920> about<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.490> would<00:02:41.850> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
thought about that would you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.680 
thought about that would you
he<00:02:43.230> just<00:02:43.500> stays<00:02:44.340> around<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:45.680> nothing<00:02:46.680> major

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
he just stays around it's nothing major

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.070 
he just stays around it's nothing major
fairly<00:02:48.690> minor

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
fairly minor

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.560 
fairly minor
I<00:02:50.000> would<00:02:51.000> give<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.600> heat<00:02:51.900> perhaps<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:53.570> one

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
I would give this on heat perhaps a one

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.120 
I would give this on heat perhaps a one
and<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.780> half<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.830> ten<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.890> stays

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
and a half out of ten it just stays

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.940 
and a half out of ten it just stays
there<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> it's<00:02:59.910> not<00:03:00.060> getting<00:03:00.209> any<00:03:00.480> hotter

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
there and it's not getting any hotter

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.130 
there and it's not getting any hotter
still<00:03:01.950> remains<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.880> tip<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.930> tongue

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
still remains on the tip of the tongue

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.000 
still remains on the tip of the tongue
and<00:03:04.410> not<00:03:04.560> too<00:03:04.800> much<00:03:04.950> more<00:03:05.280> than<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:07.010> don't

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
and not too much more than that I don't

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.440 
and not too much more than that I don't
think<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.250> even<00:03:08.340> trying<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.850> migrate<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.239> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
think it's even trying to migrate to the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.479 
think it's even trying to migrate to the
back<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> throat<00:03:10.049> at<00:03:10.170> all<00:03:10.489> flavor-wise

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
back of the throat at all flavor-wise

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.120 
back of the throat at all flavor-wise
again<00:03:12.150> yeah<00:03:13.489> it's<00:03:14.489> all<00:03:14.670> right

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
again yeah it's all right

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.070 
again yeah it's all right
mostly<00:03:17.130> good<00:03:17.370> mostly<00:03:18.269> good<00:03:18.480> on<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.780> one

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
mostly good mostly good on this one

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.220 
mostly good mostly good on this one
I<00:03:19.290> think<00:03:20.070> again<00:03:20.400> after<00:03:21.360> having<00:03:21.570> some<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
I think again after having some of the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.600 
I think again after having some of the
other<00:03:22.350> pods<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.890> I've<00:03:23.070> already<00:03:23.430> reviewed

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
other pods that I've already reviewed

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.289

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
from Jim which has enormous ly high

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.740 
from Jim which has enormous ly high
standards<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.019> live<00:03:28.230> up<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.410> no<00:03:28.769> less<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:30.630> know

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
standards to live up to no less you know

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.900 
standards to live up to no less you know
this<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.799> me<00:03:31.980> becoming<00:03:32.370> becoming

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
this is just to me becoming becoming

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.259 
this is just to me becoming becoming
another<00:03:33.180> pot<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.920> take<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:35.760> what<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.239> is

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
another pot so take that for what it is

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.740 
another pot so take that for what it is
it<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:37.530> fairly<00:03:38.310> solid<00:03:38.640> it's<00:03:39.000> pretty<00:03:39.239> good<00:03:39.510> and

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750
