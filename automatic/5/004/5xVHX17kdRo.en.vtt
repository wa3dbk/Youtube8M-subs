00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.000 

I<00:00:03.600> think<00:00:04.600> one<00:00:05.140> of<00:00:05.170> the<00:00:05.290> biggest<00:00:05.529> problems<00:00:05.890> we

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.010 
I think one of the biggest problems we

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.760 
I think one of the biggest problems we
have<00:00:06.250> at<00:00:06.630> developing<00:00:07.630> pace<00:00:08.230> bowlers<00:00:08.740> in

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:08.770 
have at developing pace bowlers in

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.549 
have at developing pace bowlers in
particular<00:00:09.250> is<00:00:09.850> that<00:00:10.420> most<00:00:10.809> coaches<00:00:11.320> don't

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
particular is that most coaches don't

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.000 
particular is that most coaches don't
really<00:00:11.799> understand<00:00:12.490> where<00:00:12.789> speed<00:00:13.209> comes<00:00:13.600> from

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
really understand where speed comes from

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.490 
really understand where speed comes from
how<00:00:15.010> its<00:00:15.160> generated<00:00:15.279> in<00:00:15.789> the<00:00:15.879> body<00:00:16.090> or<00:00:17.020> how<00:00:17.440> to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
how its generated in the body or how to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.940 
how its generated in the body or how to
coach<00:00:17.949> speed<00:00:18.910> into<00:00:19.390> fast<00:00:20.050> bowlers<00:00:20.440> themselves

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
coach speed into fast bowlers themselves

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.460 
coach speed into fast bowlers themselves
so<00:00:21.100> this<00:00:21.730> is<00:00:21.880> one<00:00:22.030> we<00:00:22.180> have<00:00:22.330> this<00:00:22.540> saying<00:00:23.110> that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
so this is one we have this saying that

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.650 
so this is one we have this saying that
fast<00:00:23.680> bowlers<00:00:24.190> are<00:00:24.310> born<00:00:24.520> not<00:00:24.880> made<00:00:24.910> which<00:00:25.540> of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
fast bowlers are born not made which of

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.560 
fast bowlers are born not made which of
course<00:00:25.980> isn't<00:00:26.980> true<00:00:27.280> fast<00:00:27.670> bowling<00:00:27.940> is<00:00:28.510> a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
course isn't true fast bowling is a

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.980 
course isn't true fast bowling is a
process<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.500> like<00:00:29.710> any<00:00:29.980> process<00:00:30.840> humans<00:00:31.840> can

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
process and like any process humans can

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.510 
process and like any process humans can
learn<00:00:32.169> it<00:00:32.379> you're<00:00:32.500> not<00:00:32.649> born<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:33.039> doctor<00:00:33.370> you're

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
learn it you're not born a doctor you're

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.310 
learn it you're not born a doctor you're
not<00:00:33.640> born<00:00:33.879> an<00:00:34.030> engineer<00:00:34.449> you're<00:00:34.600> not<00:00:34.780> born<00:00:35.230> a

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
not born an engineer you're not born a

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.460 
not born an engineer you're not born a
scientist<00:00:35.860> you<00:00:36.100> learn<00:00:36.570> those<00:00:37.570> skills<00:00:37.630> and<00:00:38.320> you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
scientist you learn those skills and you

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.830 
scientist you learn those skills and you
develop<00:00:39.310> the<00:00:39.460> knowledge<00:00:39.850> about<00:00:40.150> how<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.540> do

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
develop the knowledge about how to do

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.410 
develop the knowledge about how to do
those<00:00:41.020> specific<00:00:41.770> roles<00:00:42.040> and<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:43.060> same<00:00:43.270> is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
those specific roles and the same is

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.210 
those specific roles and the same is
true<00:00:43.450> of<00:00:43.690> batting<00:00:44.200> and<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.500> same<00:00:44.710> therefore

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
true of batting and the same therefore

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.979 
true of batting and the same therefore
it's<00:00:45.520> true<00:00:45.670> fast<00:00:46.000> bowling<00:00:46.300> in<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.570> sense<00:00:46.899> that

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
it's true fast bowling in the sense that

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.590 
it's true fast bowling in the sense that
you<00:00:47.170> take<00:00:47.250> whatever<00:00:48.250> raw<00:00:48.520> talent<00:00:49.030> someone<00:00:49.360> has

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
you take whatever raw talent someone has

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.310 
you take whatever raw talent someone has
and<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.770> develop<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.399> into<00:00:51.989> hopefully<00:00:52.989> a

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
and you develop that into hopefully a

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.590 
and you develop that into hopefully a
world-class<00:00:54.300> cricketer<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:56.320> think<00:00:57.040> that<00:00:57.600> what

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
world-class cricketer I think that what

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.510 
world-class cricketer I think that what
is<00:00:58.719> lacking<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.410> world<00:00:59.680> at<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.920> moment<00:01:00.100> is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
is lacking in the world at the moment is

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.049 
is lacking in the world at the moment is
