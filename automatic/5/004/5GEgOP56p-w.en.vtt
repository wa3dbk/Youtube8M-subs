00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 hi people i am want clipper too 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 known as piranha 4 and good today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.740
 we are here continuing the series the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.949
 killer mods because I was good 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.109
 weeks has occupied and well then now 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.890
 we continue the series with a mod that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.060
 well, it's quite interesting 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.060
 and it is this 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.629
 it's called dragon mount and it consists of 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.030
 have a minecraft dragon and a dragon 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.360
 that I can master and I can walk with him 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.320
 there as you can see in the aesthetics 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.130
 of the dragon is the host 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.170
 As you can see, look, I can walk and 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.930
 eat the wings when pressing space then 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.809
 fly and it's a pet I can take it 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.390
 wherever and the whole subject and now 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.090
 let's see how I know how this works 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.470
 this good way 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:09.520
 and this out and let's see what's good for 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.070
 this way we will need three items three 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.830
 objects is a very small mode but 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.690
 visually it is a pass then 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.130
 let's put the first item that is the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.030
 dragon egg with dragon egg 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.120
 we can invoke our dragon 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.880
 simply giving him a punch with 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.430
 the right click 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.140
 we invoke the dragon what happens now 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.049
 We saw dragons are without anything I can 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.630
 get on it but do not pay attention to me 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.679
 so what you have to do is catch 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.719
 the chair with the mythical chair for 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.310
 pigs and put it on as you see has changed 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.530
 the way and now I can I get on 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.960
 on top of him and I can therefore walk around 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.960
 and fly I can go from one place to another 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.200
 and I can go around like the dragon is the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.120
 I host the very small mode but the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.130
 truth is that it would be very very good that 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.130
 put him in original minecraft not 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.840
 I think it costs you a lot but this is 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.200
 work is not that they work a lot 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.910
 version 1.3 should be almost 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.880
 two weeks or a few weeks if I do not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.270
 I'm wrong and until August , you will not really see 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.100
 what they do there said they are in a bottle 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.380
 it's the whole week after we go with the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.600
 next thing that is this 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.270
 this object the watermelon the melon 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.459
 shining forgiveness if I give it the veil of 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.100
 crucify the dragon as you see it becomes 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.620
 this color and what is this because this 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.360
 it's just that I can go through 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.819
 good walls I can go through everything 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.400
 you want 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.709
 this the dragon key minecraft already the one 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.349
 the one that we find in the end that 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.420
 dragon already does the same destroys everything 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.999
 what you do there, you can not crafter 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.950
 nothing because it simply destroys it 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:56.120
 the one that makes a house and is that is the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.690
 fucking love and good because nothing in rhythm is 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.850
 this is nothing else what 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.100
 what to add I think 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.280
 just as I would give it to put in 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.930
 this mode in what is the version of 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.820
 minecraft but good when you hit the button 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.620
 right as you see there is a platform that 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.220
 falls to the ground and here we have 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.430
 our egg and this egg and right now 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.609
 we break it good is not so creative 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.680
 Well, what we have again is common 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.540
 Dragonball capsules know it 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.420
 means nothing because we have a car 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.159
 good dragon, that's all here 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.150
 this series of mods that is very tiny 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.629
 but good but for the next 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.090
 chapter see if I find another way by 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.069
 true thanks to mac patxi that was the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.379
 who told me this mod and I hope that I 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.530
 you also recommend some that only 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.090
 I give a requirement that is not very 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.639
 known if it might not be the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.760
 mythical of always if it is a mod 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.010
 well i would like to make mods that are not 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.750
 known and that are original 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.609
 basically I also wanted to comment 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.169
 taking advantage of that I'm here in one in 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:06.780
 a medieval city with castles that yes 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.280
 can you send me the maps good and I 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.650
 send you are many maps I think I have 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.920
 nine or something like that but if you can 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.320
 send more better two weeks remain 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.000
 and the map according to what I have is going to be 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.769
 I cut short then to do something else 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.930
 great, it would be good if you send 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.520
 anything else remember that 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.400
 it is also worth a construction of this 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.840
 style a castle also worth me 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.400
 Well that's quite a greeting wants 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.310

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.940

 greeting and peace
