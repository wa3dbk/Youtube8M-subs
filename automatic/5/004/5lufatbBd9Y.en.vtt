00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
organizations in partnership with IBM so

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.260 
organizations in partnership with IBM so
we<00:00:32.920> looked<00:00:33.130> at<00:00:33.250> all<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.730> things<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.120> they've

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
we looked at all the things that they've

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.360 
we looked at all the things that they've
been<00:00:34.390> doing<00:00:34.720> in<00:00:34.870> their<00:00:35.530> strategic<00:00:35.710> mentoring

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
been doing in their strategic mentoring

my<00:00:39.760> interest<00:00:40.330> is<00:00:40.570> in<00:00:40.630> technology<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:41.620> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
my interest is in technology and and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.370 
my interest is in technology and and
engineering<00:00:43.390> oriented<00:00:43.840> products<00:00:44.260> and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
engineering oriented products and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.770 
engineering oriented products and
services<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:45.180> there's<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.240> real<00:00:46.420> challenge

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
services and there's a real challenge

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.680 
services and there's a real challenge
given<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.680> global<00:00:48.460> environment<00:00:48.580> now<00:00:49.510> in

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
given the global environment now in

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.300 
given the global environment now in
terms<00:00:49.990> of<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.620> development<00:00:50.920> process

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
terms of the development process

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.240 
terms of the development process
actually<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.150> do<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.510> variety<00:00:52.990> of<00:00:53.320> research<00:00:53.770> some

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
actually I do a variety of research some

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.320 
actually I do a variety of research some
of<00:00:54.400> which<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:56.310> fairly<00:00:57.310> directly<00:00:57.910> related<00:00:58.300> to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
of which is fairly directly related to

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.910 
of which is fairly directly related to
accounting<00:00:58.630> which<00:00:59.020> are<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.350> courses<00:00:59.620> I<00:00:59.770> teach

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
accounting which are the courses I teach

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.190 
accounting which are the courses I teach
but<00:01:00.280> other<00:01:00.520> parts<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:00.970> my<00:01:01.180> research<00:01:01.510> are<00:01:01.840> sort

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
but other parts of my research are sort

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.310 
but other parts of my research are sort
of<00:01:02.310> more<00:01:03.310> general<00:01:03.479> business<00:01:04.479> more

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
of more general business more

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.779 
of more general business more
specifically<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.950> did<00:01:06.189> some<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.429> the<00:01:06.520> first

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
specifically I did some of the first

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.719 
specifically I did some of the first
work<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.509> foreign<00:01:08.289> currency<00:01:08.740> options<00:01:08.859> I<00:01:09.369> look

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
work on foreign currency options I look

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.240 
work on foreign currency options I look
at<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.570> valuation<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.350> things<00:01:11.590> like<00:01:11.740> options

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
at the valuation of things like options

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.959 
at the valuation of things like options
and<00:01:12.609> forwards<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.780> futures<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.670> look<00:01:15.670> at<00:01:15.820> how

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
and forwards and futures and look at how

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.529 
and forwards and futures and look at how
those<00:01:16.210> markets<00:01:16.810> interact<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:18.539> more

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
those markets interact with more

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.419 
those markets interact with more
fundamental<00:01:20.259> markets<00:01:20.770> like<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.100> equity

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
fundamental markets like the equity

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.760 
fundamental markets like the equity
markets<00:01:21.939> foreign<00:01:22.869> currency<00:01:23.320> markets

higher productivity for example I'm not

higher productivity for example I'm not
over<00:01:33.819> the<00:01:33.909> opinion<00:01:34.270> for<00:01:34.450> example<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.929> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
over the opinion for example of the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.560 
over the opinion for example of the
world<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.469> purely<00:01:36.130> economic<00:01:36.429> and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
world is purely economic and

instead sort of purely behavioral and

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.730 
instead sort of purely behavioral and
those<00:01:43.000> two<00:01:43.240> areas<00:01:43.479> get<00:01:43.990> merged<00:01:44.320> in<00:01:44.620> my

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
those two areas get merged in my

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.130 
those two areas get merged in my
research<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.340> they<00:01:46.120> get<00:01:46.300> murdered<00:01:46.780> in<00:01:46.960> the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
research and they get murdered in the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.080 
research and they get murdered in the
way<00:01:47.260> I<00:01:47.290> handle<00:01:48.070> things<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.610> classroom<00:01:48.760> as

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
way I handle things in the classroom as

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.700 
way I handle things in the classroom as
well<00:01:49.120> there<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.630> very<00:01:50.110> big<00:01:50.830> link<00:01:51.390> between

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
well there is a very big link between

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.200 
well there is a very big link between
research<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:53.979> or<00:01:54.130> stud<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.430> classroom<00:01:55.030> I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
research and or stud in the classroom I

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.719 
research and or stud in the classroom I
think<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.869> don't<00:01:56.200> maintain<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.950> link<00:01:57.250> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
think you don't maintain that link the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.420 
think you don't maintain that link the
classes<00:01:58.240> get<00:01:58.450> boring<00:01:59.020> because<00:01:59.800> you're<00:02:00.220> not
