00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
so we're creating a piece of artwork I

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.700 
so we're creating a piece of artwork I
like<00:00:15.650> to<00:00:16.160> try<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:17.060> feel<00:00:17.599> it<00:00:17.960> as<00:00:18.199> opposed<00:00:18.590> to

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
like to try and feel it as opposed to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.310 
like to try and feel it as opposed to
just<00:00:19.009> copying<00:00:19.520> a<00:00:19.640> photograph<00:00:20.180> or<00:00:20.390> trying<00:00:20.660> so

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
just copying a photograph or trying so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.979 
just copying a photograph or trying so
to<00:00:21.380> get<00:00:21.619> into<00:00:21.829> the<00:00:22.070> atmosphere<00:00:22.220> I<00:00:22.939> started<00:00:23.869> off

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:23.989 
to get into the atmosphere I started off

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.300 
to get into the atmosphere I started off
by<00:00:24.020> putting<00:00:24.619> on<00:00:24.770> a<00:00:24.800> number<00:00:25.099> of<00:00:25.160> different

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
by putting on a number of different

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.370 
by putting on a number of different
washes<00:00:26.029> again<00:00:26.419> everything<00:00:27.020> sort<00:00:27.320> of

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
washes again everything sort of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.010 
washes again everything sort of
directional<00:00:28.129> which<00:00:28.369> helps<00:00:28.820> me<00:00:29.119> remember<00:00:29.570> I

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
directional which helps me remember I

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.040 
directional which helps me remember I
like<00:00:30.860> to<00:00:31.099> work<00:00:31.250> in<00:00:31.520> layers<00:00:31.759> because<00:00:32.509> I<00:00:32.719> like

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
like to work in layers because I like

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.709 
like to work in layers because I like
the<00:00:34.040> highlights<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.129> find<00:00:37.520> that<00:00:37.910> you<00:00:38.570> know

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
the highlights and I find that you know

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.389 
the highlights and I find that you know
if<00:00:38.899> I've<00:00:39.079> got<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.469> whites<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.129> paper

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
if I've got the whites of the paper

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.760 
if I've got the whites of the paper
doing<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.420> work<00:00:41.629> of<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:41.870> highlights<00:00:42.410> for<00:00:42.710> me

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
doing the work of the highlights for me

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.729 
doing the work of the highlights for me
although<00:00:43.219> often<00:00:44.150> highlights<00:00:44.930> aren't<00:00:45.560> that

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
although often highlights aren't that

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.010 
although often highlights aren't that
white<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:46.430> this<00:00:46.610> case<00:00:46.940> I've<00:00:47.239> pretty<00:00:47.480> much<00:00:47.540> left

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
white in this case I've pretty much left

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.569 
white in this case I've pretty much left
them<00:00:48.320> as<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.160> paper<00:00:49.400> I<00:00:49.640> think<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:50.060> works<00:00:50.360> okay

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
them as the paper I think it works okay

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.639 
them as the paper I think it works okay
if<00:00:52.579> some<00:00:52.850> saturation<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.750> really<00:00:53.989> actually<00:00:54.320> go

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
if some saturation to really actually go

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.280 
if some saturation to really actually go
that<00:00:54.860> right<00:00:55.190> I<00:00:55.610> think<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.480> works<00:00:56.690> because<00:00:56.930> it's

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
that right I think it works because it's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.549 
that right I think it works because it's
it's<00:00:57.649> bright<00:00:57.980> atmosphere<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:59.200> the<00:01:00.200> Greens

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
it's bright atmosphere and the Greens

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.549 
it's bright atmosphere and the Greens
have<00:01:01.280> sort<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.730> made<00:01:02.450> it<00:01:02.720> a<00:01:02.750> nice<00:01:03.079> sort<00:01:03.500> of

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
have sort of made it a nice sort of

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.190 
have sort of made it a nice sort of
Pleasant<00:01:04.040> contrasting<00:01:04.909> bluey<00:01:05.210> green<00:01:05.659> sort<00:01:06.140> of

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
Pleasant contrasting bluey green sort of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.590 
Pleasant contrasting bluey green sort of
kulish<00:01:06.770> against<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.759> warmth<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.329> body

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
kulish against the warmth of the body

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.469 
kulish against the warmth of the body
really<00:01:09.439> to<00:01:09.560> make<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:09.770> stand<00:01:10.189> out<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.880> haven't

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
really to make it stand out I haven't

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.109 
really to make it stand out I haven't
done<00:01:11.689> too<00:01:11.930> much<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.560> sky<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:13.310> could<00:01:14.000> have

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
done too much to the sky I could have

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.620 
done too much to the sky I could have
knocked<00:01:14.360> back<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:15.290> clouds<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:16.729> just<00:01:17.030> had<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> a

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
knocked back the clouds and just had a a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.870 
knocked back the clouds and just had a a
plain<00:01:17.929> wash<00:01:18.709> which<00:01:19.100> might<00:01:19.399> have<00:01:19.609> made<00:01:19.639> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
plain wash which might have made the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.419 
plain wash which might have made the
highlight<00:01:20.240> stand<00:01:20.600> out<00:01:20.780> even<00:01:20.810> more<00:01:21.219> but<00:01:22.219> I

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
highlight stand out even more but I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.010 
highlight stand out even more but I
think<00:01:22.729> sometimes<00:01:23.389> when<00:01:23.600> you're<00:01:23.780> doing<00:01:23.869> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
think sometimes when you're doing the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.980 
think sometimes when you're doing the
piece<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.439> work<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.569> might<00:01:26.569> think<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.959> that

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
piece of work you might think of that

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.379 
piece of work you might think of that
and<00:01:27.380> think<00:01:27.560> what<00:01:27.709> okay<00:01:28.069> the<00:01:28.310> next<00:01:28.639> one<00:01:28.789> I<00:01:28.819> do<00:01:28.939> or

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.389 
and think what okay the next one I do or

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.010 
and think what okay the next one I do or

might<00:01:30.619> try<00:01:30.859> that<00:01:31.479> can<00:01:32.479> have<00:01:32.630> bright<00:01:32.869> ideas<00:01:33.350> as

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
might try that can have bright ideas as

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.690 
might try that can have bright ideas as
you<00:01:33.679> go<00:01:33.829> along<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.249> you<00:01:34.310> can't<00:01:34.549> necessarily

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
you go along and you can't necessarily

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.269 
you go along and you can't necessarily
change<00:01:35.149> things<00:01:35.749> without<00:01:35.929> making<00:01:36.289> it<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.859> total

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:37.279 
change things without making it a total

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:43.029 
change things without making it a total
mess<00:01:37.639> of<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:41.840> think<00:01:41.990> although<00:01:42.469> it<00:01:42.709> looks

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
mess of it so I think although it looks

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.269 
mess of it so I think although it looks
like<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.490> was<00:01:43.700> doing<00:01:44.029> detail<00:01:44.749> I<00:01:45.020> would<00:01:45.279> expect

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:46.279 
like I was doing detail I would expect

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.139 
like I was doing detail I would expect
to<00:01:46.670> do<00:01:47.479> more<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.319> this<00:01:48.619> piece<00:01:49.069> of<00:01:49.099> artwork<00:01:49.579> to

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
to do more to this piece of artwork to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.919 
to do more to this piece of artwork to
make<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.630> more<00:01:50.810> polished<00:01:51.369> I<00:01:52.369> really<00:01:53.329> wanted<00:01:53.749> to

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
make it more polished I really wanted to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.239 
make it more polished I really wanted to
show<00:01:54.200> how<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.649> could<00:01:55.689> enjoy<00:01:56.689> creating<00:01:57.499> an

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
animal which does require synthesis

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.650

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.940 
internal work I like working with that
so<00:02:27.910> not<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.150> huge<00:02:28.480> amount<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:29.140> color<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:29.650> again

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
so not a huge amount of color but again

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.310 
so not a huge amount of color but again
that<00:02:30.250> was<00:02:30.490> really<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.570> purpose<00:02:31.840> was<00:02:32.200> just

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
that was really the purpose was just

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.830 
that was really the purpose was just
focusing<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.640> animal<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.300> just<00:02:34.330> having<00:02:34.750> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
focusing on the animal and just having a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.320 
focusing on the animal and just having a
bit<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.290> cool<00:02:35.980> contrast<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.940> it

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
bit of a cool contrast to it

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.180 
bit of a cool contrast to it
so<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.140> thought<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.350> really<00:02:38.739> didn't<00:02:39.010> needed

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
so that's thought I really didn't needed

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.720 
so that's thought I really didn't needed
to<00:02:39.459> do<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:41.280> think<00:02:42.280> everyone<00:02:42.580> you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
to do with this one I think everyone you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.940 
to do with this one I think everyone you
do<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.630> learn<00:02:43.840> from<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.590> think<00:02:44.830> what

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
do you learn from and you think what

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.470 
do you learn from and you think what
okay<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.430> next<00:02:45.730> time<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:45.940> do<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.270> slightly

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
okay the next time I do it slightly

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.680 
okay the next time I do it slightly
differently<00:02:46.989> but<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.650> know<00:02:47.830> some<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
differently but you know some of the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.890 
differently but you know some of the
marks<00:02:50.110> I'm<00:02:50.470> happy<00:02:51.400> with<00:02:54.239> but<00:02:55.239> I'm<00:02:55.390> happy<00:02:55.780> in

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
marks I'm happy with but I'm happy in

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.930 
marks I'm happy with but I'm happy in
the<00:02:56.050> end<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.890> know<00:02:57.070> fits<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> paper

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the end that you know fits on a paper

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.870 
the end that you know fits on a paper
okay<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.500> looks<00:02:59.739> like<00:02:59.830> it's<00:03:00.130> moving<00:03:00.459> this

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
okay and it looks like it's moving this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.850 
okay and it looks like it's moving this
atmosphere<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.989> I've<00:03:02.110> got<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> highlights

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
atmosphere and I've got the highlights

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
atmosphere and I've got the highlights
and<00:03:03.130> some<00:03:03.340> depth

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
and some depth

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.490 
and some depth
they<00:03:04.000> have<00:03:04.870> happened<00:03:05.200> with<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.850> used

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
they have happened with that I used

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.870 
they have happened with that I used
actually<00:03:08.500> two<00:03:08.709> very<00:03:08.920> nice<00:03:09.220> brushes<00:03:09.549> which

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
actually two very nice brushes which

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.020 
actually two very nice brushes which
I've<00:03:10.060> not<00:03:10.239> used<00:03:10.450> before<00:03:10.870> from<00:03:11.730> Jackson's<00:03:12.730> arts

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
I've not used before from Jackson's arts

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.860 
I've not used before from Jackson's arts
plants<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.810> one<00:03:14.320> was<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.769> sable<00:03:15.630> what's<00:03:16.630> called

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
plants and one was a sable what's called

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.800 
plants and one was a sable what's called
a<00:03:16.989> safer<00:03:17.440> one<00:03:17.709> strict<00:03:18.370> series<00:03:18.790> nine<00:03:19.269> one<00:03:19.540> six

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
a safer one strict series nine one six

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.930 
a safer one strict series nine one six
that<00:03:20.080> was<00:03:20.260> nice<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.220> Jackson's

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
that was nice and the Jackson's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.780 
that was nice and the Jackson's
I<00:03:22.060> thought<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.570> series<00:03:22.750> 702<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:24.040> back<00:03:24.340> seven

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
I thought the series 702 that back seven

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.789 
I thought the series 702 that back seven
it<00:03:24.910> was<00:03:25.209> particularly<00:03:25.780> useful<00:03:25.989> for<00:03:26.290> lifting

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
it was particularly useful for lifting

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.340 
it was particularly useful for lifting
off<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.160> color<00:03:27.720> at<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> end<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.930> started

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
off the color at the end if I started

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.440 
off the color at the end if I started
off<00:03:32.470> with<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.640> could<00:03:33.880> actually<00:03:34.060> use

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
off with that and I could actually use

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.940 
off with that and I could actually use
them<00:03:34.780> because<00:03:34.959> they're<00:03:35.140> flats<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.590> could<00:03:35.769> use

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
them because they're flats I could use

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.039 
them because they're flats I could use
some<00:03:36.190> flat<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.120> could<00:03:37.329> use<00:03:37.510> them<00:03:37.720> on<00:03:37.840> their

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
some flat and I could use them on their

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.380 
some flat and I could use them on their
side<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:38.829> I<00:03:38.890> could<00:03:39.070> get<00:03:39.190> some<00:03:39.459> nice<00:03:39.610> marks<00:03:40.150> with

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
side so I could get some nice marks with

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.620 
side so I could get some nice marks with
that<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:41.650> was<00:03:41.950> particularly<00:03:42.489> keen<00:03:42.940> on<00:03:42.970> the

actually<00:04:30.780> this<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.290> quite<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.560> handy<00:04:31.950> thing<00:04:31.980> I

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
actually this is quite a handy thing I

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.910 
actually this is quite a handy thing I
think<00:04:32.490> it's<00:04:32.810> 425<00:04:33.810> round<00:04:34.110> something<00:04:34.530> like<00:04:34.680> that

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
think it's 425 round something like that

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.320 
think it's 425 round something like that
and<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.430> don't<00:04:35.580> necessarily<00:04:35.760> have<00:04:36.300> to

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
and you don't necessarily have to

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.400 
and you don't necessarily have to
stretch<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.870> but<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:37.980> prefer<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.460> because<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:40.020> it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
stretch it but I prefer to because it it

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.260 
stretch it but I prefer to because it it
just<00:04:40.680> gives<00:04:41.010> me<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.190> lot<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.520> choice<00:04:41.700> if<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.090> want

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
just gives me a lot of choice if I want

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.290 
just gives me a lot of choice if I want
to<00:04:42.480> squash<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.960> loss<00:04:43.140> of<00:04:43.410> water<00:04:43.820> but<00:04:44.820> actually

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
to squash the loss of water but actually

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.870 
to squash the loss of water but actually
you<00:04:45.570> know<00:04:45.720> it's<00:04:46.170> very<00:04:46.440> good<00:04:46.620> paper<00:04:46.860> mallets<00:04:47.520> I

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
you know it's very good paper mallets I

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.520 
you know it's very good paper mallets I
think<00:04:48.240> it's<00:04:48.420> a<00:04:48.600> high<00:04:48.810> white<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.380> it's

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
think it's a high white and it's

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.470 
think it's a high white and it's
brilliant<00:04:49.980> I<00:04:50.400> mean<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.790> think<00:04:50.940> that's<00:04:51.180> what's

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
brilliant I mean I think that's what's

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.480 
brilliant I mean I think that's what's
helped<00:04:51.810> me<00:04:51.870> get<00:04:52.050> highlights<00:04:52.590> they<00:04:53.100> look<00:04:53.250> so

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
helped me get highlights they look so

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.370 
helped me get highlights they look so
nice<00:04:53.670> very<00:04:54.300> very<00:04:54.570> impressed<00:04:54.930> with<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.170> paper

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
nice very very impressed with the paper

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.600 
nice very very impressed with the paper
I<00:04:56.660> think<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.870> other<00:04:58.050> thing<00:04:58.320> that<00:04:58.620> we<00:04:59.490> were

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
I think the other thing that we were

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.390 
I think the other thing that we were
talking<00:04:59.790> about<00:05:00.060> was<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:01.260> inspiration<00:05:01.680> doing

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
talking about was the inspiration doing

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.910 
talking about was the inspiration doing
work<00:05:02.640> like<00:05:02.670> this<00:05:03.210> as<00:05:03.480> I<00:05:03.630> say<00:05:03.930> in<00:05:04.110> my<00:05:04.320> case<00:05:04.380> is

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
work like this as I say in my case is

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.040 
work like this as I say in my case is
because<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.340> spent<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.940> number<00:05:06.420> of<00:05:06.570> years<00:05:06.720> in

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
because I spent a number of years in

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.450 
because I spent a number of years in
Kenya<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.590> my<00:05:07.740> youth<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:09.440> from<00:05:10.440> that<00:05:10.740> I'd<00:05:11.190> be
