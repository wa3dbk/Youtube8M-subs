painting you will like erased it with

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.789 
painting you will like erased it with
white<00:01:57.179> because<00:01:58.179> you're<00:01:58.420> on<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.229> mass<00:01:59.469> that<00:01:59.500> is

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
white because you're on a mass that is

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.730 
white because you're on a mass that is
white<00:02:00.099> so<00:02:00.729> everything<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.479> do<00:02:01.689> on<00:02:01.929> white<00:02:02.380> you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
white so everything you do on white you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.350 
white so everything you do on white you
will<00:02:03.450> restore<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:06.060> everything<00:02:07.060> you're<00:02:07.209> doing

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
will restore and everything you're doing

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.520 
will restore and everything you're doing
black<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:08.470> will<00:02:08.679> erase<00:02:09.250> out<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.660> mask<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
black you will erase out of that mask so

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.819 
black you will erase out of that mask so
that's<00:02:11.769> why<00:02:12.040> when<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.430> paint<00:02:12.730> with<00:02:12.879> black<00:02:13.829> you

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
that's why when you paint with black you

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.410 
that's why when you paint with black you
are<00:02:14.860> showing<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.790> color<00:02:16.629> which<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:18.420> layer

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
are showing the color which is the layer

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.550 
are showing the color which is the layer
the<00:02:20.110> background<00:02:20.590> later<00:02:21.959> okay<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.230> to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the background later okay and just to

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.710 
the background later okay and just to
give<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.040> violence<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.970> picture<00:02:25.329> we<00:02:25.510> will

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
give the violence in the picture we will

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.030 
give the violence in the picture we will
like<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.379> paint<00:02:26.890> also<00:02:27.160> or<00:02:27.549> erase<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:29.859> can

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
like to paint also or erase so we can

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.809 
like to paint also or erase so we can
show<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:32.200> background<00:02:32.709> which<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.549> color

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
show the background which is the color

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.520 
show the background which is the color
image<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.640> eyes<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.510> way<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:37.930> can<00:02:38.109> have<00:02:38.140> a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
image the eyes so that way we can have a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.550 
image the eyes so that way we can have a
little<00:02:38.799> balance<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.880> picture<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:41.940> since<00:02:42.940> a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
little balance in the picture so since a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.410 
little balance in the picture so since a
face<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.889> all<00:02:45.280> about<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.700> lips<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.180> eyes

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
face is all about the lips and the eyes

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.650 
face is all about the lips and the eyes
eyes<00:02:46.840> are<00:02:47.170> very<00:02:47.349> important<00:02:47.739> we<00:02:48.280> would<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.609> to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
eyes are very important we would like to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.140 
eyes are very important we would like to
to<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:50.139> them<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.829> color<00:02:51.220> also<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:52.120> that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
to for them to be in color also so that

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.170 
to for them to be in color also so that
way<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.660> have<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.840> very<00:02:53.230> good<00:02:53.579> balance<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:54.760> then

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
way we have a very good balance and then

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.000 
way we have a very good balance and then
i<00:02:55.299> will<00:02:55.329> recommend<00:02:55.690> also<00:02:56.290> not<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.709> leave<00:02:56.889> it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
i will recommend also not to leave it

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.280 
i will recommend also not to leave it
just<00:02:57.519> as<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.849> is<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.299> black<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.599> white<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.049> you

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
just as it is in black and white so you

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.339 
just as it is in black and white so you
can<00:02:59.470> go<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.889> you<00:03:00.730> know<00:03:00.760> click<00:03:01.150> on<00:03:01.359> the

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
can go and you know click on the

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.650 
can go and you know click on the
black-and-white<00:03:02.950> layer<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.519> take<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
black-and-white layer and take the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.839 
black-and-white layer and take the
opacity<00:03:04.900> down<00:03:05.139> a<00:03:05.470> little<00:03:05.650> bit<00:03:05.829> so<00:03:06.549> that<00:03:06.579> will

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
opacity down a little bit so that will

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.530 
opacity down a little bit so that will
be<00:03:06.970> ninety<00:03:07.389> percent<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.980> some<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.579> you<00:03:09.970> some<00:03:10.419> of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
be ninety percent so some of you some of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.460 
be ninety percent so some of you some of
the<00:03:10.599> color<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:13.209> color<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.319> background

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
the color of the color of the background

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.099 
the color of the color of the background
layer<00:03:15.180> would<00:03:16.180> show<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:17.910> little<00:03:18.910> bit<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.389> also

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
layer would show a little bit and also

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.670 
layer would show a little bit and also
since<00:03:20.620> we're<00:03:20.950> working<00:03:21.340> with<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:21.760> new

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
since we're working with a new

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.780 
since we're working with a new
adjustment<00:03:24.680> layer<00:03:26.410> we<00:03:27.410> are<00:03:27.740> going<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.430> take

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
adjustment layer we are going to take

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.620 
adjustment layer we are going to take
the<00:03:29.120> levels<00:03:29.540> on<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.010> properties<00:03:31.010> properties

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
the levels on the properties properties

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.920 
the levels on the properties properties
properties<00:03:33.040> window<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.520> we<00:03:35.390> are<00:03:35.480> gonna<00:03:36.880> take

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
properties window and we are gonna take

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.400 
properties window and we are gonna take
the<00:03:38.930> handle<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:40.420> move<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.570> along<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.930> red

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
the handle and move it along the red

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.260 
the handle and move it along the red
channel<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.220> way<00:03:43.550> we<00:03:43.700> can<00:03:43.910> get<00:03:44.060> a

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
channel so that way we can get a

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.210 
channel so that way we can get a
different<00:03:45.190> black<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.400> white<00:03:46.460> effect<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:49.160> you

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
different black and white effect so you

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.490 
different black and white effect so you
know<00:03:49.430> play<00:03:49.730> with<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.090> adjustment<00:03:50.720> layers<00:03:50.900> so

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
know play with the adjustment layers so

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.680 
know play with the adjustment layers so
that<00:03:51.530> way<00:03:51.800> you<00:03:51.860> can<00:03:52.100> have<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.280> like<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.180> more<00:03:53.480> edgy

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
that way you can have a like a more edgy

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
that way you can have a like a more edgy
look<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.550> whatever<00:03:55.550> you<00:03:55.760> doing<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.870> sorry
