00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.089
 nice all guys i'm jp from 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.220
 welcome to this new video in which 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.160
 we will analyze the new screens 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.470
 new menu fifa 13 the last team 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.689
 the first screen we will see is that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 concerning casilias dani alves piquÃ¨ 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.599
 puyol and abidal and dani alves was 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.290
 lowered 84 more than was lowered 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.680
 86 boxers remained 86 while abidal is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.540
 been lowered from 81 80 I know, however, that I 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.239
 puzzled that only 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.890
 casillas between these five players both 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.680
 remained rare while the other four 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.780
 players are not rare sincerely 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.260
 this thing is not I can't understand it e 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:59.399
 it also seems quite strange to me 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:00.050
 we proceed in our analysis as 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.300
 you see 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.869
 it looks like a new screen in which we find 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.479
 a new team containing issued 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.750
 benzema wave blasi coschi busacca 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.850
 marchisio alaba a defender of whom not 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.260
 I know the name hammers another 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.330
 attraction of which I do not know the name e 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.550
 art plus the whole bench 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.310
 what leaves me even more perplexed in 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.860
 this screen is the fact that put or 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.360
 that is rare while the screens that 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.850
 we have seen in previous videos not 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.640
 it was rare while benzema for example is not 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.539
 rare and this is enough 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.759
 strange proceeding we can observe the 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.310
 new screenshots of fifa last 13 teams 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.810
 for computers then from the web app 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.210
 we also find what will be 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.300
 probably the screen on 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.289
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 then the menu 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.570
 main 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.850
 we go to analyze them together we find 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.610
 left single player 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.360
 thorne in single player on the right 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.330
 we find tournaments online then 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.149
 multiplayer while we find nano one 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.399
 fairly basic news or the 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.009
 seasons as king season in the head a 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.720
 head on fifa 12 which we now find also 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.030
 in the latest teams as you can see 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.890
 we divide five divisions 5 both 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.680
 in the seasons online and in singles 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.790
 player to the right instead we find plays 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.950
 with a team friend we find the usual ones 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.400
 new for example the theme of the week e 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.020
 at the top we have 999 thousand and 800 credits 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.730
 which seems to me quite absurd 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.500
 now I start to understand why a lot 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.959
 people really have too many credits 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.060
 as you can see these look a bit like 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.290
 challenges and new challenges to earn 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.940
 credits 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.250
 here is a new web page 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.050
 app where there is immediately in my opinion a 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.870
 rather gross error that it has 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.209
 he could save himself 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.220
 now as you can see there is an xland asian 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.280
 berlen several players at auction 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.849
 let's see better the price 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.750
 starting 60,000 credits for the current 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.010
 56,000 credits 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.550
 well it's a pretty gross mistake 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.010
 even if that 60 might seem like a 50 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.690
 thousand credits but honestly it seems to me 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.000
 plus a 60 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.910
 here is a new team shown 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.850
 always from the web app that shows in short 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.920
 carter the web app is here another 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.900
 contradiction we find put that not 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.790
 was the while in the previous image 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.660
 it was rare and this is enough 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.520
 strange 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.290
 then we find other players we find 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.900
 usual benzema which is not rare but 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.210
 we find large silver chambre lant 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.700
 while before it was gold so well a bit of 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.130
 contradictions, in short, we can here 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.080
 note that you can also use it 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.670
 the iphone 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.500
 well guys the video is over this 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.150
 small analysis ends here 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.610
 I remind you to leave a beautiful me 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.890
