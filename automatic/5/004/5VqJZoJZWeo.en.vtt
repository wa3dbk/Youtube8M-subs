00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
believe that Matisse it has on great

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.370 
believe that Matisse it has on great
defense<00:05:42.120> a<00:05:42.300> lot<00:05:42.690> of<00:05:42.719> people<00:05:42.840> don't<00:05:43.199> see<00:05:43.349> that

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
defense a lot of people don't see that

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.149 
defense a lot of people don't see that
but<00:05:43.710> um<00:05:43.919> but<00:05:44.630> Matisse's<00:05:45.630> sometimes<00:05:46.080> kind<00:05:47.039> of

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
but um but Matisse's sometimes kind of

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.459 
but um but Matisse's sometimes kind of
um<00:05:47.389> folks<00:05:48.389> around<00:05:48.599> with<00:05:48.779> that<00:05:48.900> shoulder<00:05:49.169> roll

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
um folks around with that shoulder roll

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.589 
um folks around with that shoulder roll
and<00:05:49.710> I<00:05:50.099> see<00:05:50.310> that<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.520> lot<00:05:50.610> in<00:05:50.759> the<00:05:50.909> ring<00:05:51.210> but<00:05:51.419> all

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
and I see that a lot in the ring but all

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.629 
and I see that a lot in the ring but all
but<00:05:52.349> other<00:05:52.560> than<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.680> overall<00:05:53.130> has<00:05:53.370> great

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
but other than that overall has great

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.390 
but other than that overall has great
defense<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.900> thing<00:05:55.289> about<00:05:55.409> Danny<00:05:55.919> is<00:05:56.219> that

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
defense the thing about Danny is that

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.339 
defense the thing about Danny is that
Danny's<00:05:56.819> defense<00:05:57.270> i'm<00:05:57.419> not<00:05:57.599> a<00:05:57.630> big<00:05:57.870> fan<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.110> it

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
Danny's defense i'm not a big fan of it

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.570 
Danny's defense i'm not a big fan of it
because<00:05:58.380> he<00:05:58.800> always<00:05:58.979> leaves<00:05:59.250> his<00:05:59.340> hand

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
because he always leaves his hand

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.519 
because he always leaves his hand
slightly<00:05:59.909> below<00:06:00.300> his<00:06:00.479> chin<00:06:00.509> and<00:06:00.960> he's<00:06:01.349> always

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529 
slightly below his chin and he's always

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.189 
slightly below his chin and he's always
throwing<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.069> line<00:06:02.340> loopy<00:06:02.819> punches<00:06:03.060> which<00:06:03.900> um

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
throwing the line loopy punches which um

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.620 
throwing the line loopy punches which um
which<00:06:05.190> which<00:06:05.580> allows<00:06:05.909> him<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.150> get<00:06:06.419> hit

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
which which allows him to get hit

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.300 
which which allows him to get hit
especially<00:06:06.840> by<00:06:07.259> a<00:06:07.289> guy<00:06:07.560> like<00:06:07.740> Luke<00:06:07.860> was<00:06:08.009> Matty

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
especially by a guy like Luke was Matty

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.890 
especially by a guy like Luke was Matty
see<00:06:08.460> that<00:06:08.610> loves<00:06:08.849> throwing<00:06:09.060> straight<00:06:09.449> punches

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
see that loves throwing straight punches

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.830 
see that loves throwing straight punches
now<00:06:10.680> like<00:06:10.889> I<00:06:10.919> said<00:06:11.039> I'm<00:06:11.940> Danny's<00:06:12.419> gonna<00:06:12.539> come

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
now like I said I'm Danny's gonna come

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.719 
now like I said I'm Danny's gonna come
out<00:06:12.960> boxing<00:06:13.409> fairly<00:06:13.889> well<00:06:14.069> the<00:06:14.310> first<00:06:14.550> three

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
out boxing fairly well the first three

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.089 
out boxing fairly well the first three
rounds<00:06:14.930> just<00:06:15.930> like<00:06:16.080> Peterson<00:06:16.409> did<00:06:16.710> but<00:06:16.919> then

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
rounds just like Peterson did but then

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.820 
rounds just like Peterson did but then
once<00:06:17.370> mateesah<00:06:17.909> closes<00:06:18.360> that<00:06:18.569> gap<00:06:18.810> it<00:06:19.349> stars

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
once mateesah closes that gap it stars

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.999 
once mateesah closes that gap it stars
land<00:06:20.099> on<00:06:20.340> land<00:06:20.909> letting<00:06:21.599> his<00:06:21.779> hands<00:06:22.080> go<00:06:22.380> and

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
land on land letting his hands go and

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.309 
land on land letting his hands go and
stars<00:06:23.279> landing<00:06:23.819> on<00:06:24.029> Danny<00:06:24.330> Garcia<00:06:24.840> I<00:06:25.020> think

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
stars landing on Danny Garcia I think

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.659 
stars landing on Danny Garcia I think
it's<00:06:25.440> only<00:06:25.650> going<00:06:25.770> to<00:06:25.830> be<00:06:25.889> a<00:06:26.009> matter<00:06:26.279> of<00:06:26.370> time

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
it's only going to be a matter of time

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.029 
it's only going to be a matter of time
before<00:06:26.789> arm<00:06:27.240> Lucas<00:06:28.199> mateesah<00:06:28.500> gets<00:06:28.800> rid<00:06:28.979> of

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
before arm Lucas mateesah gets rid of

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:46.559 
credit in a fight we go to the

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:48.469 
credit in a fight we go to the
scorecards<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:47.369> you're<00:06:47.729> right<00:06:47.969> that<00:06:48.270> fight

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
scorecards and you're right that fight

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.029 
scorecards and you're right that fight
could<00:06:48.689> go<00:06:48.869> either<00:06:49.080> way<00:06:49.199> in<00:06:49.529> the<00:06:49.649> sense<00:06:49.889> that

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
could go either way in the sense that

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.459 
could go either way in the sense that
Danny<00:06:50.369> it<00:06:50.550> does<00:06:50.789> have<00:06:51.029> that<00:06:51.689> good<00:06:51.899> power<00:06:52.139> and

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:52.469 
Danny it does have that good power and

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:54.109 
Danny it does have that good power and
good<00:06:52.619> timing<00:06:52.919> that<00:06:53.189> he<00:06:53.279> could<00:06:53.430> time<00:06:53.610> Lucas<00:06:53.939> and

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:54.119 
good timing that he could time Lucas and

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.029 
good timing that he could time Lucas and
possibly<00:06:54.419> knock<00:06:54.659> them<00:06:54.809> out<00:06:54.930> but<00:06:55.589> I<00:06:55.770> just<00:06:55.949> think

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
possibly knock them out but I just think

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:57.649 
possibly knock them out but I just think
that<00:06:56.189> Lucas<00:06:56.520> is<00:06:56.550> going<00:06:56.759> to<00:06:56.849> get<00:06:56.939> same<00:06:57.180> person

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:57.659 
that Lucas is going to get same person

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:00.409 
that Lucas is going to get same person
