red eye meat has finally slowed down the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.660 
red eye meat has finally slowed down the
Furman<00:00:27.689> teen<00:00:27.840> area<00:00:28.010> how<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.310> tell<00:00:29.490> is

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
Furman teen area how you can tell is

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.540 
Furman teen area how you can tell is
there's<00:00:29.849> an<00:00:30.000> alibi<00:00:30.390> ball<00:00:30.539> every<00:00:30.810> loved<00:00:31.800> one

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
there's an alibi ball every loved one

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.060 
there's an alibi ball every loved one
bottle<00:00:32.820> per<00:00:32.850> 30<00:00:33.270> seconds<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.989> he's<00:00:34.620> doing<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
bottle per 30 seconds and he's doing a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.680 
bottle per 30 seconds and he's doing a
lot<00:00:35.219> lower<00:00:35.399> than<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> yeast<00:00:36.360> is

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
lot lower than that so the yeast is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
lot lower than that so the yeast is
basically<00:00:37.590> done<00:00:37.860> fermenting<00:00:38.160> which<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.820> nice

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
basically done fermenting which is nice

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.299 
basically done fermenting which is nice
so<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.110> move<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> racking<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
so now we can move on to racking it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.650 
so now we can move on to racking it
which<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.610> putting<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:41.969> from<00:00:42.180> its<00:00:42.329> old<00:00:42.480> home

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
number one we have an auto siphon it's a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.830 
number one we have an auto siphon it's a
really<00:01:32.310> cool<00:01:32.490> device<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.509> keeps<00:01:33.689> things

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
really cool device and it keeps things

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
really cool device and it keeps things
nice<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.170> sanitary<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.490> have

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
nice and sanitary as you can see we have

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.969 
nice and sanitary as you can see we have
a<00:01:35.610> skirt<00:01:35.909> skirt<00:01:36.689> still<00:01:36.900> cuter<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> an<00:01:37.590> open

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
a skirt skirt still cuter and an open

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.710 
a skirt skirt still cuter and an open
tube<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:38.610> another<00:01:39.240> tube<00:01:39.540> right<00:01:39.689> here

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
tube and then another tube right here

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
tube and then another tube right here
and<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.170> does<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:42.030> fits<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.390> here

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
and what this does is it fits in here

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.760 
and what this does is it fits in here
and<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.829> creates<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> seal<00:01:44.520> around<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and it creates a seal around the the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.859 
and it creates a seal around the the
outer<00:01:47.070> tube<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.270> pull<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
outer tube so when you pull it up and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.179 
outer tube so when you pull it up and
brings<00:01:49.110> liquid<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.740> when<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> push<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
brings liquid up and when you push it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.219 
brings liquid up and when you push it
down<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.729> sends<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> liquid<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.960> through<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
down it sends the liquid up through the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
down it sends the liquid up through the
top<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.619> tube<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.159> down<00:01:54.000> into<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.479> new

home<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.560> great<00:01:55.950> thing<00:01:56.219> about<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.520> auto

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
home the great thing about an auto

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
home the great thing about an auto
siphon<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> keeps<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.869> keeps<00:01:58.049> everything

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
siphon is that keeps it keeps everything

siphon is that keeps it keeps everything
sanitary<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.399> it's<00:02:00.270> much<00:02:00.570> better<00:02:00.780> than<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
sanitary and it's much better than the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.050 
sanitary and it's much better than the
traditional<00:02:01.890> method<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.490> siphoning<00:02:02.909> which

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
traditional method of siphoning which

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.429 
traditional method of siphoning which
was<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.390> put<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> tube<00:02:03.869> into<00:02:04.049> your<00:02:04.170> Mead

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
was do you put the tube into your Mead

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.800 
was do you put the tube into your Mead
and<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.460> suck<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> tube<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.630> bring

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and then you suck on the tube to bring

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.760 
and then you suck on the tube to bring
the<00:02:06.930> media<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> its<00:02:07.380> new<00:02:07.500> home

can check it out and also you will need
a<00:03:12.590> new<00:03:12.890> home<00:03:13.570> glass<00:03:14.570> jugs<00:03:14.959> are<00:03:15.400> preferable<00:03:16.400> to

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
a new home glass jugs are preferable to

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.860 
a new home glass jugs are preferable to
everything<00:03:16.940> else<00:03:17.120> because<00:03:17.359> it's<00:03:17.570> gonna<00:03:17.690> have

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
everything else because it's gonna have

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.250 
everything else because it's gonna have

on a pretty decent alcohol content and

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.380 
on a pretty decent alcohol content and
you<00:03:21.380> don't<00:03:21.560> want<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:21.829> in<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.040> plastic<00:03:22.459> jug<00:03:22.760> so

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
you don't want that in a plastic jug so

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.750 
you don't want that in a plastic jug so
we're<00:03:24.019> using<00:03:24.170> glass<00:03:24.530> here<00:03:24.799> as<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.400> can<00:03:25.549> see<00:03:25.730> I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
we're using glass here as you can see I

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.750 
we're using glass here as you can see I
am<00:03:26.060> lens<00:03:26.269> here<00:03:26.720> air<00:03:27.260> out<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.650> I've<00:03:27.950> got<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.549> side

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
am lens here air out and I've got a side

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.680 
am lens here air out and I've got a side
and<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:28.970> shook<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:30.380> auto<00:03:31.310> siphon<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.420> I'm

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
and I shook the auto siphon and I'm

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.840 
and I shook the auto siphon and I'm
about<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:32.989> go<00:03:33.109> do<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:34.010> same<00:03:34.220> thing<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.730> this

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
about to go do the same thing to this

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.390 
about to go do the same thing to this
tube<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.359> that<00:03:35.630> there's<00:03:35.810> no<00:03:35.930> stars'<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.130> foam

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
tube so that there's no stars' and foam

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.979 
tube so that there's no stars' and foam
in<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.269> it's<00:03:38.420> nice<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.600> clean

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
in this and in that it's nice and clean

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.759 
in this and in that it's nice and clean
I<00:03:39.230> should<00:03:39.799> also<00:03:39.920> show<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.310> dracs<00:03:40.760> brew<00:03:41.090> and

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
I should also show you dracs brew and

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.620 
I should also show you dracs brew and
the<00:03:42.769> reason<00:03:43.100> we<00:03:43.250> are<00:03:43.299> siphoning<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:44.480> is

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
the reason we are siphoning this is

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.150 
the reason we are siphoning this is
because<00:03:44.840> as<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.500> can<00:03:45.620> see<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.889> the<00:03:45.980> top

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
because as you can see on the top

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.979 
because as you can see on the top
there's<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.549> lot<00:03:46.700> of<00:03:46.819> gunk<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.329> can<00:03:47.720> see<00:03:47.870> the

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
there's a lot of gunk you can see the

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.330 
there's a lot of gunk you can see the
raisins<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.500> can<00:03:48.650> see<00:03:48.739> some<00:03:48.920> of<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.069> seeds

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
raisins you can see some of the seeds

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.559 
raisins you can see some of the seeds
from<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.730> strawberries<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.329> raspberries

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
from the strawberries and raspberries

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.920 
from the strawberries and raspberries
but<00:03:51.290> at<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.530> bottom<00:03:52.299> we<00:03:53.299> have<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.750> white

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
but at the bottom we have that white

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.430 
but at the bottom we have that white
stuff<00:03:54.319> which<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.799> dead<00:03:55.250> yeast<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:55.880> other

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
stuff which is dead yeast and other

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.990 
stuff which is dead yeast and other
seeds<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.590> have<00:03:57.680> floated<00:03:58.100> down<00:03:58.280> there<00:03:58.519> and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
seeds that have floated down there and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.699 
seeds that have floated down there and
what<00:03:59.239> this<00:03:59.359> siphoning<00:03:59.780> does<00:04:00.049> is<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:00.530> just

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
what this siphoning does is it just

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.680 
what this siphoning does is it just
basically<00:04:01.280> makes<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.030> none<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.510> this

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
basically makes it so that none of this

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.960 
basically makes it so that none of this
stuff<00:04:02.930> is<00:04:03.049> in<00:04:03.230> here<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.950> we<00:04:04.069> just<00:04:04.100> get<00:04:04.459> nice

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
stuff is in here and we just get nice

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.740 
stuff is in here and we just get nice
clean<00:04:05.630> Mead<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:07.160> how<00:04:07.340> does<00:04:07.400> racking<00:04:08.000> actually

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
clean Mead so how does racking actually

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.990 
clean Mead so how does racking actually
work<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.019> might<00:04:09.290> be<00:04:09.470> asking<00:04:09.799> well<00:04:10.130> in<00:04:10.850> order

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
work you might be asking well in order

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.819 
work you might be asking well in order
to<00:04:11.120> explain<00:04:11.420> that<00:04:11.630> we<00:04:11.750> have<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.989> go<00:04:12.079> into<00:04:12.350> the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
to explain that we have to go into the

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.720 
to explain that we have to go into the
realm<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.670> science

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
realm of science

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.180 
realm of science
this<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.180> where<00:04:16.300> physics<00:04:16.690> kicks<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:17.770> we

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
this is where physics kicks in so we

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.360 
this is where physics kicks in so we
have<00:04:18.370> our<00:04:18.450> meetup<00:04:19.450> here<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:20.010> our<00:04:21.010> new<00:04:21.160> home

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
have our meetup here and our new home

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.450 
have our meetup here and our new home
right<00:04:21.850> here<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:22.930> important<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.980> new

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
right here this is important the new

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.450 
right here this is important the new
home<00:04:24.700> has<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.270> be<00:04:25.450> under<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.110> bottom<00:04:26.500> of<00:04:26.680> the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
home has to be under the bottom of the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.750 
home has to be under the bottom of the
castor<00:04:28.450> with<00:04:28.600> where<00:04:28.870> your<00:04:28.990> meat<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:30.010> when

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
castor with where your meat is so when

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.820 
castor with where your meat is so when
you<00:04:30.880> put<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.360> siphon<00:04:31.720> here<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.230> set<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.560> up<00:04:32.650> it

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
you put the siphon here you set it up it

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.220 
you put the siphon here you set it up it
goes<00:04:32.920> under<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.730> top<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.000> siphon<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:35.110> it

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
goes under the top of the siphon and it

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.110 
goes under the top of the siphon and it
comes<00:04:35.470> down<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.160> goes<00:04:36.310> into<00:04:36.490> your<00:04:36.580> meat<00:04:36.880> and

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
comes down and goes into your meat and

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.590 
comes down and goes into your meat and
what<00:04:37.270> happens<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:37.840> if<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.800> have<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:39.010> good<00:04:39.600> flow

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
what happens is if you have a good flow

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.200 
what happens is if you have a good flow
of<00:04:40.740> liquid<00:04:41.740> or<00:04:41.980> whatever<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.760> put<00:04:42.970> into<00:04:43.090> your

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
of liquid or whatever you put into your

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.450 
of liquid or whatever you put into your
site<00:04:43.480> then<00:04:43.660> that's<00:04:44.350> going<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.680> cause<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:45.310> rest

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
site then that's going to cause the rest

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.430 
site then that's going to cause the rest
of<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.670> limit<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:46.000> travel<00:04:46.420> up<00:04:46.510> with<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.960> there

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
of the limit to travel up with it there

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.950 
of the limit to travel up with it there
a<00:04:47.470> kind<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.430> suction<00:04:48.820> vacuum<00:04:49.030> into<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.840> new

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
a kind of a suction vacuum into the new

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.690 
a kind of a suction vacuum into the new

meter<00:04:54.940> right<00:04:55.090> now<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.510> might<00:04:55.660> be<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.870> little<00:04:56.230> bit

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
meter right now it might be a little bit

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.730 
meter right now it might be a little bit
awkward<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:57.340> watch<00:04:57.790> because<00:04:58.380> I'm<00:04:59.380> doing<00:04:59.650> this

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
awkward to watch because I'm doing this

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.550 
awkward to watch because I'm doing this
by<00:04:59.920> myself<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.580> this<00:05:00.900> tubing<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:02.140> kind<00:05:02.440> of

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
by myself and this tubing is kind of

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.930 
by myself and this tubing is kind of
still<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.100> circular<00:05:05.520> arrangement<00:05:06.520> which

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
still the circular arrangement which

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.960 
still the circular arrangement which
makes<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.330> kind<00:05:07.510> of<00:05:08.640> hard<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.790> handle

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
makes it kind of hard to handle

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.230 
makes it kind of hard to handle
sometimes<00:05:10.540> let<00:05:10.870> me<00:05:10.960> give<00:05:11.110> these<00:05:12.060> last<00:05:13.060> few

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
sometimes let me give these last few

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.500 
sometimes let me give these last few
shakes<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:15.250> we're<00:05:15.730> gonna<00:05:15.820> come<00:05:16.090> over<00:05:16.270> here

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
shakes and we're gonna come over here

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.370 
shakes and we're gonna come over here
and<00:05:16.720> connect<00:05:17.670> one<00:05:18.670> end<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.390> other<00:05:19.510> seven

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.800

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
yeah we go we're gonna find the easiest

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.470 
yeah we go we're gonna find the easiest
rasam<00:05:26.320> for<00:05:27.100> this<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:27.400> travel<00:05:27.910> which<00:05:28.090> seems<00:05:28.420> to

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
rasam for this to travel which seems to

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.770 
rasam for this to travel which seems to
be<00:05:28.600> going<00:05:29.350> around<00:05:29.910> and<00:05:30.910> we're<00:05:31.480> gonna<00:05:31.630> lift

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
be going around and we're gonna lift

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.520 
be going around and we're gonna lift
this<00:05:31.900> up<00:05:32.050> halfway<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.710> gently<00:05:33.430> stick<00:05:33.640> it<00:05:33.760> in

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
this up halfway and gently stick it in

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.000 
this up halfway and gently stick it in
to<00:05:36.030> route<00:05:37.030> now<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.050> might<00:05:38.230> have<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.410> cap<00:05:38.710> on<00:05:38.890> the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
to route now I might have a cap on the

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.980 
to route now I might have a cap on the
bottom<00:05:39.280> of<00:05:39.340> it<00:05:39.430> which<00:05:39.550> is<00:05:39.700> nice<00:05:39.910> because<00:05:40.180> that

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
bottom of it which is nice because that

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.870 
bottom of it which is nice because that
prevents<00:05:41.380> any<00:05:41.590> of<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.890> other<00:05:42.130> yeast<00:05:42.490> getting

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
prevents any of the other yeast getting

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.620 
prevents any of the other yeast getting
into<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:44.400> siphon<00:05:45.400> so<00:05:45.670> and<00:05:46.150> what<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:46.420> to

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
into the siphon so and what this to

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.480 
into the siphon so and what this to
aerate<00:05:46.840> it<00:05:47.020> as<00:05:47.110> little<00:05:47.290> as<00:05:47.350> possible<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:48.400> I'm

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
aerate it as little as possible so I'm

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.900 
aerate it as little as possible so I'm
going<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.670> put<00:05:48.850> this<00:05:48.970> up<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:50.760> drop<00:05:51.760> it<00:05:51.880> down

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
going to put this up and drop it down

00:05:51.910 --> 00:06:01.260 
going to put this up and drop it down
once<00:05:52.560> pick<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.680> up<00:05:53.800> again<00:05:59.850> love<00:06:00.850> to<00:06:00.940> do<00:06:01.060> it<00:06:01.150> one

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
once pick it up again love to do it one

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.380 
once pick it up again love to do it one
more<00:06:01.360> time<00:06:02.910> there<00:06:03.910> we<00:06:03.940> go

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
more time there we go

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.280 
more time there we go
as<00:06:05.320> you<00:06:05.440> can<00:06:05.560> see<00:06:05.710> that<00:06:05.890> beautiful<00:06:06.130> red<00:06:06.670> liquid

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
as you can see that beautiful red liquid

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.020 
as you can see that beautiful red liquid
is<00:06:08.290> going<00:06:08.620> down<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:08.980> tube<00:06:09.160> just<00:06:09.370> by<00:06:09.730> itself

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
is going down the tube just by itself

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.270 
is going down the tube just by itself
and<00:06:11.020> then<00:06:11.110> pulling<00:06:11.380> it<00:06:11.530> down<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:11.920> other<00:06:12.010> end

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
and then pulling it down the other end

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.830 
and then pulling it down the other end
so<00:06:12.520> that<00:06:12.550> we<00:06:12.790> don't<00:06:12.940> get<00:06:13.060> too<00:06:13.240> much<00:06:13.360> aeration

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
so that we don't get too much aeration

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.770 
so that we don't get too much aeration
and<00:06:14.530> you<00:06:14.680> can<00:06:14.830> see<00:06:15.070> it<00:06:15.190> slowly<00:06:15.790> going<00:06:16.510> down

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
and you can see it slowly going down

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.190 
and you can see it slowly going down
into<00:06:17.020> it<00:06:17.290> there<00:06:17.620> we<00:06:17.710> go<00:06:17.860> go<00:06:18.460> that<00:06:18.670> hand<00:06:19.200> and

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
into it there we go go that hand and

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:36.640 
into it there we go go that hand and
also<00:06:20.470> you<00:06:21.430> can<00:06:21.640> tilt<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.970> jug<00:06:25.300> if<00:06:25.540> need<00:06:25.750> be

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.110 

one<00:06:37.650> thing<00:06:37.860> that<00:06:38.010> is<00:06:38.160> kind<00:06:38.340> of<00:06:38.460> important<00:06:38.940> is

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
one thing that is kind of important is

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.000 
one thing that is kind of important is
you<00:06:39.270> don't<00:06:39.510> want<00:06:39.630> to<00:06:39.690> take<00:06:39.840> all<00:06:40.200> of<00:06:40.230> the<00:06:40.710> liquid

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
you don't want to take all of the liquid

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.770 
you don't want to take all of the liquid
out<00:06:41.100> because<00:06:41.400> there's<00:06:41.640> a<00:06:41.700> lot<00:06:41.790> of<00:06:42.270> gunk<00:06:42.510> down

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
out because there's a lot of gunk down

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.480 
out because there's a lot of gunk down
there<00:06:42.990> and<00:06:43.530> we<00:06:43.650> don't<00:06:43.770> want<00:06:43.950> to<00:06:43.980> get<00:06:44.130> any<00:06:44.340> of

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
there and we don't want to get any of

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.200 
there and we don't want to get any of
that<00:06:44.520> gunk<00:06:44.940> in<00:06:45.180> our<00:06:45.720> rats<00:06:46.590> but<00:06:47.340> I<00:06:47.640> did<00:06:48.030> get<00:06:48.150> a

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
that gunk in our rats but I did get a

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.490 
that gunk in our rats but I did get a
little<00:06:48.300> bit<00:06:48.450> and<00:06:48.840> that's<00:06:49.500> not<00:06:49.680> bad<00:06:51.050> it's<00:06:52.050> you

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
little bit and that's not bad it's you

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.020 
little bit and that's not bad it's you
know<00:06:52.620> it's<00:06:53.100> not<00:06:53.250> the<00:06:53.430> worst<00:06:53.640> thing<00:06:53.730> that<00:06:53.850> could

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
know it's not the worst thing that could

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.350 
know it's not the worst thing that could
ever<00:06:54.090> happen<00:06:54.240> so<00:06:55.200> that's<00:06:55.680> why<00:06:55.950> every<00:06:56.700> so<00:06:57.150> often

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
ever happen so that's why every so often

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.560 
ever happen so that's why every so often
you<00:06:57.900> rack<00:06:58.170> it<00:06:58.410> but<00:06:59.370> this<00:06:59.730> is<00:06:59.940> the<00:06:59.970> end<00:07:00.150> product

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
you rack it but this is the end product

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.270 
you rack it but this is the end product
of<00:07:00.800> the<00:07:01.800> old<00:07:02.070> home<00:07:02.420> and<00:07:03.420> if<00:07:03.780> I<00:07:03.900> can<00:07:04.160> pick<00:07:05.160> this

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
of the old home and if I can pick this

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.930 
of the old home and if I can pick this
up<00:07:05.430> slowly<00:07:08.270> look<00:07:09.270> at<00:07:09.540> that<00:07:09.720> beautiful<00:07:10.020> red<00:07:10.940> now

up slowly look at that beautiful red now

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.930 
up slowly look at that beautiful red now
it<00:07:12.240> might<00:07:12.390> not<00:07:12.570> be<00:07:14.360> perfectly<00:07:15.360> close<00:07:16.350> to<00:07:16.940> dracs

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
it might not be perfectly close to dracs

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.580 
it might not be perfectly close to dracs
finger<00:07:18.330> head<00:07:18.480> but<00:07:18.660> I<00:07:18.750> think<00:07:18.780> I<00:07:19.080> did<00:07:19.230> a<00:07:19.260> pretty

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.590

finger head but I think I did a pretty
damn<00:07:20.520> good<00:07:20.760> job<00:07:20.820> and<00:07:21.210> there's<00:07:21.330> a<00:07:21.390> little<00:07:21.660> bit

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
damn good job and there's a little bit

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.080
