going<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.700> come<00:02:04.790> back<00:02:08.770> add<00:02:09.770> some<00:02:09.950> other

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
going to come back add some other

going to come back add some other
drivers<00:02:10.520> here<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.780> flow<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.440> use<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.130> one

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
drivers here the flow I use that one

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.670 
drivers here the flow I use that one
it's<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> little<00:02:13.910> bit<00:02:14.030> shorter<00:02:14.240> than<00:02:14.690> enforcer

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
it's a little bit shorter than enforcer

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.390 
it's a little bit shorter than enforcer
but<00:02:16.490> gives<00:02:16.610> me<00:02:16.730> more<00:02:16.880> glide<00:02:17.210> that's<00:02:17.780> me<00:02:17.960> longer

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
but gives me more glide that's me longer

the<00:02:19.400> boatman<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.150> one's<00:02:20.330> actually<00:02:20.450> little

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
the boatman this one's actually little

the boatman this one's actually little
bit<00:02:20.840> beat<00:02:20.990> in<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.470> i<00:02:21.500> use<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.100> i<00:02:22.400> can<00:02:22.580> turn<00:02:22.730> it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
bit beat in so i use it i can turn it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.910 
bit beat in so i use it i can turn it
over<00:02:23.000> i<00:02:23.120> can<00:02:23.330> throw<00:02:23.450> an<00:02:23.540> analyzer<00:02:23.840> or<00:02:24.770> go

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
over i can throw an analyzer or go

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.860 
over i can throw an analyzer or go
straight<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.550> or<00:02:25.910> throw<00:02:26.180> Heiser<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:26.720> a

is<00:02:40.940> what<00:02:41.060> I'm<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.300> use<00:02:41.480> for<00:02:41.720> my<00:02:41.900> high

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
is what I'm going to use for my high

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.020 
is what I'm going to use for my high
speed<00:02:43.360> distance<00:02:44.360> driver<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.490> world<00:02:46.670> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
other high speed distance driver this is

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.680 
other high speed distance driver this is
to<00:02:48.710> be<00:02:48.830> more<00:02:48.980> stable<00:02:49.220> than<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.490> king<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.940> i

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
to be more stable than the king and i

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.020 
to be more stable than the king and i
use<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:51.160> pretty<00:02:52.160> much<00:02:52.280> my<00:02:52.520> biggest<00:02:52.850> drive

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
use it for pretty much my biggest drive

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.850 
use it for pretty much my biggest drive
so<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.300> when<00:02:53.510> i<00:02:53.540> need<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.960> get<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> max

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
so that when i need to get the max

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.050 
so that when i need to get the max
distance<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.430> throw<00:02:55.550> it<00:02:55.640> as<00:02:55.730> hard<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.000> can

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
distance and throw it as hard as I can

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.300 
distance and throw it as hard as I can
pretty<00:02:56.510> much<00:02:56.600> grab<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.990> world<00:02:59.770> for<00:03:00.770> putters

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
pretty much grab the world for putters
