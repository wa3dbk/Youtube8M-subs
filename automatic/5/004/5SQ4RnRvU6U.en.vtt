back on my parents HiFi Zenith system
that<00:00:27.210> they<00:00:27.330> had<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:28.260> well<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:28.859> been

that they had as well as I've been
converting<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> lot<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:29.910> grandmother's<00:00:30.599> old

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

jazz records from from 78 vinyl on to

jazz records from from 78 vinyl on to
digital<00:00:35.730> format<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.330> I<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.989> really<00:00:37.170> excited

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
digital format so I was really excited

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.799 
digital format so I was really excited
to<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:37.949> little<00:00:38.100> unit<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.120> was

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to see this little unit here and was

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
to see this little unit here and was
very<00:00:39.930> hopeful<00:00:40.379> Crosley<00:00:40.949> isn't<00:00:41.160> necessarily

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
very hopeful Crosley isn't necessarily

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.329 
very hopeful Crosley isn't necessarily
known<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.120> advanced<00:00:42.750> audio<00:00:43.559> equipment<00:00:44.159> but

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
known for advanced audio equipment but

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.619 
known for advanced audio equipment but
they<00:00:44.549> have<00:00:44.670> been<00:00:44.820> putting<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.449> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
they have been putting out a lot of it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
they have been putting out a lot of it
so<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.930> hopeful<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.589> in<00:00:47.159> the<00:00:47.220> model

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
so I was hopeful that the a in the model

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.689 
so I was hopeful that the a in the model
number<00:00:48.119> which<00:00:48.360> means<00:00:48.750> advanced<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:50.430> actually

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
number which means advanced was actually

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:51.859 
number which means advanced was actually
going<00:00:50.790> to<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.030> bringing<00:00:51.180> some<00:00:51.540> really<00:00:51.750> high

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:51.869 
going to be bringing some really high

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:53.630 
going to be bringing some really high
quality<00:00:51.930> audio<00:00:52.470> and<00:00:52.650> we'll<00:00:53.220> get<00:00:53.339> to<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
quality audio and we'll get to that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.030 
quality audio and we'll get to that
whether<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> paid<00:00:54.570> off<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.049> minute<00:00:55.350> this

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
whether that paid off in a minute this

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.280 
whether that paid off in a minute this
particular<00:00:56.280> unit<00:00:56.549> you<00:00:56.790> can<00:00:56.940> find<00:00:57.210> online<00:00:57.540> for

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
particular unit you can find online for

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.950 
particular unit you can find online for
about<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.739> hundred<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.220> fifty<00:00:59.519> dollars<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
about a hundred and fifty dollars it's a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.869 
about a hundred and fifty dollars it's a
little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.439> pricey<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.189> range<00:01:02.430> compared

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
little bit pricey in that range compared

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
little bit pricey in that range compared
to<00:01:02.939> other<00:01:03.210> comparable<00:01:03.750> units<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> may

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
to other comparable units that you may

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.109 
to other comparable units that you may
find<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.159> does<00:01:05.400> come<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:05.880> pretty<00:01:06.030> good

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
find it does come with some pretty good

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.940 
find it does come with some pretty good
features<00:01:06.570> though<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.439> look<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
features though if you just look out of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520 
features though if you just look out of
the<00:01:08.010> box<00:01:08.270> for<00:01:09.270> example<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> does<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the box for example it does have a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.980 
the box for example it does have a
counterweight<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.299> back<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.750> help<00:01:12.900> with

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
counterweight in the back to help with

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.160 
counterweight in the back to help with
turntable<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> has<00:01:14.009> some<00:01:14.340> anti<00:01:15.119> anti<00:01:15.630> skating

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
turntable it has some anti anti skating

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
turntable it has some anti anti skating
mechanisms<00:01:17.159> which<00:01:17.369> help<00:01:17.609> for<00:01:17.850> skipping<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
mechanisms which help for skipping and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.370 
mechanisms which help for skipping and
things<00:01:18.539> like<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.750> when<00:01:19.109> you're<00:01:19.229> playing

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
things like that when you're playing

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.279 
things like that when you're playing
your<00:01:19.590> records<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:21.030> also<00:01:21.210> has<00:01:21.539> a<00:01:21.570> strobe<00:01:22.259> light

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
your records it also has a strobe light

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.950 
your records it also has a strobe light
on<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:23.729> actually<00:01:24.359> you<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.659> really

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
on it which actually you can really

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.029 
on it which actually you can really
fine-tune<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.039> speed<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:27.829> record<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:28.950> it

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
fine-tune the speed of your record as it

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.889 
fine-tune the speed of your record as it
spins<00:01:29.189> around<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.909> fact<00:01:30.149> this<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.749> is

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
spins around in fact this one is

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.480 
spins around in fact this one is
compatible<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.499> both<00:01:31.619> European<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.340> North

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
compatible with both European and North

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.880 
compatible with both European and North
American<00:01:32.640> standards<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.479> speed<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.530> was

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
American standards for speed so that was

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.700 
American standards for speed so that was
really<00:01:35.130> nice<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.140> dial<00:01:37.469> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
really nice to see so you can dial that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.270 
really nice to see so you can dial that
in<00:01:37.859> right<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.999> auto<00:01:39.569> adjustment

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
in right here on the auto adjustment

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.349 
in right here on the auto adjustment
mechanism<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.700> watch<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.090> strobe

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
mechanism here and watch the strobe

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.510 
mechanism here and watch the strobe
light<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.810> dial<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.499> the<00:01:44.130> speed<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.490> your

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
light and dial in the the speed of your

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
light and dial in the the speed of your
record<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:44.999> all<00:01:45.179> that's<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.689> nice<00:01:45.899> however

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
record so all that's really nice however

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.719 
record so all that's really nice however
there<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:47.039> some<00:01:47.249> problems<00:01:47.429> with<00:01:47.609> this

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
there are some problems with this

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.389 
there are some problems with this
particular<00:01:47.999> unit<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.689> first<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
particular unit so first of all the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.590 
particular unit so first of all the
audio<00:01:51.030> quality<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:52.049> has<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.920> phono<00:01:53.490> input<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
audio quality this has a phono input it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.300 
audio quality this has a phono input it
also<00:01:54.719> has<00:01:54.899> connections<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.439> auxiliary<00:01:55.859> input

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
also has connections for auxiliary input

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.830 
also has connections for auxiliary input
but<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.789> think<00:01:56.999> how<00:01:57.090> most<00:01:57.329> people<00:01:57.389> are<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.749> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
but I think how most people are going to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.050 
but I think how most people are going to
be<00:01:57.929> using<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.319> is<00:01:58.499> with<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.829> USB<00:01:59.219> connection

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
be using this is with the USB connection

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.989 
be using this is with the USB connection
and<00:02:00.179> when<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.079> connect<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.409> USB<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:02.429> is<00:02:02.729> no

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
and when you connect the USB there is no

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.020 
and when you connect the USB there is no
way<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.719> found<00:02:04.109> any<00:02:04.289> way<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:05.130> adjust<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
way that I found any way to adjust the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550 
way that I found any way to adjust the
levels<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.569> what's<00:02:06.749> coming<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.139> across<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
levels of what's coming in across that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.070 
levels of what's coming in across that
USB<00:02:07.889> I<00:02:08.340> tried<00:02:08.610> changing<00:02:09.240> all<00:02:09.569> sorts<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.929> levels

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
USB I tried changing all sorts of levels

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.820 
USB I tried changing all sorts of levels
in<00:02:10.500> Windows<00:02:11.209> 7<00:02:12.209> audio<00:02:13.020> mixer<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.410> tried

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
in Windows 7 audio mixer I tried

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
in Windows 7 audio mixer I tried
changing<00:02:14.040> levels<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.700> audacity<00:02:15.000> which<00:02:15.480> ships

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
changing levels in audacity which ships

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.930 
changing levels in audacity which ships
with<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.200> particular<00:02:16.500> unit<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.760> just

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
with this particular unit and I just

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.490 
with this particular unit and I just
could<00:02:18.090> not<00:02:18.180> find<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> way<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.900> was<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.380> was

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
could not find a way it was it was

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.100 
could not find a way it was it was
highly<00:02:19.830> distorted<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:21.240> there<00:02:21.690> was<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.990> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
highly distorted and there was just a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.270 
highly distorted and there was just a
lot<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.440> noise<00:02:22.800> come

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
lot of noise come

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.790 
lot of noise come
across<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> USB<00:02:24.060> connection<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:25.709> a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
across the USB connection so so that's a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.480 
across the USB connection so so that's a
big<00:02:25.920> problem

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
big problem

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.120 
big problem
the<00:02:26.850> second<00:02:27.180> problem<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.140> strobe<00:02:28.920> lights

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
the second problem is the strobe lights

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.710 
the second problem is the strobe lights
a<00:02:29.250> great<00:02:29.430> addition<00:02:29.880> but<00:02:30.180> they<00:02:30.390> didn't<00:02:30.630> really

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
a great addition but they didn't really

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.210 
a great addition but they didn't really
fine-tune<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.350> enough<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.800> when<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.100> get

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
fine-tune it enough so that when you get

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.890 
fine-tune it enough so that when you get
into<00:02:32.459> those<00:02:32.580> high<00:02:32.790> speeds<00:02:33.150> it's<00:02:33.720> almost

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
into those high speeds it's almost

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.270 
into those high speeds it's almost
impossible<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.680> tell<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:34.950> you're<00:02:35.069> at<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
impossible to tell if you're at the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.830 
impossible to tell if you're at the
right<00:02:35.400> speed<00:02:35.730> or<00:02:35.850> not<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.180> don't<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.480> see

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
right speed or not you don't really see

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.380 
right speed or not you don't really see
the<00:02:37.020> difference<00:02:37.440> between<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.430> European<00:02:38.940> 78

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the difference between the European 78

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.910 
the difference between the European 78
standard<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> North<00:02:40.110> American<00:02:40.530> 78

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
standard in the North American 78

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.800 
standard in the North American 78
standard<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.459> could<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.060> way<00:02:42.270> off<00:02:42.510> in

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
standard so you could be way off in

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.840 
standard so you could be way off in
terms<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.290> what<00:02:43.830> speed<00:02:44.100> your<00:02:44.280> records<00:02:44.580> playing

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
terms of what speed your records playing

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.400 
terms of what speed your records playing
at<00:02:45.060> not<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> huge<00:02:45.630> problem<00:02:45.870> because<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.260> can

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
at not a huge problem because you can

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.870 
at not a huge problem because you can
always<00:02:46.590> adjust<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:47.040> digitally<00:02:47.400> later<00:02:47.610> but

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
always adjust that digitally later but

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.870 
always adjust that digitally later but
it's<00:02:48.420> not<00:02:48.660> great<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.920> other<00:02:50.250> problem<00:02:50.790> with

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
it's not great the other problem with

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.350 
it's not great the other problem with
this<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.959> needle<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.610> comes<00:02:53.850> with<00:02:53.940> so

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
this is the needle that it comes with so

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.979 
this is the needle that it comes with so
for<00:02:54.780> people<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.170> have<00:02:55.380> 33<00:02:55.980> rpm<00:02:56.130> or<00:02:56.840> 33<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:57.930> a

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
for people that have 33 rpm or 33 and a

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.229 
for people that have 33 rpm or 33 and a
third<00:02:58.019> or<00:02:58.410> 45<00:02:58.830> rpm<00:02:59.250> records<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.940> needle<00:03:00.209> will

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
third or 45 rpm records this needle will

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.540 
third or 45 rpm records this needle will
work<00:03:00.480> fine<00:03:00.750> once<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.560> get<00:03:01.709> into<00:03:01.830> 78<00:03:02.400> you

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
work fine once you get into 78 you

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.120 
work fine once you get into 78 you
really<00:03:02.910> do<00:03:03.090> need<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.360> different<00:03:03.690> needle<00:03:04.380> to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
really do need a different needle to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.009 
really do need a different needle to
play<00:03:05.280> those<00:03:05.459> records<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.030> they<00:03:06.510> recommend

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
play those records and they recommend

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.690 
play those records and they recommend
playing<00:03:07.230> 78<00:03:07.709> with<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.010> needle<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.459> would

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
playing 78 with this needle I would

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.190 
playing 78 with this needle I would
highly<00:03:09.090> not<00:03:09.330> recommend<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.810> at<00:03:09.959> all<00:03:10.050> you're

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200

highly not recommend that at all you're
gonna<00:03:10.290> ruin<00:03:10.560> your<00:03:10.709> 78<00:03:11.310> playing<00:03:12.090> them<00:03:12.300> on<00:03:12.450> this

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
gonna ruin your 78 playing them on this

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.610 
gonna ruin your 78 playing them on this
needle<00:03:12.900> they<00:03:12.989> should<00:03:13.170> have<00:03:13.260> mentioned<00:03:13.590> that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
needle they should have mentioned that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.830 
needle they should have mentioned that
in<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:14.100> instruction<00:03:14.940> manual<00:03:14.970> somewhere<00:03:15.660> or

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
in the instruction manual somewhere or

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.690 
in the instruction manual somewhere or
even<00:03:16.050> online<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.560> they<00:03:16.620> didn't<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.430> that's<00:03:17.610> a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
even online and they didn't so that's a

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.610 
even online and they didn't so that's a
big<00:03:17.910> miss<00:03:18.120> for<00:03:18.480> them<00:03:18.930> right<00:03:19.170> there<00:03:19.380> because

big miss for them right there because
nobody<00:03:20.370> wants<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.670> give<00:03:20.880> this<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.360> play

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
nobody wants to give this out and play

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.420 
nobody wants to give this out and play
grandma's<00:03:21.840> records<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.470> end<00:03:23.040> up<00:03:23.190> ruining

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
grandma's records and end up ruining

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.030 
grandma's records and end up ruining
them<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.569> not<00:03:25.260> being<00:03:25.500> able<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.709> use<00:03:25.860> them

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
them and not being able to use them

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.539 
them and not being able to use them
later<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.810> needle<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.320> problem<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
later so so the needle is a problem the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.220 
later so so the needle is a problem the
last<00:03:29.820> problem<00:03:30.180> with<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.540> actually<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
last problem with this actually is the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.170 
last problem with this actually is the
the<00:03:31.709> look<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.040> feel<00:03:32.130> are<00:03:32.310> pretty<00:03:32.579> good<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:33.000> has

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
the look and feel are pretty good it has

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.850 
the look and feel are pretty good it has
some<00:03:33.420> glossy<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:34.200> particular<00:03:34.470> model<00:03:34.739> has

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
some glossy this particular model has

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.400 
some glossy this particular model has
glossy<00:03:35.310> orange<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:36.150> looks<00:03:36.420> okay<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:36.959> when<00:03:37.320> you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
glossy orange it looks okay but when you

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.069 
glossy orange it looks okay but when you
feel<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.950> it's<00:03:38.730> actually<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.720> doesn't

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
feel it it's actually it just doesn't

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.310 
feel it it's actually it just doesn't
feel<00:03:40.230> right<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.130> painted<00:03:41.579> plywood<00:03:41.790> and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
feel right it's like painted plywood and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.289 
feel right it's like painted plywood and
it<00:03:43.320> doesn't<00:03:43.799> have<00:03:43.980> very<00:03:44.459> good<00:03:44.730> quality<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.269> I

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
it doesn't have very good quality so I

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.970 
it doesn't have very good quality so I
wouldn't<00:03:45.630> expect<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.140> if<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.440> dropped<00:03:46.769> this

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
wouldn't expect this if you dropped this

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.830 
wouldn't expect this if you dropped this
if<00:03:47.220> you're<00:03:47.340> moving<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.239> happen<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.510> drop<00:03:48.630> this

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
if you're moving you happen to drop this

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.390 
if you're moving you happen to drop this
out<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.650> know<00:03:49.739> just<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.040> couple<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.310> inches

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
out of you know just a couple of inches

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.770 
out of you know just a couple of inches
onto<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.760> table<00:03:51.030> or<00:03:51.120> something<00:03:51.150> it's<00:03:51.540> probably

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
onto a table or something it's probably

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.300 
onto a table or something it's probably
gonna<00:03:51.870> crack<00:03:52.140> peel<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.769> paints<00:03:53.010> gonna<00:03:53.070> come

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
gonna crack peel the paints gonna come

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.430 
gonna crack peel the paints gonna come
off<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.390> quality<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.810> not<00:03:54.930> there<00:03:55.140> either

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
off so the quality is not there either

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.340 
off so the quality is not there either
so<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.160> pros<00:03:56.400> are<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:57.359> does<00:03:57.630> have<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> few

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
so the pros are it does have a few

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.080 
so the pros are it does have a few
features<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:58.890> don't<00:03:59.010> find<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.609> this
