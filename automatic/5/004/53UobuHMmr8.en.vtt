rise<00:01:18.640> first<00:01:18.970> so<00:01:19.659> die<00:01:19.869> rise<00:01:20.200> is<00:01:20.560> probably<00:01:21.430> it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
rise first so die rise is probably it's

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.810 
rise first so die rise is probably it's
the<00:01:22.330> classic<00:01:22.570> first<00:01:23.049> map<00:01:23.260> pack<00:01:23.530> for<00:01:24.340> black<00:01:24.640> ops

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
the classic first map pack for black ops

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.030 
the classic first map pack for black ops
as<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.479> know<00:01:25.630> for<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.900> first<00:01:26.049> black<00:01:26.320> map<00:01:26.799> map

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
as you know for the first black map map

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.310 
as you know for the first black map map
pack<00:01:27.610> for<00:01:27.790> black<00:01:27.939> ops<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.540> was<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.689> century<00:01:29.049> and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
pack for black ops it was a century and

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.710 
pack for black ops it was a century and
now<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.590> have<00:01:29.740> this<00:01:29.950> map<00:01:30.189> and<00:01:30.510> they're<00:01:31.510> both

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
now you have this map and they're both

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.469 
now you have this map and they're both
really<00:01:31.900> easy<00:01:32.229> this<00:01:32.860> map<00:01:33.040> after<00:01:33.939> my<00:01:34.270> first

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
really easy this map after my first

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.609 
really easy this map after my first
couple<00:01:34.750> tries<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.110> there's<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.320> series

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
couple tries and there's a series

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.630 
couple tries and there's a series
hopefully<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.130> I'll<00:01:36.220> be<00:01:36.340> able<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.520> figure

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
hopefully that I'll be able to figure

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.190 
hopefully that I'll be able to figure
out<00:01:36.820> cuz<00:01:36.939> my<00:01:37.060> hard<00:01:37.420> drive<00:01:37.630> crash<00:01:37.869> for<00:01:38.080> those

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
out cuz my hard drive crash for those

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.539 
out cuz my hard drive crash for those
you<00:01:38.290> who<00:01:38.320> don't<00:01:38.590> know<00:01:38.650> so<00:01:39.220> that's<00:01:39.400> why<00:01:39.520> I

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
you who don't know so that's why I

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:40.890 
you who don't know so that's why I
haven't<00:01:39.729> been<00:01:39.850> imposed<00:01:40.210> in<00:01:40.330> many<00:01:40.450> videos<00:01:40.750> is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
haven't been imposed in many videos is

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.420 
haven't been imposed in many videos is
my<00:01:41.140> hard<00:01:41.320> drive<00:01:41.530> crash<00:01:41.830> I<00:01:41.920> had<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.130> reboot<00:01:42.369> my

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
my hard drive crash I had to reboot my

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.350 
my hard drive crash I had to reboot my
whole<00:01:42.670> computer<00:01:42.790> but<00:01:43.380> anyways<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:44.740> yeah<00:01:44.770> um

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
whole computer but anyways so yeah um

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.690 
whole computer but anyways so yeah um
that<00:01:46.360> has<00:01:46.600> been<00:01:46.750> an<00:01:46.840> issue<00:01:46.930> but<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.680> just<00:01:48.490> think

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
that has been an issue but I just think

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.670 
that has been an issue but I just think
that<00:01:48.759> this<00:01:49.060> map<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.570> very<00:01:49.990> it's<00:01:50.350> very<00:01:50.409> easy

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
that this map is very it's very easy

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.590 
that this map is very it's very easy
once<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.310> actually<00:01:51.729> get<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.090> strategy

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
once you actually get a strategy

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.730 
once you actually get a strategy
together<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.110> there's<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.290> lot<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.470> glitch

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
together and there's a lot of glitch

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.319 
together and there's a lot of glitch
spots<00:01:54.070> which<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.369> it's<00:01:54.759> kind<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.000> up<00:01:55.150> there

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
spots which I it's kind of up there

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.480 
spots which I it's kind of up there
because<00:01:56.020> people<00:01:56.650> who<00:01:56.740> glitch<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.250> get<00:01:57.369> the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
because people who glitch and get the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.859 
because people who glitch and get the
high<00:01:57.579> runs<00:01:57.820> on<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.030> leaderboards<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.720> mean

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
high runs on the leaderboards I mean

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.330 
high runs on the leaderboards I mean
it's<00:01:59.020> like<00:01:59.110> okay<00:01:59.470> cool<00:01:59.740> leave<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.189> that

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
it's like okay cool leave it to that

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.130 
it's like okay cool leave it to that
round<00:02:00.610> but<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.299> really<00:02:01.450> takes<00:02:01.509> no<00:02:01.750> effort<00:02:01.899> and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
round but it really takes no effort and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.139 
round but it really takes no effort and
honestly<00:02:02.530> getting<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.369> farm<00:02:03.670> around<00:02:03.790> really

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
honestly getting to a farm around really

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.330 
honestly getting to a farm around really
isn't<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.079> hard<00:02:05.259> like<00:02:05.860> once<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.159> get<00:02:06.310> a

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
isn't that hard like once you get a

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.169 
isn't that hard like once you get a
groupon<00:02:06.869> personally<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:07.930> feel<00:02:08.200> like<00:02:08.379> the<00:02:08.679> first

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
groupon personally I feel like the first

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.769 
groupon personally I feel like the first
between<00:02:10.179> rounds<00:02:11.099> 6<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.430> 15<00:02:12.969> are<00:02:13.299> probably

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:13.779 
between rounds 6 and 15 are probably

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.569 
between rounds 6 and 15 are probably
actually<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.169> hardest<00:02:14.290> for<00:02:14.620> me<00:02:14.650> because<00:02:15.430> it's

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
actually the hardest for me because it's

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.540 
actually the hardest for me because it's
when<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:15.969> get<00:02:16.090> started

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
when you have to get started

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.310 
when you have to get started
set<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.150> once<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.420> get<00:02:17.510> set<00:02:17.840> up<00:02:17.870> its<00:02:18.080> really

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
set up so once you get set up its really

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.110 
set up so once you get set up its really
really<00:02:18.530> easy<00:02:18.680> but<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.580> don't<00:02:19.730> know<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:19.820> those

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
really easy but I don't know if those

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.370 
really easy but I don't know if those
are<00:02:20.270> those<00:02:20.420> personally<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.960> me<00:02:20.990> are<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
are those personally to me are the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.870 
are those personally to me are the
hardest<00:02:21.710> rounds<00:02:21.950> rather<00:02:22.160> than<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:22.550> round

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
hardest rounds rather than like round

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.580 
hardest rounds rather than like round
100<00:02:23.240> cuz<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:23.840> gets<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.170> time

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
100 cuz it just gets to be time

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.950 
100 cuz it just gets to be time
consuming<00:02:24.620> rather<00:02:25.310> than<00:02:25.520> difficult<00:02:26.060> but

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
consuming rather than difficult but

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.800 
consuming rather than difficult but
that's<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:27.320> me<00:02:27.530> personally<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:29.690> is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
that's just me personally so that is

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.750 
that's just me personally so that is
that<00:02:29.960> I'm<00:02:30.800> scale<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.340> ten<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.610> would

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
that I'm scale of one to ten I would

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.380 
that I'm scale of one to ten I would
probably<00:02:32.000> rate<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.600> map<00:02:32.930> let's<00:02:33.290> go<00:02:34.390> probably

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
probably rate this map let's go probably

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.210 
probably rate this map let's go probably
and<00:02:35.890> six<00:02:36.890> no<00:02:37.370> six<00:02:37.820> like<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.060> 7.5<00:02:38.690> seven<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:40.010> that

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
and six no six like a 7.5 seven in that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.280 
and six no six like a 7.5 seven in that
range<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.880> reason<00:02:41.300> personally<00:02:41.750> because<00:02:42.020> it

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
range the reason personally because it

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.140 
range the reason personally because it
is<00:02:42.380> not<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.830> ten<00:02:43.100> out<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.250> ten<00:02:43.460> map<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> nine<00:02:44.120> or

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
is not a ten out of ten map or a nine or

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.360 
is not a ten out of ten map or a nine or
something<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:44.960> because<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:46.010> is

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
something is because that it is it is

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.280 
something is because that it is it is
sort<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:46.940> really<00:02:47.240> really<00:02:47.480> easy<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.900> has<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.080> lot

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
sort of really really easy and has a lot

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.690 
sort of really really easy and has a lot
of<00:02:48.320> glitch<00:02:48.560> spots<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.490> thing<00:02:49.520> that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
of glitch spots but the thing that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.100 
of glitch spots but the thing that
actually<00:02:49.940> really<00:02:50.330> drove<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.660> down<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.930> most

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
actually really drove it down the most

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.470 
actually really drove it down the most
for<00:02:51.320> me<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.470> was<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> Easter<00:02:51.830> egg<00:02:52.010> now<00:02:52.480> after

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
for me it was the Easter egg now after

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.060 
for me it was the Easter egg now after
the<00:02:53.600> easter<00:02:54.110> egg<00:02:54.260> thinking<00:02:54.800> about<00:02:54.890> and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
the easter egg thinking about and

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.560 
the easter egg thinking about and
talking<00:02:55.100> my<00:02:55.370> friend<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.880> very<00:02:56.270> easy

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
talking my friend it is a very easy

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.540 
talking my friend it is a very easy
easter<00:02:56.840> right<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.170> accomplish<00:02:57.770> but<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.490> is

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
easter right to accomplish but it is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.040 
easter right to accomplish but it is
very<00:02:58.610> frustrating<00:02:58.910> partially<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.840> now<00:02:59.930> if

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
very frustrating partially and now if

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.990 
very frustrating partially and now if
you<00:03:00.170> gave<00:03:00.350> me<00:03:00.590> probably<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.160> month<00:03:01.460> or<00:03:01.760> two

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
you gave me probably a month or two

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880 
you gave me probably a month or two
months<00:03:02.030> after<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.050> then<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.620> did<00:03:03.800> the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
months after this and then I did the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.620 
months after this and then I did the
easter<00:03:03.980> egg<00:03:04.220> again<00:03:04.490> I<00:03:04.730> would<00:03:05.120> probably<00:03:05.330> have<00:03:05.600> a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
easter egg again I would probably have a

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.090 
easter egg again I would probably have a
very<00:03:05.900> different<00:03:06.170> rating<00:03:06.590> I'd<00:03:06.680> probably<00:03:06.860> give

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
very different rating I'd probably give

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.000 
very different rating I'd probably give
this<00:03:07.190> map<00:03:07.370> probably<00:03:07.700> an<00:03:07.760> eight<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.300> an<00:03:08.390> 8.5<00:03:09.010> but

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
this map probably an eight to an 8.5 but

map<00:04:34.099> can<00:04:34.249> do<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.580> simply<00:04:35.419> just<00:04:35.839> one<00:04:36.020> map<00:04:36.229> and

00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:36.499 
map can do that simply just one map and

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.070 
map can do that simply just one map and
that's<00:04:36.919> not<00:04:37.039> even<00:04:37.159> counting<00:04:37.539> turned<00:04:38.539> which<00:04:38.930> I

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
that's not even counting turned which I

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.899 
that's not even counting turned which I
really<00:04:39.439> really<00:04:39.680> enjoyed<00:04:39.949> turn<00:04:40.219> now<00:04:40.550> return

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
really really enjoyed turn now return

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.149 
really really enjoyed turn now return
turned<00:04:41.689> is<00:04:41.809> a<00:04:41.839> wholly<00:04:42.050> different<00:04:42.169> story<00:04:42.620> I

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
turned is a wholly different story I

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.129 
turned is a wholly different story I
really<00:04:43.639> do<00:04:43.789> think<00:04:44.150> that<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.509> one<00:04:44.719> of<00:04:44.749> the<00:04:44.809> best

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
really do think that is one of the best

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.390 
really do think that is one of the best
game<00:04:45.379> modes<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:45.710> they<00:04:45.889> have<00:04:46.099> incorporated

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
game modes that they have incorporated

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.010 
game modes that they have incorporated
into<00:04:46.729> zombies<00:04:47.059> I<00:04:47.150> like<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.419> lot<00:04:47.629> better<00:04:47.749> than

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
into zombies I like it a lot better than

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.920 
into zombies I like it a lot better than
grief<00:04:48.999> simply<00:04:49.999> because<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.419> love<00:04:50.569> playing<00:04:50.749> as

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
grief simply because I love playing as

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.209 
grief simply because I love playing as
the<00:04:50.960> zombie<00:04:51.379> I<00:04:51.409> just<00:04:51.620> think<00:04:51.770> it's<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:52.039> awesome

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
the zombie I just think it's so awesome

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.730 
the zombie I just think it's so awesome
but<00:04:53.059> the<00:04:53.389> only<00:04:53.569> problem<00:04:53.900> I<00:04:54.020> have<00:04:54.199> would<00:04:54.469> turn

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
but the only problem I have would turn

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.070 
but the only problem I have would turn
is<00:04:54.979> how<00:04:55.129> quickly<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:56.089> die<00:04:56.300> as<00:04:56.599> a<00:04:56.629> human

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
is how quickly you die as a human

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.230 
is how quickly you die as a human
because<00:04:57.229> I<00:04:57.379> just<00:04:57.620> get<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:57.770> just<00:04:57.919> raged<00:04:58.520> so<00:04:58.939> hard

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
because I just get I just raged so hard

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.089 
because I just get I just raged so hard
but<00:04:59.719> it's<00:04:59.839> not<00:04:59.960> like<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.139> rage<00:05:00.379> rage<00:05:00.650> it's<00:05:00.949> more

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
but it's not like a rage rage it's more

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.679 
but it's not like a rage rage it's more
like<00:05:01.189> a<00:05:01.279> fun<00:05:01.520> rate<00:05:01.729> which<00:05:01.999> is<00:05:02.029> kind<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.360> cool<00:05:02.419> I

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 
like a fun rate which is kind of cool I

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.439 
like a fun rate which is kind of cool I
love<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:03.370> um<00:05:04.370> but<00:05:04.849> that's<00:05:05.180> pretty<00:05:05.330> much

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
love that um but that's pretty much

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.809 
love that um but that's pretty much
turned<00:05:05.809> turned<00:05:06.110> over<00:05:06.439> all<00:05:06.680> itself<00:05:07.249> out<00:05:07.430> of<00:05:07.460> 10

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
turned turned over all itself out of 10

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.219 
turned turned over all itself out of 10
if<00:05:07.909> I'm<00:05:08.029> giving<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.330> an<00:05:08.449> individual<00:05:08.960> score<00:05:09.199> I

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
if I'm giving it an individual score I

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.709 
if I'm giving it an individual score I
probably<00:05:09.499> give<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.830> an<00:05:09.949> eight<00:05:10.159> to<00:05:10.460> an<00:05:10.580> 8.5<00:05:11.029> on<00:05:11.419> a

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
probably give it an eight to an 8.5 on a

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:13.959 
probably give it an eight to an 8.5 on a
rating<00:05:12.199> I'm<00:05:12.289> a<00:05:12.319> pretty<00:05:12.559> lenient<00:05:12.860> grader<00:05:13.580> which

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
rating I'm a pretty lenient grader which

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.329 
rating I'm a pretty lenient grader which
is<00:05:14.120> kind<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.389> good<00:05:14.599> for<00:05:14.659> treyarch<00:05:15.169> I<00:05:15.289> guess<00:05:15.649> but

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:16.339 
is kind of good for treyarch I guess but

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.079 
is kind of good for treyarch I guess but
um<00:05:16.399> anyways<00:05:17.120> so<00:05:18.279> finalizing<00:05:19.279> my<00:05:19.460> die<00:05:19.759> rise

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:20.089 
um anyways so finalizing my die rise

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.299 
um anyways so finalizing my die rise
thoughts<00:05:20.569> I<00:05:20.809> feel<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.110> die<00:05:21.229> rise<00:05:21.439> is<00:05:21.710> one<00:05:22.159> of

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:22.309 
thoughts I feel that die rise is one of

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:25.209 
thoughts I feel that die rise is one of
the<00:05:22.460> better<00:05:22.849> maps<00:05:23.149> in<00:05:23.509> the<00:05:23.779> black<00:05:24.110> ops<00:05:24.349> through

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 
the better maps in the black ops through

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.399 
the better maps in the black ops through
black<00:05:25.430> ops<00:05:25.639> 2<00:05:25.879> I<00:05:26.089> wouldn't<00:05:26.779> give<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.139> top

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
black ops 2 I wouldn't give it a top

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.170 
black ops 2 I wouldn't give it a top
three<00:05:27.800> ranking<00:05:28.249> but<00:05:28.399> I<00:05:28.460> would<00:05:28.610> certainly<00:05:28.819> give

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
three ranking but I would certainly give

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.719 
three ranking but I would certainly give
it<00:05:29.300> within<00:05:29.509> like<00:05:29.809> the<00:05:29.839> top<00:05:30.259> five<00:05:30.729> probably

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
it within like the top five probably

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.239 
it within like the top five probably
your<00:05:32.120> top<00:05:32.360> man<00:05:32.959> you<00:05:33.169> know<00:05:33.259> what<00:05:33.289> top<00:05:33.560> six<00:05:33.860> top

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:34.249 
your top man you know what top six top

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.639 
your top man you know what top six top
seven<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:34.749> think<00:05:35.749> it<00:05:35.839> might<00:05:35.959> work<00:05:36.020> yeah<00:05:36.259> I<00:05:36.409> guess

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:36.649 
seven I think it might work yeah I guess

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:39.040 
seven I think it might work yeah I guess
because<00:05:37.099> um<00:05:37.490> it's<00:05:38.209> just<00:05:38.479> it's<00:05:38.719> just<00:05:38.810> one<00:05:39.020> of

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
because um it's just it's just one of

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.589 
because um it's just it's just one of
those<00:05:39.139> maps<00:05:39.439> that<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.889> really<00:05:40.189> can't<00:05:40.849> do<00:05:41.089> solo

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
those maps that you really can't do solo

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.600 
those maps that you really can't do solo
like<00:05:41.959> for<00:05:42.289> a<00:05:42.319> lot<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.649> fun<00:05:42.919> it's<00:05:43.370> one<00:05:43.490> of<00:05:43.520> the

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
like for a lot of fun it's one of the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.399 
like for a lot of fun it's one of the
maps<00:05:43.729> that<00:05:43.909> I<00:05:43.969> enjoy<00:05:44.209> a<00:05:44.389> lot<00:05:44.509> more<00:05:44.839> doing<00:05:45.169> co-op

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
maps that I enjoy a lot more doing co-op

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.320 
maps that I enjoy a lot more doing co-op
with<00:05:45.649> friends<00:05:46.039> then<00:05:46.189> solo<00:05:46.550> which<00:05:46.789> is<00:05:46.969> kind<00:05:47.240> of

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
with friends then solo which is kind of

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.420 
with friends then solo which is kind of
interesting<00:05:47.740> which<00:05:48.740> kind<00:05:48.949> of<00:05:48.979> gives<00:05:49.099> it<00:05:49.249> a

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
interesting which kind of gives it a

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.730 
interesting which kind of gives it a
negative<00:05:49.639> edge<00:05:49.999> on<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.360> solo<00:05:50.659> aspect<00:05:51.110> but

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
negative edge on the solo aspect but

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.739 
negative edge on the solo aspect but
personally<00:05:52.459> that<00:05:52.639> doesn't<00:05:52.939> really<00:05:53.060> affect<00:05:53.479> my

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:53.749 
personally that doesn't really affect my

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:56.350 
personally that doesn't really affect my
grading<00:05:54.199> overall<00:05:54.819> so<00:05:55.819> that's<00:05:55.999> my<00:05:56.089> review<00:05:56.180> of
