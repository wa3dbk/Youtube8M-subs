on the back side of the axle so that

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.350 
on the back side of the axle so that
it'll<00:03:05.350> try<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.680> roll<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.130> forward<00:03:06.430> then<00:03:07.209> I

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
that right there on the leaf spring just

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.819 
that right there on the leaf spring just
see<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.370> top<00:03:33.579> one<00:03:33.640> has<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.209> hole<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.989> right

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
there so you put these blocks in you get

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.380 
there so you put these blocks in you get
them<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.780> they<00:03:40.930> are<00:03:41.230> straight<00:03:42.180> make<00:03:43.180> sure

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
them so that they are straight make sure

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.789 
them so that they are straight make sure
that<00:03:43.510> they're<00:03:43.720> straight<00:03:44.079> with<00:03:44.440> your<00:03:44.620> leaf

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
that they're straight with your leaf

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.250 
that they're straight with your leaf
spring<00:03:45.250> as<00:03:45.489> straight<00:03:46.480> as<00:03:46.630> possible<00:03:46.690> the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
spring as straight as possible the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.380 
spring as straight as possible the
straighter<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.590> better<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.549> then<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.239> lower

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
straighter the better and then you lower

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.330 
straighter the better and then you lower
this<00:03:49.630> back<00:03:49.840> down<00:03:50.079> until<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.470> hole<00:03:50.859> meets<00:03:51.100> up

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
this back down until that hole meets up

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.420 
this back down until that hole meets up

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.490 
with that nipple and you'll do the same
thing<00:03:54.820> on<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.030> side<00:03:55.180> all<00:03:56.079> right<00:03:56.290> once<00:03:56.440> you

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
thing on that side all right once you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.590 
thing on that side all right once you
let<00:03:56.680> your<00:03:56.829> axle<00:03:57.160> back<00:03:57.310> down<00:03:57.579> make<00:03:58.269> sure<00:03:58.480> that

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
let your axle back down make sure that

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.390 
let your axle back down make sure that
that<00:03:58.780> nipple<00:03:59.049> lines<00:03:59.500> up<00:03:59.739> at<00:03:59.829> the<00:03:59.920> hole<00:04:00.130> and

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
that nipple lines up at the hole and

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.390 
that nipple lines up at the hole and
everything<00:04:00.670> lines<00:04:00.850> up<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.620> then<00:04:02.620> throw<00:04:03.220> your

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
everything lines up and then throw your

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.030 
everything lines up and then throw your
new<00:04:03.519> u-bolts<00:04:04.150> over<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.750> axle<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.350> bring<00:04:05.890> them

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
new u-bolts over the axle and bring them

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.000 
new u-bolts over the axle and bring them
down<00:04:06.690> these<00:04:07.690> are<00:04:08.170> going<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.590> seem<00:04:08.829> like

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
down these are going to seem like

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.620 
down these are going to seem like
they're<00:04:09.190> too<00:04:09.370> wide<00:04:09.579> for<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.880> holes<00:04:10.090> but<00:04:10.420> all

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
they're too wide for the holes but all

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.120 
they're too wide for the holes but all
you<00:04:10.720> got<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.959> do<00:04:11.049> is<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.319> just<00:04:11.350> grab<00:04:11.769> them<00:04:11.950> and

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
you got to do is you just grab them and

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.460 
you got to do is you just grab them and
you<00:04:12.250> squeeze<00:04:12.670> them<00:04:12.910> in<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.870> when<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.109> squeeze

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
you squeeze them in and when you squeeze

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.150 
you squeeze them in and when you squeeze
them<00:04:14.709> in<00:04:14.980> like<00:04:15.579> this<00:04:16.590> they'll<00:04:17.590> go<00:04:17.769> right<00:04:17.950> into

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
them in like this they'll go right into

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.030 
them in like this they'll go right into
those<00:04:18.310> holes

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.520 

and<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.280> end<00:04:21.730> up<00:04:21.820> looking<00:04:21.970> like<00:04:22.150> this<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:22.810> haven't

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
and I end up looking like this I haven't

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.800 
and I end up looking like this I haven't
tightened<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:23.890> down<00:04:23.920> yet<00:04:24.370> but<00:04:25.120> get<00:04:25.330> your<00:04:25.540> bolts

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
tightened it down yet but get your bolts

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.650 
tightened it down yet but get your bolts
put<00:04:25.990> on<00:04:26.110> there<00:04:26.320> by<00:04:26.500> hand<00:04:26.890> and<00:04:27.850> try<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.570> get

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
put on there by hand and try and get

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.210 
put on there by hand and try and get
them<00:04:28.780> run<00:04:28.930> up<00:04:29.080> as<00:04:29.200> far<00:04:29.380> as<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.530> can<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.040> do<00:04:30.190> not

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
them run up as far as you can and do not

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.550 
them run up as far as you can and do not
use<00:04:30.550> power<00:04:30.820> tools<00:04:31.270> because<00:04:31.720> these<00:04:31.900> will<00:04:32.200> cross

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
use power tools because these will cross

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.760 
use power tools because these will cross
thread<00:04:33.010> very<00:04:33.340> easily<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:35.080> use<00:04:35.290> your<00:04:35.470> hand

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
thread very easily so use your hand

thread very easily so use your hand
tools<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.460> make<00:04:36.580> sure<00:04:36.790> that<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.090> go<00:04:37.210> slowly

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
tools and make sure that you go slowly

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.140 
tools and make sure that you go slowly
making<00:04:38.200> sure<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.620> at<00:04:38.770> all<00:04:38.950> threads<00:04:39.880> up

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
making sure that at all threads up

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.330 
making sure that at all threads up
properly<00:04:40.600> all<00:04:41.350> right<00:04:41.530> one<00:04:41.710> more<00:04:41.890> thing<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.190> pay

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
properly all right one more thing to pay

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.260 
properly all right one more thing to pay
attention<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.990> see<00:04:43.990> how<00:04:44.080> that's<00:04:44.260> not<00:04:44.440> centered

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
attention to see how that's not centered

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.960 
attention to see how that's not centered
take<00:04:46.270> your<00:04:46.510> hammer<00:04:46.690> or<00:04:47.050> something<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.700> get

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
take your hammer or something and get

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:57.120 
take your hammer or something and get
that<00:04:49.240> until<00:04:49.830> it<00:04:50.830> meets<00:04:51.070> up<00:04:51.370> Center<00:04:56.070> maybe<00:04:57.070> I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
that until it meets up Center maybe I

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.380 
that until it meets up Center maybe I
should<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:57.400> picked<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.610> better<00:04:57.640> hammer<00:04:59.370> okay

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
should have picked a better hammer okay

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.340 
should have picked a better hammer okay
see<00:05:01.390> that's<00:05:01.570> just<00:05:01.720> about<00:05:02.500> centered<00:05:03.040> there<00:05:03.250> now

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
see that's just about centered there now

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.560 
see that's just about centered there now
see<00:05:05.350> how<00:05:05.440> that<00:05:05.590> is<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:07.030> centered<00:05:07.360> on<00:05:07.450> the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
see how that is and it's centered on the

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.820 
see how that is and it's centered on the
blocks<00:05:08.640> just<00:05:09.640> a<00:05:09.880> little<00:05:10.150> bit<00:05:10.500> you<00:05:11.500> guys<00:05:11.620> can

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
blocks just a little bit you guys can

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.080 
blocks just a little bit you guys can
hate<00:05:11.950> on<00:05:11.980> me<00:05:12.220> for<00:05:12.280> being<00:05:12.550> crooked<00:05:12.700> I<00:05:12.940> don't

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
hate on me for being crooked I don't

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.690 
hate on me for being crooked I don't
care<00:05:13.300> but<00:05:13.870> anyway<00:05:14.290> yes<00:05:14.590> make<00:05:15.430> sure<00:05:15.580> that

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
care but anyway yes make sure that

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.930 
care but anyway yes make sure that
that's<00:05:15.820> squared<00:05:16.270> up<00:05:16.450> I<00:05:17.280> put<00:05:18.280> my<00:05:18.370> bolts<00:05:18.700> all<00:05:18.820> the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
that's squared up I put my bolts all the

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.390 
that's squared up I put my bolts all the
way<00:05:19.060> on<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.540> then<00:05:20.290> I<00:05:20.320> use<00:05:20.620> my<00:05:20.830> angle<00:05:21.070> grant<00:05:21.280> and

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
way on and then I use my angle grant and

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.220 
way on and then I use my angle grant and
I<00:05:21.430> cut<00:05:21.700> them<00:05:21.790> off<00:05:21.970> so<00:05:22.540> that<00:05:22.690> it's<00:05:22.810> easier<00:05:23.200> to

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
I cut them off so that it's easier to

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.350 
I cut them off so that it's easier to
get<00:05:23.410> a<00:05:23.470> deep<00:05:23.680> socket<00:05:24.130> onto<00:05:24.310> them<00:05:24.640> otherwise

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
get a deep socket onto them otherwise

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.090 
get a deep socket onto them otherwise
the<00:05:25.570> bolts<00:05:25.870> like<00:05:26.020> this<00:05:26.290> long<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:26.830> you're<00:05:26.980> not

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
the bolts like this long and you're not

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.890 
the bolts like this long and you're not
going<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.310> reach<00:05:27.490> that<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:28.000> it<00:05:28.450> takes<00:05:28.570> forever

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
going to reach that and it takes forever

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.280 
going to reach that and it takes forever
with<00:05:29.410> a<00:05:29.560> wrench<00:05:30.390> all<00:05:31.390> right<00:05:31.600> now<00:05:31.780> once<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.080> get

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
with a wrench all right now once you get

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.600 
with a wrench all right now once you get
them<00:05:32.820> tightened<00:05:33.820> up<00:05:33.940> on<00:05:34.240> both<00:05:34.570> sides<00:05:35.610> that's

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
them tightened up on both sides that's

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.130 
them tightened up on both sides that's
time<00:05:36.850> to<00:05:37.030> lay<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.360> down<00:05:37.390> on<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.750> ground<00:05:37.990> and

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
time to lay it down on the ground and

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.050 
time to lay it down on the ground and
see<00:05:38.470> what<00:05:38.710> happens<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.900> there<00:05:40.900> we<00:05:41.020> go

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
see what happens and there we go

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.850 
see what happens and there we go
rear<00:05:43.060> in<00:05:43.210> is<00:05:43.390> lowered<00:05:43.720> three<00:05:44.050> inches<00:05:44.410> which

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
rear in is lowered three inches which

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.200 
rear in is lowered three inches which
makes<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.280> front<00:05:45.520> look<00:05:45.730> like<00:05:45.910> it's<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.330> 4x4<00:05:48.210> but

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
makes the front look like it's a 4x4 but

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.680 
makes the front look like it's a 4x4 but
here<00:05:49.390> we<00:05:49.510> go

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
here we go

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.260 
here we go
three<00:05:50.650> inches<00:05:50.950> we're<00:05:51.130> probably<00:05:51.340> like<00:05:51.910> I<00:05:52.030> said

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
three inches we're probably like I said

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.030 
three inches we're probably like I said
we're<00:05:52.450> still<00:05:52.600> going<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:52.840> take<00:05:53.110> out<00:05:53.320> one<00:05:53.650> leaf
