00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
the axles bad the boots neither one of

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.799 
the axles bad the boots neither one of
them<00:00:06.019> really<00:00:06.049> seem<00:00:06.439> to<00:00:06.529> be<00:00:06.620> leaking<00:00:07.809> not

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
them really seem to be leaking not

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.650 
them really seem to be leaking not
finding<00:00:09.200> any<00:00:09.349> cracks<00:00:09.889> in<00:00:10.190> them<00:00:10.929> but<00:00:13.629> when<00:00:14.629> I

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
finding any cracks in them but when I

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:30.040 
finding any cracks in them but when I
turn<00:00:14.990> them<00:00:17.650> here<00:00:21.370> I<00:00:28.660> don't<00:00:29.660> know<00:00:29.780> if<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:29.930> can

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
turn them here I don't know if you can

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.490 
turn them here I don't know if you can
tell<00:00:30.320> that<00:00:30.560> they're<00:00:30.980> turning<00:00:32.050> just<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.200> little

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
tell that they're turning just a little

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:53.049 
tell that they're turning just a little
bit

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.750 

of<00:00:54.059> course<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.510> turning<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:55.729> right<00:00:56.729> here

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of course it's turning some right here

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:09.920 
of course it's turning some right here
at<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.949> at<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> hub<00:00:59.339> and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.270 

that's<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.079> driver's<00:01:11.530> side<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.770> don't<00:01:12.070> think

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
that's the driver's side I don't think

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.300 
that's the driver's side I don't think
the<00:01:12.369> driver's<00:01:12.759> side<00:01:13.020> bad<00:01:14.020> but<00:01:14.799> I'm<00:01:14.890> not<00:01:15.070> sure

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the driver's side bad but I'm not sure

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.469 
the driver's side bad but I'm not sure
when<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.340> come<00:01:18.580> over<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.939> passenger<00:01:19.450> side

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
when I come over to the passenger side

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.560 
when I come over to the passenger side
and<00:01:21.869> when<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:22.990> turn<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:25.270> actually

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
and when you turn it you can actually

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.029 
and when you turn it you can actually
see<00:01:25.929> the<00:01:26.080> boot<00:01:29.429> again<00:01:30.429> it's<00:01:30.670> not<00:01:30.820> leaking

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
see the boot again it's not leaking

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:50.499 
see the boot again it's not leaking
but<00:01:33.039> it<00:01:33.130> seems<00:01:38.549> loose<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.789> me

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.980 

not<00:01:51.170> leaking<00:01:51.880> they're<00:01:52.880> not<00:01:53.119> cracked<00:01:53.600> or<00:01:53.810> not

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
not leaking they're not cracked or not

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.959 
not leaking they're not cracked or not
broken<00:01:55.390> but<00:01:56.390> when<00:01:56.719> I<00:01:56.750> Drive<00:01:57.020> down<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.320> road

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
broken but when I Drive down the road

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.889 
broken but when I Drive down the road
and<00:01:58.969> I<00:01:59.090> accelerate<00:02:00.490> I'm<00:02:01.899> experiencing

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
and I accelerate I'm experiencing

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.460 
and I accelerate I'm experiencing
vibration<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.130> steering<00:02:04.520> wheel<00:02:04.670> and

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
vibration in the steering wheel and

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.749 
vibration in the steering wheel and
really<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.560> whole<00:02:06.679> car<00:02:06.950> kind<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.280> vibrates

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
really the whole car kind of vibrates

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.430 
really the whole car kind of vibrates
but<00:02:08.330> when<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.569> let<00:02:08.720> off<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.019> accelerator<00:02:11.440> it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
but when you let off the accelerator it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.850 
but when you let off the accelerator it
quits<00:02:12.830> vibrating<00:02:14.050> it's<00:02:15.050> only<00:02:15.380> when<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.590> seems

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
quits vibrating it's only when it seems

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.170 
quits vibrating it's only when it seems
like<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.450> transmissions<00:02:17.450> under<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.959> torque

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
like the transmissions under a torque

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.420 
like the transmissions under a torque
either<00:02:20.180> accelerating<00:02:20.959> or<00:02:21.080> going<00:02:21.440> uphill<00:02:21.620> or

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
either accelerating or going uphill or

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.490 
either accelerating or going uphill or
something<00:02:22.819> like<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.239> does<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.750> seem<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.200> it

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
something like that does it seem like it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.100 
something like that does it seem like it
really<00:02:24.620> vibrates<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:27.849> hope<00:02:28.849> you<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.209> give<00:02:29.989> me

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
really vibrates I hope you can give me

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.809 
really vibrates I hope you can give me
some<00:02:30.260> advice<00:02:30.349> let<00:02:31.160> me<00:02:31.220> know<00:02:31.370> if<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.640> think

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
some advice let me know if you think

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.810 
some advice let me know if you think
these<00:02:32.180> are<00:02:32.239> bad<00:02:32.599> or<00:02:32.930> not<00:02:34.299> thank<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.360> bye
