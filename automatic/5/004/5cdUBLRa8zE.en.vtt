00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.200 
got a just a traditional LCD display
more<00:01:32.899> applications<00:01:33.619> than<00:01:33.920> one<00:01:34.759> would<00:01:34.970> check<00:01:35.180> a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
more applications than one would check a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.770 
more applications than one would check a
stick<00:01:35.479> at<00:01:38.050> but<00:01:39.050> I<00:01:39.710> like<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.940> mean<00:01:41.149> it's<00:01:41.360> it's

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
definitely smaller the only thing I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.570 
definitely smaller the only thing I
don't<00:01:44.660> like<00:01:45.080> about<00:01:45.200> this<00:01:45.530> entire<00:01:45.950> phone<00:01:46.310> the

don't like about this entire phone the
intone<00:01:47.030> Lee<00:01:47.149> thing<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:48.050> only<00:01:48.229> thing<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.440> can

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
intone Lee thing the only thing I can

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.310 
intone Lee thing the only thing I can
find<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.729> placement<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.660> this<00:01:50.780> charging

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
find is the placement of this charging

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.070 
find is the placement of this charging
board<00:01:52.090> when<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.179> hold<00:01:53.330> in<00:01:53.479> your<00:01:53.509> hand<00:01:53.899> your

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
board when you hold in your hand your

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.809 
board when you hold in your hand your
hand<00:01:54.140> naturally<00:01:54.800> wants<00:01:55.039> to<00:01:55.190> kind<00:01:55.429> of<00:01:55.490> go

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
hand naturally wants to kind of go

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.680 
hand naturally wants to kind of go
around<00:01:55.940> here<00:01:57.640> for<00:01:58.640> example<00:01:59.060> if<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.300> charging

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
around here for example if the charging

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.559 
around here for example if the charging
port<00:01:59.840> was<00:02:00.110> on<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:00.380> this<00:02:01.369> was<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.670> front<00:02:01.880> we

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
port was on this this was the front we

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.260 
port was on this this was the front we
think<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.810> good<00:02:02.959> rest<00:02:03.229> comfortably<00:02:03.470> there<00:02:04.270> but

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
think a good rest comfortably there but

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.400 
think a good rest comfortably there but
nothing<00:02:05.390> everything<00:02:05.810> wants<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.110> sit<00:02:06.289> down

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
nothing everything wants to sit down

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.980 
nothing everything wants to sit down
here<00:02:06.709> I'll<00:02:07.250> go<00:02:07.399> up<00:02:07.490> here<00:02:07.550> just<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.509> little<00:02:08.630> small

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
here I'll go up here just a little small

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.830 
here I'll go up here just a little small
no<00:02:09.229> answer<00:02:09.560> but<00:02:10.240> really<00:02:11.240> overall<00:02:11.480> for<00:02:11.750> this

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
no answer but really overall for this

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.000 
no answer but really overall for this
phone<00:02:12.080> for<00:02:12.530> what<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.770> does<00:02:13.480> it's<00:02:14.480> got<00:02:14.630> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
phone for what it does it's got a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.720 
phone for what it does it's got a
dual-core<00:02:16.150> 1.5<00:02:17.150> gigahertz<00:02:17.420> processor<00:02:18.550> 1<00:02:19.550> gig

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor 1 gig

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.800 
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor 1 gig
of<00:02:19.760> ram

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.600 

so<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.830> mean<00:02:24.010> you're<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.130> running<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.580> little

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
so I mean you're just running a little

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.750 
so I mean you're just running a little
bit<00:02:24.880> older<00:02:25.209> specs<00:02:25.510> but<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:27.430> it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
bit older specs but I like it

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.100 
bit older specs but I like it
that's<00:02:27.940> very<00:02:28.870> cool<00:02:29.230> very<00:02:29.680> well<00:02:29.950> built<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:32.020> I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that's very cool very well built and I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.840 
that's very cool very well built and I
think<00:02:32.290> Casio<00:02:32.590> kind<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.860> got<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> bad<00:02:33.220> name<00:02:33.490> for

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
think Casio kind of got a bad name for

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.440 
think Casio kind of got a bad name for
these<00:02:34.840> devices<00:02:35.350> but<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:36.330> think<00:02:37.330> they've<00:02:37.420> done

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
these devices but I think they've done

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.130 
these devices but I think they've done
well<00:02:37.750> with<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:39.239> kind<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.360> little<00:02:40.510> my<00:02:40.660> mini

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
the Internet at the same time so that's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.660

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
of technology at the same time so that's

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.340 
of technology at the same time so that's
been<00:03:10.510> my<00:03:10.540> review<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.350> enjoy
