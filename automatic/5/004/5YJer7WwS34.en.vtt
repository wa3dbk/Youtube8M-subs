 choose your shoes hello 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.230
 actually today I'm going to you 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.449
 to talk about shoes is my domain 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 favorite but even if you're like 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 I love all his shoes we do not 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.240
 can not wear everything it all depends actually 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.830
 your morphology 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.320
 so I'm going to explain to you how 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 choose according to the shape of your legs in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.769
 done for example when at a calf 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050
 which is strong enough we must avoid 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.180
 spreading that are very fine all of that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.149
 is only an optical effect a thin heel 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 on a maul effort will accentuate the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.860
 size of the calf so it is necessary to prefer 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
 a talent that is thicker for 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.030
 respect the balanced and for that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.100
 be more harmonious when you look 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.960
 girls, on the other hand, can 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 allow fine talents and will avoid 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.510
 heels very thick like big 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 hooves that will give the impression that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.680
 the girl will struggle to lift the foot 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.519
 you have to stay consistent with the width 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.170
 of the heel in relation to his leg in fact 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.360
 for the height 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.409
 so of course more and at most and feminine 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 but it's not always easy to 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.390
 wear so we'll start for those 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.450
 who can not walk with 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.330
 very high heels with one with a small 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.000
 heel 4 to 5 cm or with a wide heel 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.710
 which also facilitates the process 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.900
 are the skates at the front of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.600
 shoe that are going to reduce the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.460
 arching of the foot and which will be more 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 easy to wear to get back to our 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.509
 calves the girls on to what we 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.729
 call the boot of course that it covers 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.619
 knee deep 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.450
 more and more there are models 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.200
 adjustable for those who really have a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.159
 very strong calf 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.079
 So that's the same advantage is 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.689
 avoid anything that is ankle boots in this 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.540
 kind that cuts the calf and the leg 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.189
 it's not pretty to look at so really 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.119
 the boots in this genre it's 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.000
 only for girls who have 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.890
 long legs and very thin same 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.290
 when you have a very strong foot, you avoid 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.040
 the thongs it will not be pretty at the end 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.380
 an hour of walking 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.420
 when the country has inflated the same so 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.580
 it's meant for very thin legs 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.319
 therefore, models 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.450
 indented 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.790
 to lengthen the foot and who are going 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.859
 also lengthen the leg it takes 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.499
 always for reference we see the 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.959
 birth of the toes it is very pretty 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:27.090
 feminine and it highlights the foot in 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.230
 makes the right compromise when you need 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.760
 to walk all day when we have 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.090
 still want to be in high heels 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.359
 the wedge heels of course it's all going 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.950
 world is easy to wear and especially 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.260
 it's more comfortable than a heel 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.909
 needle so do not hesitate in more 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.290
 it's very trendy in summer as in 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.489
 winter so the pressure to deprive 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.540
 to conclude to shoes is a 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.129
 true accessory 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.719
 so do not hesitate to have several 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.639
 do not hesitate to train yourself 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.590
 at home for the approach to stay 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.510
 right so that it looks 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.109
 normal even if you drill on 15 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.109
 pennies and talent
