00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.120
 good to everyone while 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.400
 I was looking for more material for my video 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.530
 fighting I found a surprise 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.240
 quite disappointing and it's seeing that a 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.420
 our colleague what the whole thing jill 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.880
 66 have been fucking her with more videos 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.130
 focused on ruining your reputation so much 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.869
 in his videos as well as on a personal level what 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.180
 which I find it as low as there is 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.609
 to win people because I do not doubt that this 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.619
 be in addition to envious criticisms a 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.570
 strategy to make controversy and win 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.730
 more people to your channels I will not say the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.680
 name of those channels or those videos 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.780
 because I do not want to contribute to their cause 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 but it 's the highest berna so-called user 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.250
 with just 4 videos and that is presented 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.649
 very cordially in the first and now 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.570
 in the last one insult her in her title and 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.520
 in the other case a long criticism in the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.010
 that they throw shit to his way of doing 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.899
 videos just because he uses sexy images and 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.210
 the worst is that in the end they try to pass 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.579
 by educated using a pretty language 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.590
 searched and saying that the criticism was 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.660
 made without intending to tell you how 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.879
 make your videos when it's clear that 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.250
 all the video was spent telling him that 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.260
 I know there are many critical videos 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.390
 damn against users who 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.820
 one of those maybe they deserve it because 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.490
 they started some discussion but in 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.530
 the case of why guild 66 she does 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.390
 your videos to entertain your audience 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.100
 and I have not seen that he's messed with 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.080
 another what he calls is what 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.810
 many are also fixed are the images 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.850
 that he puts in his videos quite uploaded 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.550
 but I wonder if that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.230
 it really is something that is wrong or is me 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.180
 I think that every January has its 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.040
 own style of making videos by 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.380
 example I do not like to use those 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.540
 funny faces that you put some to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.000
 their avatars but that does not mean that 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.130
 I do not like the way other people do 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.110
 that I follow my own rules and styles 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.240
 to avoid falling into the same as do 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.910
 others and I think that's what it does for 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.770
 keith earls 66 just do something 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.620
 that others do not do and that's fine 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.900
 moreover they are not just images uploaded from 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.210
 all you have that is just look at 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.640
 the tiny details of your videos already 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.620
 it is easy to see why girl 66 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.690
 He tries hard to make videos of 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.550
 quality or tell me you guys are there 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.709
 many genres that can create 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.989
 openings as she or he does 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.220
 animation of the mouths movements equal 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.520
 fa sensus 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.830
 and those things he creates for her because he does not 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.020
 he creates them for his subscribers which 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.390
 I show dedication and effort 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.220
 things that we should all respect I 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.410
 I know many will say that I am a fan boy 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.120
 of that which in dera or something like that 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.640
 I've seen all your videos since a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.620
 some do not understand the joke well 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.690
 like some songs that have more 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.460
 meaning for Mexicans like that of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.500
 the tacos but what I've seen 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.930
 shows great dynamism in the use of 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.000
 its characters I find it incredible that 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.250
 even get to see your photos and 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.890
 check all information of her fuck 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.050
 get a life whether it's easy 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.420
 see those photos or not is not a reason to 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.459
 to walk around me pathetically in life 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.590
 someone else's staff just to search for 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.840
 some little things to get out of each and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.790
 more on top of being so cheeky to tell 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.400
 what types of photos should they upload and what 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.380
 do not really fuck buy a friend and 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.840
 as I know they are so detailed and before 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.720
 I take out this in face I'll tell him 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.730
 participate in the 66 poker contest 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.590
 for the valentine since I found that 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.750
 It was a great opportunity to give me 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.890
 know and also that the idea of ​​creating 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.750
 a romantic story was pretty 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.760
 because he was testing our 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.459
 creativity with something that many people 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.530
 It costs to express is more would be great 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.420
 to do more contests with such topics 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.819
 diverse like that also criticize him 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.950
 who has responded angrily to a video 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.330
 that insulted her in the title because I 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.209
 I think anyone loses their temper 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.940
 if there are so many malicious people who 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.280
 looks to see you fall in summary do not get 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.530
 with the personal life of others because that 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.660
 speaks very badly of you resembling those 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.700
 reporters who rummage in the trash for 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.800
 to be able to say what a celebrity eats 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.780
 and that if you do not like a video 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.730
 they see it but if they make an argument 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.860
 about something that does not affect them, 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.080
 hope they will not receive answers to 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.320
 I would like to leave a message to 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.030
 little chan and handsome that 66 giles and also 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.340
 to those what in the good ones that 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.720
 have gone through this and that is that you do not have 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.239
 to pay attention to criticism 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.549
 negative when one does well his 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.950
 work will always come to people 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.959
 who will be looking to get the worst out of you 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.820
 but you must remember that by a message 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.800
 bad there are always more good 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.630
 you always have to keep in mind that 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.310
 there are people who like what you do 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.080
 and as long as it's a single 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.360
 I'm sorry to continue with this and of course while 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.280
 it's fun for you I know I'm a 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.220
 fledgling novice and that very surely 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.290
 these things you already know xd but only 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.570
 in case you have a doubtful moment I hope 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.060
 serve you I hope that if you want to get there 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.070
 to change your style of videos be it because 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.500
 you want to do it and not for criticism 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.389
 ill-intentioned fools I just hope that 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.430
 none of these affects you since I 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.800
 would like to see more videos of you from the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.110
 prints clear good one last thing 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.760
 before leaving and that is what I want to tell you 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.190
 how a constructive opinion is made 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.410
 when they try to say things that do not 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.780
 like another video do it without imposing 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.880
 nothing or without saying you have to do 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.010
 this because I say it but even 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.290
 try to be more friendly using the I think 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.630
 or I think that it will do much more 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.130
 nice to read and listen but good 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.130
 it's up to each other
