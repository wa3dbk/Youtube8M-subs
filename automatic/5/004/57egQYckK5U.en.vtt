here's my groove now we can lay down a
guitar<00:02:48.600> groove<00:02:48.900> using<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> MIDI<00:02:49.769> track<00:02:50.130> we

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
guitar groove using the MIDI track we

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:05.520 
guitar groove using the MIDI track we
just<00:02:50.640> created

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:21.849 

so<00:03:06.530> let<00:03:06.680> me<00:03:06.709> quantize<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:20.769> using<00:03:21.769> a

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
so let me quantize that using a

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.390 
so let me quantize that using a
duplicate<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.760> same<00:03:23.090> midi<00:03:23.480> guitar<00:03:23.599> track

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
duplicate of that same midi guitar track

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.069 
duplicate of that same midi guitar track
let's<00:03:25.400> layer<00:03:25.609> in<00:03:25.849> a<00:03:25.939> nice<00:03:26.150> little<00:03:26.419> lick<00:03:26.750> just

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
let's layer in a nice little lick just

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:44.949 
let's layer in a nice little lick just
to<00:03:27.230> fill<00:03:27.439> in<00:03:27.560> some<00:03:27.769> space<00:03:43.389> now<00:03:44.389> repeat<00:03:44.810> this

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
to fill in some space now repeat this

00:03:44.959 --> 00:04:10.479 
to fill in some space now repeat this
process<00:03:45.230> one<00:03:45.829> last<00:03:46.069> time<00:04:09.159> lastly<00:04:10.159> we'll<00:04:10.370> need

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
process one last time lastly we'll need

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.219 
process one last time lastly we'll need
to<00:04:10.639> fatten<00:04:10.849> up<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.209> track<00:04:11.509> with<00:04:11.780> some<00:04:11.989> bass<00:04:12.199> in

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:12.229 
to fatten up the track with some bass in

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:54.840 
to fatten up the track with some bass in
low<00:04:12.650> end<00:04:12.859> piano

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.400 

so<00:04:55.850> again<00:04:56.150> this<00:04:56.330> has<00:04:56.510> been<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.720> look<00:04:56.990> at<00:04:57.170> how<00:04:57.350> to

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410
