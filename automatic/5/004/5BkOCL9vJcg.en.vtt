screwdriver is no longer magnetized so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.270 
screwdriver is no longer magnetized so
this<00:00:46.170> might<00:00:46.320> take<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> little<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:46.980> longer

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.180 

we<00:01:15.410> can't<00:01:15.590> get<00:01:15.740> these<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:15.920> pop<00:01:16.250> out<00:01:16.490> for<00:01:16.730> us<00:01:18.190> all

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
we can't get these to pop out for us all

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.250 
we can't get these to pop out for us all
right<00:01:19.490> there's<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.240> five<00:01:20.570> black<00:01:20.900> of<00:01:21.140> one

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.930 
right there's the five black of one
silver<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.680> then<00:01:21.830> one<00:01:21.950> silver<00:01:22.280> stayed<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:22.730> the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
silver and then one silver stayed in the

to use a pair of tweezers to get this
one<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.090> apparently<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:40.990> next<00:01:41.200> step<00:01:41.320> is

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
one that apparently on the next step is

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.500 
one that apparently on the next step is
to<00:01:41.560> go<00:01:41.680> ahead<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:41.950> pull<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.400> plastic<00:01:43.180> housing

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.900 

there's<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.980> clip<00:02:42.250> just<00:02:42.370> right<00:02:42.580> above<00:02:42.790> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
there's a clip just right above the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.570 
there's a clip just right above the
battery<00:02:43.180> area<00:02:43.720> as<00:02:43.840> well<00:02:44.069> right<00:02:45.069> next<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
battery connection there we go see we've

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.550 
battery connection there we go see we've
got<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.420> couple<00:02:52.480> connectors<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.170> backyard

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
go ahead and set that aside we can try

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.520 
go ahead and set that aside we can try
to<00:02:57.280> work<00:02:57.459> out<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.019> speaker<00:02:59.019> portion<00:02:59.410> down

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530

to work out the speaker portion down
here<00:02:59.680> at<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.830> bottom<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:01.180> pulling<00:03:01.480> up

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
here at the bottom it's pulling up

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.110 
here at the bottom it's pulling up
towards<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.930> battery<00:03:02.260> side<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:03.430> wiggling<00:03:04.030> it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
towards the battery side and wiggling it

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.259 
towards the battery side and wiggling it
off<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:06.220> ahead<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.459> set<00:03:06.550> that<00:03:06.580> aside<00:03:06.730> as<00:03:07.090> well

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
the phone here so the one thing that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.600 
the phone here so the one thing that
we're<00:03:14.620> gonna<00:03:14.709> go<00:03:14.860> ahead<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.100> start<00:03:15.310> with<00:03:15.459> is

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
we're gonna go ahead and start with is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.420 
we're gonna go ahead and start with is
down<00:03:15.819> here<00:03:16.030> at<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.180> bottom<00:03:17.340> we're<00:03:18.340> gonna

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
down here at the bottom we're gonna

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.330 
down here at the bottom we're gonna
remove<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.819> little<00:03:19.299> wire<00:03:20.230> antenna<00:03:20.709> cable<00:03:21.130> and

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
remove the little wire antenna cable and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.559 
remove the little wire antenna cable and
the<00:03:21.700> bottom<00:03:22.269> board<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:24.790> has<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.000> display

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
the bottom board it has a display

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.830 
the bottom board it has a display
connector<00:03:26.049> on<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:27.540> actually<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.569> believe<00:03:28.690> this

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
connector on it actually I believe this

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.630 
connector on it actually I believe this
is<00:03:29.019> for<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:31.080> cable<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.319> runs<00:03:32.349> in<00:03:32.890> behind<00:03:33.459> the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
is for a cable that runs in behind the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.140 
is for a cable that runs in behind the
LCD<00:03:34.480> up<00:03:35.260> towards<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.620> front<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.950> phone

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.009 

and<00:03:40.150> sometimes<00:03:40.480> these<00:03:40.569> little<00:03:40.630> antenna

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
and sometimes these little antenna

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.539 
and sometimes these little antenna
cables<00:03:41.410> can<00:03:41.530> be<00:03:41.560> difficult<00:03:42.099> you<00:03:42.160> may<00:03:42.280> want<00:03:42.519> to

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
cables can be difficult you may want to

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.890 
cables can be difficult you may want to
use<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.700> small<00:03:43.180> pry<00:03:43.420> tool<00:03:43.660> you<00:03:43.750> can<00:03:43.840> use

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
use a small pry tool you can use

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.690 
use a small pry tool you can use
something<00:03:44.140> like<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.319> toothpick<00:03:44.859> we<00:03:45.519> have<00:03:45.640> a

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
something like a toothpick we have a

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.340 
something like a toothpick we have a
sharper<00:03:46.060> nylon<00:03:46.450> tool<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.810> might<00:03:46.930> be<00:03:47.019> easier

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
sharper nylon tool it might be easier

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.310 
sharper nylon tool it might be easier
just<00:03:47.440> be<00:03:47.590> careful<00:03:47.829> not<00:03:47.859> to<00:03:47.950> damage<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
little bit tricky to get off you don't

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.890 
little bit tricky to get off you don't
wanna<00:03:57.190> bend<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.790> does<00:03:57.940> flex<00:03:58.329> just<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.600> little

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
rip it it's kind of pull it back so

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.110 
rip it it's kind of pull it back so

you'll<00:06:01.840> see<00:06:01.930> there's<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.170> little<00:06:02.380> kind<00:06:02.560> of<00:06:02.590> a

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
you'll see there's a little kind of a

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.440 
you'll see there's a little kind of a

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
the inside of the board so you can't put

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.410 
the inside of the board so you can't put
it<00:06:06.700> on<00:06:06.790> the<00:06:07.360> wrong<00:06:07.570> way<00:06:11.880> now<00:06:12.880> this<00:06:13.090> point<00:06:13.270> you

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.420 
it on the wrong way now this point you

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.760 
it on the wrong way now this point you
could<00:06:13.510> go<00:06:13.630> ahead<00:06:13.750> and<00:06:13.870> remove<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.320> display<00:06:14.650> if

could go ahead and remove the display if

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.380 
could go ahead and remove the display if
