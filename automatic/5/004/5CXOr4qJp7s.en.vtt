00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.099 

Einstein<00:00:18.289> said<00:00:18.830> that<00:00:19.420> essentially<00:00:20.420> for

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
Einstein said that essentially for

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.050 
Einstein said that essentially for
something<00:00:21.590> to<00:00:21.770> exist<00:00:22.220> that<00:00:22.460> must<00:00:22.670> be<00:00:22.850> moving

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
something to exist that must be moving

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.810 
something to exist that must be moving
so<00:00:23.810> every<00:00:24.439> single<00:00:24.710> thing<00:00:24.919> in<00:00:25.220> this<00:00:25.369> universe

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
so every single thing in this universe

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.089 
so every single thing in this universe
is<00:00:26.060> moving<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.929> interesting<00:00:27.349> thing<00:00:27.619> is<00:00:27.829> that

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
is moving the interesting thing is that

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.509 
is moving the interesting thing is that
all<00:00:28.939> of<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:29.449> movement<00:00:30.050> in<00:00:30.320> nature<00:00:30.919> has<00:00:31.490> a

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
all of that movement in nature has a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.270 
all of that movement in nature has a
particular<00:00:32.110> spiraling<00:00:33.110> path<00:00:33.350> nature<00:00:33.980> never

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
particular spiraling path nature never

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.130 
particular spiraling path nature never
ever<00:00:34.520> moves<00:00:34.820> in<00:00:34.970> a<00:00:35.060> straight<00:00:35.300> line<00:00:35.329> no<00:00:35.900> such

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
ever moves in a straight line no such

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.610 
ever moves in a straight line no such
thing

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
thing

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.160 
thing
so<00:00:36.950> that<00:00:37.190> is<00:00:37.460> nature's<00:00:38.030> streamline<00:00:38.510> principle

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
so that is nature's streamline principle

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.979 
so that is nature's streamline principle
when<00:00:39.710> I<00:00:39.739> froze<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.940> Whirlpool<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:41.719> you<00:00:41.809> see

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
when I froze the Whirlpool that you see

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.750 
when I froze the Whirlpool that you see
in<00:00:42.140> your<00:00:42.260> bathtub<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:42.829> pull<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.100> plug<00:00:43.309> out

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
in your bathtub you pull the plug out

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.299 
in your bathtub you pull the plug out
there's<00:00:44.359> the<00:00:44.539> whirlpool<00:00:45.020> if<00:00:45.500> you<00:00:45.680> freeze<00:00:46.070> that

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
there's the whirlpool if you freeze that

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.360 
there's the whirlpool if you freeze that
whirlpool<00:00:46.629> it's<00:00:47.629> exactly<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.379> same<00:00:48.620> geometry

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
whirlpool it's exactly the same geometry

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.410 
whirlpool it's exactly the same geometry
as<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.660> hurricane<00:00:51.230> or<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.530> tornado<00:00:52.070> or<00:00:53.059> any<00:00:53.210> other

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
as a hurricane or a tornado or any other

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.689 
as a hurricane or a tornado or any other
spiral<00:00:53.929> or<00:00:54.079> cochlear<00:00:54.590> of<00:00:54.679> your<00:00:54.859> ear<00:00:55.100> this

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
spiral or cochlear of your ear this

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.910 
spiral or cochlear of your ear this
shape<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.210> archetypal<00:00:56.840> in<00:00:56.960> nature<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.710> so

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
shape is archetypal in nature and so

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.279 
shape is archetypal in nature and so
when<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.370> froze<00:00:58.789> this<00:00:59.120> I<00:00:59.390> was<00:00:59.780> then<00:00:59.960> able<00:01:00.109> to

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
when I froze this I was then able to

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.490 
when I froze this I was then able to
rotate<00:01:00.949> it<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.280> create<00:01:02.269> because<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.350> had<00:01:03.440> a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
rotate it and create because I had a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.350 
rotate it and create because I had a
frozen<00:01:03.739> whirlpool<00:01:04.370> I<00:01:04.550> was<00:01:04.699> able<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.970> create<00:01:05.239> a

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
frozen whirlpool I was able to create a

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.750 
frozen whirlpool I was able to create a
whirlpool<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.380> one<00:01:07.070> of<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.250> first<00:01:07.520> things

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
whirlpool so one of the first things

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.300 
whirlpool so one of the first things
that<00:01:07.910> I<00:01:08.060> used<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:08.750> on<00:01:09.100> particularly<00:01:10.100> in

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
that I used it on particularly in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.190 
that I used it on particularly in
America<00:01:10.520> there<00:01:11.000> are<00:01:11.120> great<00:01:11.659> big<00:01:11.810> holding

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
America there are great big holding

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.730 
America there are great big holding
tanks<00:01:12.680> well<00:01:13.400> that<00:01:13.520> water<00:01:13.790> gets<00:01:14.030> stagnant<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
tanks well that water gets stagnant the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.260 
tanks well that water gets stagnant the
municipalities<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.700> manage<00:01:16.970> that<00:01:17.119> water

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
municipalities that manage that water

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.450 
municipalities that manage that water
have<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.659> put<00:01:17.810> chlorine<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.650> chloramines

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
have to put chlorine and chloramines

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.649 
have to put chlorine and chloramines
into<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.150> water

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
into the water

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.319 
into the water
the<00:01:21.110> problem<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.680> better<00:01:22.040> solved<00:01:22.610> by<00:01:23.030> mixing

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
the problem is better solved by mixing

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.210 
the problem is better solved by mixing
that<00:01:23.659> water<00:01:23.899> generally<00:01:24.799> throughout<00:01:25.040> the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
that water generally throughout the

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.889 
that water generally throughout the
world<00:01:25.399> if<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.579> want<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.759> mix<00:01:25.939> water<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:26.509> very

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
world if you want to mix water it's very

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.840 
world if you want to mix water it's very
expensive<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.649> put<00:01:28.250> one<00:01:28.399> of<00:01:28.490> these<00:01:28.549> frozen

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
expensive I put one of these frozen

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.730 
expensive I put one of these frozen
whirlpools<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.930> bottom<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.320> one<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.590> these

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
whirlpools in the bottom of one of these

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.030 
whirlpools in the bottom of one of these
tanks<00:01:31.119> 6<00:01:32.119> inches<00:01:32.420> high<00:01:32.479> 4<00:01:32.930> inches<00:01:33.170> wide<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.680> I

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
tanks 6 inches high 4 inches wide and I

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.740 
tanks 6 inches high 4 inches wide and I
rotated<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:34.820> with<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.119> couple<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.630> hundred

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
rotated it with a couple of hundred

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.539 
rotated it with a couple of hundred
watts<00:01:36.079> of<00:01:36.200> power<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.710> couple<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.100> light<00:01:37.250> bulbs

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
watts of power a couple of light bulbs

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.760 
watts of power a couple of light bulbs
of<00:01:37.700> power<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.570> found<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:38.990> was<00:01:39.079> able<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.530> mix

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
of power and I found it was able to mix

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.039 
of power and I found it was able to mix
an<00:01:40.009> entire<00:01:40.430> tank<00:01:40.939> of<00:01:41.090> water<00:01:41.299> 10<00:01:41.630> million

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
an entire tank of water 10 million

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.260 
an entire tank of water 10 million
gallons<00:01:42.380> which<00:01:42.890> from<00:01:43.460> an<00:01:43.579> engineering<00:01:44.000> point

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
gallons which from an engineering point

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.230 
gallons which from an engineering point
of<00:01:44.390> view<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.840> not<00:01:45.290> even<00:01:46.040> conceivably<00:01:46.640> possible

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
of view is not even conceivably possible

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.810 
of view is not even conceivably possible
so<00:01:47.780> from<00:01:48.079> there<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.560> started<00:01:49.040> adapting<00:01:49.670> these

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
so from there I started adapting these

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.380 
so from there I started adapting these
shapes<00:01:50.149> into<00:01:50.630> fans<00:01:51.130> fans<00:01:52.130> use<00:01:52.399> 18%<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.299> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
shapes into fans fans use 18% of the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.819 
shapes into fans fans use 18% of the
world's<00:01:53.420> electrical<00:01:54.140> energy<00:01:54.500> they're<00:01:54.680> not

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
world's electrical energy they're not

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.190 
world's electrical energy they're not
terribly<00:01:55.159> efficient<00:01:55.700> we<00:01:56.360> found<00:01:56.630> time<00:01:56.990> and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
terribly efficient we found time and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.899 
terribly efficient we found time and
time<00:01:57.320> again<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:57.829> could<00:01:57.979> take<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.250> best<00:01:58.460> fan<00:01:58.729> in

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
time again we could take the best fan in

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.779 
time again we could take the best fan in
the<00:01:59.000> world<00:01:59.210> and<00:01:59.539> reduce<00:01:59.899> its<00:02:00.110> energy<00:02:00.340> by<00:02:01.340> as

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
the world and reduce its energy by as

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.359 
the world and reduce its energy by as
much<00:02:02.090> as<00:02:02.149> 30%<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.350> pretty<00:02:03.590> much<00:02:03.710> everything<00:02:04.250> in

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
much as 30% so pretty much everything in

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.550 
much as 30% so pretty much everything in
an<00:02:04.490> industrial<00:02:05.149> world<00:02:05.420> can<00:02:05.840> be<00:02:05.990> improved<00:02:06.409> by

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
an industrial world can be improved by

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.359 
an industrial world can be improved by
taking<00:02:07.549> these<00:02:07.729> shapes<00:02:08.000> from<00:02:08.149> nature<00:02:08.570> and

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
taking these shapes from nature and

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.380 
taking these shapes from nature and
reconfiguring<00:02:10.420> what<00:02:11.420> engineers<00:02:11.960> build<00:02:12.200> today
