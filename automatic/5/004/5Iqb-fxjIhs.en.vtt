00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.940

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.509
 So now we'll show you like you 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.240
 as before twelve that actually whole or 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.189
 so what a pc costs but he gets that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.289
 Chaos prevails in the link 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.980
 description stands the park bay point 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.400
 is it xms affected by it on his 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.740
 page 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:38.550
 that looks the same to you and then 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:42.750
 looking for pirates you write a lot and day 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:48.530
 The mirror here could do that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:53.030
 then you pirates low on it 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:06.360
 then there are too many things com 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:12.200
 then go and go to page 3 and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.880
 then somewhere a bit and a bit there 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.220
 a bit down but not so much 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.220
 but it still works 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:32.310
 So here then stands for 14 17 then bent 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.150
 He did it before you did that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.670
 was paid here 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.000
 in the handle description is the left 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.040
 motors what do you need for the game? 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.759
 Also, if you have that, then so have 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.759
 may the gate 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.350
 now the rotors in there you can do it 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.170
 somewhere else a gate 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.540
 but I do it rather downloads her 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.990
 through the village 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:09.260
 So now we'll be right back 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:13.610
 After the dollar we are back so 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:17.840
 jesus fifa 2012 finished and you push 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.760
 here on the case and the package 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.830
 installation 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.910
 but if that was not you, come out 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.060
 does not matter what comes out was with it comes 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.640
 Everyone was always out, he pressed 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.030
 I have only once 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.180
 but because she's so if you have so much 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.390
 paint does not do it but it's easy 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.870
 and not install then ok and 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:51.740
 open further and then open 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.490
 believe that the game will show then 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.490

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.299

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:22.480
 who over here so 12 people it works 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:26.750
 but that was it but us 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.849

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.489
