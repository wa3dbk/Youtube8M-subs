00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.309
 let's say red and the perfume of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.280
 fruit in the air at harvest time apples 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.620
 in fact, apples that worked in mines 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 general principles for the proper 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.590
 fruit, the ideal climate is the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.020
 cold cultivars have adapted the climate 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.210
 some regions of the state are having 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.420
 success is estimated to be 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.880
 produced this year more than 4500 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.640
 tons of fruit more than the year 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.320
 past when 4,000 were harvested and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.989
 300 tons as reported and mater minas 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 currently, on average, 200 hectares 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.879
 planted among them the three hectares of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.910
 baião in ax in the south of minas one of the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.550
 producing regions of apple in the state 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.590
 baron and fruit grower for 25 years and there 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.079
 five grown apple 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.660
 this year he expects to welcome 60 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.120
 tons and sales are to the south of 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.280
 minas são paulo and campinas in the interior 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.019
 from the state of São Paulo 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.840
 he says that one of the challenges of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.110
 producer is the marketing of the fruit 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.570
 workforce requiring specialization 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 is increasingly scarce 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.590
 the difficulty is a little updating 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 In an instant, the consumer market. 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.630
 the major centers in these 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.430
 have difficulty with your hand too 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.380
 because in floriculture the people 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.150
 needs more skilled labor. 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.780
 specialized care harvest themes 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.920
 doors in this two winter and summer cesspools 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.000
 is more than a tip in general is a 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.240
 hard work 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 20-year-old luan works in tillage 2 and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.280
 said that work is not difficult just 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.950
 more complicated to work when it rains 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.649
 but says that after working 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.899
 Do you get used to it when you look at it? 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.149
 I started learning everything right but 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.619
 after you got the hang of society no 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.810
 It's okay, it's not easy at the time. 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.849
 harvesting it is crucial that the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.360
 worker be careful not to 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.690
 and to the moon is so easy that 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.870
 is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.090
 I'm teaching me how to harvest the fruit. 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.000
 harvesting apple is very simple just to observe 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.810
 whether it is arriving or at the point of 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 harvest 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.210
 The correct thing is for you to open your hands and 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.100
 fruit does not pluck and in the corridor you 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.410
 should not play 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.390
 If you have friction between the fruits they will 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.540
 become soiled and so they lose 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.120
 market value of the plantation for the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.340
 different treatment of the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.840
 neighborhood shack only has women in the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.930
 caring for apples 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.240
 his wife is responsible for 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.760
 work and explains how the 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.330
 cleaning and selection of fruits with 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.840
 fruits arrive here is sorted there in the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.450
 The treadmill passes through the polishing 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.240
 one on your your the corners of 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.780
 separating by size and the girls will 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.010
 catching defective and placing 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.890
 the others in the box 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.150
 although it is he who still said that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.280
 this work is done by women 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.160
 because they believe they are more 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.130
 careful and more attentive to the quality of 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.500
 fruit an apple that also generates income 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.660
 to the city renata one of the twelve 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.640
 employees of the shed and tells the 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.489
 importance of the fruit in the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.040
 family job that takes the income to 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.950
 It 's good for me to support the family, huh? 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.840
 so not your brother who is a year old 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.360
 The whole thing that we can come to work on 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.410
 here even if it was not here we have 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.410
 to go out and work somewhere else
