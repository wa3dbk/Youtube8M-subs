00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello people i am a marcel and i 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.940
 show you today in four weeks 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.050
 create per hear, first start 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.410
 First of all you have to look that we 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.509
 Have the right posture look 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.560
 that the head is focused on it 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.199
 looks up and the upper body too 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.619
 is straight and no longer bent in front 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.119
 as shown here this is wrong 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.170
 Head should not be all the time 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:39.149
 looking at the ground really looks 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:41.960
 that he is beautiful on the right here 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.559
 is the task for the basis 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.420
 the running one puts you that way 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.489
 He begins to follow the front foot 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.120
 pulls down 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.120
 as shown here 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.930
 and at the same time you have the back 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.680
 raise foot and at the same height 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.060
 bring front shot to the back of you 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.440
 tried the back to the front 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.440
 to do that in one movement 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:31.340
 then we put the foot in the air 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:35.770
 is forward and at the same time the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.729
 pull another foot backwards 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.060
 try it again in one 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:46.070
 to make a move 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:49.369
 then you have the frame through here 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.080
 again shown really tried 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.530
 slowly learn this step 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.009
 That is the most important step in the process 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.009
 create 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.650
 then the same with the others only 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.650
 rivers 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.599
 tries very slowly at the beginning 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.260
 and if you feel safe you can 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:27.819
 faster now a variation 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.000
 the rheins eight movements all 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.739
 just look at the foot from 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.099
 down that puts him with the heel 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.099
 raises 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.490
 so bring a bit more variation in 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.490
 your standard needs 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.550
 then try the mine running one 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:12.200
 with the running man with verses too 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:16.940
 combine then try the running 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.560
 more upside down so do the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.220
 reverse browning and even more variation 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.220
 bring in 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:51.760
 just do the same movements 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:54.550
 then tries in the other direction 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.470
 all three now learned things 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.160
 So connect the reverse moment like 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:09.640
 normal 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:13.680
 with the help then I'll show you 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.680
 here the shuffle stop 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.350
 it does the foot when it's up in the air 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.590
 is not only front but back in 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.210
 the air back up in the air 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.200
 she then returns with the normal running 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.200
 one carries on 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.340
 so if you want to become a pro you have to 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.710
 Of course, train 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.620
 I have the training plan now 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.330
 written together for a week 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.140
 let's start on monday 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.530
 Nine for thirty minutes 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.760
 So these are the minimum requirements 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.640
 Of course you can do much more 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:23.500
 you will do a lot better 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:26.260
 faster then on Tuesday we have then 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.110
 20 minutes you can rest in ten minutes 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.840
 assume Wednesday is now ten 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.480
 minutes rang 95 minutes here taking among others 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.720
 and ten minutes of reverse warnings 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:44.370
 then it was 25 minutes on thursday 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:47.500
 because then ran to the hit running mate in 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.990
 mixed race that means we 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.890
 Just create 25 minutes and mixes 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.700
 to collect the three species 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:01.480
 on friday then took 20 minutes 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.730
 with running and stop installed and 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.750
 repeated five minutes the reverse one 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.070
 combined it again on saturday 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.950
 All the things I have in the video 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.490
 showed and now has 30 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.919
 minutes 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.180
 on sunday should then the second part 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:21.280
 come and look at it and then 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.810
 So he gets the next news from me 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.330
 Until next time 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.140
 Have fun practicing and in four weeks 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.140
 since then pro
