00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.880
 a new ten people dawns over the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.279
 thickets of the miocene africa the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.830
 global cooling is doing the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.900
 cooler weather conditions and 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.699
 dry is where millions of years ago 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.360
 There were forests inside 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.640
 now there are rainy plains bushes and 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.260
 pastures cover the earth creating huge 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.260
 Grasslands for the Serbs 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.420
 but here in what is now kenya yet 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 there are forests and swampy areas that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.950
 they come and go with the seasons 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.520
 this is the rainy season and the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.460
 wetland is full of life 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.550
 you may expect to see google 2 or even 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.770
 hippos 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.280
 but these are only giving their first 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.280
 evolutionary steps 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.190
 instead we have this strange 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.190
 creature 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.380
 it seems the unfortunate son of a 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.290
 elephant and unnim a we ride with your 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.330
 short trumpet flattened tusks and what 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.870
 that looks like a shovel coming out of its 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.870
 lower jaw 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.760
 short tips sturdy body and a 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.280
 great appetite make a unique creature 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.590
 the mud tea the noble 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.350
 creative the add-on is part of a 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.990
 family called the contents a group 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.110
 of animals distributed globally very 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.119
 common during this period his relatives 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.119
 the closest living are the elephants 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.790
 they live in small herds of about 6 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.620
 or 7 individuals spends much of their 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.670
 time resting in the muddy waters 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.670
 of the marshlands 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.940
 the rainy season is good occasion 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.830
 to care for the offspring as there 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.010
 abundant food at the bottom of our 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.010
 streets 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.819
 the soil rich in nutrients is perfect 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.090
 for algae that are soft and easy 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.090
 to digest 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.739
 use your dead jaw to a shovel 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.069
 to cut the soft trunks of the 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.579
 algae 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.579
 ah 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.030
 adults also complements their 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.010
 diet by cutting the bark of trees 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.950
 using his jaw like an ax or 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.790
 a strategy that they use during the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.790
 dry season 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.239
 but just as there are peaceful 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.260
 herbivores and carnivores and as companies 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:00.069
 there are predators 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.680
 this is to see giant croaker or a 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.390
 ancestor of hyenas the size of a 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.610
 Lion 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.410
 with a big head with powerful 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.360
 jaws filled with teeth 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.260
 Lammergeier is an impressive 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.260
 predator 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.830
 they live and they marry in small factories 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.060
 and can knock down larger animals 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.390
 that they 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.400
 this time they are lucky with 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.620
 relative to where it has been separated from 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.420
 rest of the herd feeding on 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.940
 some succulent bushes 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.480
 stalking the company 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.480
 and so 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.490
 no no 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.520
 normal 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.240
 the action ends together with the life of the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.240
 mud saucer 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.560
 Y 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.019
 and
