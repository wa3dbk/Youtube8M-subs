00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.799 
descended into Jupiter's atmosphere
specifically<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.399> hot<00:00:38.790> spot<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> this

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
specifically at a hot spot and this

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
specifically at a hot spot and this
