another interesting trick if you know
about<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> cross-bite<00:00:57.840> eatle<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.640> beam

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
about the cross-bite eatle on the beam

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.920 
about the cross-bite eatle on the beam
on<00:01:00.000> cross<00:01:00.239> by<00:01:00.420> es<00:01:00.899> series<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:02.129> know<00:01:02.250> about

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
on cross by es series you know about

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
on cross by es series you know about
sonic<00:01:03.930> device<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:09.650> little<00:01:10.650> trick<00:01:10.890> i<00:01:11.010> found

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
sonic device now little trick i found

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179 
sonic device now little trick i found
out<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.170> basically<00:01:13.380> turn<00:01:13.830> him<00:01:14.040> into

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
out you can basically turn him into

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
out you can basically turn him into
sonic<00:01:14.580> device<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.150> he<00:01:15.270> has<00:01:15.390> these<00:01:15.540> little

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
sonic device because he has these little

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.710 
sonic device because he has these little
cavities<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.939> that<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.420> put

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
cavities in here that you can put

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.760 
cavities in here that you can put
marbles<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:24.020> now<00:01:25.020> he's<00:01:25.619> quite<00:01:26.070> easily<00:01:26.400> sliding

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
marbles in now he's quite easily sliding

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.170 
marbles in now he's quite easily sliding
it's<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.920> neat<00:01:29.159> little<00:01:29.189> trick<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:30.000> thought

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
it's a neat little trick just thought

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.429 
it's a neat little trick just thought
I'd<00:01:30.299> show<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.939> a<00:01:32.939> new<00:01:33.570> problem<00:01:34.079> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
I'd show you that and a new problem I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.219 
I'd show you that and a new problem I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
found out about this guy is that when

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.950 
found out about this guy is that when

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
shooting in like an arena if you have

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.630 
shooting in like an arena if you have
max<00:01:43.259> power<00:01:43.619> I'm<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:43.979> sure<00:01:44.130> it'll<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
max power I'm not sure it'll do it this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.399 
max power I'm not sure it'll do it this
time<00:01:45.110> no<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> actually<00:01:46.380> hit<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:48.710> an<00:01:49.710> arena

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
time no I actually hit but in an arena

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.249 
time no I actually hit but in an arena
sometimes<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.509> gamma<00:01:54.750> will<00:01:55.380> jump<00:01:55.770> over

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
sometimes the be gamma will jump over

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.770 
sometimes the be gamma will jump over
the<00:01:58.259> target<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
the target so that's just the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.020 
the target so that's just the
interesting<00:02:03.780> thing<00:02:06.860> another<00:02:07.860> thing<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.369> don't

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
interesting thing another thing is don't

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.350

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
squeeze too hard I do and I replaced his

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.780 
squeeze too hard I do and I replaced his

don't always have to have Super Max

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.860 
don't always have to have Super Max
power<00:02:40.950> even<00:02:41.640> though<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.940> powerful
