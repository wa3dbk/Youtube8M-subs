00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
when I was like looking at it

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.269 
when I was like looking at it
I<00:00:16.320> noticed<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.250> only<00:00:17.369> has<00:00:17.640> four<00:00:18.560> colors<00:00:19.970> it<00:00:20.970> has

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
I noticed it only has four colors it has

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:31.519 
I noticed it only has four colors it has
white<00:00:23.279> green<00:00:24.680> like<00:00:25.680> bronze<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:28.580> red<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
white green like bronze and red so so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.459 
white green like bronze and red so so
the<00:00:32.250> red<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.570> all<00:00:33.570> around<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> back<00:00:34.230> line

the red is all around the back line

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.860 
the red is all around the back line
because<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> basic<00:00:35.670> color<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
because it's like the basic color the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.510 
because it's like the basic color the
original<00:00:37.260> color<00:00:37.730> bronze<00:00:38.730> appears<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:40.219> most<00:00:41.219> of

his<00:00:41.640> head<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.300> teeth<00:00:42.860> back<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.280> shell

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
his head in teeth back up the shell

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.290 
his head in teeth back up the shell
first<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> body<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.070> green<00:00:47.309> abuse<00:00:47.640> its

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I think is like really cool because it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
I think is like really cool because it
was<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> really<00:00:56.910> empty<00:00:57.270> without<00:00:58.230> that

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
was like a really empty without that

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
was like a really empty without that
color<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.949> those<00:01:01.949> visual<00:01:02.309> things<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
color so those visual things about it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.929 
color so those visual things about it
