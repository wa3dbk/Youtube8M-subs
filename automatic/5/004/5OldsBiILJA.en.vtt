as far as all of the stuff up for trade

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.290 
as far as all of the stuff up for trade
got<00:04:45.819> quite<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.120> bit<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:48.759> I<00:04:48.789> just<00:04:48.910> kind<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.120> run

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
got quite a bit so I just kind of run

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.330 
got quite a bit so I just kind of run
through<00:04:49.330> them<00:04:49.660> real<00:04:49.870> quick<00:04:50.080> well<00:04:50.949> necessary

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
through them real quick well necessary

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.469 
through them real quick well necessary
to<00:04:51.400> say<00:04:51.490> their<00:04:51.639> names<00:04:51.819> because<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.120> don't<00:04:52.300> have

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
to say their names because I don't have

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.879 
to say their names because I don't have
them<00:04:52.660> sort<00:04:52.960> it<00:04:53.050> out<00:04:53.169> so<00:04:53.440> there's<00:04:53.620> going<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.830> be

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
them sort it out so there's going to be

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.969 
them sort it out so there's going to be
some<00:04:54.099> duplicates<00:04:54.490> in<00:04:54.699> here<00:04:55.830> but<00:04:56.830> yeah

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
some duplicates in here but yeah

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.270 
some duplicates in here but yeah
essentially<00:04:57.490> we've<00:04:57.610> got<00:04:57.819> just<00:04:58.240> about<00:04:58.419> one<00:04:58.930> of

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
essentially we've got just about one of

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.550 
essentially we've got just about one of
every<00:05:00.280> rare<00:05:00.819> I<00:05:01.270> think<00:05:01.720> except<00:05:01.990> for<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:02.289> manda

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
every rare I think except for the manda

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.610 
every rare I think except for the manda
bus<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.490> chin<00:05:04.270> chino<00:05:04.569> those<00:05:05.319> really

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
bus and the chin chino those really

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.140 
bus and the chin chino those really
hoping<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:05.949> pull<00:05:06.130> some<00:05:06.310> duplicates<00:05:06.759> of<00:05:06.940> those

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
hoping to pull some duplicates of those

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.510 
hoping to pull some duplicates of those
instead<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:07.990> quite<00:05:08.770> a<00:05:08.800> few<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:09.009> the<00:05:09.130> duplicates

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
instead of quite a few of the duplicates

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.990 
instead of quite a few of the duplicates
that<00:05:09.580> have<00:05:09.729> gotten<00:05:09.849> in<00:05:10.090> here<00:05:10.500> um<00:05:11.849> but<00:05:12.849> that's

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
that have gotten in here um but that's

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.700 
that have gotten in here um but that's
okay<00:05:13.889> so<00:05:14.889> quite<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> few<00:05:15.490> non<00:05:15.639> hollow<00:05:15.880> rares<00:05:19.710> um

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
okay so quite a few non hollow rares um

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.629 
okay so quite a few non hollow rares um
and<00:05:21.039> then<00:05:21.789> these<00:05:22.659> are<00:05:22.960> all<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.259> reverses<00:05:23.740> so

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.629 

snippy<00:05:27.639> I<00:05:27.970> might<00:05:28.659> hang<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.229> just<00:05:30.159> because

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
snippy I might hang on to just because

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.260 
snippy I might hang on to just because
of<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.630> superior<00:05:32.320> line<00:05:32.729> in<00:05:33.729> case<00:05:33.880> i<00:05:34.000> want<00:05:34.150> it

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
of the superior line in case i want it

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.120 
of the superior line in case i want it
all<00:05:34.360> nice<00:05:34.630> and<00:05:34.840> rubbed<00:05:34.960> out<00:05:35.110> but<00:05:35.440> again<00:05:35.919> this

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
all nice and rubbed out but again this

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.770 
all nice and rubbed out but again this
is<00:05:36.190> that's<00:05:36.580> kind<00:05:36.759> of<00:05:36.789> one<00:05:36.969> that<00:05:37.150> if<00:05:37.270> you<00:05:37.479> really

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780

addition so that leaves me with this is

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.180 
addition so that leaves me with this is

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
the ability so I'm hoping that's going

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.060 
the ability so I'm hoping that's going
to<00:07:20.730> be<00:07:20.820> easy<00:07:20.970> to<00:07:21.120> trade<00:07:21.300> for<00:07:21.530> number<00:07:22.530> 32

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070 
to be easy to trade for number 32

samurott number 54 scolipede oh and the
samurai<00:07:26.820> I<00:07:27.030> believe<00:07:27.300> is<00:07:27.450> the<00:07:27.750> ability<00:07:27.960> one

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.350 
samurai I believe is the ability one

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.620 
samurai I believe is the ability one
sadly<00:07:29.250> and<00:07:29.460> the<00:07:30.450> chin<00:07:30.630> Chino<00:07:30.840> um<00:07:32.630> yeah

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.630 
sadly and the chin Chino um yeah

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.230 
sadly and the chin Chino um yeah
probably<00:07:34.140> if<00:07:34.980> you<00:07:35.130> have<00:07:35.280> the<00:07:35.460> chin<00:07:35.669> Chino<00:07:36.000> I'll

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
probably if you have the chin Chino I'll

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.470 
probably if you have the chin Chino I'll
probably<00:07:36.600> trade<00:07:37.050> a<00:07:38.000> little<00:07:39.000> more<00:07:39.180> than<00:07:39.330> it's

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.480 
probably trade a little more than it's

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.680 
probably trade a little more than it's
worth<00:07:39.570> um<00:07:40.490> just<00:07:41.490> because<00:07:41.760> I<00:07:41.850> i<00:07:42.180> don't<00:07:42.600> know<00:07:42.660> i

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690 
worth um just because I i don't know i

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.020 
worth um just because I i don't know i
think<00:07:42.870> this<00:07:43.140> is<00:07:43.200> it<00:07:43.710> has<00:07:44.220> the<00:07:44.370> potential<00:07:44.700> to<00:07:44.880> be

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.030 
think this is it has the potential to be

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.850 
think this is it has the potential to be

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.380 
a really good deck and i want to go
ahead<00:07:46.979> and<00:07:47.190> get<00:07:47.280> it<00:07:47.430> and<00:07:47.820> put<00:07:48.120> it<00:07:48.150> in<00:07:48.300> my

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.390 
ahead and get it and put it in my

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.330 
ahead and get it and put it in my
collection<00:07:48.710> before<00:07:49.710> it<00:07:50.010> gets<00:07:50.160> to<00:07:50.310> be
