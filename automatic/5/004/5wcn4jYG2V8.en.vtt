00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.980 
in a split second and I went to stand up
I<00:02:04.750> realized<00:02:05.290> my<00:02:05.440> right<00:02:05.800> leg<00:02:06.010> no<00:02:06.280> longer<00:02:06.610> worked

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.620 
and so I laid there in my lane and
thought<00:02:10.420> well<00:02:10.630> okay<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:12.580> road<00:02:12.940> here<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.360> don't
