stomach area in this example we did a

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.190 
stomach area in this example we did a
similar<00:02:14.319> thing<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:16.420> waist<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.830> tightened

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
surgically by suturing the muscles

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.199 
surgically by suturing the muscles
together<00:02:22.830> creating<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.920> much<00:02:24.160> more<00:02:24.640> narrow

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
