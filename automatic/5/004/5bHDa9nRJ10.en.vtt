00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
use a UV lamp which is a bigger version

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.780 
use a UV lamp which is a bigger version

now<00:02:39.080> I'll<00:02:39.319> block<00:02:39.590> sand<00:02:39.980> my<00:02:40.160> primer<00:02:40.519> with<00:02:40.760> 320

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
now I'll block sand my primer with 320

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:51.880 
now I'll block sand my primer with 320
to<00:02:41.480> level<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.870> out<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.080> little<00:02:42.410> bit<00:02:42.500> better

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.110 

next<00:02:52.890> I'll<00:02:53.010> need<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.160> finer<00:02:53.430> sandpaper<00:02:53.849> to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
next I'll need a finer sandpaper to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.630 
next I'll need a finer sandpaper to
finish<00:02:54.420> my<00:02:54.599> primer<00:02:55.050> off<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:55.620> I'll<00:02:55.830> go<00:02:56.220> over<00:02:56.519> it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
finish my primer off so I'll go over it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.270 
finish my primer off so I'll go over it
now<00:02:56.670> with<00:02:57.030> some<00:02:57.239> 600<00:02:57.840> grit<00:02:58.019> paper<00:02:58.230> over<00:02:59.040> the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.270 
repair and a little bit beyond the last
thing<00:03:06.959> I'll<00:03:07.140> need<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.530> do<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.890> stand<00:03:08.160> my

I<00:03:26.010> much<00:03:26.250> prefer<00:03:26.280> doing<00:03:26.849> this<00:03:27.090> wet<00:03:27.329> as<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.569> will

I much prefer doing this wet as it will

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.039

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
cut weight a bit better

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.270

now<00:03:47.519> we'll<00:03:47.700> mask<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.060> up<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.239> little<00:03:48.329> bit<00:03:48.540> better

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.479 

so<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.290> paint<00:03:57.500> I'm<00:03:57.650> going<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:57.980> be<00:03:58.069> using<00:03:58.400> is

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
so the paint I'm going to be using is

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.860 
so the paint I'm going to be using is
actually<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.060> same<00:03:59.269> stuff<00:03:59.599> I've<00:03:59.840> been

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
actually the same stuff I've been

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.690 
actually the same stuff I've been
spraying<00:04:00.409> chrome<00:04:00.769> acts<00:04:00.980> for<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> waterborne

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.069 

I'll<00:04:15.190> apply<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:15.519> in<00:04:15.819> two<00:04:16.090> coats<00:04:16.449> similar<00:04:16.870> to

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
I'll apply it in two coats similar to

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.780 
I'll apply it in two coats similar to

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
on my second coat I'm going to apply one

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.129 
on my second coat I'm going to apply one
coat<00:04:36.340> wet<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:36.879> then<00:04:37.000> pull<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.330> back<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.719> dust

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:53.959 

the<00:04:52.979> blood<00:04:53.159> actually<00:04:53.279> turned<00:04:53.610> out<00:04:53.759> really

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
the blood actually turned out really

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.639 
the blood actually turned out really
well<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.539> this<00:04:55.050> is<00:04:55.229> somewhat<00:04:55.499> of<00:04:55.529> a

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:55.649 
well and this is somewhat of a

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.259 
well and this is somewhat of a
challenging<00:04:56.099> color<00:04:56.279> so<00:04:56.459> I<00:04:56.489> got<00:04:56.639> to<00:04:56.759> say<00:04:56.939> I'm<00:04:57.209> a

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:57.269 
challenging color so I got to say I'm a

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:59.389 
challenging color so I got to say I'm a
little<00:04:57.599> bit<00:04:57.809> impressed<00:04:58.259> on<00:04:58.679> how<00:04:58.889> easy<00:04:59.099> this

00:04:59.389 --> 00:04:59.399 
little bit impressed on how easy this

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.969 
little bit impressed on how easy this
was<00:04:59.459> to<00:04:59.729> accomplish<00:04:59.999> with<00:05:00.269> an<00:05:00.360> aerosol<00:05:00.979> the

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
was to accomplish with an aerosol the

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.350 
was to accomplish with an aerosol the
next<00:05:02.189> thing<00:05:02.339> we'll<00:05:02.459> do<00:05:02.639> now<00:05:02.819> is<00:05:03.029> apply<00:05:03.149> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
next thing we'll do now is apply the

next thing we'll do now is apply the
clear<00:05:03.719> coat<00:05:03.959> now<00:05:04.169> this<00:05:04.379> clear<00:05:04.709> coating<00:05:05.009> can<00:05:05.219> as

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:05.429 
clear coat now this clear coating can as

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:08.059 
clear coat now this clear coating can as
special<00:05:05.879> as<00:05:06.029> it<00:05:06.179> has<00:05:06.360> an<00:05:06.659> activator<00:05:07.529> button

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
special as it has an activator button

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.919 
special as it has an activator button
and<00:05:08.279> what<00:05:08.789> this<00:05:08.969> does<00:05:09.179> is<00:05:09.419> mix<00:05:09.659> as<00:05:09.779> you're

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:09.929 
and what this does is mix as you're

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:12.409 
and what this does is mix as you're
harder<00:05:10.319> and<00:05:10.529> clearer<00:05:10.949> inside<00:05:11.699> the<00:05:11.849> can<00:05:12.089> and

your clear coat blended area is what

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.820 
your clear coat blended area is what
likely<00:06:28.689> feel<00:06:28.990> a<00:06:29.020> little<00:06:29.379> bit<00:06:29.560> gritty

originally<00:06:30.599> now<00:06:31.599> this<00:06:31.750> would<00:06:31.900> ideally<00:06:32.259> also

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
originally now this would ideally also

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.589 
originally now this would ideally also
be<00:06:32.919> best<00:06:33.250> done<00:06:33.490> by<00:06:33.550> sanding<00:06:34.300> and<00:06:34.419> polishing

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
be best done by sanding and polishing

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.570 
be best done by sanding and polishing
with<00:06:34.990> a<00:06:35.020> machine<00:06:35.349> polisher<00:06:35.530> but<00:06:36.099> for<00:06:36.280> the<00:06:36.370> sake

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
with a machine polisher but for the sake

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.879 
with a machine polisher but for the sake
of<00:06:36.610> this<00:06:37.060> demonstration<00:06:37.300> it<00:06:38.199> will<00:06:38.620> work

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
of this demonstration it will work

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.410 
of this demonstration it will work
alright

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.600 

now<00:06:42.200> you<00:06:42.290> can<00:06:42.410> also<00:06:42.530> do<00:06:42.800> a<00:06:42.830> complete<00:06:43.190> panel

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
now you can also do a complete panel

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.400 
now you can also do a complete panel
this<00:06:43.730> way<00:06:43.970> as<00:06:44.270> I've<00:06:44.540> shown<00:06:44.810> in<00:06:45.140> a

this way as I've shown in a
demonstration<00:06:46.010> previously<00:06:46.820> it's<00:06:47.000> better<00:06:47.210> to
