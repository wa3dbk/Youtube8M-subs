 everything you are currently changing 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.939
 but the question is what are you doing 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.099
 to consciously change if we're 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.189
 confused inside we reflected it outside 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.770
 then we surveyed focusing on the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.200
 problems or in the solutions the first

 the future 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.410
 someone who wants to start now 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.769
 there is no secret the first thing is to know what 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.979
 is what you want the second move and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.990
 practice it and the third commit and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.300
 do not give up at that point 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.920
 we accompany you we decided to break 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.920
 with the cosmonaut training we 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.900

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.240
 the personal training center 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.490
 integral with the objective of accompanying you

 to achieve your goals already with the achievement 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.909
 of the balance between cycles 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.680
 energy and the physical we have 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.550
 developed a tiered method that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.550
 it suits you 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.550
 we just discovered that the system 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.520
 training we are satisfied because 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.280
 It is very cute and very intense for 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.710
 complement poor transport like the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.770
 Chinese soccer bag muay thai man 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.840

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.570
 points so that guide on having a 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.550
 exceptional human quality what I 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.560
 like to come in to have here is that it is a 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.580
 dedicated time for me I'm alone with 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.310
 my trainer 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.200
 and so I have the opportunity to take advantage 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.200
 the time and get the best 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.490
 For me it is essential to spend it very 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.340
 I detest the workouts 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.890
 boring and monotonous and here I pass it 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.410

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.410
 trust in you because not many friends 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.880

 and the time to start is now that 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.220
 problem that you have who teaches to 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.930
 to realize his truth was that he was 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.930
 seen this right now
