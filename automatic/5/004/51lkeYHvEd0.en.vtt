00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.490
 m 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.580
 Yes 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.259
 it 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.090
 good evening 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.040
 a month ago 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.559
 what are you doing by m 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.119
 at several things mayor among others he does not stand in the lineup 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.070
 today is oddly the second onslaught of visual art flush with 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.680
 Earth 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.840
 so the point of appearing is where among all the press formations 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.110
 what is happening on the tree stage and she in montreal here now and 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.350
 that's why you did it to present radiant that you had 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.100
 want to come here with us today yes absolutely and why it's worth the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.010
 pain and what do we see when we go to see a write off actually percent 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.170
 I know that the goal of the show is creativity but me what 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.690
 I hope it is it will showcase the creativity and the r 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.840
 of course capital of retreat quoted corvino level of visual art enough 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.180
 unstoppable the Commons here by the general public and even by the middle 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.380
 emi discussed who does what so no 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.870
 and for 100 euros level of the media and even at the level of the emirates 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.390
 parentheses a year ago there are gaps in this underground car park 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.770
 are you yourself by then 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.229
 yes practice training but I feel a little aside lately these 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.840
 recent years to put forward initiatives that allow 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 in the back within nine if we want 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.910
 to be highlighted what does it give me more satisfaction to do 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.299
 a work editor work of others 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.530
 and promote our own work c ap i think it's universal out 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.460
 to discuss these ungrateful departure from the province in% self admission it's always 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.859
 something pete it's the threat that does not weigh 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.070
 and then I admit that can take others is something that brings me 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.350
 a lot of satisfactions especially who has more there are so many beautiful things 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 there is so much to see 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.799
 so what did you do to some people think that this is 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.490
 because you are an artist ourselves 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.200
 that's sure it helps - target and macy's finished% at 4057 a little more than 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.810
 ten years 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.590
 to the question but my father bernard desum was great at the university 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.699
 ottawa 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.900
 she remained a great opportunity to leave young people and then when I 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.429
 went out and it was he was living late that never get to become an artist at 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.699
 the side was clear like rock water so I turned to 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.719
 my job I did things 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.920
 eq it is with that of May I wanted a little and then we really have nothing but for 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.749
 me it was the music from there in canada 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.759
 world bank for my schedule already it was 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.739
 something but all that to say that 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.930
 the years old artists by default we are isolated 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.290
 his hands 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.290
 but but these sardines some places 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.810
 messi we can also rebuild this isolation to eat 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.329
 cooked 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.990
 ebay had met 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.280
 eq people who enroll in communities so that was a bit of a 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.300
 stage this need and the head compensation hours 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.439
 - I would like to set up 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.989
 Impregilo 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.370
 in e sport what creates a community i think i will find% and i 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.739
 call back 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.739
 so if I play the middleman 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:19.080
 and like this Father's Day 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.780
 yes it's very rewarding in fact it's sure not what it's 30 years I 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.370
 stalled for a year of history fired because it's a bit like you're not 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.510
 on the same scale but still tartar 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.209
 I think that any artist is always activated by the approval by the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.949
 parties 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.249
 to speak a sawtooth session twente is very tight then 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.999
 so much better it can be a guarantee of quality but still 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.679
 when we can see it cc 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.269
 it makes carnacois when we see that people are listening and already braided already 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.459
 already looks back at people targeted genres then clicks the scene that's 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.049
 a proof that we do not speak in the vacuum August something that 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.749
 resonates and with the word of the end 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:07.489
 the first activity the art galleries the centers of activities and cc of 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.779
 mines of gold mines 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.779
 I concede it to you 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:23.069
 even worse for me fathers
