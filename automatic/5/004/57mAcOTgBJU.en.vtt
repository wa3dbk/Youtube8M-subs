it blows out right here okay I have a
gasket<00:00:44.700> kit<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.570> engine<00:00:46.700> I'll<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
gasket kit for this engine I'll have to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.410 
gasket kit for this engine I'll have to
take<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> head<00:00:48.629> off<00:00:49.910> make<00:00:50.910> sure<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.270> head

gasket<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> place<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> spark<00:00:59.940> plug<00:01:01.820> needs<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
gasket and place the spark plug needs a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.789 
gasket and place the spark plug needs a
drive<00:01:03.270> belt<00:01:05.600> now<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.320> somebody

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
drive belt now this one here somebody

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
drive belt now this one here somebody
went<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.130> welded<00:01:08.549> these<00:01:08.700> little<00:01:09.030> plates<00:01:09.689> on

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
went and welded these little plates on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
went and welded these little plates on
here<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.470> did<00:01:13.740> by<00:01:14.280> doing<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.820> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
here and what they did by doing that is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.289 
here and what they did by doing that is
they<00:01:15.180> blocked<00:01:15.509> off<00:01:15.810> these<00:01:16.759> slots<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
they blocked off these slots for the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.560 
they blocked off these slots for the
attachments<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:20.939> gonna<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> clean

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
attachments so I'm gonna have to clean

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.289 
attachments so I'm gonna have to clean
this<00:01:21.780> off<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.189> grind<00:01:23.460> all<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.060> weld

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
this off and then grind all that weld

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.410 
this off and then grind all that weld
off<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.020> them<00:01:25.200> things<00:01:25.470> off<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.860> there

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
off and get them things off of there

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.789 
off and get them things off of there
otherwise<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.659> can't<00:01:27.900> mount<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
otherwise you can't mount the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.380 
otherwise you can't mount the
attachments<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> front<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:33.000> looks<00:01:33.030> like

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
attachments on the front it looks like

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.030 
attachments on the front it looks like
they<00:01:33.570> welded<00:01:34.020> something<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.560> here<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.920> then

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
they welded something on here and then

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.859 
they welded something on here and then
it<00:01:35.189> broke<00:01:35.369> off<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.060> cut<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> off<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:41.869> they

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it broke off or they cut it off but they

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.480 
it broke off or they cut it off but they
had<00:01:42.990> pretty<00:01:43.229> good<00:01:43.320> tires<00:01:43.710> yet<00:01:45.259> this<00:01:46.259> has<00:01:46.560> three

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
had pretty good tires yet this has three

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.120 
had pretty good tires yet this has three
speeds<00:01:47.820> forward<00:01:48.829> plus<00:01:49.829> reverse

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.040 

this<00:01:56.130> must<00:01:56.370> be<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:56.730> type<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.120> safety<00:01:57.360> deal

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.450 

but<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.410> that's<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.010> unique

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
but the thing that's kind of unique

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.230 
but the thing that's kind of unique
about<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.380> tractor<00:02:04.580> they<00:02:05.580> were<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.940> tube

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
about this tractor they were this tube

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.040 
about this tractor they were this tube
is<00:02:07.130> there<00:02:08.130> should<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.520> tube<00:02:09.479> slides<00:02:09.929> out

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
is there should be a tube slides out

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.750 
is there should be a tube slides out
comes<00:02:13.050> back<00:02:13.170> here<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:14.430> should<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
comes back here and there should be a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.400 
comes back here and there should be a
pair<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.120> wheels<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> seat

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
pair of wheels with a seat

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.750 
pair of wheels with a seat
and<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:18.180> steering<00:02:18.480> wheel<00:02:19.070> this<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.670> a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
and a steering wheel this is actually a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.980 
and a steering wheel this is actually a
ride<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.300> tractor<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:23.209> did<00:02:24.209> not<00:02:24.360> get<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.780> back

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
ride on tractor I did not get the back

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.690 
ride on tractor I did not get the back
half<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> tractor<00:02:26.100> however<00:02:28.489> there<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.670> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
half of the tractor however there is a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.350 
half of the tractor however there is a
guy<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.030> know<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:30.630> says<00:02:31.140> he<00:02:31.290> has<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> back<00:02:31.920> half

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
guy I know that says he has a back half

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.590 
guy I know that says he has a back half
and<00:02:33.650> I'm<00:02:34.650> working<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.730> getting<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.270> from<00:02:36.480> him

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
and I'm working on getting it from him

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.040 
and I'm working on getting it from him
otherwise<00:02:39.600> they'll<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.290> make<00:02:40.980> something

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
otherwise they'll have to make something

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.040 
otherwise they'll have to make something
but<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:45.090> lever<00:02:45.390> engages<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:47.720> belt<00:02:48.720> drive

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
but this lever engages that belt drive

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.340 
but this lever engages that belt drive
for<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.410> transmission<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:54.750> lever<00:02:55.050> goes

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
for the transmission this lever goes

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.970 
for the transmission this lever goes
down<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.170> probably<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.739> lever

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
down here and it's probably the lever

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.970 
down here and it's probably the lever
that<00:02:59.720> would<00:03:00.720> engage<00:03:01.049> power<00:03:01.790> implements

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
that would engage power implements

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.080 
that would engage power implements
probably<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.220> front<00:03:05.549> or<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.820> back<00:03:08.090> then

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
probably on the front or the back then

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.940 
probably on the front or the back then
there's<00:03:09.269> these<00:03:09.390> little<00:03:09.780> foot<00:03:10.080> tight<00:03:10.440> levers

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
there's these little foot tight levers

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.120 
there's these little foot tight levers
here<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:16.400> think<00:03:17.400> some<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.850> stuff<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.330> still

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
here I think some of this stuff is still

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:29.090 
here I think some of this stuff is still
locked<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.549> bit<00:03:24.799> but<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:27.320> think<00:03:28.320> what<00:03:28.890> these

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
locked up a bit but I think what these

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.949 
locked up a bit but I think what these

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
that's some type of brake it works on

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.880 
that's some type of brake it works on
this<00:04:29.940> lever<00:04:30.270> here<00:04:30.660> which<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:31.470> not<00:04:31.650> moving<00:04:33.890> and

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
this lever here which is not moving and

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.090 
this lever here which is not moving and
then<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.130> is<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.490> shift<00:04:35.760> lever<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.919> this

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
then this is the shift lever so so this

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.550 
then this is the shift lever so so this
thing<00:04:38.310> has<00:04:38.460> some<00:04:38.700> work<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.910> do<00:04:39.560> getting

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
thing has some work to do getting

everything moving I did download a

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.480 
everything moving I did download a
manual<00:04:44.960> off<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.440> internet<00:04:46.740> for<00:04:47.070> rewards
