structure of a store but I think for me
the<00:00:28.109> most<00:00:28.349> useful<00:00:28.619> thing<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.580> probably<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the most useful thing was probably the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.640 
the most useful thing was probably the
simple<00:00:30.300> business<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.750> being<00:00:30.900> sent<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650

in every classroom and with every

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.350 
in every classroom and with every
professor<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.400> every<00:03:24.670> social<00:03:24.880> setting

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
professor and it in every social setting

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.600 
professor and it in every social setting
made<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.740> you<00:03:26.890> were<00:03:27.040> constantly

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
made it so that you were constantly

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.850 
made it so that you were constantly
learning<00:03:28.140> whether<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.380> were<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.650> classroom

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
learning whether you were in a classroom

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.040 
learning whether you were in a classroom
or<00:03:30.130> not<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.580> so<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:31.270> think<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.600> was<00:03:31.900> the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
or not and so I think that was the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.870 
or not and so I think that was the
biggest<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.680> greatest<00:03:32.890> asset<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.550> going<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
biggest and greatest asset of going the
