00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.510
 We would like to have our pictures 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.660
 nice sharp and crisp look like that 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:11.660
 like this copy here but 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.420
 what do we do when recording 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.019
 instead he looks something like that 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.929
 washed out a little bit and spoiled 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:24.470
 so generally not spicy and 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:28.369
 High contrast the easiest way we do 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.460
 change into perfect in hands remaining 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.000
 first in perfect in hands here 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.740
 sharpen it in the age of three 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.160
 Preferences that we can use 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.430
 there is a sharp default for 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.310
 print one for video and one the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.380
 means fix focus and that's the one we 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.710
 be using now and with one 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.440
 simple click on fixe focus 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.850
 our picture is much sharper 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.680
 has clearly gained in contrast and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.670
 The veil is also largely 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.189
 disappeared 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.590
 but there is something more we do 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:11.090
 can and we change up here 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.670
 in the color and tone value adjustments and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.880
 in the color and tone value adjustments there 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.880
 First of all we can do the detail 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.979
 pull the regulator slightly upwards and with 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.229
 this attitude wins our picture 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.020
 just a little more contrast and 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.130
 to deep and as we mostly 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 we can need contrast here above 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.090
 then also the contrast regulator 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.570
 use and regulate the contrast 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.030
 something up and that is our picture 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.150
 now really crisp and sharp 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.150
 contrasty 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.600
 and with these few clicks we are 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.210
 from a picture that looks like this 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.210
 come to this result here
