00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
you can actually add as many apps to a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.769 
you can actually add as many apps to a
page<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.730> want<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.359> allows<00:00:24.570> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
to vertically scroll through them just

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240 
to vertically scroll through them just
like<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.769> right<00:00:28.800> here

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
like that now you can see right here

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
like that now you can see right here
that<00:00:29.310> i<00:00:29.429> actually<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.880> paging<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.619> right<00:00:31.619> now

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that i actually have paging on right now

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.200 
that i actually have paging on right now
so<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.430> pops<00:00:32.910> from<00:00:33.350> every<00:00:34.350> 9<00:00:35.210> applications

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so it pops from every 9 applications

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
so it pops from every 9 applications
just<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.440> also<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.890> have

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
just like that you also can have

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.819 
just like that you also can have
multiple<00:00:38.340> pages<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.500> scroll<00:00:40.770> through

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
multiple pages so you can scroll through

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.790 
multiple pages so you can scroll through
just<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.200> now<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.620> some

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
just like that now if you have some

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
just like that now if you have some
settings<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.789> we'll<00:00:44.940> jump<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.329> there<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
settings here so we'll jump in there and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
settings here so we'll jump in there and
you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.230> see<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.620> isn't<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> folders

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
you can see this isn't in the folders

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.709 
you can see this isn't in the folders
you<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.730> vertical<00:00:48.000> scrolling<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you have vertical scrolling which you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
you have vertical scrolling which you
can<00:00:48.899> enable<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.350> disable<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
can enable or disable you can have the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.979 
can enable or disable you can have the
scrolling<00:00:51.300> bounce<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.809> highly

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
scrolling bounce which I highly

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.869 
scrolling bounce which I highly
recommend<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.579> whole<00:00:53.699> lot

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
recommend I think that's a whole lot

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.700 
recommend I think that's a whole lot
nicer<00:00:54.059> than<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> popping<00:00:55.320> back<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
nicer than just the popping back and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
nicer than just the popping back and
forth<00:00:55.920> sort<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.280> thing<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.300> when

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
forth sort of thing so you can see when

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.840 
forth sort of thing so you can see when
we<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.809> scrolling<00:00:58.320> bounce<00:00:58.500> enabled<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
we have scrolling bounce enabled it's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.069 
we have scrolling bounce enabled it's
going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> give<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.600> nice<00:01:00.840> little

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
going to give you that nice little

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
going to give you that nice little
cushion<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.309> when<00:01:02.520> you're<00:01:02.640> swiping

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
cushion right there when you're swiping

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.960 
cushion right there when you're swiping
through<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.610> all<00:01:05.610> right<00:01:05.790> so

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
through just like that all right so

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.609 
through just like that all right so
let's<00:01:06.060> jump<00:01:06.299> back<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> settings<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
let's jump back in the settings and you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.350 
let's jump back in the settings and you
also<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.100> scroll<00:01:08.580> bar<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.240> make

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
also have a scroll bar so you can make

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.679 
also have a scroll bar so you can make
it<00:01:09.420> either<00:01:09.659> white<00:01:10.049> black<00:01:10.770> or<00:01:11.060> disable<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.180> so

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it either white black or disable it so

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.870 
it either white black or disable it so
you<00:01:13.260> probably<00:01:13.290> didn't<00:01:13.860> even<00:01:13.979> notice<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.729> if

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you probably didn't even notice it if

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
you probably didn't even notice it if
you<00:01:15.090> weren't<00:01:15.299> looking<00:01:15.570> very<00:01:15.930> closely<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.500> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you weren't looking very closely but you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.820 
you weren't looking very closely but you
can<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.280> white<00:01:18.210> little<00:01:19.170> scroll<00:01:19.439> bar<00:01:19.650> right

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
can see a white little scroll bar right

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.850 
can see a white little scroll bar right
there<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> right-hand<00:01:20.369> side<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.740> can

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
there on the right-hand side so you can

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.260 
there on the right-hand side so you can
change<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> black<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.820> well<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> want

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
change that to black as well if you want

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.140 
change that to black as well if you want
to<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.530> also<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:26.100> vertical<00:01:26.369> paging<00:01:26.939> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
to now you also have vertical paging so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.969 
to now you also have vertical paging so
if<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:27.750> want<00:01:27.869> paging<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
if you don't want paging on then you can

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
if you don't want paging on then you can
turn<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.340> off<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:30.780> here

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
turn that off and you can see right here

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.370 
turn that off and you can see right here
as<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.470> swipe<00:01:31.710> through<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
as you swipe through it's not going to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
as you swipe through it's not going to
jump<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.530> page<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.799> page<00:01:35.009> rather<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.210> going

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
jump from page to page rather it's going
