GM<00:03:09.319> started<00:03:09.769> probably<00:03:09.950> thinking<00:03:10.609> a<00:03:10.670> little

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
GM started probably thinking a little

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.460 
GM started probably thinking a little
more<00:03:10.910> cost-effectively<00:03:11.780> on<00:03:11.989> these<00:03:12.200> and

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
more cost-effectively on these and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.650 
more cost-effectively on these and
that's<00:03:13.010> why<00:03:13.370> would<00:03:13.910> they<00:03:14.030> took<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.359> springs

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
that's why would they took the springs

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.370 
that's why would they took the springs
out

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
out

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.830 
out
now<00:03:15.680> these<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.400> we'll<00:03:16.730> get<00:03:16.880> closer<00:03:17.150> actually

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
now these is we'll get closer actually

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.660 
now these is we'll get closer actually
have<00:03:18.850> wires<00:03:19.850> embedded<00:03:20.240> in<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.560> foam<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:22.640> can

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
have wires embedded in the foam you can

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.160 
have wires embedded in the foam you can
actually<00:03:22.970> see<00:03:23.270> some<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.630> them<00:03:23.750> here<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.020> we'll

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
actually see some of them here and we'll

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.060 
actually see some of them here and we'll
zoom<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:24.560> on<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:27.110> best<00:03:27.350> way<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.590> install

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
zoom in on this the best way to install

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.070 
zoom in on this the best way to install
these<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.640> 2ha<00:03:29.060> going<00:03:29.330> directly<00:03:29.690> into<00:03:29.960> these

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
these is 2ha going directly into these

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.710 
these is 2ha going directly into these
wires<00:03:30.380> which<00:03:30.710> is<00:03:30.830> what<00:03:31.010> they're<00:03:31.190> meant<00:03:31.370> for

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
wires which is what they're meant for

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.240 
wires which is what they're meant for
and<00:03:32.720> then<00:03:33.110> once<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.560> have<00:03:33.710> the<00:03:33.830> upholstery

and then once you have the upholstery

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.310 
and then once you have the upholstery
hog<00:03:34.520> rammed<00:03:34.790> into<00:03:35.000> these<00:03:35.330> then<00:03:36.020> you<00:03:36.050> would

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
hog rammed into these then you would

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.950 
hog rammed into these then you would
install<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.860> on<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.040> frame<00:03:37.660> but<00:03:38.660> again

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
install it on the frame but again

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.840 
install it on the frame but again
there's<00:03:39.620> nothing<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.430> need<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.700> go

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
really start until the early 90s so a

GM<00:06:35.919> actually

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
GM actually

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.609 
GM actually
at<00:06:36.799> some<00:06:37.009> point<00:06:37.249> started<00:06:37.869> laminating<00:06:38.869> the

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:39.619 
at some point started laminating the

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.589 
at some point started laminating the
upholstery<00:06:40.249> to<00:06:40.519> the<00:06:40.669> foam<00:06:40.879> which<00:06:41.239> makes<00:06:41.479> it

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
upholstery to the foam which makes it

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.329 
upholstery to the foam which makes it
even<00:06:41.659> more<00:06:41.959> difficult<00:06:42.169> to<00:06:42.499> take<00:06:42.679> apart<00:06:42.979> if<00:06:43.249> you

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:43.339 
even more difficult to take apart if you

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.219 
even more difficult to take apart if you
need<00:06:43.489> to<00:06:43.579> recover<00:06:43.879> you'll<00:06:44.479> see<00:06:44.689> this<00:06:44.869> more<00:06:45.199> in

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
need to recover you'll see this more in

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.039 
need to recover you'll see this more in
late<00:06:46.039> 90s<00:06:46.489> to<00:06:46.549> 2000s<00:06:47.299> and<00:06:47.389> it<00:06:47.479> probably<00:06:47.869> really

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:48.049 
late 90s to 2000s and it probably really

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:50.979 
late 90s to 2000s and it probably really
won't<00:06:48.379> affect<00:06:48.739> you<00:06:48.919> as<00:06:49.369> far<00:06:49.699> as<00:06:49.879> muscle<00:06:50.839> car
