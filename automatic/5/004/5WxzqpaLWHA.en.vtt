speeder boards toastier boards are
basically<00:00:09.719> an<00:00:09.840> adjustment<00:00:10.290> simulation<00:00:11.010> tool

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
basically an adjustment simulation tool

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.730 
basically an adjustment simulation tool
they're<00:00:12.059> used<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.450> simulate<00:00:12.780> an<00:00:13.200> adjustment

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
they're used to simulate an adjustment

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.650 
they're used to simulate an adjustment
and<00:00:14.009> simulate<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.910> way<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> bone<00:00:15.360> actually

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and simulate the way the bone actually

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.840 
and simulate the way the bone actually
feels<00:00:16.109> when<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.740> drops<00:00:17.100> when<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.490> make<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
feels when it drops when you make the

feels when it drops when you make the
adjustment<00:00:17.940> itself<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.529> great<00:00:19.949> for<00:00:20.220> a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
adjustment itself this is great for a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.550 
adjustment itself this is great for a

diversified meat chest upper cervical
and<00:00:24.930> toggle<00:00:25.439> we've<00:00:26.220> used<00:00:26.460> them<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.699> train<00:00:27.119> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
and toggle we've used them to train for

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.160 
and toggle we've used them to train for
all<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.720> them

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
all of them

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.859 
all of them
so<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.160> speeder<00:00:29.429> board<00:00:29.640> itself<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.720> made

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
so the speeder board itself is just made

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.650 
so the speeder board itself is just made
of<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.050> padded<00:00:31.590> top<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.180> nice<00:00:33.180> hard<00:00:33.450> bottom

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
of a padded top here nice hard bottom

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
of a padded top here nice hard bottom
and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.050> there's<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.559> two<00:00:34.770> Springs<00:00:35.250> here

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and then there's just two Springs here

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.400 
and then there's just two Springs here
with<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> clip<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> whole<00:00:36.899> concept<00:00:37.110> behind

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
with a clip so the whole concept behind

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.729 
with a clip so the whole concept behind
that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.430> come<00:00:38.700> close<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that you come close to see is that the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.729 
that you come close to see is that the
board<00:00:41.610> itself<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.180> drop<00:00:42.480> down<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.020> clip

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
board itself will drop down and clip

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.110 
board itself will drop down and clip
just<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
just like that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.479 
just like that
simulating<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.140> fixated<00:00:46.950> position<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
simulating a fixated position of a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.660 
simulating a fixated position of a
vertebra<00:00:47.940> moving<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.410> freely<00:00:50.160> movable

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
vertebra moving into freely movable

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.689 
vertebra moving into freely movable
position<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:52.020> will<00:00:52.199> feel<00:00:52.469> similar<00:00:53.190> now

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
position so it will feel similar now

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.540 
position so it will feel similar now
exactly<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.420> similar<00:00:54.960> -<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.590> adjustment

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
exactly but similar - and adjustment

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
exactly but similar - and adjustment
itself<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> great<00:00:57.719> thing<00:00:57.899> about<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
itself but the great thing about this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.979 
itself but the great thing about this
and<00:00:58.559> I've<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.520> enjoyed<00:00:59.730> training<00:01:00.690> with

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
and I've really enjoyed training with

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.609 
and I've really enjoyed training with
this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:02.719> it<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.870> helped<00:01:04.199> me<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.559> my

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
this is that it really helped me with my

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.520 
this is that it really helped me with my
speed<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> adjustment<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.380> way<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
speed on the adjustment and the way I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
speed on the adjustment and the way I
set<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:07.920> my<00:01:08.010> body<00:01:08.340> getting<00:01:08.700> use<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
set up my body getting use of the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.550 
set up my body getting use of the
mechanics<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.810> actually<00:01:10.110> making<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
mechanics of actually making the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.500 
mechanics of actually making the
adjustment<00:01:11.010> without<00:01:11.250> having<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.700> try<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
adjustment without having to try on

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
adjustment without having to try on
people<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> got<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.070> work<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> lot<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
people so I got to work out a lot of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.679 
people so I got to work out a lot of
kinks<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.600> had<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.229> lot<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.659> guess<00:01:18.659> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
kinks that I had a lot of I guess you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.570 
kinks that I had a lot of I guess you
could<00:01:19.049> say

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
could say

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.240 
could say
biomechanical<00:01:21.110> insufficiencies<00:01:22.250> towards

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
biomechanical insufficiencies towards

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.820 
biomechanical insufficiencies towards
the<00:01:23.460> adjustment<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:24.930> trained<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the adjustment so I actually trained a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
the adjustment so I actually trained a
long<00:01:26.130> time<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.700> I've<00:01:26.850> been<00:01:26.970> training

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
long time on this I've been training

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.609 
long time on this I've been training
with<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.630> about<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:27.990> years<00:01:28.020> now

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
with this for about two years now

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.730 
with this for about two years now
and<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.060> taken<00:01:30.659> my<00:01:30.960> chiropractic

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and it has really taken my chiropractic

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.490 
and it has really taken my chiropractic
adjustments<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.380> great

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
adjustments to a really really great

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
adjustments to a really really great
level<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.430> I'd<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> example<00:01:36.630> how<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.840> use

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
level so I'd like to example how to use

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
level so I'd like to example how to use
this<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.490> come<00:01:38.700> over<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
this so what I come over here to the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.200 
this so what I come over here to the
table

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.280 

tables<00:01:42.600> these<00:01:43.260> are<00:01:44.240> just<00:01:45.240> simulating<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
tables these are just simulating the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.170 
tables these are just simulating the
position<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> patient<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.610> specific

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
position of a patient this is specific

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.690 
position of a patient this is specific
to<00:01:48.210> knee<00:01:48.600> chest<00:01:48.900> upper<00:01:49.320> cervical<00:01:49.530> however<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
to knee chest upper cervical however you

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340 
to knee chest upper cervical however you
don't<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> limit<00:01:51.330> yourself<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:52.080> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
don't have to limit yourself to that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770 
don't have to limit yourself to that
this<00:01:52.890> meter<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.550> great<00:01:53.760> for<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.060> so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
this meter is really great for that so

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.980 
this meter is really great for that so
what<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:56.220> actually<00:01:56.340> set<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.690> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
what we do is we actually set up on the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.660 
what we do is we actually set up on the
speeder<00:01:58.259> board<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.830> if<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.220> were<00:01:59.280> setting<00:01:59.520> up

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
speeder board as if we were setting up

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.830 
speeder board as if we were setting up
on<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.970> Atlas<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.610> we<00:02:02.610> train<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.570> would

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
on the Atlas here and we train we would

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
on the Atlas here and we train we would
break<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.140> apart<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.560> pieces<00:02:04.590> where<00:02:05.520> we

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
break this apart in pieces where we

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
break this apart in pieces where we
actually<00:02:05.820> train<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.690> get<00:02:07.170> used<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> field

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
actually train and get used to the field

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130 
actually train and get used to the field
of<00:02:08.310> putting<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.940> force<00:02:09.209> through<00:02:09.569> our<00:02:09.690> hands

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
of putting a force through our hands

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.350 
of putting a force through our hands
using<00:02:10.410> our<00:02:10.649> entire<00:02:10.920> body<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.880> we<00:02:12.000> start<00:02:12.270> with

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
using our entire body so we start with

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.150 
using our entire body so we start with
the<00:02:12.480> back<00:02:12.660> leg<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.260> don't<00:02:13.440> move<00:02:13.620> our<00:02:13.800> arms<00:02:14.040> at

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
the back leg and don't move our arms at

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.509 
the back leg and don't move our arms at
all<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.180> train<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:16.310> actually<00:02:17.310> just

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
all and you can train to actually just

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.070 
all and you can train to actually just
send<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.850> thrust<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.360> through<00:02:18.540> your<00:02:18.630> leg<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
send it thrust up through your leg and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.900 
send it thrust up through your leg and
it'll<00:02:19.260> travel<00:02:19.620> through<00:02:19.739> your<00:02:19.860> legs<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.760> can

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
it'll travel through your legs you can

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.850 
it'll travel through your legs you can
also<00:02:21.030> turn<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.590> with<00:02:22.739> either

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
also turn this and do this with either

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.340 
also turn this and do this with either
hand<00:02:23.220> for<00:02:23.730> our<00:02:23.760> multiple<00:02:24.350> multiple

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
hand for our multiple multiple

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.440 
hand for our multiple multiple
techniques<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:26.489> as<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.940> were<00:02:27.060> on<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
techniques but as if you were on the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.420 
techniques but as if you were on the
side<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.989> patient<00:02:28.410> head<00:02:28.680> down<00:02:28.890> your<00:02:29.190> body

side of the patient head down your body

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.229 
side of the patient head down your body
down<00:02:29.730> here<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.690> actually<00:02:30.870> set<00:02:31.380> up<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.970> to

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
down here and actually set up and to

and<00:02:38.160> that's<00:02:38.280> training<00:02:38.550> more<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.180> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
and that's training more of just the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.750 
and that's training more of just the
arms<00:02:39.660> itself<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.769> can<00:02:40.920> also<00:02:41.069> work<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.519> just

is just going to bring your your arms in
it's<00:02:46.170> also<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> deliver<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.130> thrust<00:02:49.160> you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
it's also going to deliver it thrust you

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.460 
it's also going to deliver it thrust you
can<00:02:50.310> also<00:02:50.430> train<00:02:50.850> just<00:02:51.299> your<00:02:51.480> triceps<00:02:52.049> alone

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
can also train just your triceps alone

as if it's an actual patient so I'm

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.310 
as if it's an actual patient so I'm
going<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.700> example<00:03:18.329> for<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.600> setting<00:03:18.989> up<00:03:19.079> a

neat chest upper cervical adjustment so

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.319 
neat chest upper cervical adjustment so
what<00:03:22.500> we<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.160> actually<00:03:23.310> palpate<00:03:24.060> for

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
what we do is we actually palpate for

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.569 
what we do is we actually palpate for
the<00:03:24.750> certain<00:03:25.049> point<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.470> neck<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.040> we'd

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
the certain point on the neck and we'd

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.570 
the certain point on the neck and we'd
actually

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
actually

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.820 
actually
the<00:03:28.730> highest<00:03:29.210> form<00:03:29.360> right<00:03:29.960> on<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.290> Atlas<00:03:30.560> foam

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
the highest form right on the Atlas foam

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.190 
the highest form right on the Atlas foam
just<00:03:31.610> like<00:03:31.760> we<00:03:31.850> would<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.210> a<00:03:32.240> patient<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.900> I'm

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
just like we would on a patient and I'm

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.870 
just like we would on a patient and I'm
going<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.440> set<00:03:33.650> my<00:03:33.830> body<00:03:34.100> exactly<00:03:34.430> like<00:03:34.760> I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
going to set my body exactly like I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.000 
going to set my body exactly like I
would<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.570> deliver<00:03:35.930> with<00:03:36.110> all<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.560> mechanics

would and deliver with all the mechanics
that<00:03:37.070> are<00:03:37.190> would<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.610> patient<00:03:38.090> I'm<00:03:38.210> going<00:03:38.360> to

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
that are would to a patient I'm going to
