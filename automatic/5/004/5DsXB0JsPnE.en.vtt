00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.560
 we are coming for 10 years 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.080
 to bring one out 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.269
 a commercial of the world 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.099
 Korte the healed Erfurt is a classic perhaps proves to be

 Bundesverband deutscher Post Richter 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.919
 but not at that time to destroy those troops 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.970
 Federal Association of German took place 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.330
 and at the same time - though 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.870
 Fact is we are us 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.060
 breeds bred 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.130
 for breeder and owner Dr

 Percent of the animal Ishiaku AG BHB 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.990
 how fed up and Wittstock 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.520
 April between Rostock and 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.200
 really hide one and a half hours

 he was 22 years old to look at her, just drive by shortly before calling that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.200
 it is possible at any time 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 Hercules Silver was born on 29 07 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.080
 So a good seven and a half years 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 he is currently bringing back a poem from outside 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.380
 Elena cross-examination of own goal 49 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.670
 Hercules is already one 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.640
 the well-tried chocolate 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.810
 Success in the Sahel zone 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.010
 the US is back 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.220
 this year's winner taps the winner 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.620
 Oldenburg state capital 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.290
 2008 has been here at the Bieler Mecklenburg exhibition 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.120
 you realize that he is off 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.500
 Plants themselves until then wait until they are the characteristic though the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.050
 outward appearance times one out 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.050
 because you presented quite well and that worldwide 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.440
 the study goes on to say 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.490
 this is also preferable over the case when they are used 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.500
 to see five times 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.550
 Note to that we have presented here pornos, there are also 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.190
 Jörg Niehoff and b 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.610
 but they already know that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.670
 they are so prevalent worldwide among the educators 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.519
 if one is pursued to 1 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.229
 instead of putting it over the best already in front of the podium 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.399
 Hesse has a lot of Canadian blood and thus the games advertised 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.389
 on the maternal side, the increased withdrawal is a great idea is a 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.389
 Euro to be bought back 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.189
 let's move on 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.089
 Miner is up 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.299
 at the KAB St the researchers 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.739
 bwin shareholders 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.519
 Herford is only available in this color 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.010
 that means you are born and brown fur is also Dr 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.939
 the price of oil under belly and hints 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.179
 mandatory breaks 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.499
 Question that is desired 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.649
 leave another feature 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.979
 There's a show off 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.979
 that means he's there 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.479
 that is quite desired that is 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.529
 with him is not quite as pronounced as on the stage they called in the 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.929
 Weld is called dash 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:11.649
 estimate for the current quarter 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.049
 in Indian that's not quite as pronounced as the European good we forgive 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.049
 the 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.120
 the characteristics of the requirement become 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.929
 also adaptable 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.069
 here you can see on the 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.339
 Final destination number of animals 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:28.339
 Because of the answers she has his specialty store that she has worldwide 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.959
 So widespread is this actually widespread worldwide among Muslims 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.359
 Binder Basel 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.359
 also assume that now even 6 million 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.139
 we have a very good one out of that 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.439
 and even very good 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 for example, to throw on our this year's 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.319
 only park and food 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.849
 the ignition of about a thousand samples 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.439
 which we from our point of view 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.999
 the most impressive 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.419
 beyond that is very crucial 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.649
 Stadtwerke Münster 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.739
 the easy-going time that is 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.739
 the ladder stress test of the EBA 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.669
 the credulity that is also a criterion made by me 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.830
 also in the middle of the crossing 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 that leads back to that 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.389
 we are super 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.389
 in the round of the Zuger 2000 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.240
 and if you want more information to checkout the WRC 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.809
 Time is not working 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:55.299
 You are welcome to 27 08 at the BDF and we would like to

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.110
 had better than dreamed 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.819
 Thank you for introducing the Polo 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.819
