that it has that protecting the foam

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.240 
that it has that protecting the foam
we've<00:03:56.300> got<00:03:56.450> an<00:03:56.510> additional<00:03:56.900> overlay<00:03:57.260> 11<00:03:57.620> we've

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
we've got an additional overlay 11 we've

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.160 
we've got an additional overlay 11 we've
got<00:03:58.400> some<00:03:58.640> energy<00:03:58.970> absorbing<00:03:59.600> foam<00:03:59.870> some

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
got some energy absorbing foam some

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.490 
got some energy absorbing foam some
super<00:04:00.530> fabric<00:04:00.950> right

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
super fabric right

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.770 
super fabric right
the<00:04:03.500> fingers<00:04:03.980> we've<00:04:04.370> got<00:04:04.520> overlays<00:04:04.970> got

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
the fingers we've got overlays got

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.270 
the fingers we've got overlays got
knuckle<00:04:06.140> protectors<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:06.980> way<00:04:07.130> they've

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
knuckle protectors and the way they've

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.560 
knuckle protectors and the way they've
done<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.580> overlays<00:04:08.030> there's<00:04:08.240> kind<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.480> a

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
done the overlays there's kind of a

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.180 
done the overlays there's kind of a
tunnel<00:04:08.870> system<00:04:09.020> right<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.920> allows<00:04:10.160> for

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
tunnel system right so it allows for

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.660 
tunnel system right so it allows for
really<00:04:10.790> good<00:04:11.510> mobility<00:04:12.070> very<00:04:13.070> good<00:04:13.370> feel<00:04:13.640> on

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
really good mobility very good feel on

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.360 
really good mobility very good feel on
this<00:04:13.970> area

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370

plastic outlet okay they've used a
tunnel<00:04:29.300> system<00:04:29.450> here<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.050> let<00:04:30.140> me<00:04:30.260> make<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.470> fist

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
tunnel system here so let me make a fist

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.860 
tunnel system here so let me make a fist
it<00:04:31.430> can<00:04:31.640> move<00:04:31.790> here<00:04:32.090> easily<00:04:32.450> it<00:04:32.540> keeps<00:04:32.720> the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
it can move here easily it keeps the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.120 
it can move here easily it keeps the
