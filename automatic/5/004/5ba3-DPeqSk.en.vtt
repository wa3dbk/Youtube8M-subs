00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.330 
to feel such a difference between that
first<00:02:24.240> stance<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:25.500> stance<00:02:25.830> because<00:02:26.070> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
first stance and this stance because you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.920 
first stance and this stance because you
really<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.940> work<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.420> keeping<00:02:27.810> that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
really have to work with keeping that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.050 
really have to work with keeping that
hula<00:02:28.200> hoop<00:02:28.470> up<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.340> position<00:02:29.550> when<00:02:29.940> your

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
hula hoop up in that position when your

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.500 

so<00:03:55.800> if<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.010> do<00:03:56.190> squats<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:57.090> will<00:03:57.270> be<00:03:57.390> good

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
so if you do squats this will be good

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.030 
so if you do squats this will be good
for<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.810> because<00:03:57.990> it's<00:03:58.470> literally<00:03:59.010> a

then you're raising back up and you're
just<00:04:04.800> repeating<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.970> again<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.660> are

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
just repeating that and again you are
