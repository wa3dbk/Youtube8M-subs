because<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.570> had<00:00:45.989> always<00:00:46.200> had<00:00:46.380> plans<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.040> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
because I had always had plans for it I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
years then nothing with it so I figured
