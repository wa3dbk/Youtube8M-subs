apparently<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.209> know<00:01:53.330> there<00:01:53.539> are<00:01:53.569> some

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
apparently what I know there are some

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.919 
apparently what I know there are some
rebel<00:01:54.289> factions<00:01:54.709> already<00:01:54.950> started<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.340> gate

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
rebel factions already started the gate

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.359 
rebel factions already started the gate
this<00:01:56.929> is<00:01:57.110> like<00:01:57.289> replaceable<00:01:57.950> we're<00:01:58.069> having

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
this is like replaceable we're having

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.990 
this is like replaceable we're having
but<00:01:58.520> um<00:01:59.950> hezi<00:02:00.950> ice<00:02:01.099> just<00:02:01.310> roll<00:02:01.520> over<00:02:01.549> all<00:02:01.880> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
but um hezi ice just roll over all the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.690 
but um hezi ice just roll over all the
north<00:02:02.209> but<00:02:03.009> actually<00:02:04.009> doesn't<00:02:04.250> have<00:02:04.340> actually

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
north but actually doesn't have actually

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.550 
north but actually doesn't have actually
gone<00:02:04.789> away<00:02:05.599> with<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.840> because<00:02:06.080> I<00:02:06.229> think<00:02:06.439> it's

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
gone away with this because I think it's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.410 
gone away with this because I think it's
enough<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.099> more<00:02:07.429> of<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.640> version<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.179> gabe

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
enough is it more of the version of gabe

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.759 
enough is it more of the version of gabe

just rattled from Garrison's bite and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.420 
just rattled from Garrison's bite and

probably take care of the Blitz much
let's<00:03:13.299> see<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.750> should<00:03:14.140> be<00:03:14.170> starting<00:03:14.859> with

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
let's see so I should be starting with

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.550 
let's see so I should be starting with
webster's<00:03:15.760> yes<00:03:16.090> somebody<00:03:16.540> award<00:03:16.870> Webster's

and<00:03:17.829> how's<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:17.980> Joffrey<00:03:18.519> there<00:03:19.180> are<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.299> lot<00:03:19.420> of

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
and how's the Joffrey there are a lot of

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.050 
and how's the Joffrey there are a lot of
different<00:03:19.750> facts<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.200> game<00:03:20.409> and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
different facts in the game and

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.369 
different facts in the game and
interesting<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.150> Joffrey<00:03:22.629> the<00:03:22.750> Sun<00:03:22.989> faction

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
interesting the Joffrey the Sun faction

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.750 
interesting the Joffrey the Sun faction
it's<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:23.680> rather<00:03:23.950> than<00:03:24.189> that<00:03:24.370> last<00:03:24.579> rope

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
it's just rather than that last rope

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.960 
it's just rather than that last rope
action<00:03:26.010> yeah<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.250> guess<00:03:27.370> he<00:03:27.519> only<00:03:27.670> controls

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
action yeah so I guess he only controls

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.960 
action yeah so I guess he only controls
King's<00:03:28.209> Landing<00:03:28.769> yeah<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:30.250> I'm<00:03:30.459> we<00:03:30.609> rely<00:03:30.909> to

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
King's Landing yeah so I'm we rely to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.039 
King's Landing yeah so I'm we rely to
the<00:03:31.150> house<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.450> totally<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:33.419> right<00:03:34.419> it's<00:03:34.870> cool

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
the house of totally and right it's cool

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.619 
the house of totally and right it's cool
so<00:03:35.230> we<00:03:35.290> can<00:03:35.439> go<00:03:35.560> through<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.859> other<00:03:35.980> things<00:03:36.629> so

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
so we can go through the other things so

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.479 
so we can go through the other things so
I<00:03:37.810> guess<00:03:37.989> karna<00:03:38.379> logic<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.919> little<00:03:39.250> bit<00:03:39.340> off

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
I guess karna logic is a little bit off

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.399 
I guess karna logic is a little bit off
because<00:03:39.760> house<00:03:39.939> krage<00:03:40.299> always<00:03:40.659> already<00:03:41.109> war

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
because house krage always already war

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.659 
because house krage always already war
with<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.799> Tully's<00:03:42.189> and<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.400> guess<00:03:42.519> they

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
with the Tully's and I guess they
