00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello friends and today we will 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.250
 cook pancakes and first we go for 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.389
 ingredients in the shop we buy eggs 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.370
 flour and milk pour milk on me 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.400
 need milk who needs milk in general and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.170
 but only after the milk bottle leave 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 imagine we go to the market to buy 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.220
 last ingredient but gave us say 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.380
 that you need to go to the suburbs for this 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:34.530
 ingredients so we go to the suburbs 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:35.180
 and meet the dog dog we don't you 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.739
 touch 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 does not touch and but we are of one blood for 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.020
 city tire service we were told good 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 people that somewhere here is possible and then 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.120
 what are we looking for but do not know where only 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.100
 vaguely gave up maybe we 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.829
 could and find what we needed 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 if you were on the roads longer 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.149
 suburbs or courtyards 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.070
 but who needs it so we went through 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.409
 fields of the road for wimps 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.409
 here is the real path for the males through the fields 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.299
 but when we made our way through more 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.510
 a knee in the snow happened 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.100
 unforeseen we saw a mountain and i decided 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.880
 that we will go to the mountain because we 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.619
 must go to the mountain because 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.619
 because we have to come to the mountain by 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.330
 ways we tear huge weeds 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.610
 used as a meter 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.140
 snow depths jumping a little 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.690
 trickle we 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.060
 they shop which probably stayed 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.790
 here since the revolution we 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 settling in 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.720
 half rotten moss-covered bench 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.720
 which keeps only on an honest word 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.509
 drove quite close muzzles close in 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.970
 some point shop under pressure 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.280
 our ass does not stand up and breaks 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.450
 a shop that probably sat on 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.540
 fell in love 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.070
 on which oedipus possibly sat she 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.070
 breaks down and we have her in antalya 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.160
 and make of it totems further in our 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.160
 your head comes genital we go 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.050
 we throw in turn our 20 m and 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.140
 we pass through it so as not to fail 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.860
 under the snow, may our ancestors keep us 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.180
 after that we see a plane in the sky and 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.930
 stop to look at him 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.470
 well and continue to move already relying on 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.050
 3 topics 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.620
 after we come to the foot 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 the mountains 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.130
 mordor we start on not climbing 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.870
 however, you need to be careful because 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.110
 the child does not give us this so easy 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.110
 to make 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 i'm this bullshit i'm coming 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:53.909
 there is no fraud without itself and after that we 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:56.340
 climb to the top look at the snow 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.940
 which has a gleam like snow in 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.730
 skyrim 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.069
 and generally we just rest because 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.750
 Frodo and Sam got to the marker 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.750
 Frodo and Sam can sit 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.590
 Kirill at this moment said that I 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.270
 a complete fagot like a griffin and not for us 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.610
 fly we are forced to descend by ourselves 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:34.650
 that's where the totem came in handy we put on 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:37.200
 his ass and down on him well and in 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.970
 eventually we find out why 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.970
 came to such distance yes and you 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.370
 slaughterhouse and we needed blood we 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.200
 make pancakes his mother with blood in the market 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.760
 they had no blood so they were told to go 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.670
 out of town for the slaughterhouse 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.010
 after we throw flour and eggs 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.670
 in capacity 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.040
 we filter there already blood but flour and eggs 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.070
 it is possible at its discretion throws but I 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.590
 threw 3 eggs and 2 tablespoons of flour 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.230
 but blood in thought was not filtered 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.870
 because she curled up yes and dishonest 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.020
 the butcher threw in there not only blood but also 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.790
 pieces of liver so we're a little 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.150
 warm up our sacrifices on 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.150
 on fire 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:27.290
 after that we filter again and start 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:29.720
 no way stir 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:35.120
 fill the blood with water otherwise it will 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.990
 scenes from the movie shine cooking pancakes we 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.640
 we will be on Igor Igor fucking psycho 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.790
 because he is happy that he will be on it 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.620
 to cook blood into mass for pancakes we 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.370
 add sunflower oil and 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.030
 stir 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.880
 she is Igor we also pour sunflower 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:57.020
 Butter of course is best to smear 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.540
 igor and bacon or pork fat after 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.840
 that igor is a little warmed up we 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.060
 we fill it with blood we fill it with 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.190
 eyes and mouth 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.890
 Igor is happy while Igor bathes in 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.380
 blood get shamanism to pancakes 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.960
 turned out tastier as the pancake warms up 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.810
 on one side you flip it 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.510
 on the other but nothing first damn lump 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.760
 after you made the first damn you 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.240
 again fill the sick bastard with blood 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.480
 until you run out of blood and after that 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.129
 look 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.349
 rub ago 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.339
 it's so cute after that you go 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.949
 splatters 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.989
 push monthly and of course give 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:44.019
 smell the pancakes to the cat 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:45.939
 and then you try it yourself actually 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:48.939
 turned out pretty tasty I did not expect 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:52.419
 what happens is so tasty like 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:59.999
 the liver has only a natural taste of blood 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:02.740
 more than a year did not like pancakes 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:03.639
 serve pancakes you can with 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.449
 ketchup 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.849
 with sour cream with mayonnaise with caviar even with 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:13.499
 lingonberry jam and so thank you all 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.499
