00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.370
 yes welcome back dungeon keeper the 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.190
 Bullfrog's legendary series is back 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.660
 but unfortunately not quite as you look 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.840
 would have liked because the one he has 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.210
 from it a mobile game brought in 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.990
 tablet and mobile game for ios and for 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.000
 android systems and the other is that 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.580
 One suspects something is already here 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.500
 little bit of money and money 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.610
 that's the way it really should be 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.940
 say very hard 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.000
 pure rip me totally looking forward to it 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.920
 finally in the dungeon keeper part 3 gave 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.449
 it is not now but now wrong 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.549
 At least on the phone, I'm happy 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.949
 really total 

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:50.290
 However, it is too early because it is 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.229
 a free to play game sounds now 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.369
 first totally cool and cheap you can 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.729
 download it for free 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:01:00.449
 but it is financed and I believe 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:03.729
 also golden cars in the bosses 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.049
 About in-app purchases and that's how it works 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.670
 you are his first here 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.150
 ultimately the workers do that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.160
 Here are some rooms here 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.800
 totally fast and how it works 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.470
 that is in the frame in mine 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.210
 Dungeon in the middle there I have to 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.190
 do not wait or so can with one 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.500
 jewel and a boost make it even more 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.040
 everything goes faster easy easy 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.350
 cool 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.060
 The problem is only when I later 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.870
 times my dungeon wants to expand and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.930
 then on the left you can see that too 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.700
 Then stones outside would like to knock 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.700
 need the ems subtly longer 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.230
 four minutes that was the library that 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.670
 is also still four minutes 50 is not 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.120
 problem here again the spine 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.790
 costs somehow in the fall I think 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.950
 somehow few jewels are all cool now 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.180
 but do you see here? 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.290
 that's a bit longer time 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.880
 four hours 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.990
 I thought he was too joking 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.730
 and I would have somehow missed 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.120
 But it takes four hours and now 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.070
 Although in real time to this in the 359th 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.810
 so he goes faster until he gets away 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.030
 Knocked up so a son falls away 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.100
 is and I can shop for 50 jewels 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.510
 Please choose the number 50 clock 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.210
 I turn on the pen now 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.830
 Of course I can say that here as well 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.830
 would like to choose to buy and it goes like that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.200
 really cheap so is better 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.300
 price ratio at 14,000 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.850
 jewels for 89 99 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.130
 the most popular are the 2500 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.900
 for 18 euros 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.550
 Of course, now you can say about ingame 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.940
 You can also jewel events 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.240
 win is like that, but I have soko 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.770
 5 July as a reward for a commitment 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.900
 means that you can actually cool 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.630
 but realize that the people is 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.239
 still totally satisfied yes very cool in the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.840
 Google Place Tor has the thing totally 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.410
 great reviews and that despite the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.860
 Next breakdown namely the end user 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.640
 Contract you have to confirm this 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.880
 to gamble 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.670
 and that's him here I roll him 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.290
 just completely through what now 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.330
 also this next three minutes 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.810
 will play videos easy even to 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.700
 show how much text should read aloud and 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.770
 Secondly, to show how much fun 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 is about makes dungeon keeper 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.000
 to play the phone 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.959
 it is simply a pure qual 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.790
 because when you see it like that 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.160
 customer friendliness and also one 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.690
 famous series kicked 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.040
 become pure greed 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.800
 that is really a mystery to me 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.180
 especially since he would be able to get these prices 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.250
 adjust 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.160
 but at any time so far nothing is 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.560
 happened and despite the fact I say so 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.330
 relatively clear criticism at least in the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.550
 app store at google and also if you are 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
 on the internet what people see and also 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.700
 the 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.980
 So keep the web pages from this game 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.620
 there is no leaf in front of the mouth 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.240
 and around again very briefly on this 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.330
 return data protection here 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.830
 So that's a dream for the nsa what 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
 because everything is in it if what you want 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.190
 really read through you really have something to 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.430
 so it's the motto one laughs 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.560
 can actually all phone number 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.630
 mac-addresses white the vulture left that 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.220
 or at least read it out 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.190
 if I confirm that and of course 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.380
 also to third party providers of analysis tools 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.810
 knows the vulture what forward everything 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.970
 i'm not saying that this data 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.220
 take them now and somehow everyone 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.950
 but sends alone that one 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.040
 forced to confirm this 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.680
 a dungeon keeper to gamble is already 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.420
 bizarre and funny it is also one 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.010
 has for the game always be online 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.650
 So you start it connects with 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.510
 the internet and that also has days 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.720
 long with me does not work error 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.520
 code 15 that too and there is also 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.960
 a whole latte on more fun 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.820
 for example the colleague from the video 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.820
 department has installed the thing 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.500
 rejected the push messages 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.350
 but still gets push messages 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.300
 or there is where your just needs 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.070
 your help or so the thing is 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.020
 wonderful we almost made it 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.030
 the complete privacy and cookie 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.280
 right through scrolling 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.260
 I then ask later times do 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.790
 I just stop if you all sentences 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.130
 read as olaf thon if you still have 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.660
 I 've been there before it's just that 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.100
 whole now does not come to the conclusion so 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.560
 I have the return of the German 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.330
 Cinemas not presented Yes and I am 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.500
 Also curious which classics series 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.750
 DE next, I say clearly 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.300
 raped and what others 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.800
 in app purchases is still short 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.210
 to the best price 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.000
 performance ratio at dungeon keeper 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.169
 89 99 for virtual jewels and more 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.630
 I do not think so 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:48.010
 I wish the gentleman in the 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:50.470
 Chefetage have fun with your champagne 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.840
 and with her golden watches she 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.150
 have earned with it and I am 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.070
 with unfortunately, every one of these actually 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.660
 price package accidentally or 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.860
 also deliberately pressed 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.860
 merry poodle
