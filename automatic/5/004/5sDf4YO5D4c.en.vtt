00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.350
 and good as you see arrived at FC Barcelona 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 and we are going to start 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.960
 the first league match the first 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.260

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.850
 to start 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.850
 the alignment 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.690
 as you can see the alignment that I'm using 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.330
 they are 433 with villa ball left messi 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.970
 of forward center and alexis by the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.670
 right 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.540
 I already live half iniesta and fabregas the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.030
 right the one of alves piqué puyol and abidal 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.220
 in Valdés trash and there are the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.220
 substitutes that is pedro basin are 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:38.620
 buscats mascherano adriano and pinto 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.620
 and jordi alba that is in progression 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 we also have the specialists who 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.840
 to choose the capital the faults the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.450
 penalties 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.899

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.460

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.790
 all players 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.920
 and we are going to sell some players for 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.430
 example deulofeu that will not have 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.950
 many minutes by 11 million because it is 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.700
 young and has progression can go up 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.429

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.400
 Y 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.870
 to Marc Bartra another 11 million 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.200
 because he is also young and has a lot 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.200
 progression 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.439

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.120
 that we can hire and how I have 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.300

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.200
 of the rival tell us goalies a 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.430

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.189
 Players 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.340
 and to finish I have hired a 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.340
 attorney 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.720

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.989

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.000

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.510
 husbands is the stadium advertising 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.879
 we have four companies that make us 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.250
 advertising are real companies but 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.640
 they have changed the name for example 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.890
 foam 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.590

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.010
 I chose these 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.940
 we also have another thing very 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.590
 interesting that is the newspaper in the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.890
 newspaper there will be news of our 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.360
 team and rival teams and it's a 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.860
 online game played against others 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.860
 users is not the computer 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.200
 now I'm going to show you a bit like 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.959
 said the specialists from before and now 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.560
 I'm going to teach a little the tactics that 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.230
 I have 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.410
 for example I have hard games 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.630
 what happens in the ball game pass the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.180
 attackers only attack middle centers 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.480
 neutral as they rise and fall and the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.070
 defenses that stay behind the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.460
 man-to-man marking without using 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.650
 out of the game and the offensive mentality 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.230
 I have time to look for spaces 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.030
 although English is standard and the 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:50.500
 I have 75% pressure, I do not want them 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.500
 set to 100% so as not to force 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.810
 Y 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.690
 we have an inning camp and a secret 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.259
 training in the cenin camp makes them go 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.639
 more motivated to the party and the secret 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.639
 camps so they do not see your tactics 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.390
 and good 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.040
 in summary I'll see to see what else there is 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.769
 to see if 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.949

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:21.949
 to see 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.220

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.320

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.450
