00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.530
 hello everyone how good in this video 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.170
 I'm going to show you some purchases that I've 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.970
 made of clothes although mostly it is 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.300
 of shoes I'm a little bit 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.340
 renewing and doing me with new things 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.260
 and good to teach a little bit what 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.540
 that I bought so far I'm going to 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.300
 start with the shoes I do not know if the 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.400
 teach I think I have not bought these 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.140
 that are brown with wedge and were offer 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.090
 they were forty euros left 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.400
 in 20 in half almost everything I've 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.100
 bought has been a bit of rebates that 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.260
 for now there are those that are more 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.839
 inter-season but here really the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.640
 summer are two days with which you 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.970
 It makes up for more buying things from 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.659
 half time so nothing are super 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.540
 comfortable I like it because they have the tip 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.060
 rounded and so they do not bother you for 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.950
 nothing I have always problems with 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.240
 tips rather than be 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.579
 rounded 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.430
 the only thing that is clear is this skin that if 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.280
 it rains your shoe is spoiled is 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.439
 the only thing but good as it is fat 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.600
 Well finally it seems that they will endure 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.930
 then other browns also that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.210
 bought are these I have picked up 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.570
 also a little more comfortable as I say 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.340
 more to go for a walk or buy me 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.590
 like the detail also with the tip 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.710
 more rounded and this heel also 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:45.170
 that seems very very comfortable was also 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.920
 on offer they were at 70 and now they are 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.920
 60 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.549
 of skin and above all the most important 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.530
 is the rubber in case it rains so 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.840
 nothing super comfortable and I think that of 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.060
 look good for anything comfortable 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.190
 but also that they are very very 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.560
 because it's what I did not want 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.619
 following with the brown that will make neighbor 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.260
 with your black shoes with presto 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.250
 party that I loved that with the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.930
 bow also super comfortable normally 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.510
 I will not buy it for high shoes 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.480
 with platform if it is not with platform 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 I do not want them anymore, it's clear to me how 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.320
 they say the letizios good then I also 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.960
 I signed up for letizia fashion but it's 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.310
 phenomenal this is wonderful and good 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.010
 has here the detail that is a 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.190
 little open the shoe more to 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.430
 mid-season even winter summer 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.200
 good more or less good as I say the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.560
 oily or expensive goal if it rains too 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.580
 this material 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.989
 it is broken but not because nothing is 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.690
 cool and now to teach and then the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.959
 dressed with those that I have put them for 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.790
 last of shoes and making use of 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.030
 recommendations about all of karina 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.450
 karina a huge kiss I bought these 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.959
 black sack also she looked for 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.580
 go for a walk and to put them even 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.890
 columns with jeans or with a 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.230
 Chinese or with a miniskirt whatever 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.569
 because I normally used those from 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.400
 reebok the black ones these of success 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.410
 although I have to be very comfortable but it is 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.260
 a shoe that really is for 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.900
 walk to play sports but not 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.620
 you saw a lot , the video comes and I've 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.110
 taken advantage of these offer 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.959
 and I'm delighted the truth is that I do not 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.989
 love is not a shoe that I fall in love 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.209
 but I recognize that it is comfortable that 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:52.159
 You can walk with him to take with you 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.049
 little skirt or anything are not very 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.629
 very current I thank you taking 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.049
 note of the recommendations because good 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.900
 in the way also to dress and 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.280
 The shoes I was wearing in Spain is 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.970
 totally different from what you wear 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.409
 here 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.220
 and you have to change certain things 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.780
 because the weather requires it and now 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.640
 regarding the clothes that the two teach 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.389
 dresses that my aunt has given me 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.930
 They are beautiful and I have already put them on 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.430
 It is one 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.320
 what is wonderful 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.540
 because it extends this movement here 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.610
 precious is a classic 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.340
 and here is a little button 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.020
 and the deck is that I'm delighted 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.580
 As I say I hope it's good weather 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.870
 for 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.670
 dress is this 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.130
 it's tied up here 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:52.000
 so are the two very very party 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:55.990
 but but I liked a lot in white 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.760
 and black like this with little sheets already with an outfit 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.990
 I'll wear it so you can see it come more 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.990
 or less by the waist 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.320
 it's tied back 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.710
 I'm going to put it like that so you can see it 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.580
 it's a store called dolega 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.370
 dolega aunt 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.000
 where I know her 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.769
 but it looks very nice and together it brings 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.940
 is 

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:24.900
 little jacket 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.449
 and as I say here, we need 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.009
 and it would be so great for a 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.199
 wedding a christening 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.699
 I have also bought quite 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.839
 Underwear always needs to be renewed 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:40.469
 mostly basic black white color 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:42.149
 cream as I say the one of the brand mab a 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:45.180
 which is one of my favorites here for 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:47.129
 price and quality then good then 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.869
 are basic that you always have to have to go 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.059
 renewing because there are clear times that the 

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:53.819
 Underwear is destroyed a lot and 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:56.939
 here I think that more I bought this 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:01.120
 small set and as I say it's a bit 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:03.220
 sport these are some Chinese 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.889
 and with his belt he was also 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.479
 offer 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.479
 and this one was at 40 and they have cost me 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.479
 25 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.440
 they are green is a material so if 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:23.580
 It also rains super comfortable 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.580
 and they come here 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.650
 that is super comfortable and that you are seeing 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.830
 then to accompany he has bought two 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.950
 basic white shirts too 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.980
 I like this round neck favors 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:45.160
 very much they were ten euros and they have 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.230
 left at eight euros and bought two 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.350
 because they tend to stain a lot more 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.220
 what and then as I say here the subject 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:57.790
 of summer is relative as I have taken 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:01.050
 is this jersey this jersey sorry 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.670
 it's pretty light it 's there in the hand 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.980
 arrives around the waist more or less 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.960
 bit short and well then you can 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.780
 Take it if it's cold you can 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.970
 It gets very cold and good as 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.120
 I say here in summer it's very relative with 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.810
 which you have to look for ideas with 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.080
 more mid-season clothes what is more 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:25.320
 more asks you when the day comes that 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.790
 make good and make sunshine put on the suit 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.560
 because there are not many opportunities or be 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.320
 that any suit even those of 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.570
 I do not party I'll put my fix I 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.870
 with my costume because really as I say 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.889
 the heat is 12 days take advantage for 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.030
 put what I have 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:44.400
 because then you no longer see again 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.840
 so nothing good because this has been the 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.750
 video that I wanted to teach them from the 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.900
 first purchases that I made 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.910
 spring we would say more or less so 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.860
 Well, as always, thanks for watching 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.950
 the video and see you in the next 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.950
 chance
