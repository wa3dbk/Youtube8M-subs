00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.050
 pegi 16 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:16.240
 I should have been there he will treat us 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:20.210
 of a terrorist marauder or worse 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.769
 sorry I promised you never to 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.560
 back in these fucking machine but if 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.429
 you're looking at me 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.429
 I hope you will understand 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.110
 we give up everything and our 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.850
 arrival was just the beginning 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.570
 you said it would be hard to leave 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.620
 to zero 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.070
 I was not listened to 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.000
 you said that others would come but 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.950
 I thought they wanted to be 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.270
 quiet 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.040
 I was wrong but I can not 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.470
 blurry 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.340
 recovered 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.330
 this land is ours and then I 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.330
 beat to be 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.940
 that for you 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 I do not know if the honor still has its 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.570
 place remains whole 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.710
 if he ever had 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.229
 all that I know 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.080
 they will pay me
