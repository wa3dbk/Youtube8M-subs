00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.860
 hello everyone welcome to the kitchen riot 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.900
 today's recipe are some 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.270
 very rich military you are nutella and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.539
 red fruits and the ingredients that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 we need are 18 cookies with sparks 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.699
 of chocolate half bar of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.689
 melted butter a bit of nutella 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.700
 and finally a cup of red fruits what 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 first thing I did was empty the cookies 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.719
 in a bowl with the help of a glass 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.870
 shred until they were 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.430
 completely pulverized this too 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.980
 you can do in a word processor 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.809
 food or in a blender when 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.340
 I got that I'll stay like that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.879
 I added the melted butter 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.219
 little by little mixing it evenly 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.870
 until all the cookie will be wet 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.870
 and a dough will form 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.990
 for these cakes I chose some molds 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.090
 with a leaf shape and to make it more 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.790
 easy to disassemble I put them paper 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.860
 wax after the vacuum some of the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.900
 cookie dough and with a spoon what 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.570
 I went to scattering to cover the bottom and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.550
 the walls of the mold doing it with 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.750
 very careful to avoid taking off the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.750
 waxed paper paste 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.110
 after having made all the pies 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.960
 I put them on a plate and refrigerate them 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.000
 about 20 minutes once I was already 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.220
 lasts the pasta I took it out of the molds 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.500
 you just have to pull one of the corners 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.500
 of the paper and the whole cake will come out 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.390
 now the filling that will be nutella 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.810
 and to make the decoration more showy 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.250
 use a sleeve with star duya 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.350
 Remember that you should get all the air out of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.460
 the sleeve so that bubbles do not bubble 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.460
 be easier to decorate 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.120
 When I had the nutella ready, I started 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.340
 to refill making it from the center towards 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.160
 outside and back to the starting point 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.260
 you must do it in one movement for 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.430
 that looks uniform and looks more 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.350
 decor 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.090
 fill in the same way all 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.720
 pies and then decorate them with 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.490
 blackberries and blueberries I chose to put 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.920
 the action cost because I think that 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.860
 give these cards a finer touch 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.740
 They are hyper easy to prepare and if you 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.050
 Like nutella, you'll love it 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.320
