00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
okay this is going to be the last

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.560 
okay this is going to be the last
exercise<00:00:02.429> I'm<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.879> be<00:00:02.970> posting<00:00:03.360> for<00:00:03.540> a

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
exercise I'm going to be posting for a

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.559 
exercise I'm going to be posting for a
while<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:04.740> don't<00:00:05.730> actually<00:00:05.879> practice<00:00:06.390> that

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
while and I don't actually practice that

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.040 
while and I don't actually practice that
many<00:00:06.779> exercises<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.630> the<00:00:09.630> ones<00:00:09.870> i've

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
many exercises so and the ones i've

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.930 
many exercises so and the ones i've
posted<00:00:10.230> up<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.800> are<00:00:11.070> kind<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.340> once<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.700> read

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
posted up and I are kind of once I read

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.270 
posted up and I are kind of once I read
like<00:00:12.210> I'm<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.900> actually<00:00:13.349> practice<00:00:13.830> whenever<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
like I'm do actually practice whenever I

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.730 
like I'm do actually practice whenever I
want<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.610> work<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.000> stuff<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.480> if<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.500> were<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
want to work on stuff and if I were to

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.320 
want to work on stuff and if I were to
show<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:16.980> much<00:00:17.220> more<00:00:17.460> stuff<00:00:17.760> than<00:00:17.789> I'd<00:00:18.119> be

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
show you much more stuff than I'd be

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.210 
show you much more stuff than I'd be
running<00:00:18.480> into<00:00:18.720> things<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.320> making<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
running into things I was making up to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.220 
running into things I was making up to
show<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.460> guys<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> would<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.109> be

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
show you guys or I would just be

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.990 
show you guys or I would just be
stealing<00:00:22.710> other<00:00:22.830> people's<00:00:23.279> exercises<00:00:23.880> which

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
stealing other people's exercises which

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.689 
stealing other people's exercises which
I<00:00:24.090> don't<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.630> cool<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.490> last

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
I don't think is cool so the last

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.550 
I don't think is cool so the last
exercise<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.599> show<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
exercise I'm going to show you it's a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.099 
exercise I'm going to show you it's a
double<00:00:28.949> octave<00:00:29.340> displaced<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.210> minor<00:00:30.810> scale

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
double octave displaced a minor scale

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.979 
double octave displaced a minor scale
pattern<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.579> octave<00:00:33.149> displacement<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.840> when

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
pattern so octave displacement is when

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
pattern so octave displacement is when
we<00:00:34.140> take<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.410> note<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.550> line<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.090> move<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
we take a note in a line and we move it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
we take a note in a line and we move it
up<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:36.690> diner<00:00:36.960> octave<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.280> take<00:00:38.489> an<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
up or diner octave so if you take an a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.920 
up or diner octave so if you take an a
minor<00:00:38.940> scale<00:00:40.670> if<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.879> move<00:00:42.090> every<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.690> note

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
minor scale if you move every other note

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.889 
minor scale if you move every other note
up<00:00:43.230> an<00:00:43.440> octave<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.789> kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:47.809> let<00:00:48.809> me

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
up an octave you get this kind of let me

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
up an octave you get this kind of let me
see<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.320> play<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:51.320> yeah<00:00:52.430> she's<00:00:53.430> an

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
see if I can play this yeah she's an

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.459 
see if I can play this yeah she's an
exercise<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.270> itself<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.440> i

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
exercise in itself but it's not what i

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.260 
exercise in itself but it's not what i
want<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> show<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> today<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.760> what<00:00:57.030> i<00:00:57.059> want

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
want to show you today and what i want

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.490 
want to show you today and what i want
to<00:00:57.329> show<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.570> easier<00:00:58.020> and<00:01:00.320> basically<00:01:01.320> when

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to show you is easier and basically when

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.869 
to show you is easier and basically when
i<00:01:01.559> was<00:01:01.680> getting<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.949> dark<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> displacement

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
i was getting a dark of displacement

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.479 
i was getting a dark of displacement
there's<00:01:03.750> something<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.589> easy<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.280> cool

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
there's something really easy and cool

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
there's something really easy and cool
but<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> guitar<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.110> e<00:01:07.140> strings<00:01:07.590> are

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
but the guitar which is to e strings are

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.820 
but the guitar which is to e strings are
both<00:01:07.979> east<00:01:08.280> rings<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.930> as<00:01:09.930> such<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.650> want

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
both east rings and as such if you want

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
both east rings and as such if you want
to<00:01:10.920> move<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.549> two<00:01:11.790> octaves<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to move in an up two octaves from the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
to move in an up two octaves from the
LOI<00:01:12.630> all<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.380> put<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> same

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
LOI all you do is you put it on the same

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
LOI all you do is you put it on the same
fret<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> high<00:01:15.270> E<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> take<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
fret on the high E so if you take the a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
fret on the high E so if you take the a
minor<00:01:16.860> scale<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.460> play<00:01:17.640> something<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:20.240> so

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
minor scale you play something like so

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.719 
minor scale you play something like so
just<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.750> six<00:01:23.090> all<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.360> way<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> low<00:01:24.840> E

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
just like six all the way up the low E

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.960 
just like six all the way up the low E
and<00:01:27.619> then<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.070> obnoxious<00:01:29.280> thing

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and then you can do this obnoxious thing

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.340 
and then you can do this obnoxious thing
where<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> move<00:01:30.329> every<00:01:30.600> other<00:01:30.720> note<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.170> two

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
where you move every other note up two

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:46.940 
where you move every other note up two
octaves<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.040> get<00:01:32.250> this

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.150 

which<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.160> tricky<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.260> kind<00:01:50.260> of<00:01:50.350> bends<00:01:50.980> the

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
which is tricky and kind of bends the

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.760 
which is tricky and kind of bends the
brain<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:51.550> fingers<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:52.180> ears<00:01:52.420> which<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:53.500> like

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
brain and fingers the ears which I like

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.660 
brain and fingers the ears which I like
and<00:01:54.010> I<00:01:55.050> think<00:01:56.050> Jason<00:01:56.440> Becker<00:01:56.890> demonstrates

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and I think Jason Becker demonstrates

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.070 
and I think Jason Becker demonstrates
that<00:01:57.820> but<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.240> did<00:01:58.510> come<00:01:58.720> up<00:01:58.840> with<00:01:58.960> it

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
that but I did come up with it

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.080 
that but I did come up with it
independently<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.430> that's<00:02:00.610> going<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.880> be<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
independently so that's going to be the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.820 
independently so that's going to be the
last<00:02:01.240> exercise<00:02:01.810> for<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.140> while<00:02:02.350> but<00:02:02.560> if<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.770> do

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
last exercise for a while but if I do

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.110 
last exercise for a while but if I do
come<00:02:03.070> up<00:02:03.130> with<00:02:03.250> anything<00:02:03.550> really<00:02:03.850> good

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
come up with anything really good

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.850 
come up with anything really good
meantime<00:02:04.690> I'll<00:02:04.870> definitely<00:02:05.080> posted<00:02:05.680> and
