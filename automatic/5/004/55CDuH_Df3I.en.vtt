00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 There was night in the moonlight and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.710
 egg on a leaf and then on a beautiful one 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.410
 Sunday morning sun beach and long I went 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.450
 crawled out of its own 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.450
 clock a hungry caterpillar 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:29.310
 He went on his way to look for food 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.980
 Monday as we cut through one 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:39.180
 apple, but he didn't have enough 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:43.410
 on Tuesdays always cut through 241 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.300
 but enough to always do not 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.230
 on Wednesday he had three 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.340
 plum one 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.350
 but he had still not enough 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.649
 Thursday he had been through four 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.609

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.820
 which had still not on Fridays 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.170
 He cut himself through 5 oranges one 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.450
 but he still didn't have enough 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.619
 Saturday what if I cut through a piece 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:21.860
 chocolate cake an ice cream and more acidic 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.860
 source goes off 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.850
 this chest 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.560
 a lollipop 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.670
 a piece of fruitcake 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.120
 a grove 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.320
 a cake 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.020
 and is the column that evening he had pain 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.869
 day the caterpillar was like a Sunday again 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.820
 sits right through green leaf 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.420
 he felt much better now he had 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.720
 no more hunger 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.750
 really real enough and then it wasn't either 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.200
 more small he was a big fat caterpillar 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.600
 and that big zipper blue one 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.430
 small house for itself that cocoon 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.260
 is mentioned 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.880
 more than two weeks are needed 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.000
 to sit 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.019
 then he changed a hole in the cocoon 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.019
 scrambled outside and 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.489
