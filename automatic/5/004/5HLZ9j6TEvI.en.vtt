00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
a little sticky translucent clay can be

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.029 
a little sticky translucent clay can be
pretty<00:01:18.469> sticky<00:01:21.549> um<00:01:22.549> gonna<00:01:23.240> place<00:01:23.829> one<00:01:24.829> of<00:01:24.950> the

pretty sticky um gonna place one of the
balls<00:01:25.250> or<00:01:26.209> spheres<00:01:26.600> onto<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.259> cabochons<00:01:28.159> and

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
balls or spheres onto the cabochons and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:29.919 
balls or spheres onto the cabochons and
I'm<00:01:28.490> using<00:01:28.670> my<00:01:28.819> clay<00:01:29.240> shaper<00:01:29.600> which<00:01:29.719> is

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
I'm using my clay shaper which is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:37.859 
I'm using my clay shaper which is
basically<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:32.829> silicon<00:01:33.829> rubber<00:01:34.130> I<00:01:34.310> think<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.759> is

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.899 

it's<00:01:38.869> um<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.380> soft<00:01:39.740> tip<00:01:40.069> it's<00:01:40.909> not<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.149> brush<00:01:42.909> I'm

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
it's um a soft tip it's not a brush I'm

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.380 
it's um a soft tip it's not a brush I'm
going<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.119> smooth<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:45.939> try<00:01:46.939> make<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.239> ball

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
going to smooth that try make that ball

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.479 
going to smooth that try make that ball
into<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.899> flat<00:01:48.349> surface<00:01:48.770> like<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.129> said<00:01:49.310> there's

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:49.489 
into a flat surface like I said there's

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:51.910 
into a flat surface like I said there's
a<00:01:49.579> thin<00:01:49.789> film<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.179> polymer<00:01:50.899> clay<00:01:51.110> liquid<00:01:51.200> on

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
a thin film of polymer clay liquid on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.219 
a thin film of polymer clay liquid on
top<00:01:52.099> of<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:53.060> cabochon<00:01:53.509> which<00:01:53.750> makes<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.170> a

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
top of the cabochon which makes it a

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.800 
top of the cabochon which makes it a
little<00:01:54.349> bit<00:01:54.560> slippery<00:01:55.539> but<00:01:56.539> I'm<00:01:56.629> going<00:01:56.750> to

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
little bit slippery but I'm going to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.309 
little bit slippery but I'm going to
shape<00:01:56.989> this<00:01:57.489> into<00:01:58.489> a<00:01:58.539> leaf<00:01:59.539> shape<00:01:59.569> and<00:02:00.170> then

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
shape this into a leaf shape and then

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.990 
shape this into a leaf shape and then
take<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.909> on<00:02:01.909> one<00:02:01.939> side<00:02:02.859> slightly<00:02:03.859> lower<00:02:04.640> and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
take it on one side slightly lower and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.009 
take it on one side slightly lower and
more<00:02:05.750> pointed<00:02:06.200> towards<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.590> top<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.840> can

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
more pointed towards the top you can

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.830 
more pointed towards the top you can
slide<00:02:12.319> your<00:02:12.349> clay<00:02:12.799> shaped<00:02:13.069> bird<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:14.420> around

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
slide your clay shaped bird to around

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.949 
slide your clay shaped bird to around
the<00:02:14.930> edges<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.670> move<00:02:16.670> your<00:02:16.880> clay<00:02:17.120> around<00:02:17.450> into

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
the edges and move your clay around into

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.170 
the edges and move your clay around into
the<00:02:18.049> shape<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.380> want<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:19.459> goal<00:02:19.730> here<00:02:20.000> is

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.520 
the shape you want it your goal here is
to<00:02:20.209> make<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.780> as<00:02:22.420> thin<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.569> possible<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
to make it as thin as possible in the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.490

middle and give it the shape of a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.159 
middle and give it the shape of a
butterfly<00:02:27.620> wing<00:02:28.870> I'm<00:02:29.870> gonna<00:02:30.049> lay<00:02:30.139> down

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:30.169 
butterfly wing I'm gonna lay down

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.750 
butterfly wing I'm gonna lay down
another<00:02:30.560> ball<00:02:30.799> underneath<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.609> is

another ball underneath of it this is

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.229 
another ball underneath of it this is
gonna<00:02:31.880> be<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.299> bottom<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.959> wing<00:02:34.239> on

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
gonna be at the bottom of the wing on

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.949 
gonna be at the bottom of the wing on
the<00:02:35.510> right<00:02:35.660> side<00:02:36.549> I'm<00:02:37.549> not<00:02:37.760> going<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.970> press<00:02:38.750> it

the right side I'm not going to press it
quite<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.440> same<00:02:39.680> way<00:02:39.859> I'm<00:02:40.099> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.250> pull<00:02:40.489> it

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
quite the same way I'm going to pull it

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.510 
quite the same way I'm going to pull it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:09.119 
and thinner towards the middle this is
not<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.980> best<00:02:52.130> butterfly<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.820> world

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.890 

taking<00:03:09.849> my<00:03:09.939> time<00:03:09.969> with<00:03:10.359> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
taking my time with it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.960 
taking my time with it
whenever<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.680> first<00:03:13.159> pressed<00:03:13.459> down<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:13.940> the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
whenever I first pressed down on to the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.380 
whenever I first pressed down on to the
ball<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.299> roll<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.959> clay<00:03:15.200> shaper<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.920> little<00:03:16.129> bit

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
ball I roll the clay shaper a little bit

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.430 
ball I roll the clay shaper a little bit
just<00:03:17.390> in<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.690> center<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:19.190> get<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:20.140> first<00:03:21.140> part

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
just in the center to get the first part

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.770 
just in the center to get the first part
of<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> leaf<00:03:21.799> shape<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:23.330> I'm<00:03:23.420> indeed<00:03:23.659> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
of the leaf shape and I'm indeed the

a<00:04:43.889> little<00:04:44.889> sticky<00:04:46.710> translucent<00:04:47.710> clay<00:04:47.919> can<00:04:48.160> be

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
a little sticky translucent clay can be

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.020 
a little sticky translucent clay can be
pretty<00:04:48.490> sticky<00:04:51.630> I'm<00:04:52.630> gonna<00:04:53.259> place<00:04:53.680> one<00:04:54.100> of<00:04:54.940> the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
pretty sticky I'm gonna place one of the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.409 
pretty sticky I'm gonna place one of the
balls<00:04:55.240> or<00:04:56.199> spheres<00:04:56.590> onto<00:04:57.039> the<00:04:57.250> cabochon<00:04:58.150> and

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
balls or spheres onto the cabochon and

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.939 
balls or spheres onto the cabochon and
I'm<00:04:58.479> using<00:04:58.660> my<00:04:58.840> clay<00:04:59.259> shaper<00:04:59.590> which<00:04:59.740> is

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
I'm using my clay shaper which is

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:08.250 
I'm using my clay shaper which is
basically<00:05:00.580> a<00:05:02.820> silicon<00:05:03.820> rubber<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.300> think<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.750> is

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.890 

it's<00:05:08.890> a<00:05:09.160> soft<00:05:09.730> tip<00:05:10.060> it's<00:05:10.930> not<00:05:11.140> a<00:05:11.170> brush<00:05:12.900> I'm

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
it's a soft tip it's not a brush I'm

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.370 
it's a soft tip it's not a brush I'm
going<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.170> smooth<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:15.930> try<00:05:16.930> make<00:05:17.080> that<00:05:17.230> ball

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
going to smooth that try make that ball

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.470 
going to smooth that try make that ball
into<00:05:17.650> a<00:05:17.920> flat<00:05:18.370> surface<00:05:18.610> like<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:19.150> said<00:05:19.300> there's

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
into a flat surface like I said there's

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.900 
into a flat surface like I said there's
a<00:05:19.570> thin<00:05:19.810> film<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.200> polymer<00:05:20.890> clay<00:05:21.130> liquid<00:05:21.220> on

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
a thin film of polymer clay liquid on

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.240 
a thin film of polymer clay liquid on
top<00:05:22.120> of<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:23.080> cabochon<00:05:23.500> which<00:05:23.770> makes<00:05:24.010> it<00:05:24.160> a

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
top of the cabochon which makes it a

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.790 
top of the cabochon which makes it a
little<00:05:24.340> bit<00:05:24.550> slippery<00:05:25.560> but<00:05:26.560> I'm<00:05:26.620> going<00:05:26.770> to

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
little bit slippery but I'm going to

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.330 
little bit slippery but I'm going to
shape<00:05:27.010> this<00:05:27.480> into<00:05:28.480> a<00:05:28.530> leaf<00:05:29.530> shape<00:05:29.560> and<00:05:30.160> then

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
shape this into a leaf shape and then

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.040 
shape this into a leaf shape and then
take<00:05:30.610> it<00:05:30.870> on<00:05:31.870> one<00:05:32.110> side<00:05:32.640> slightly<00:05:33.640> lower<00:05:34.630> and

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
take it on one side slightly lower and

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:42.000 
take it on one side slightly lower and
more<00:05:35.740> pointed<00:05:36.190> towards<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.610> top<00:05:40.830> you<00:05:41.830> can

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
more pointed towards the top you can

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.940 
more pointed towards the top you can
slide<00:05:42.340> your<00:05:42.370> clay<00:05:42.790> shape<00:05:43.030> or<00:05:43.440> two<00:05:44.440> around<00:05:44.860> the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
slide your clay shape or two around the

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.060 
slide your clay shape or two around the
edges<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.660> move<00:05:46.660> your<00:05:46.930> clay<00:05:47.110> around<00:05:47.380> into<00:05:47.950> the

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
edges and move your clay around into the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.190 
edges and move your clay around into the
shape<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.370> want<00:05:48.490> it<00:05:48.670> your<00:05:49.480> goal<00:05:49.750> here<00:05:50.020> is<00:05:50.170> to

shape you want it your goal here is to

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.510 
shape you want it your goal here is to
make<00:05:50.440> it<00:05:50.800> as<00:05:52.410> thin<00:05:53.410> as<00:05:53.590> possible<00:05:53.650> in<00:05:54.430> the

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
make it as thin as possible in the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.480 
make it as thin as possible in the
middle<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:55.830> give<00:05:56.830> it<00:05:56.920> the<00:05:57.010> shape<00:05:57.220> of<00:05:57.340> a

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
middle and give it the shape of a

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.180 
middle and give it the shape of a
butterfly<00:05:57.610> wing<00:05:58.890> then<00:05:59.890> I'll<00:06:00.010> lay<00:06:00.160> down

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
butterfly wing then I'll lay down

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.740 
butterfly wing then I'll lay down
another<00:06:00.550> ball<00:06:00.820> underneath<00:06:01.090> of<00:06:01.330> it<00:06:01.420> this<00:06:01.570> is

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
another ball underneath of it this is

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.220 
another ball underneath of it this is
going<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:01.960> be<00:06:02.110> at<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.320> bottom<00:06:02.500> of<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:02.950> wing<00:06:04.230> on

going to be at the bottom of the wing on

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.940 
going to be at the bottom of the wing on
the<00:06:05.380> right<00:06:05.650> side<00:06:06.540> I'm<00:06:07.540> not<00:06:07.600> going<00:06:07.870> to<00:06:07.930> press<00:06:08.770> it

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:38.830 
and thinner towards the middle this is
not<00:06:21.800> the<00:06:21.979> best<00:06:22.100> butterfly<00:06:22.639> in<00:06:22.789> the<00:06:22.819> world

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.869 

taking<00:06:39.840> my<00:06:39.960> time<00:06:39.990> with<00:06:40.199> it

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:41.879 
taking my time with it

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:44.059 
taking my time with it
whenever<00:06:42.599> I<00:06:42.689> first<00:06:43.139> pressed<00:06:43.469> down<00:06:43.679> on<00:06:43.800> to<00:06:43.949> the
