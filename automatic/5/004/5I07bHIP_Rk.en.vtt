00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello and welcome to the cooking 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.089
 channel today is about this raised bed 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.189
 Here is the video is a summary 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.450
 from several small video clips 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.280
 the time lapse sometimes after 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.469
 spoken and documented like that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.210
 High ground came the earth 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.289
 push that a bit tight coupÃ© that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.369
 I'll probably do better later 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.770
 again with the stomping 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.140
 I hope the video illustrates that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.430
 Topic a bit and if 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.430
 you have questions you write 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
 just in the comments 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.000
 The tech boards will later be used for this 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 stand tall with paint and discovered s 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.200
 Boards that have been treated as 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 europallets i know so they are 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
 with pesticides or something else 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.360
 it puts a strain on it but we go in it 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.780
 high will be later inside with pond film 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 is lined to the extent is 120 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.059
 long so 18 high june to the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.829
 pages are very nice to each other and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.340
 then in addition to the squarewood 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.989
 stabilized it can now i have 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 tailored and already in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.739
 screwed here at one point that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.719
 everything is loose and firm almost falling over 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.100
 and yes, anyone can do it as he pleases 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.660
 with the kantholz I feel there 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.560
 simply safer or back on the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.020
 safe site is indeed a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.460
 very calming simple action for 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.900
 the spectator not particularly exciting 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.619
 therefore I would be the same 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 time lapse makes yes why do you leave that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.590
 raise again 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.330
 the glaze can indeed into the earth then 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 go over and burden that 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.380
 but I mean it has a simple one 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.490
 So it is much more resistant 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.990
 against the weather outside the cold heat 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.670
 rain all attacks the wood 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 you do not want it already after 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.520
 one year already it should be coincidental 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.250
 yes, for a while , there are roots on the outside 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.380
 very beautiful chestnut brown launched and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.210
 not yet, but of course I have to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.070
 Just as the pond foil helps 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.630
 nothing but through the scratches and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.500
 the open, they put everything 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.630
 attack surfaces 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.630
 if it later to for exasperation 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.440
 I have the angles ever 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.730
 and while I'm with you 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.960
 are making screw firmly 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.960
 screwed on a diligent helper 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:17.720
 He sees that I can do something 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.240
 just trained and I use 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.370
 for this quite common wood screws 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.440
 There is a picture in every hardware store 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.150
 on or from wood criticism of the holder to 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.220
 Pond foil you can use the pieces 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.080
 to cut in we have in the ground 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.370
 stricher see I have but only once 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.970
 made because the length is not quite 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.980
 was enough 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.770
 but you can also completely here 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.770
 simply start the festive season on the internet 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.720
 when the slides are festgetackert comes 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.480
 still wants to put a piece of fence on it 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.940
 boysen is also stapled and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.459
 then you can go outside like that 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.800
 out here in the garden is now the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.750
 grass sods tapped 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.730
 So you just little filling up 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.010
 will have high and it is fundamentally ibid 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.820
 can do depending on how dickmann it 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.700
 starting here 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.590
 I 've finished tapping all the roots 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.070
 tapped and just more filling for 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.070
 the raised bed 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.040
 the whole thing looks like this 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.810
 and I have to say so I have now 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.010
 I am particularly give a lot of trouble is 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.530
 especially to make even 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:35.300
 I was there the same again at hand 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:37.070
 accept and carry chop through chopped 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.940
 the whole is a lot finer like him 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.220
 just sees 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.170
 and now you can do it perfectly 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.600
 make and it's really nice in 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:49.489
 water of the plates and units is 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.760
 Of course, an activity here too 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.110
 But eating a lot of time is worth it 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.090
 to really do that in the water 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.760
 and to compact in the ground really nice 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.110
 because otherwise then always wrong then 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.820
 I was the ground in one place too 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.140
 if I'm really tight and want it 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.940
 Of course not because we are yes 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.860
 that is wenns times since then 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.420
 do not stop at the chefs in the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.709
 is around and when it gets high 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.780
 then you can already with straub 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.640
 movie but the training I get in 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.650
 next video that would like more detail 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.120
 show if you liked it up 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.120
 let the thumb up there
