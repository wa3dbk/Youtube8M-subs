take<00:00:01.969> a<00:00:01.999> look<00:00:02.300> at<00:00:02.480> a<00:00:02.510> tr3<00:00:03.439> fuel<00:00:03.770> pump<00:00:04.100> and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.450 
take a look at a tr3 fuel pump and

rebuild<00:00:05.450> kit<00:00:05.779> today<00:00:06.759> a<00:00:07.759> problem<00:00:08.480> that<00:00:08.630> I<00:00:08.660> had

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
rebuild kit today a problem that I had

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.860 
rebuild kit today a problem that I had
here<00:00:09.650> was<00:00:09.860> getting<00:00:10.730> gasoline<00:00:11.390> in<00:00:11.780> the

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
here was getting gasoline in the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.680 
here was getting gasoline in the
crankcase<00:00:12.290> and<00:00:12.800> I<00:00:13.550> presume<00:00:14.240> that<00:00:14.270> it's

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
crankcase and I presume that it's

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.990 
crankcase and I presume that it's
getting<00:00:15.050> there<00:00:15.290> via<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.040> fuel<00:00:16.340> pump<00:00:16.640> I

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
getting there via the fuel pump I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.630 
getting there via the fuel pump I
rebuilt<00:00:17.960> this<00:00:18.230> years<00:00:19.100> ago<00:00:21.100> this<00:00:22.100> kid<00:00:22.460> is

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
rebuilt this years ago this kid is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.980 
rebuilt this years ago this kid is
marked<00:00:23.320> genuine<00:00:24.320> AC<00:00:25.240> rather<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:26.480> diaphragm

is<00:00:27.170> marked<00:00:27.470> genuine<00:00:27.920> AC<00:00:28.130> it's<00:00:29.119> a<00:00:29.210> rubbery

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
is marked genuine AC it's a rubbery

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.679 
is marked genuine AC it's a rubbery
material<00:00:30.280> there's<00:00:31.280> two<00:00:31.520> layers<00:00:31.789> here<00:00:32.450> and

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
material there's two layers here and

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.950 
material there's two layers here and
this<00:00:33.350> rubbery<00:00:34.070> material<00:00:34.160> is<00:00:34.820> also<00:00:35.000> labeled<00:00:35.540> AC

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
this rubbery material is also labeled AC

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.729 
this rubbery material is also labeled AC
I<00:00:36.550> presume<00:00:37.550> somewhere<00:00:38.120> this<00:00:38.750> is<00:00:39.020> cracked<00:00:39.440> and

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
I presume somewhere this is cracked and

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.650 
I presume somewhere this is cracked and
fuel<00:00:40.070> is<00:00:40.220> going<00:00:40.610> through<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.360> getting

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
fuel is going through it and getting

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.400 
fuel is going through it and getting
into<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.140> crankcase<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:43.750> got<00:00:44.750> this<00:00:44.899> rebuild

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410

know how serious an issue that is the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.550 
know how serious an issue that is the
seal<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.910> still<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.390> there<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.350> certainly

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
seal is still in there and I certainly

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.800 
seal is still in there and I certainly
wouldn't<00:02:50.950> look<00:02:51.160> forward<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.790> trying<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.330> UNCHR

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
wouldn't look forward to trying to UNCHR

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.040 
wouldn't look forward to trying to UNCHR
imp<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.200> ring<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.390> replacing<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.420> seal

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
imp this ring and replacing that seal

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.990 
imp this ring and replacing that seal
even<00:02:56.920> if<00:02:57.040> there<00:02:57.220> was<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> new<00:02:57.610> one<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:57.910> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
even if there was a new one in the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.960 
even if there was a new one in the
rebuild<00:02:58.390> kit<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.900> understand<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> $50<00:03:00.489> rebuild

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
rebuild kit I understand the $50 rebuild

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.840 
rebuild kit I understand the $50 rebuild
kit<00:03:01.209> also<00:03:01.450> includes<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:02.170> new<00:03:02.350> brass<00:03:03.040> screen

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
kit also includes a new brass screen

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.680 
kit also includes a new brass screen
part<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.050> sediment<00:03:05.560> bolt<00:03:06.300> but<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:07.480> is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
part of the sediment bolt but this is

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:15.509 
part of the sediment bolt but this is
fine<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.020> can<00:03:08.290> use<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.830> again<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:14.160> think<00:03:15.160> these

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
fine I can use that again I think these

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:22.830 
fine I can use that again I think these
valves<00:03:16.150> are<00:03:16.299> working<00:03:16.720> fine<00:03:19.350> but<00:03:21.630> since<00:03:22.630> I'm<00:03:22.810> in

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
valves are working fine but since I'm in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.509 
valves are working fine but since I'm in
the<00:03:23.049> neighborhood<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.620> guess<00:03:23.799> I'll<00:03:24.130> install

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
the neighborhood I guess I'll install

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.300 
the neighborhood I guess I'll install
the<00:03:24.580> new<00:03:24.910> ones<00:03:25.530> again<00:03:26.530> I'll<00:03:26.680> likely<00:03:27.010> stick

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
the new ones again I'll likely stick

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.720 
the new ones again I'll likely stick
with<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:27.730> gasket<00:03:28.090> at<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.750> engine<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.730> I'm

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
with this gasket at the engine and I'm

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.240 
with this gasket at the engine and I'm
not<00:03:30.970> going<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.239> replace<00:03:31.600> this<00:03:32.019> diaphragm<00:03:32.560> seal

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
not going to replace this diaphragm seal

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.539 
not going to replace this diaphragm seal
even<00:03:34.150> if<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.390> kid<00:03:34.600> had<00:03:34.870> one<00:03:35.320> I<00:03:35.560> think<00:03:36.310> that's

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
even if the kid had one I think that's

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.140 
even if the kid had one I think that's
beyond<00:03:37.000> my<00:03:37.920> interest<00:03:38.920> in<00:03:39.130> ambition<00:03:39.579> at<00:03:39.940> this

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
beyond my interest in ambition at this

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.810 
beyond my interest in ambition at this
time<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.660> thanks<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:44.980> sure<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.340> watch<00:03:45.519> my
