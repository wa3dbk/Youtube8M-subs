00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello good this video is for 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.180
 present you the new lost exits 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.960
 of the pro we reach the blacks to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.500
 2014 season 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.500
 so 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.699
 let's do a brief inspection of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.340
 the new ones of these mountains and their cover 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.030
 because as you can see it does not have 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.480
 Monsieur breathing exercises 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.980
 There are two small holes for them to 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.370
 ask for the order when saving them 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.860
 but it's not like the other way the other 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.320
 way I had more buildings to shoot 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.290
 in three feet 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.290
 let's open the cover of the color 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 let's do better 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.620
 these inscriptions are for 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.910
 to know how the glove is washed 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.910
 and how it has to be used to 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.090
 so they do not break 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.259
 Mercedes 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.259
 here is the glove 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.920
 It's very good 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.890
 Y 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.130
 has here a color combination of 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.130
 blue 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.890
 and as white as coming up 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.610
 down and here it's like honeycombs 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.590
 from bee 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.050
 the on 2 this finger always always changes 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.020
 it's never to be the same 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.710
 also all the others although this 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 has a combination of red because of 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.420
 the palm of the glove 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.030
 let's see in the middle of January fat 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.330
 these little inlays I do not know if 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.080
 you will see it I think so in the video 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.620
 it's like he has a volume that goes for 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.620
 down and up 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.110
 at the time of closing and entering the glove 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.150
 to put this link that does not escape 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.159
 the closure is elastic that you can adjust 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.159
 in your way you have a small sprain 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.390
 he squeezes a lot to mount tension in 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.530
 change is little and here 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.940
 at the end of the closing 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.380
 the name of the glove holder appears 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.380
 it's a hand on the web 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.430
 that also comes with a small 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.790
 help 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.439
 I do not have it right now 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.540
 but it comes with a little gel for 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.180
 that they can wash the instructions 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.400
 They would not do any good, I'm not going to put 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.400
 the glove so you can see how normal it was 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.670
 and if a goalkeeper 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.080
 vistalegre that uses everything from adidas you can 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.420
 check is very good at the time of 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.239
 put on your gloves and when it's time to stop 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.030
 also imagine imagine that you are going to 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.190
 stop and stick out your hand and reflected 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.190
 because the red ies looks a lot 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.390
 good 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.350
 it's the glove we leave it to me 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.660
 here 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.660
 here is the other 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.549
 it's the same as it is for the other hand 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.049
 We are going to show you the old glove that 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.049
 it is also a predator 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.110
 but also but it was used not only 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.539
 Manuel denied but also others 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.400
 goalies as squares 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.529
 peter check 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.659
 and else 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.389
 It also looks nice but if it was the 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:41.949
 new would be better if it is already adapted 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:46.260
 I have no more to my hand, I do not know how else 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.720
 molded to me to my hand 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.570
 As you can see, it's made dust falling in 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.420
 chunks and over here by adidas is a lot 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.510
 use it 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.610
 canceled two years ago so they are very 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.759
 good ones 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.740
 for two years during these we are going to 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:07.849
 leave it here too 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.099
 buy if you try it 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.380
 I already made a video about these gloves 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.990
 just here 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.950
 I have been able to prove they are not similar in 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.460
 nothing 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:25.340
 and here are my pumps that are also 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.340
 adidas are both new editions 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.070
 about the night 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:36.440
 2.0 mid-range mid -range tacos de 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.930
 natural grass because I play the grass 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.740
 natural 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.780
 ah 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.370
 this is to put the microchip in 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.349
 count the kilometers a few kilometers 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.539
 etcetera that you do what you are losing 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.120
 of weight and the exercise that you're 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.639
 doing 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.030
 and this is for when they talk two and 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:02.380
 that's how life comes back so when you 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:05.529
 you're going to jump example is high and you do not have 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:09.299
 than to return to the same position 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.299
 and we also had it here 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.550
 and nothing else I have nothing more than 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.639
 show you this mountain costs about 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.250
 doormen 64 euros is very good if 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.470
 you want to wait for me to come down 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.630
 principle is I think it seems good 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.120
 what you can find are the doormen 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.010
 What happens is that I will not get 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.700
 the size eight and a half up you have 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.950
 what to call 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:40.260
 and when calling, they will tell you that 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:41.850
 there are more sizes so this is 8 and the 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.920
 way of eight and a half and I dropped it but 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.590
 I called and nothing and I got eight and 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.900
 half 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.940
 and nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:55.430
 video if you want to subscribe subscribe 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.289
 if you liked to like it if not 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.820
 give it like 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.640
 and nothing 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.510
 I spent a good day enjoying the 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.510
 gloves and shopping
