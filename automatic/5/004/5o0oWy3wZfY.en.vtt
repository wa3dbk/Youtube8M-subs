this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.469> free<00:00:01.620> motion<00:00:01.800> quilting

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
this is the free motion quilting

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.670 
this is the free motion quilting
tutorial<00:00:02.639> for<00:00:02.850> whirlpools<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.650> a

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
tutorial for whirlpools this is a

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.160 
tutorial for whirlpools this is a
foundational<00:00:05.160> design<00:00:05.850> so<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.420> design<00:00:06.990> is

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
foundational design so this is design is

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.379 
foundational design so this is design is
going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.529> start<00:00:07.799> out<00:00:07.980> with<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.610> foundational

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
going to start out with a foundational

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.100 
going to start out with a foundational
line<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.679> align<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.719> circles<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
line and that is align with circles and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.509 
line and that is align with circles and
then<00:00:13.259> you're<00:00:13.410> going<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.620> going<00:00:13.889> inside<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
then you're going to going inside the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.570 
then you're going to going inside the
circle<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> closed<00:00:16.170> spiral<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.430> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
circle with a closed spiral and that is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.359 
circle with a closed spiral and that is
a<00:00:17.609> spiral<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.449> fill<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> entire<00:00:19.650> circle

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
a spiral that you fill the entire circle

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.279 
a spiral that you fill the entire circle
with<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.760> then<00:00:21.000> travel<00:00:21.510> your<00:00:21.630> way<00:00:21.689> back<00:00:22.080> out

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
with and then travel your way back out

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.590 
with and then travel your way back out
this<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> create<00:00:23.760> some<00:00:24.269> thread

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
this is going to create some thread

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.769 
this is going to create some thread
build<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.670> extra<00:00:26.670> dimension<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> these

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
build up and extra dimension to these

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.150 
build up and extra dimension to these
areas<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.380> way<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:28.710> stand<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
areas so that way they stand out a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.120 
areas so that way they stand out a
little<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.550> better<00:00:30.380> you're<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.859> stitch

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
little bit better you're going to stitch

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.220 
little bit better you're going to stitch
very<00:00:32.579> carefully<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.120> how<00:00:33.450> slowly<00:00:33.899> I'm

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
very carefully you see how slowly I'm

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
very carefully you see how slowly I'm
stitching<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.250> my<00:00:35.399> spiral<00:00:35.730> you're<00:00:36.329> going

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
stitching out of my spiral you're going

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.299 
stitching out of my spiral you're going
to<00:00:36.540> connect<00:00:36.960> back<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.559> outside<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
to connect back with the outside of that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.330 
to connect back with the outside of that
circle<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.690> continue<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.649> slightly

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
circle and then continue your slightly

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
circle and then continue your slightly
wiggly<00:00:41.969> wavy<00:00:42.360> line<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.140> take<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
wiggly wavy line and you can take this

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.369 
wiggly wavy line and you can take this
anywhere<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.250> filling<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> 4-inch<00:00:45.780> block

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
anywhere I'm filling just a 4-inch block

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.500 
anywhere I'm filling just a 4-inch block
with<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.890> design<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.149> could<00:00:48.300> easily

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
with this design but you could easily

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.869 
with this design but you could easily
fill<00:00:48.989> an<00:00:49.110> entire<00:00:49.230> quilt<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.100> us<00:00:50.280> keep<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
fill an entire quilt with us keep that

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.840 
fill an entire quilt with us keep that
in<00:00:51.000> mind<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> rest<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> design

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
in mind so really the rest of the design

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
in mind so really the rest of the design
is<00:00:54.329> created<00:00:54.989> by<00:00:55.199> stitching<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
is created by stitching this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
is created by stitching this
foundational<00:00:56.969> line<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.829> circles<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> spirals

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
foundational line of circles and spirals

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.090 
foundational line of circles and spirals
connected<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> wiggly<00:01:00.660> line<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.199> then

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
connected with a wiggly line and then

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.740 
connected with a wiggly line and then
we're<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> move<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> second

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
we're going to move on to the second

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.679 
we're going to move on to the second
half<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> design<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.600> using<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
half of the design and that is using the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
half of the design and that is using the
foundation<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> you've<00:01:07.619> created<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.520> this

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
foundation that you've created with this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.210 
foundation that you've created with this
line<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.180> circles<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.290> fill<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> rest<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.130> your

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
line in circles to fill the rest of your

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.820 
line in circles to fill the rest of your
quilting<00:01:11.610> space<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.930> let's<00:01:13.110> start<00:01:13.350> saying<00:01:13.560> how

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
quilting space so let's start saying how

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.210 
quilting space so let's start saying how
some<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.369> works<00:01:14.580> now<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
some of that works now so when you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700 
some of that works now so when you
finish<00:01:18.030> completely<00:01:18.750> filling<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.350> quilting

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
finish completely filling your quilting

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730 
finish completely filling your quilting
space<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.580> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.850> reaching<00:01:21.780> every<00:01:21.960> area

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
space just kind of reaching every area

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.050 
space just kind of reaching every area
with<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.430> wiggly<00:01:24.060> line<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:25.439> occasional

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
with this wiggly line and an occasional

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
with this wiggly line and an occasional
circle<00:01:27.060> with<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> spiral<00:01:27.840> inside<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> then

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
circle with a spiral inside of it then

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.679 
circle with a spiral inside of it then
you're<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> go<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:30.450> going

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you're going to go in and you're going

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.679 
you're going to go in and you're going
to<00:01:30.869> echo<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.979> foundational<00:01:32.729> line<00:01:32.970> you're

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to echo this foundational line you're

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
to echo this foundational line you're
just<00:01:33.869> simply<00:01:34.079> stitching<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> set<00:01:35.100> distance

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
just simply stitching a set distance

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.149 
just simply stitching a set distance
away<00:01:35.880> from<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.509> original<00:01:36.810> line<00:01:37.290> whenever

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
away from that original line whenever

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.490 
away from that original line whenever
you<00:01:38.579> reach<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> circles<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:40.079> simply

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you reach one of the circles just simply

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.999 
you reach one of the circles just simply
pivot<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> kind<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> work<00:01:42.210> around<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.110> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
pivot and kind of work around it it is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
pivot and kind of work around it it is
meant<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.579> change<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.750> texture<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
meant to change the texture of the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.920 
meant to change the texture of the
design<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.610> good<00:01:47.759> thing<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.240> helps

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
design so that's a good thing it helps

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.789 
design so that's a good thing it helps
to<00:01:49.110> make<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.439> design<00:01:50.030> change<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.770> kind<00:01:52.770> of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to make the design change and kind of

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.219 
to make the design change and kind of
flow<00:01:53.250> around<00:01:53.850> those<00:01:54.299> circles<00:01:54.720> which<00:01:54.930> are<00:01:55.020> your

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
flow around those circles which are your

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499 
flow around those circles which are your
whirlpools<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.640> gives<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> really

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
