I don't know how this is going to do I

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.149 
I don't know how this is going to do I
never<00:01:48.390> tried<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.600> before

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159

yeah that went through so it's doing
pretty<00:01:57.280> good<00:01:57.520> on<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.700> twine

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.400 

again<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.440> isn't<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.770> sharpest<00:02:05.950> knife

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
again this isn't the sharpest knife

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.280 
again this isn't the sharpest knife
nothing<00:02:08.410> like<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> moral<00:02:09.040> or<00:02:09.930> anything<00:02:10.930> scandi

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
nothing like a moral or anything scandi

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.220 
nothing like a moral or anything scandi
ground<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.340> simple<00:02:15.610> grind<00:02:15.850> though<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
ground just a simple grind though so and

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.490 
ground just a simple grind though so and
it<00:02:17.860> does<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.130> trick<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.990> would<00:02:20.170> be<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> great

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
it does the trick this would be a great

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.320 
it does the trick this would be a great
night<00:02:20.530> for<00:02:20.890> ED<00:02:21.250> scene<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:21.940> had<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.120> cut<00:02:22.300> a

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
night for ED scene if you had to cut a

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.570 
night for ED scene if you had to cut a
lot<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:23.400> rope<00:02:24.400> open<00:02:24.910> boxes<00:02:26.220> things<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.370> that

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
lot of rope open boxes things like that

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.110 
lot of rope open boxes things like that
also<00:02:28.360> makes<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.810> good<00:02:28.960> tactical<00:02:29.530> blade<00:02:30.120> sike

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
also makes a good tactical blade sike

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.260 
also makes a good tactical blade sike
almost<00:02:32.310> probably<00:02:33.310> almost<00:02:33.430> 4<00:02:33.700> inches<00:02:33.730> long<00:02:34.120> i

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
almost probably almost 4 inches long i

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:50.160 
almost probably almost 4 inches long i
don't<00:02:34.420> know<00:02:37.290> I'd<00:02:38.290> say<00:02:38.500> three

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.000 

so<00:02:50.770> it's<00:02:51.040> doing<00:02:51.220> pretty<00:02:51.280> good<00:02:52.800> slices<00:02:53.800> through

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
so it's doing pretty good slices through

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.530 
so it's doing pretty good slices through
twine<00:02:54.840> pretty<00:02:55.840> well<00:02:56.970> sliced<00:02:57.970> up<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.270> milk

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
twine pretty well sliced up this milk

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.160 
twine pretty well sliced up this milk
jug<00:02:58.780> pretty<00:02:59.050> well<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.470> it<00:03:00.370> still<00:03:00.640> got<00:03:01.300> pretty

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
jug pretty well and it still got pretty
