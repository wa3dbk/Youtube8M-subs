00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
crystallized you just set this you would

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.050 
crystallized you just set this you would

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
and it would D crystallize but since

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.500 
and it would D crystallize but since
this<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.040> similar<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.760> sugar<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.330> its

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
this is similar to sugar in its

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.320 
this is similar to sugar in its
consistency<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:54.430> not<00:01:54.729> going<00:01:54.910> to<00:01:55.000> worry<00:01:55.210> about
