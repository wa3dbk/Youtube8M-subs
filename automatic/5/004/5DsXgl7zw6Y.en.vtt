00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.399
 stomach to go to Toulouse so we go 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.840

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.170
 I already install installed a theme of a 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.509

 he compared years is pretty good 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:46.880

 first caddoc and the startup and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.010
 stop or six 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.380

 understanding you what are you going 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.550
 to make it ugly we will be depending on 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 your choices be created a little misstep so 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.000
 you want to create my own 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.120
 others after we did create a city 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.550

 is efficient 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.669
 I reach the sculptors not that the 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:44.039
 bar it had appeared in the summer his side 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.469
 very badly placed under galley to be able to 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:50.969
 mastery and after I found so 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:53.240
 this is a little tutorial for them have 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:57.330

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.199
 reminds you of the faÃ§ade and 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:10.710
 speak because when do you when 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:13.620
 you will choose a so theme pack 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.750
 rather die a theme imagine hop on 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.699
 like it does more information 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.469
 and there you will see if it's 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.539
 already compatible with this country visit to 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:24.300
 brussels m i do not have much there 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.529
 seems compatible with xp vista and so 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.699
 to you will see the features 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.560
 that is, we are not going to 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.599
 police we will not have understood it in the 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.210
 pack and nice morning I do not know what 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.860
 it would have done all that is reversed 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.680
 what you understand you will have in the 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.919
 pack of course by going on more 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.409
 that opaque software that they are not 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.659
 great thing to choose in any case as I 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.520
 have already shown you do install are 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:52.979
 we can not always choose what we 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:57.199
 will not be so here it was for 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:59.699
 this little one will show you what 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:02.990
 how to change health rages so voila

 as you could see being able to have 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.370
 totally changed landscapes that makes 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.409
 good but will always mean that 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.770
 same landscape you're coming home was 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:17.060
 in this good too why I had 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.060
