what sort of students can come on this
course<00:00:42.989> well<00:00:43.860> obviously<00:00:43.950> you've<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> have

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
course well obviously you've got to have

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.720 
course well obviously you've got to have
a<00:00:44.670> degree<00:00:45.350> we<00:00:46.350> would<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> 2<00:00:47.309> 2

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
a degree we would like you to have a 2 2

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.869 
a degree we would like you to have a 2 2
or<00:00:47.969> better<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.390> an<00:00:48.600> equivalent<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.850> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
or better or an equivalent to that and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.639 
or better or an equivalent to that and
obviously<00:00:51.600> students<00:00:51.930> who've<00:00:52.020> got<00:00:52.170> biomedical

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
obviously students who've got biomedical

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.920 
obviously students who've got biomedical
science<00:00:52.980> degrees<00:00:53.340> would<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.870> obviously<00:00:54.870> very

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
science degrees would be obviously very

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.830 
science degrees would be obviously very
welcome<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:55.980> degrees<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.940> biological

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
welcome but also degrees like biological

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.099 
welcome but also degrees like biological
science<00:00:58.559> genetics<00:00:59.280> biochemistry<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.719> even

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
science genetics biochemistry or even

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.650 
science genetics biochemistry or even
perhaps<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.620> bit<00:01:01.829> wider<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.309> field<00:01:02.660> such

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
perhaps a little bit wider a field such

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.170 
perhaps a little bit wider a field such
as<00:01:03.690> physiotherapy<00:01:04.320> or<00:01:04.920> even<00:01:05.280> nursing<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
as physiotherapy or even nursing so this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.200 
as physiotherapy or even nursing so this
is<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> strong<00:01:07.130> biological<00:01:08.130> element<00:01:09.060> within

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
is a strong biological element within

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.590 
is a strong biological element within
the<00:01:09.510> degree<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.979> welcome<00:01:11.400> both<00:01:11.610> home<00:01:12.180> students

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the degree we welcome both home students

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.440 
the degree we welcome both home students
and<00:01:12.840> overseas<00:01:13.229> students<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> course<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
and overseas students of course and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
and overseas students of course and
Brighton<00:01:15.450> has<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> particularly<00:01:16.229> good<00:01:17.220> support

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
Brighton has a particularly good support

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.550 
Brighton has a particularly good support
system<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.630> overseas<00:01:19.170> international

will<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:24.900> well<00:01:25.619> we've<00:01:25.770> put<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.040> course

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
will I do well we've put the course

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.300 
will I do well we've put the course
around<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.850> core<00:01:27.090> modules<00:01:27.710> which<00:01:28.710> stress

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
around some core modules which stress

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
around some core modules which stress
the<00:01:29.780> pathology<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.140> molecular<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
diagnostic processes at that level as

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.340 
diagnostic processes at that level as
well<00:01:38.150> because<00:01:39.150> we're<00:01:39.329> also<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.840> pharmacy

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
well because we're also a pharmacy

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.960 
well because we're also a pharmacy
department<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.070> biomedical<00:01:41.490> science

department as well as biomedical science

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
department as well as biomedical science
department<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.619> number<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.280> home

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

department we have a number of home
colleges<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.270> we've<00:01:45.390> built<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.619> level

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
colleges here so we've built in a level

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.929 
colleges here so we've built in a level
of<00:01:47.610> pharmacology<00:01:48.360> into<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.780> MSC<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.409> well

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
of pharmacology into this MSC as well

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.100 
of pharmacology into this MSC as well
because<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.060> find<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.600> area<00:01:51.930> where

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

you've<00:02:35.660> got<00:02:35.840> your<00:02:36.080> project<00:02:36.650> where<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:36.890> join

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
you've got your project where you join

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.240 
you've got your project where you join
one<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.400> our<00:02:37.550> groups<00:02:37.910> research<00:02:38.810> groups<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.920> do
