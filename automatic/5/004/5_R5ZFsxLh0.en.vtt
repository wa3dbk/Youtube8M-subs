00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:15.379

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.379
 when i have it 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:32.820

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.400
 it has cost me time to go up I know that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.800
 It's not easy , I'm not going to give up anymore 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.110
 We have strength and desire to continue if there 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.059
 many rimmers but little is going 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.129
 because my time has cost me to 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.500
 go up if you think it's possible in 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.840
 try it there are names like the badge 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 of helium that in front of mic all this are 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.280
 you win with passion but a dog arrives 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.850
 has to see is the number of each dog 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.239
 spicy the first you do not want to get 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.110
 here I burned my eyebrows to open 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.960
 come to me that if you love the rhythm 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.100
 in the manuel and here that are so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 good and since they are the style more 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 written does not present nor tunnel my 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.110
 failures that before the beginners 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.410
 of very large accounts 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.290
 they can not do it well I come 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.760
 feeling good about what the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.160
 reale rappel the reale rap because I do not know 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.650
 what I started, I just know that the 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.810
 always faithful culture since the one that 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.729
 want to overcome us is not easy when 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.770
 I started who came here to record with me 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.600
 and now they all fall into balls tell me 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.520
 take out the roll and I tell them hold on 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.040
 time each one arrives alone so 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.200
 only practice evolves soon as 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.200
 I do not feel Belgian cock today because they are 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:08.649
 many but that's how I play it I follow it 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:08.649
 making you aspe we already see that we are 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.130
 and is that that hand is good I'm going 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.510
 because in my time it has cost me to 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.120
 get up that is not affiliating I'm going to 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.580
 desist from that having strength and desire 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.120
 to follow if there are many older but 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 whatever 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.940
 Try it 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.740
 as simple of what in front of me everything 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.630
 this is passionate but it is in 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.160
 you when my time of grace comes like this 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.450
 that everyone will listen will say that how 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.800
 is that I'm going to give you what you write 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.450
 a loose wheel conquers the time of 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.600
 my lai mirroring that everything is like 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.300
 format of the evil of the masters and the corts 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.150
 when you dress rhyme and convert murderers 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.250
 and who esteem knows of my effort of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.470
 your eyes want to know more about hip hop 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.930
 feeling is with me comes more of him 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.240
 for me the essence consciousness from the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.310
 adolescence with a fixed rhythm without pressure 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.320
 and always with patience that the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.390
 audience that all this starts with 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.200
 desire to give more and more is your reward 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.600
 we'll see 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.340
 if we want that 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.680
 we will also give you the extremes 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.680
 final master's counseling 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.120
 because my time has cost me to 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.880
 climb I know it's not easy anymore I'm not going to 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.160
 give up because we have because you want to 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.500
 follow if there are many rimmers but 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.990
 few I felt because in my time I have 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.210
 cost to raise if you think it 's easy 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.980
 come try it in the mix we are the 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.960
 helium logo that in front of the cni 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.240
 All this is passionate but 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.710
 until the end 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.710
 so taiwan also 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:01.240
 meanwhile in the pause 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.240
 therefore it does not change 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:15.040
 We have more than enough life but it's quiet and here 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.790
 you let it go that looked for it we are in 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.790
 the house
