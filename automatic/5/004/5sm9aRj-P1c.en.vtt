00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.719
 I bring version 3 of my program 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.759
 repairs files double j a program that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.250
 He has been very successful and he liked it 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.130
 much to the youtuber since he has 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.410
 worked perfectly today thanks to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.320
 your comments and your subscriptions in 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.090
 my channel did not discourage me and I kept motivated 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910
 in improving and updating the program 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.369
 thanks to this today the program is more 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 updated and has a base of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 data of possible viruses four times more 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 extensive than the lower versions and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.340
 eliminated trojan viruses with which I 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.010
 capped lately and the best besides 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.870
 to be executable I have also packaged 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.450
 in an installer so they can 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
 install on your computer and do not have 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.629
 have to look for the program in their 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.390
 devices whenever they need 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 In addition to this use has 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 five functions more than insurance them 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.770
 they will like operations calculator 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.960
 basic addition subtraction multiplication and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.359
 division open a website with 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.790
 security program to know what is your 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.930
 zodiac sign program to put 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.240
 icons to your usb 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 delete folder or file that is not left 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.590
 erase so I ask them if the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.480
 program they like to subscribe or that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 at least comment on my channel 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.740
 please be grateful as your 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.450
 comments and their subscriptions me 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.580
 will help me to let youtuber others 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.040
 trust you and be encouraged to download 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.810
 my program well we know that the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.630
 good references are those that count 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.990
 in many things so I ask you to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.970
 help me with an ok now yes we start 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.160
 with the tutorial the first thing to say is 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.530
 Please do not open your device 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.270
 infected on the computer because if it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.490
 they make the device's viruses are 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.920
 they will stick in the system of it another 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.020
 thing is that in this video tutorial only 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.090
 let's see how the first one is used 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 function of this program which is the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.649
 most important and the reason for which 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.570
 indeed the program was created as 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.310
 eliminate viruses like the reiki claire 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 which is the most common in the world of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.750
 computer science and among others its 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.789
 USB storage device as 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.860
 the rest I ask you to try them 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.959
 and discover them because I do not want to be 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.000
 greatly extend the time of the video on 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.900
 program is very complex and is on trial 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.640
 of errors 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.459
 and tells them what to do in case of committing 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.920
 some only read carefully what is 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.959
 asks them and ready if they can not 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.549
 admin ask for it the video of how 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.700
 use all the functions of the 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.379
 program that I will gladly do them ok what 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.090
 first to do will be download the 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.470
 program in the link of the description 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.290
 of the video 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.970
 once downloaded we will have a file 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.310
 rar as we can observe in 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.650
 screen then let's unzip it 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.720
 to extract the program we click 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.430
 right over the file and we choose the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.129
 option to extract here by clicking on 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.379
 it is decompressed once we have a 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.470
 folder with the name package repairs 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.200
 files jj 3 full then we open it and 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.349
 within this we will have two files on 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.170
 name repair files jj v-30 is the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.780
 executable file the name is tutea 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.970
 for files jj is the installer of 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.040
 this program if you want to install it 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.139
 on your computer which I recommend 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.939
 in this case I'm going to use the 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.280
 installable since I have decided that what 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.650
 I want to have on my computer if I 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.750
 they want to install in blog otherwise 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.950
 just run the program giving double 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.319
 click on it 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.989
 as they observed the installation took 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.540
 just a few seconds now I'm going to open the 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.790
 program once opened we will appear 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.590
 something like what they see on the screen 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.480
 we press a key to continue and 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.120
 the program tells us to choose a 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.610
 option in this case type the number 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.010
 one and press enter then it will ask us 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.440
 that we have typed the route of our usb 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.709
 for this we are simply going to start and 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.230
 we open my pc or computer then we watch 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.760
 what letter is the unit identifying 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.519
 where is our 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.290
 device in my case I have enough 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.640
 usb on my computer so I 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.640
 I recommend that for there 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.829
 confusion is preferably recommended 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.620
 connect only the device which 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.360
 we are going to repair thanks to the usb with 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.819
 the problem is the one he used for my 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.489
 entertainment files like videos 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.860
 music and images I can recognize it 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.209
 easily because his name is music and 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.010
 you 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.989
 in this way simply what I have 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.239
 what to do is type in the program the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.150
 letter that identifies that unit in 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.860
 this case is the letter i then the digital 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.760
 in the program and then we press 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.460
 enter and is 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.200
 we were according to the size of the device and 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.420
 of the files that are in our 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.370
 device will take cleaning but 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.110
 can be reassured is not a matter of 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.390
 hours but minutes and maybe of 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.790
 seconds after the process is finished 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.740
 our program will inform us how many 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.900
 virus contained our usb and the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.580
 press enter to continue 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.650
 informs that he will give us the name of the 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.080
 viruses found in our device 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.480
 for this we simply press 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.180
 any key preferably always 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.920
 enter to continue and in this part we 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.320
 will show the name of the viruses that are 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.020
 have removed we press enter to 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.850
 continue and then this next 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.980
 the program will ask us if we want 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.560
 continue in the program to make another 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.180
 thing or if we want to go out then we digita 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.910
 if in case you want to continue in the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.190
 program and not to leave in this case 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.140
 digital that after this we will have 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.210
 a little information about me and we 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.880
 will ask that if we want to visit my 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.920
 channel which I would appreciate them for 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.140
 that they comment and if they wish they subscribe 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.110
 Digita because if in case we want 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.540
 do it or not to exit the program 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.670
 now we will have our usb device 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.010
 clean so now we can 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.560
 access normally and safely to 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.050
 our usb so let's verify that 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.610
 the usb has been cleaned and how 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.900
 can observe the viruses were 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.140
 eliminated 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.390

 I wanted to share today I hope that my 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.020
 program is quite useful and 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.240
