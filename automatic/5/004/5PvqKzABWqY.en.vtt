00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.330
 I have one I have not come out of a fixed headings in nature programs 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.299
 between 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.169
 And then it is created by the pressure to land the money 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.799
 and that has a huge viewing density of between 300 and 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.759
 350 viewers that suggests the regional broadcaster is even better viewed 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.329
 program of the Netherlands 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.869
 it's like it's actually always one of my favorite places already full 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.380
 to photograph 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.760
 it's ever closed 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 and if you look closely you will see the number of customers stepping 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.530
 thus a user can enter the first set of room 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.940
 but this this knowledge stand that place but it really is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.210
 and and the special camera because it 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.340
 the first room of the fair that is also on HD 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.250
 yes so high resolution you can film 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.350
 Daily fact is the one it is a very ordinary camera that allows youth to 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.490
 Searching through your prism can focus it and also take photos 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.930
 very high resolution of 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.439
 21 megapixels 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.049
 if i have more megapixels not everything but good in this case a lot of pixels 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.830
 the site promote the wildlife stand up 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.830
 and much more hamburg 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.870
 hits came from tim vanhee this is quite a nice photo 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.010
 then I can say you know what 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.850
 photo anp during filming 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.690
 know one has a whole range of lenses that you can simply film with 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.570
 extremely large claims of football 16 mean millimeters or a very long one 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.680
 telephoto lens of 500 or 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.940
 and that makes me 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.510
 I immediately have a terribly large lens arsenal at my disposal 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.140
 beside 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.310
 there you can also film in a very photographic way and that is a bit 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.570
 Depending on the lighting conditions you can 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.740
 at that moment, for example, that you work beautifully with little light 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.940
 Depth of field play like that with a photo the seas can be selective sharp 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.890
 apply 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.910
 And you have to be rich in keeping this one a very automatic one 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.460
 the camera is so you can except the exposure you can not set much 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.490
 I now have one in this room 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.339
 and 8 gigabytes and compact flash cards 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.299
 but the sixteen three made compact flash cards you can just 45 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.400
 minutes of film making on behalf of one another on HD quality 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.579
 then it's perfect for me I don't always have to change jobs I have my own 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.369
 camera I like him 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.699
 I can make stills 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.389
 that made top man 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.759
 yes particularly suitable gift 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:34.749
 That is an article that is a typical Dutch photo of two toads 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.129
 actually they are more horses but the two see underwater animals and with one 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.769
 mating ritual and the jury of the 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.569
 division a little later added that also in between I have the first prize in the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.919
 category gentlemen 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.430
 and moby here so attended that behavior and also with a photo 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:52.729
 in the Netherlands and even more fun before the end 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:57.179
 because I am always pictures of sewing and the elephants but this 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.179
 just ask toads for us to get clubs 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.269
 not nice colleagues 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.269
 what is so special about the Dutch landscape 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.789
 special netherlands different landscape is that it is all this 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:13.519
 And that people everywhere can see their influence so you really have to do your best 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.519
 put on or show it on screen right 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.649
 let the party out 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:21.089
 picking up photos 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.489
 no, however, I am puristic I would find it very annoying as my photos 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.860
 the hindsight would not be real
