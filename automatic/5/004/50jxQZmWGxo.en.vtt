00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.460
 to continue with our with our tutorial videos 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.590
 at 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.630
 and coming back with him and with what we had developed in the day 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.409
 previous 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.159
 this is the fly 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:13.839
 we check tiar cuates 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.189
 the cell photo 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.189
 belonging to the left side 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.779
 which is what this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.050
 connect directly to the click 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.369
 of entry 4 as shaka 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.649
 but in this case 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.899
 per cent the same code fashion 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.530
 let's prevent in the previous video 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.690
 and what we do now instead of asking 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.600
 as you have seen it by the pin 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.340
 entry 3 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.309
 which belongs to the milk 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.089
 we are going to ask for the one that will try four that you have 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.760
 belong to others on the left 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.580
 then he simply what we do is change 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.500
 although in changing its parameters good question by 3 1 for the pattern that 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.910
 there is a according to manna signs out they do not 4 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.430
 and there, yes, what I do is simply say what is 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.860
 and already of that the program 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.910
 aesthetically functional percent 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.780
 then what is equivalent so that they can now just experiment 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.469
 for the photo you left to do the same procedure 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.440
 when the bus 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.750
 what it does is simply start the two engines well here the engines in 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.040
 united brik 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.920
 the good work of that level 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.010
 they were going to last 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.050
 percent 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.690
 a time of zero point three seconds 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.760
 lit 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.540
 i percent 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.420
 and again the question 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.340
 if the case has to go there is no light 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.440
 to the subject 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.600
 good question 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.740
 of the number sensor 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 the center-left the pce bonet high impact if it does not detect light what it does 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.200
 it's just smashed engines 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 3 as amcor amco skiers that I have done 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.070
 are going to be the council voted are they going to be turned off 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.110
 we went to try this code again 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.720
 doing the same procedure 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.990
 what is percent 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 program to the central bank a click on the programming button 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.789
 What we do is 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.389
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.389
 give him some that and kaka 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.309
 and the cake to pamper 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.979
 in this one for case this one 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.529
 again commented 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.159
 the the programmer 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.179
 there are robots 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:27.779
 this is what we are going to do now is simply to perisic operate what 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.199
 what we did in the previous day 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.359
 that tourist 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.099
 the operation the photo cells badajoz or cell 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.629
 from the left 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.909
 and we do the same 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.139
 we have to square the sensitivity of our potentiometer 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.919
 so that it does not activate with any light 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.939
 everything and if we go back 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.319
 do not increase 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.069
 percent 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.219
 Yes clear and permanent intention of product to be completely done 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.959
 eva say deactivating with light 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.959
 of environment fallout the room 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.219
 more and more in Syria has a lot of sensitivity 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.150
 this is what it is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.519
 I must prepare to stop them by covering it with my finger 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.349
 the goal is to activate with 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.469
 with the external part 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.119
 which is what I want 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:11.849
 that controls the system 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.849
 Toeman mind set potentiometer completely to the left 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.559
 coli what has led to be in Berlin and the company 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.289
 and place the electric and his death 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.579
 your movement wedding the potentiometer 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.149
 little by little to the right 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:32.149
 to the point where it is activated 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:34.509
 It is done 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.609
 that point is what is 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.129
 You are currently sensini 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.409
 only 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.699
 on the left 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.699
 in light of percent 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.309
 3 what is the moment of that 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.599
 sex 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.059
 the part this year 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:54.589
 In this case we see that it is working 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.210
 if you put a solution only the right part 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.729
 in a week because 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.989
 the colloquy made 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.189
 it is not involving the part sensor 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.489
 in profit 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.789
 simply that they are placing sensor the left leg 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:12.699
 in sciences hinted at something about the left peace effort part 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.989
 at that moment that this 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.599
 doing 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.319
 the lic 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.150
 so the broker 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.530
 has designed for 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.240
 for movement okey for control and motel the prof 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.610
 everything is simply what I do is 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.300
 I directed this sensor goal to the use of the left sensor and we saw that in so 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.210
 soon missive to the use of the sensor 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.180
 the motor 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.129
 the two engines 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.129
 moving making the next to the celac 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.559
 then this is what I wanted to show in this other video tutorial mode 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.169
 ee 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.440
 but so you can see how you think percent 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.340
 about the current commune 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.800
 how are you 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.729
 the way 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.400
 it's easy to program 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.999
 error and work with with these 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.330
 earlier 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.659
 others I say it for now 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.770
 with the expected performance 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.190
 and I hope you continue to see us on this website, and then point 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.550
 robotics course 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.000
 along with any doubt that they have full of this Friday 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.130
 porsche and if they have 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.340
 so who has interested us like that 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.189
 acquire 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.699
 in 12 both 15 x 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.650
 number one that is the the card the roots followed of light 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.800
 hotel quito winner 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.779
 3 percent 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.879
 any reading of the game 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.879
 the concern is only write us in 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.040
 and access to the page 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.340
 and all point dot robotics course
