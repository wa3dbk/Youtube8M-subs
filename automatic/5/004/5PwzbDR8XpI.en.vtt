only<00:00:00.329> at<00:00:00.510> the<00:00:00.599> Indianapolis

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.839 

well<00:00:24.720> when<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> visitor<00:00:25.109> comes<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> center

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
well when a visitor comes to the center

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.790 
well when a visitor comes to the center
I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.570> there<00:00:28.020> are<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.140> number<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.500> really

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
I think there are a number of really

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.819 
I think there are a number of really
important<00:00:29.369> things<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:30.539> are<00:00:31.169> available<00:00:31.259> to

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
important things that are available to

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.299 
important things that are available to
them<00:00:31.949> our<00:00:32.489> overall<00:00:33.120> goal<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:35.070> give<00:00:35.280> people

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
them our overall goal is to give people

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.119 
them our overall goal is to give people
the<00:00:35.910> opportunity<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:37.110> understand<00:00:37.680> orangutans

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the opportunity to understand orangutans

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.780 
the opportunity to understand orangutans
in<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.180> new<00:00:39.390> way<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.589> most<00:00:41.040> likely<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.519> a<00:00:41.610> way

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
in a new way and most likely in a way

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.939 
in a new way and most likely in a way
they<00:00:42.000> haven't<00:00:42.360> appreciated<00:00:42.900> orangutans<00:00:43.620> in

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
they haven't appreciated orangutans in

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.400 
they haven't appreciated orangutans in
the<00:00:44.040> past<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> big<00:00:45.180> issues<00:00:45.540> for<00:00:45.750> us<00:00:45.780> are

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the past so the big issues for us are

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.160 
the past so the big issues for us are
seeing<00:00:47.280> orangutans<00:00:47.730> move<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:48.989> their

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
seeing orangutans move the way their

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.250 
seeing orangutans move the way their
bodies<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.710> designed<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> move<00:00:51.260> watching

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bodies are designed to move watching

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.570 
bodies are designed to move watching
them<00:00:52.670> engage<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:54.089> social<00:00:54.830> behaviors<00:00:55.830> and<00:00:56.129> make

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
them engage in social behaviors and make

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.899 
them engage in social behaviors and make
social<00:00:56.790> choices<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.650> finally<00:00:58.909> provide

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
social choices and finally provide

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.390 
social choices and finally provide
examples<00:01:00.269> of<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:01.379> very<00:01:01.650> intelligent<00:01:02.280> they

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
examples of how very intelligent they

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.969 
examples of how very intelligent they
are<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.820> how<00:01:03.229> cognitively<00:01:04.229> complex<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.949> are

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
are and how cognitively complex they are

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.460 
are and how cognitively complex they are
and<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.700> relate<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> skills<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.290> we

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and we relate that to the skills that we

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.490 
and we relate that to the skills that we
know<00:01:07.590> about<00:01:07.770> orangutans<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> wild<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> if

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
know about orangutans in the wild so if

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.429 
know about orangutans in the wild so if
a<00:01:10.590> visitor<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:11.250> coming<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
a visitor was coming here to see the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.740 
a visitor was coming here to see the
orangutans<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> facility<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.210> think

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
orangutans and see the facility I think

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
orangutans and see the facility I think
there<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.110> several<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.979> important

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
there are several really important

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.300 
there are several really important
features<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.290> worth<00:01:19.439> pointing<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:20.040> if

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
features that are worth pointing out if

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.719 
features that are worth pointing out if
you<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.930> into<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> indoor<00:01:22.500> space<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.520> main

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you go into the indoor space in the main

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
you go into the indoor space in the main
building<00:01:24.210> you'll<00:01:25.020> note<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.710> very

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
building you'll note that it's a very

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
spacious very high indoor space about 50

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
spacious very high indoor space about 50
feet<00:01:28.920> high<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> constructed

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
feet high and it is constructed

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.389 
feet high and it is constructed
specifically<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:32.810> encourage<00:01:33.920> normal<00:01:34.920> styles

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
specifically to encourage normal styles

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.459 
specifically to encourage normal styles
of<00:01:35.609> orangutan<00:01:36.149> movement<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.869> fact<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.259> see

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
of orangutan movement and in fact we see

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.410 
of orangutan movement and in fact we see
that<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.859> a<00:01:37.920> very<00:01:38.249> regular<00:01:38.429> basis<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> Apes

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that on a very regular basis the Apes

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.380 
that on a very regular basis the Apes
use<00:01:39.749> all<00:01:40.229> levels<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.039> space<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.119> move

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
use all levels of that space and move

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
use all levels of that space and move
through<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> quite<00:01:43.140> confidently<00:01:43.829> probably

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
through it quite confidently probably

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.059 
through it quite confidently probably
the<00:01:44.819> most<00:01:45.030> prominent<00:01:45.630> thing<00:01:45.689> are<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.890> very

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
the most prominent thing are the very

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.389 
the most prominent thing are the very
tall<00:01:47.310> towers<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.090> cable<00:01:48.960> system<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:50.249> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
tall towers and cable system that the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.419 
tall towers and cable system that the
orangutans<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.719> daily<00:01:51.960> basis<00:01:52.499> and<00:01:52.710> that

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
orangutans use on a daily basis and that

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.389 
orangutans use on a daily basis and that
tower<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.909> cable<00:01:54.389> system<00:01:54.780> connects<00:01:55.649> all<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
tower in cable system connects all of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.459 
tower in cable system connects all of
the<00:01:56.549> indoor<00:01:56.819> facilities<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.350> the

the indoor facilities and all of the
outdoor<00:01:58.619> yards<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> Apes<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.509> make

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
outdoor yards so the Apes can make

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.349 
outdoor yards so the Apes can make
choices<00:02:01.020> about<00:02:01.229> where<00:02:02.069> they<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.880> who<00:02:03.240> they

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
choices about where they go and who they

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.940 
choices about where they go and who they
want<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> spend<00:02:03.780> their<00:02:03.960> time<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.409> that's<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
want to spend their time with that's a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.249 
want to spend their time with that's a
critical<00:02:05.520> component<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.389> is<00:02:07.020> very

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
critical component that is very

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.380 
critical component that is very
impactful<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.829> visitors<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.819> also<00:02:09.090> very

task<00:02:31.349> with<00:02:31.650> an<00:02:31.799> orangutan<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.879> one<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.239> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
task with an orangutan so one of the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.640 
task with an orangutan so one of the
questions<00:02:33.510> that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
questions that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.360 
questions that
that<00:02:34.829> I<00:02:35.099> hear<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.879> lot<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:37.319> pretty<00:02:37.709> simple<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that I hear a lot is pretty simple and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.940 
that I hear a lot is pretty simple and
and<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:38.970> why<00:02:39.540> did<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:40.049> this<00:02:40.260> why<00:02:40.620> did<00:02:40.799> we

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
and it's why did we do this why did we

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.619 
and it's why did we do this why did we
build<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.310> facility<00:02:41.819> like<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.209> why<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.510> we

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
build the facility like this why do we

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.319 
build the facility like this why do we
have<00:02:42.750> programs<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.439> this<00:02:43.819> why<00:02:44.819> did<00:02:44.879> we<00:02:45.120> go<00:02:45.299> to

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
have programs like this why did we go to

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.050 
have programs like this why did we go to
so<00:02:45.599> much<00:02:45.750> effort<00:02:46.250> for<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.400> particular

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
so much effort for this particular

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.670 
so much effort for this particular
exhibit<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> answer<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.200> really<00:02:49.379> easy

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
exhibit and the answer is really easy

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.460 
exhibit and the answer is really easy
and<00:02:50.010> there<00:02:50.189> are<00:02:50.310> three<00:02:50.519> parts<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.879> it<00:02:51.120> if<00:02:51.780> if<00:02:52.200> we

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
and there are three parts to it if if we

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.949 
and there are three parts to it if if we
look<00:02:52.709> at<00:02:52.980> all<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.909> the<00:02:54.030> populations<00:02:54.720> of

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
look at all of the populations of

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.410 
look at all of the populations of
orangutans<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.950> wild<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:57.090> know<00:02:57.239> that

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
orangutans in the wild we know that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.759 
orangutans in the wild we know that
they're<00:02:57.540> all<00:02:57.689> endangered<00:02:58.049> some<00:02:58.650> are

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
they're all endangered some are

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.520 
they're all endangered some are
critically<00:02:59.250> endangered<00:02:59.400> and<00:03:00.530> unless

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
critically endangered and unless

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.670 
critically endangered and unless
something<00:03:01.859> changes<00:03:02.640> we're<00:03:03.239> looking<00:03:03.659> at<00:03:03.959> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
something changes we're looking at the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.390 
something changes we're looking at the
end<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:05.010> orangutans<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:06.269> Borneo<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.049> Sumatra

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
end of orangutans in Borneo and Sumatra

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.509 
end of orangutans in Borneo and Sumatra
so<00:03:08.420> our<00:03:09.420> primary<00:03:10.019> purpose<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:11.340> call

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
so our primary purpose is to call

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.229 
so our primary purpose is to call
attention<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.359> and<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.950> give<00:03:14.250> people<00:03:14.519> an

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
attention to that and to give people an

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.720 
attention to that and to give people an
experience<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.620> will<00:03:16.829> change<00:03:17.159> their<00:03:17.459> hearts

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
experience that will change their hearts

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.539 
experience that will change their hearts
and<00:03:17.909> mind<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.569> they<00:03:18.840> care<00:03:19.079> more<00:03:19.349> about

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
and mind so that they care more about

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.309 
and mind so that they care more about
what<00:03:20.549> happens<00:03:20.879> to<00:03:20.939> orangutans<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.959> wild

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
what happens to orangutans in the wild

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.589 
what happens to orangutans in the wild
so<00:03:22.530> that's<00:03:22.709> our<00:03:22.829> first<00:03:22.980> reason<00:03:23.459> our<00:03:24.090> our

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
so that's our first reason our our

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.379 
so that's our first reason our our
second<00:03:25.019> reason<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:26.579> we<00:03:26.790> want<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.120> provide

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
second reason is that we want to provide

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.819 
second reason is that we want to provide
orangutans<00:03:27.870> with<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:29.549> wife<00:03:30.239> that's

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
orangutans with a wife that's

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.509 
orangutans with a wife that's
interesting<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.069> engaging<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:33.150> fun<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
interesting and engaging and fun and

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.030 
interesting and engaging and fun and
enriching<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:36.540> challenging<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.680> all<00:03:37.859> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
enriching and challenging and all the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.789 
enriching and challenging and all the
great<00:03:38.220> things<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:39.019> orangutans<00:03:40.019> deserve

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
great things that orangutans deserve

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.409 
great things that orangutans deserve
whether<00:03:41.310> they're<00:03:41.519> living<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:41.970> wild<00:03:42.299> are

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
whether they're living in the wild are

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.390 
whether they're living in the wild are
in<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.629> zoo<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.199> it's<00:03:43.650> really<00:03:43.859> about<00:03:44.069> their

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
in a zoo and it's really about their

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.770 
in a zoo and it's really about their
welfare<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.959> third<00:03:46.139> reason<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.709> us<00:03:46.859> is

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
welfare and the third reason for us is

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.729 
welfare and the third reason for us is
science<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:49.379> want<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.650> understand<00:03:50.129> more<00:03:50.459> about

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
science we want to understand more about

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.229 
science we want to understand more about
orangutans<00:03:52.739> mental<00:03:53.099> abilities<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.940> their

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
orangutans mental abilities and their

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.729 
orangutans mental abilities and their
cognitive<00:03:54.449> skills<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:55.049> want<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.349> share<00:03:55.590> that

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
cognitive skills we want to share that

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.309 
cognitive skills we want to share that
with<00:03:55.889> visitors<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.540> big<00:03:57.720> three<00:03:57.900> reasons

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
with visitors so the big three reasons

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.559 
with visitors so the big three reasons
for<00:03:58.500> us<00:03:58.620> are<00:03:58.799> really<00:03:59.040> simple<00:03:59.280> this<00:04:00.120> was<00:04:00.299> about

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
for us are really simple this was about

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.469 
for us are really simple this was about
conservation<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.680> orangutans<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:03.000> welfare

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
conservation of orangutans the welfare

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.569 
conservation of orangutans the welfare
of<00:04:03.569> orangutans<00:04:03.840> is<00:04:04.199> in<00:04:04.290> our<00:04:04.409> care<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.010> the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
of orangutans is in our care and the

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.720 
of orangutans is in our care and the
science<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:06.060> understanding<00:04:06.599> them<00:04:06.690> better
