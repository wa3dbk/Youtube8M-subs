my tattoo liner in trooper black this is
a<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.399> good<00:00:53.489> formula<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.300> only

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
a really good formula because not only

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.119 
a really good formula because not only
is<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.629> waterproof<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
is it waterproof but just the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.520 
is it waterproof but just the
preciseness<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.719> brush<00:00:57.960> we're<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
preciseness of the brush we're going to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950 
preciseness of the brush we're going to
really<00:00:58.770> put<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.670> good<00:00:59.699> use<00:00:59.940> today<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
really put this to good use today so

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
really put this to good use today so
starting<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.859> part<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> eye<00:01:02.340> I'm

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
starting from this part of the eye I'm

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
starting from this part of the eye I'm
going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> set<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.750> groundwork<00:01:04.199> as

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
going to kind of set the groundwork as

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
going to kind of set the groundwork as
to<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> angle<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
to what the angle is going to be and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.940 
to what the angle is going to be and
obviously<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:07.020> trick<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.740> just

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
obviously a good trick for that is just

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.270 
obviously a good trick for that is just
to<00:01:08.040> follow<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.610> natural<00:01:09.740> direction<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to follow the natural direction of the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.620 
to follow the natural direction of the
bottom<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.790> lid<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> once<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
bottom of your lid so once I have that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
bottom of your lid so once I have that
done<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.860> kind<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
done then I'm going to just kind of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.999 
done then I'm going to just kind of
start<00:01:17.820> building<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.450> shape<00:01:18.920> starting<00:01:19.920> from

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
start building the shape starting from

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.910 
start building the shape starting from
the<00:01:20.130> center<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> eye<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.110> just<00:01:22.110> sliding

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the center of the eye and just sliding

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130 
the center of the eye and just sliding
the<00:01:23.189> tip<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> liner<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> meet

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the tip of the liner all the way to meet

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.920 
the tip of the liner all the way to meet
where<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> end<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> other<00:01:26.250> line<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.930> so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
where the end of the other line is so

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
where the end of the other line is so
I'm<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.979> tattoo<00:01:29.310> liner<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
I'm going to take the tattoo liner and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
I'm going to take the tattoo liner and
just<00:01:29.909> continue<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> line<00:01:31.049> even<00:01:31.470> more<00:01:31.829> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
just continue the line even more so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.940 
just continue the line even more so
towards<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> corner<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.299> eye

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
towards the corner of the eye

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.300 
towards the corner of the eye
once<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:35.729> done<00:01:36.290> I'm<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.590> take<00:01:37.860> my
