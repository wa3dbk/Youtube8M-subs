00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
from the outside casing but I think I

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.240

soaked in wax I have a quarter of one of
these<00:02:06.229> cubes<00:02:06.649> ground<00:02:07.129> up<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:08.090> use<00:02:08.270> for<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.539> fire

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
these cubes ground up to use for a fire

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.660

so I'll just put that in here it's

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.460 
so I'll just put that in here it's
getting<00:02:25.489> like<00:02:25.880> always<00:02:26.300> starting<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.349> get

camera for about five minutes let the
wood<00:02:56.000> pellets<00:02:56.180> start<00:02:56.660> burning<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.200> then<00:02:57.980> I'll

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
wood pellets start burning and then I'll

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.020 
wood pellets start burning and then I'll
come<00:02:58.280> back<00:02:58.400> for<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.730> test<00:02:59.000> be<00:02:59.600> right<00:02:59.810> back

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
come back for the test be right back

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.789 
come back for the test be right back
okay<00:03:02.030> actually<00:03:02.269> it's<00:03:02.510> been<00:03:02.750> going<00:03:03.019> on<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:03.769> a

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
okay actually it's been going on for a

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.559 
okay actually it's been going on for a
little<00:03:03.950> more<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.250> four<00:03:04.580> minutes<00:03:04.790> but<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.420> looks

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
little more in four minutes but it looks

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.940 
little more in four minutes but it looks
like<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.810> have<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.959> pretty<00:03:06.140> good<00:03:06.230> flame<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.890> it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
like I have a pretty good flame and it

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.259 
like I have a pretty good flame and it
looks<00:03:07.130> like<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.700> pellets<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.330> are

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
looks like it's the pellets that are

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.900 
looks like it's the pellets that are
providing<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.390> gas<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:13.400> what<00:03:13.670> I'm<00:03:13.760> going<00:03:13.880> to

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
providing the gas so what I'm going to

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.509 
providing the gas so what I'm going to
do<00:03:14.060> now<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.600> have<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.810> pot<00:03:15.590> here<00:03:15.890> my<00:03:16.100> regular

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
do now is I have a pot here my regular

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.550 
do now is I have a pot here my regular
standard<00:03:16.940> pot<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:18.140> two<00:03:18.350> cups<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.709> water<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.160> it

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
standard pot the two cups of water in it

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.630 
standard pot the two cups of water in it
water<00:03:21.560> setting<00:03:22.040> at<00:03:22.510> 52<00:03:23.510> degrees<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:24.640> let's

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
water setting at 52 degrees and let's

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.180 
water setting at 52 degrees and let's
see<00:03:25.820> where<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.120> goes

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.220 

okay<00:03:30.760> we're<00:03:31.000> eight<00:03:31.180> minutes<00:03:31.570> into<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.020> test

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
okay we're eight minutes into the test

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.660 
okay we're eight minutes into the test
the<00:03:33.220> water<00:03:33.460> temperature<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.150> 107<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:34.990> three

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
the water temperature is 107 and three

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:43.050 
the water temperature is 107 and three
let's<00:03:36.670> see<00:03:36.880> what<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:41.770> outside<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:42.850> don't<00:03:43.000> know

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
let's see what the outside I don't know

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.010 
let's see what the outside I don't know
if<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.210> can<00:03:43.330> see<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.630> red<00:03:43.780> dot<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
if you can see the red dot it's the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.970 
if you can see the red dot it's the
gauge<00:03:47.020> here<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:47.380> telling<00:03:47.650> me<00:03:47.740> that<00:03:47.860> that's

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
gauge here is telling me that that's

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.640 
gauge here is telling me that that's
about<00:03:48.190> 107<00:03:49.150> degrees<00:03:51.930> that's<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:53.050> little<00:03:53.290> warmer

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
about 107 degrees that's a little warmer

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.630 
about 107 degrees that's a little warmer
down<00:03:53.830> below<00:03:54.130> 160<00:03:54.720> about<00:03:55.720> 170<00:03:56.470> down<00:03:56.650> here<00:03:59.610> yeah

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
down below 160 about 170 down here yeah

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.120 
down below 160 about 170 down here yeah
about<00:04:00.940> 115<00:04:01.720> there<00:04:01.960> so<00:04:02.290> it's<00:04:02.560> warm<00:04:02.860> on<00:04:03.040> the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
about 115 there so it's warm on the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.600 
about 115 there so it's warm on the
outside<00:04:03.580> of<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:04.020> stove<00:04:05.460> couldn't<00:04:06.460> pick<00:04:06.580> it

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
outside of this stove couldn't pick it

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.890 
outside of this stove couldn't pick it
up<00:04:06.820> by<00:04:06.970> bare<00:04:07.240> hands<00:04:09.450> let's<00:04:10.450> see<00:04:10.660> where<00:04:10.870> that

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
up by bare hands let's see where that

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.470 
up by bare hands let's see where that
goes<00:04:11.200> from<00:04:11.380> here

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:29.140 

there<00:04:19.080> we<00:04:19.230> are<00:04:19.260> at<00:04:19.590> 210

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:45.870 

211

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.690 

2:12<00:04:46.870> at<00:04:47.520> 12:17<00:04:48.840> 12<00:04:49.840> minutes<00:04:50.260> and<00:04:50.410> 17<00:04:50.740> seconds

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:11.390 

not<00:04:54.700> bad<00:04:54.760> not<00:04:55.330> Gabby

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.270 

there<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.120> soot<00:05:12.389> on<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.660> bottom<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.280> think

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
there is soot on the bottom I think

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.280 
there is soot on the bottom I think
that's<00:05:14.730> probably<00:05:14.910> more<00:05:15.480> from<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.020> wood

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
that's probably more from the wood

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.070 
that's probably more from the wood
pellets<00:05:17.090> remember<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.150> did<00:05:18.389> one<00:05:18.570> of<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.780> tests

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
pellets remember I did one of the tests

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.100 
pellets remember I did one of the tests
the<00:05:19.169> other<00:05:19.320> day<00:05:19.590> with<00:05:19.860> that<00:05:20.210> poor<00:05:21.210> man's<00:05:21.449> Kelly

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
the other day with that poor man's Kelly

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.830 
the other day with that poor man's Kelly
pot<00:05:22.460> where<00:05:23.460> I<00:05:23.490> use<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:24.120> wood<00:05:24.300> pellets<00:05:24.690> and

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
pot where I use the wood pellets and

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.140 
pot where I use the wood pellets and
then<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:25.050> use<00:05:25.229> just<00:05:25.470> regular<00:05:25.590> wood<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:26.970> got

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
then I use just regular wood and I got

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.860 
then I use just regular wood and I got
much<00:05:27.360> less<00:05:27.600> suit<00:05:27.930> with<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.410> regular<00:05:28.860> wood

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
much less suit with the regular wood

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.060 
much less suit with the regular wood
pellets<00:05:30.870> just<00:05:31.080> seemed<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.410> really<00:05:31.710> give<00:05:31.889> off

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
pellets just seemed to really give off

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.870 
pellets just seemed to really give off
stuff<00:05:32.880> but<00:05:33.180> if<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.389> look<00:05:34.520> there's<00:05:35.520> nothing

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
stuff but if you look there's nothing

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.120 
stuff but if you look there's nothing
much<00:05:36.060> in<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.300> way<00:05:36.419> of<00:05:36.570> smoke<00:05:37.050> it's<00:05:37.800> just

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
much in a way of smoke it's just

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.210 
much in a way of smoke it's just
whatever's<00:05:38.550> in<00:05:38.790> that<00:05:39.000> flame<00:05:39.979> solidifies<00:05:40.979> on

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
whatever's in that flame solidifies on

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.270 
whatever's in that flame solidifies on
the<00:05:41.310> cold<00:05:41.580> water

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
the cold water

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.150 
the cold water
pretty<00:05:44.280> nice<00:05:44.490> let<00:05:45.270> me<00:05:45.330> see<00:05:45.479> if<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:45.690> can<00:05:46.100> show<00:05:47.100> you

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
pretty nice let me see if I can show you

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.440 
pretty nice let me see if I can show you
down<00:05:47.430> in<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.940> stove<00:05:52.910> it's<00:05:53.910> kind<00:05:54.120> of<00:05:54.180> big<00:05:54.360> I

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
down in the stove it's kind of big I

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.580 
down in the stove it's kind of big I
don't<00:05:54.600> know<00:05:54.690> if<00:05:54.780> you'll<00:05:54.900> be<00:05:55.020> able<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.260> see<00:05:55.440> the

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
don't know if you'll be able to see the

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.030 
don't know if you'll be able to see the
Jets<00:05:56.090> but<00:05:57.090> down<00:05:57.300> below<00:05:57.450> you<00:05:57.630> see<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:58.110> wood

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
Jets but down below you see the wood

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.730 
Jets but down below you see the wood
pellets<00:05:59.570> just<00:06:00.570> carbonizing<00:06:01.110> or<00:06:01.440> whatever<00:06:01.680> we

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
pellets just carbonizing or whatever we

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.980 
pellets just carbonizing or whatever we
call<00:06:01.919> it<00:06:03.080> this<00:06:04.080> is<00:06:04.139> a<00:06:04.320> wood<00:06:04.560> gas<00:06:04.770> stove<00:06:05.990> where

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
call it this is a wood gas stove where

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.420 
call it this is a wood gas stove where
it's<00:06:07.139> heating<00:06:07.440> up<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.650> wood<00:06:07.770> pellets<00:06:07.950> so<00:06:08.250> they

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
it's heating up the wood pellets so they

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:17.390
