then<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.550> fix<00:00:59.820> for<00:00:59.970> this<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.330> just<00:01:00.690> around<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
onto the bridge because the service is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.410 
onto the bridge because the service is
quite<00:01:06.600> good

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 

then<00:01:10.200> accelerate<00:01:10.680> again<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.250> short

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
