you click the trackpad and actually
accelerate<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.020> project<00:00:49.739> I'll<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.820> this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
accelerate the project I'll so this this

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.680 
click accelerate so the key is you want
to<00:00:55.380> log<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.770> inside<00:00:56.070> let<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> bounce<00:00:57.210> off<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to log it inside let it bounce off the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930 
to log it inside let it bounce off the
wall<00:00:57.900> click<00:00:58.590> down<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> accelerate<00:00:59.430> let<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
wall click down the accelerate let it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.240 
wall click down the accelerate let it
bounce<00:01:00.090> back<00:01:00.450> and<00:01:00.930> basically<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:02.040> keep

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
bounce back and basically kind of keep

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.549 
bounce back and basically kind of keep
clicking<00:01:02.700> but<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.000> too<00:01:03.210> quickly<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:04.259> clear

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
clicking but not too quickly to clear

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.100 
clicking but not too quickly to clear
that<00:01:04.830> middle<00:01:05.309> section<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.450> here's<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:06.990> we're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that middle section so here's what we're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.889 
that middle section so here's what we're
going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.950> we're<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> try<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.899> to

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
going to do and we're going to try it to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.560 
going to do and we're going to try it to
lob<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.440> there<00:01:10.680> accelerate<00:01:11.610> accelerate

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
lob it in there accelerate accelerate

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.040 
lob it in there accelerate accelerate
accelerate<00:01:13.259> accelerate<00:01:13.860> sell<00:01:14.280> exact<00:01:14.660> or<00:01:15.660> are

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
accelerate accelerate sell exact or are

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.770 
accelerate accelerate sell exact or are
we<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.619> last<00:01:16.860> guy<00:01:20.270> okay<00:01:21.270> but

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
we going to get this last guy okay but

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
we going to get this last guy okay but
you<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> point<00:01:22.470> out<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.580> keep

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you get the point out so if you keep

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.749 
you get the point out so if you keep
accelerating<00:01:24.259> you'll<00:01:25.259> eventually<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.100> so

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
accelerating you'll eventually get it so

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
accelerating you'll eventually get it so
let's<00:01:26.970> try<00:01:27.149> again<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:28.459> so<00:01:29.509> fire<00:01:30.509> guy<00:01:30.929> just

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
let's try again here so fire guy just

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.919 
let's try again here so fire guy just
needs<00:01:31.709> to<00:01:31.920> clear<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.399> boundary<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.569> all

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
needs to clear the boundary there all

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.520 
needs to clear the boundary there all
right<00:01:36.649> everything<00:01:37.649> else<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> bonus<00:01:39.470> okay<00:01:40.470> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
right everything else is a bonus okay so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.240 
right everything else is a bonus okay so
with<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> bomb<00:01:41.310> guy<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> lob<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.750> up

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
with the bomb guy you lob it up

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.010 
with the bomb guy you lob it up
somewhere<00:01:44.250> around<00:01:44.429> there<00:01:44.819> oh<00:01:46.490> no<00:01:47.780> that's<00:01:48.780> not

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
somewhere around there oh no that's not

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.410 
somewhere around there oh no that's not
going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.319> do<00:01:51.470> I'll<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:52.619> let's<00:01:52.770> try<00:01:52.950> again<00:01:53.160> here

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
going to do I'll go let's try again here

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.089 
going to do I'll go let's try again here
so<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.569> quite<00:01:54.720> easy<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.679> certainly

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
so it's not quite easy and I'm certainly

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.520 
so it's not quite easy and I'm certainly
not<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.520> expert<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.179> but<00:01:57.509> took<00:01:58.349> me

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
not an expert at this but took me

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.410 
not an expert at this but took me
forever<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:59.009> figure<00:01:59.310> out<00:01:59.490> level<00:01:59.789> 24<00:02:00.209> so<00:02:00.390> i

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
forever to figure out level 24 so i

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.809 
forever to figure out level 24 so i
thought<00:02:00.569> i'd<00:02:00.750> share<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:01.800> again<00:02:02.099> first<00:02:02.580> one

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
thought i'd share it so again first one

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.660 
thought i'd share it so again first one
I'm<00:02:03.780> gonna<00:02:03.899> catch<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.259> first<00:02:04.500> guy<00:02:04.709> there<00:02:05.399> goes<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I'm gonna catch a first guy there goes a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
I'm gonna catch a first guy there goes a
bonus<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.959> then<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.319> go<00:02:10.619> off<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.770> guy<00:02:13.770> with

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
bonus and then we go off to the guy with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.820 
bonus and then we go off to the guy with
the<00:02:14.069> ball<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:15.630> might<00:02:15.810> want<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.170> go<00:02:16.440> there<00:02:16.740> we

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the ball you might want to go there we

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.309 
the ball you might want to go there we
go<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.340> click<00:02:17.520> it'll<00:02:17.910> explode<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:19.200> it

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
go so if you click it'll explode it's it

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.130 
go so if you click it'll explode it's it
easier<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.300> here<00:02:21.450> let's<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.959> try

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
easier and this one here let's just try

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.780 
easier and this one here let's just try
again<00:02:23.840> okay<00:02:24.840> these<00:02:25.140> move<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.430> just

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
again okay these move it up you just

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.050 
again okay these move it up you just
want<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.090> log<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.630> in

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.740
