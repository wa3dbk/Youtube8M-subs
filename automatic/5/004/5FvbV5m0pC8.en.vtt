00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.380
 this hotel this 5 star hotel the 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.310
 highest of europe 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.800
 so we're almost at 2400 m it's a 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.570
 hotel that is bathed in light that is 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.839
 on the south side of val thorens and as 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.760
 means the word kohinoor in Pakistani 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.370
 it means mountain of light 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.070
 so we're really pierced by the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 light and very sunny and very clear 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.199
 but 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.430
 I think what will 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.110
 characterize the crooner on this 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.210
 openness and who will stop in the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.920
 minds it's that good atmosphere it's 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.960
 this quality this simplicity 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.270
 here we have all our partners who are 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.850
 came to help us who put you the water 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.900
 to the mouth by coming to present the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.740
 products we had 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
 worked all winter 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.780
 so I wanted to thank them but at the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.180
 beyond that, it's an event that goes 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.090
 animate the whole valley I am 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.479
 sure and that will give a lot of envied to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 many people 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.320
 it 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.020
 I find great and then I find 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.300
 that the name was well chosen kohinoor on 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.470
 would be that in London kohinoor it's a 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.550
 diamond of 105.6 in two carats which is 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.080
 mounted on the royal crown exposed to the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.820
 round with all the jewels of 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.960
 family is here in val thorens 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.790
 the north cai is also a diamond 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.030
 built up on the top of the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.580
 station and that is actually a hotel and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.070
 a 5 star tourist residence of 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.510
 very very high standard is really 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.340
 we are very proud of this 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.230
 production 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.630
 but me it's just the luxury side 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.819
 any simplicity i like the place i like 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.140
 skiing I like what is and 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.700
 play as I spend myself is I'm going 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.489
 thoroughly I thought I could 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.659
 relax and sold me the dream and I 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.950
 said I 'll come and see if it's true in 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.159
 it's true it's really the real thing 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.879
 ie comfort heat 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.280
 the cocooning spirit 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.930
 but we really in all simplicity 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.950
 sought to bring in the maximum of 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.750
 light in this place 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.849
 see around you there are big 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.290
 picture windows why because everything 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.579
 I just think when we come 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.540
 on vacation in a ski resort 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.669
 like val thorens 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.469
 I think light is what 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.579
 spring this the most people come from 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.829
 take light they do not have in 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.269
 city ​​so they benefit from it and we 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.139
 we wanted to play on it we took advantage 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.139
 from this little wink 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.590
 already very happy to have opened this 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.150
 hotel today respecting our 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.209
 deadlines and to have so many people 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.860
 this inauguration and I wish so 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.860
 a lot of success at this hotel
