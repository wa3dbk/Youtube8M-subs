00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
max health over three seconds so this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.319 
max health over three seconds so this
would<00:01:45.420> help<00:01:45.540> finishing<00:01:46.049> mobs<00:01:47.149> monsters<00:01:48.149> and

that would do a lot of damage five

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.609 
that would do a lot of damage five
percent<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.240> lot<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> 3,000<00:01:52.470> health

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
recipe is it most likely will be a cloth

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.800 
recipe is it most likely will be a cloth
armor<00:02:11.009> and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
armor and

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.339 
armor and
and<00:02:12.430> random<00:02:13.430> items<00:02:13.760> not<00:02:14.060> sure<00:02:14.330> yet<00:02:14.540> obviously

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
and random items not sure yet obviously

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.050 
and random items not sure yet obviously
but<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> cloth<00:02:15.980> armor<00:02:16.160> for<00:02:16.400> sure<00:02:16.550> because<00:02:16.760> cloth

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
but a cloth armor for sure because cloth

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.059 
but a cloth armor for sure because cloth
armor<00:02:17.270> i<00:02:17.390> think<00:02:17.569> is<00:02:17.660> 18<00:02:18.080> or<00:02:18.260> 15<00:02:18.590> armor<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.010> this

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
armor i think is 18 or 15 armor and this

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.250 
armor i think is 18 or 15 armor and this
is<00:02:19.220> 20<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.330> would<00:02:20.569> make<00:02:20.720> sense<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.080> have

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
is 20 so that would make sense to have
