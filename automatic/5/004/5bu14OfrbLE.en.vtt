00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
have gone too far yeah I would go too

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.100 
have gone too far yeah I would go too

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
far so I can't go another hour I have to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.040 
far so I can't go another hour I have to
go<00:02:50.230> by<00:02:50.410> minutes<00:02:50.860> now<00:02:51.070> all<00:02:51.370> right<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.900> had

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
go by minutes now all right so if I had

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.320 
go by minutes now all right so if I had
to<00:02:53.110> pick<00:02:53.350> any<00:02:53.590> number<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.430> go<00:02:54.550> by<00:02:54.730> minutes<00:02:55.180> to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
to pick any number to go by minutes to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.880 
to pick any number to go by minutes to
make<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.630> easier<00:02:56.020> on<00:02:56.140> myself<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.739> would

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
make this easier on myself I would

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.800 
make this easier on myself I would
probably<00:02:57.070> go<00:02:57.310> by<00:02:57.489> 10<00:02:57.790> minutes<00:02:57.970> because<00:02:58.390> 10<00:02:58.780> is

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
probably go by 10 minutes because 10 is

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.870 
probably go by 10 minutes because 10 is
really<00:02:59.110> easy<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.470> add<00:02:59.560> up<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.010> I'm<00:03:00.550> going<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.730> go

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
really easy to add up so I'm going to go

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.810

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
now I can't go 10 more minutes because I

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.880 
now I can't go 10 more minutes because I
would<00:03:36.610> go<00:03:36.730> past<00:03:37.000> my<00:03:37.299> time<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.720> 1109<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.739> make

would go past my time of 1109 that make

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.340 
would go past my time of 1109 that make
sense<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.310> looking<00:03:39.670> at<00:03:39.820> it<00:03:39.989> how<00:03:40.989> many<00:03:41.170> more

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
sense so looking at it how many more

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.810 
sense so looking at it how many more
minutes<00:03:41.500> can<00:03:41.739> we<00:03:41.769> go<00:03:41.950> mr.<00:03:42.220> Witter<00:03:42.370> looks<00:03:42.670> like

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
minutes can we go mr. Witter looks like

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.699 
minutes can we go mr. Witter looks like
two<00:03:43.000> minutes<00:03:43.180> two<00:03:43.570> more<00:03:43.750> minutes<00:03:43.930> okay<00:03:44.320> so<00:03:44.350> my

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
two minutes two more minutes okay so my

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.400

end<00:03:44.890> time<00:03:45.810> was<00:03:46.810> 1109<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.980> am<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:49.510> took<00:03:49.720> me<00:03:49.900> two

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
end time was 1109 I am it took me two
