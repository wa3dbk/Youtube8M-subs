00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.010 
the table and I have found a pair of I
haven't<00:04:53.300> really<00:04:53.540> found<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.810> pair<00:04:53.960> of

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
haven't really found a pair of

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.500 
haven't really found a pair of
sunglasses<00:04:54.199> that<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:54.680> feel<00:04:54.919> prevent<00:04:55.280> that

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
sunglasses that I feel prevent that

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.150 
sunglasses that I feel prevent that
finally<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.630> this<00:04:56.690> is<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.840> very<00:04:57.229> very<00:04:57.440> rare<00:04:57.860> but

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
finally and this is a very very rare but

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.100 
finally and this is a very very rare but
occasionally<00:04:58.729> if<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.479> reflection<00:04:59.960> then

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
occasionally if the reflection then

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.650 
occasionally if the reflection then
angles<00:05:00.560> are<00:05:00.770> just<00:05:01.160> right<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.610> is<00:05:01.760> possible<00:05:02.389> for

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
angles are just right it is possible for

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.240 
angles are just right it is possible for
a<00:05:02.690> player<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.139> see<00:05:03.260> your<00:05:03.410> whole<00:05:03.560> cards<00:05:03.919> if<00:05:04.039> you

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
a player to see your whole cards if you

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.790 
a player to see your whole cards if you
lift<00:05:04.520> them<00:05:04.639> up<00:05:04.820> high<00:05:05.030> enough<00:05:05.300> for<00:05:05.960> any<00:05:06.139> decent

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
lift them up high enough for any decent

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.740 
lift them up high enough for any decent
poker<00:05:07.280> player<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.520> think<00:05:07.699> this<00:05:08.030> is<00:05:08.180> really<00:05:08.510> hard

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
poker player I think this is really hard

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.480 
poker player I think this is really hard
for<00:05:08.900> this<00:05:09.139> event<00:05:09.350> to<00:05:09.500> actually<00:05:09.620> occur<00:05:10.160> but<00:05:10.430> I

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
for this event to actually occur but I

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.460 
for this event to actually occur but I
actually<00:05:10.699> tried<00:05:11.389> it<00:05:11.419> out<00:05:11.630> in<00:05:11.660> my<00:05:11.840> office<00:05:11.870> using

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
actually tried it out in my office using

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.170 
actually tried it out in my office using
a<00:05:12.530> pair<00:05:12.710> of<00:05:12.800> ray-bans<00:05:12.949> and<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.430> was<00:05:13.610> possible

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
a pair of ray-bans and it was possible

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.150 
a pair of ray-bans and it was possible
at<00:05:14.270> certain<00:05:14.539> angles<00:05:14.930> so<00:05:15.500> I<00:05:15.530> thought<00:05:15.800> I<00:05:15.979> would

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
at certain angles so I thought I would

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.980 
at certain angles so I thought I would
bring<00:05:16.310> it<00:05:16.430> up<00:05:16.580> so<00:05:17.210> those<00:05:17.389> are<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.630> pros<00:05:17.840> and

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
bring it up so those are the pros and

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.870 
bring it up so those are the pros and
cons<00:05:18.229> that<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.860> think<00:05:19.130> are<00:05:19.250> relevant<00:05:19.520> from<00:05:19.789> a

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
cons that I think are relevant from a

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.700 
cons that I think are relevant from a
behavioral<00:05:20.389> perspective<00:05:20.570> when<00:05:21.560> you're

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
behavioral perspective when you're

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.189 
behavioral perspective when you're
making<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.310> decision<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:23.570> wear<00:05:23.750> them<00:05:23.960> or<00:05:24.080> not

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
making the decision to wear them or not

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.840 
making the decision to wear them or not
you<00:05:24.590> are<00:05:24.620> really<00:05:25.250> going<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.460> have<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.669> take<00:05:25.760> a

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
you are really going to have to take a

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.189 
you are really going to have to take a
look<00:05:26.120> at<00:05:26.240> your<00:05:26.360> own<00:05:26.479> game<00:05:26.510> and<00:05:26.930> figure<00:05:27.169> out

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
look at your own game and figure out

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.860 
look at your own game and figure out
what<00:05:27.470> is<00:05:27.560> right<00:05:27.710> for<00:05:27.889> you<00:05:28.039> personally<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:29.389> don't

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
what is right for you personally I don't

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.500 
what is right for you personally I don't
wear<00:05:30.080> sunglasses<00:05:30.410> when<00:05:31.400> I<00:05:31.430> play<00:05:31.789> I<00:05:32.030> feel<00:05:32.240> like

wear sunglasses when I play I feel like

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.120 
wear sunglasses when I play I feel like

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
fact that I get much less information

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.870 
fact that I get much less information
out<00:05:36.650> of<00:05:36.680> talking<00:05:37.010> to<00:05:37.160> people<00:05:37.340> with<00:05:37.550> them<00:05:37.700> on
