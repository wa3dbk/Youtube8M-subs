00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to hit a golf ball correctly okay so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.959 
to hit a golf ball correctly okay so
what<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.799> teach<00:01:07.799> people<00:01:08.009> how<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> run

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
what I do is teach people how to run

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.059 
what I do is teach people how to run
smarter<00:01:09.539> and<00:01:09.749> in<00:01:10.170> doing<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.499> they<00:01:10.920> become

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:11.069 
smarter and in doing so they become

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:13.789 
smarter and in doing so they become
better<00:01:11.429> runners<00:01:11.880> running<00:01:12.810> form<00:01:13.139> is<00:01:13.319> important

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
better runners running form is important

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.099 
better runners running form is important
because<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.460> avoid<00:01:14.819> injuries<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.749> you<00:01:15.929> run

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
because you avoid injuries and you run

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.109 
because you avoid injuries and you run
faster<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.249> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.399> biggest<00:01:17.609> mistakes

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
faster one of the biggest mistakes

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.260 
faster one of the biggest mistakes
runners<00:01:18.539> make<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.609> thinking<00:01:20.609> that<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.090> have

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
runners make is thinking that they have

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.230 
runners make is thinking that they have
to<00:01:21.509> run<00:01:22.109> more<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:23.159> become<00:01:23.459> a<00:01:23.670> better<00:01:23.909> runner

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to run more to become a better runner

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.749 
to run more to become a better runner
when<00:01:24.659> actually<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.799> they<00:01:26.069> really<00:01:26.189> need<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> do

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
when actually all they really need to do

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.840 
when actually all they really need to do
is<00:01:26.789> run<00:01:27.270> smarter<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.590> run<00:01:28.829> better<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.340> run

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
is run smarter to run better and run

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.209 
is run smarter to run better and run
faster<00:01:30.389> I<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.499> makes<00:01:31.679> me<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> strong

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
faster I think what makes me a strong

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.309 
faster I think what makes me a strong
