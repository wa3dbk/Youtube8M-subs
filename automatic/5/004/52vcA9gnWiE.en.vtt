00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.920 
much no lag at all um let's see what my
FPS<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.950> as<00:02:15.170> um<00:02:17.000> pong<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
FPS is as um pong get this out of the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:29.240 
FPS is as um pong get this out of the
way<00:02:20.420> I'm<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.720> sure<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.230> shows<00:02:22.560> up<00:02:27.860> yes<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.069> think

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
way I'm not sure it shows up yes I think

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.860 
way I'm not sure it shows up yes I think
it's<00:02:29.340> f2<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.000> can't<00:02:30.209> use<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.390> because

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it's f2 and I can't use that because

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.690 
it's f2 and I can't use that because
it's<00:02:31.020> why<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:33.500> button<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.739> stop<00:02:35.069> recording<00:02:35.100> but

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
it's why a button to stop recording but

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.690 
it's why a button to stop recording but
if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.910> press<00:02:36.090> s<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.300> F<00:02:36.660> 2<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.470> should<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:40.700> if

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
if you press s to F 2 it should be if

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.420 
if you press s to F 2 it should be if
you<00:02:42.330> press<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.930> should<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.580> 30<00:02:44.580> or<00:02:44.700> lower

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
you press up to it should be 30 or lower

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.400 
you press up to it should be 30 or lower
so<00:02:47.430> yeah<00:02:48.150> that's<00:02:48.420> pretty<00:02:48.600> much<00:02:48.810> how<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.080> do<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
so yeah that's pretty much how to do it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
so yeah that's pretty much how to do it
like<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.950> might<00:02:50.160> not<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:50.519> able<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.730> tell

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
like you might not be able to tell

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.140 
like you might not be able to tell
because<00:02:51.209> hypercam<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.989> wee<00:02:52.110> bit<00:02:52.230> laggy<00:02:52.440> but

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
because hypercam is a wee bit laggy but

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.300 
because hypercam is a wee bit laggy but
I'm<00:02:54.150> running<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.690> actually<00:02:55.500> no<00:02:55.530> lag<00:02:56.069> right

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
I'm running like actually no lag right

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.300 
I'm running like actually no lag right
now<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.230> if<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.680> have<00:02:58.769> any<00:02:58.920> other<00:02:59.010> questions
