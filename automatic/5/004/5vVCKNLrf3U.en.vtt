other<00:01:14.760> moisturizers<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:15.690> work<00:01:16.050> but<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> just

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
other moisturizers don't work but I just

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.000 
other moisturizers don't work but I just
find<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.260> best<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.960> guess

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
find that this is just the best I guess

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.140 
find that this is just the best I guess
um<00:01:23.010> it<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.620> anti-inflammatory

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
um it really it's it's anti-inflammatory

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.110 
um it really it's it's anti-inflammatory
so<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.750> helps<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.710> keep<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> redness<00:01:29.460> down<00:01:29.700> it

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
so it helps to keep the redness down it

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.380 
so it helps to keep the redness down it
helps<00:01:31.280> it<00:01:32.280> helps<00:01:33.030> prevent<00:01:33.840> breakup<00:01:34.440> breakouts

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
helps it helps prevent breakup breakouts

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.260 
helps it helps prevent breakup breakouts

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:20.959 
best before I discovered this but I just

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:24.670 
best before I discovered this but I just
thought<00:06:21.649> that<00:06:22.269> that<00:06:23.269> it<00:06:23.809> comes<00:06:24.169> in<00:06:24.409> like<00:06:24.649> this

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
thought that that it comes in like this

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.429 
thought that that it comes in like this
skinny<00:06:25.490> tube<00:06:25.909> and<00:06:26.419> I<00:06:26.659> feel<00:06:26.899> like<00:06:27.050> you<00:06:27.169> have<00:06:27.289> to

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:27.439 
skinny tube and I feel like you have to

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.790 
skinny tube and I feel like you have to
use<00:06:27.589> a<00:06:27.619> lot<00:06:28.009> and<00:06:28.959> it<00:06:29.959> doesn't<00:06:30.229> last<00:06:30.349> that<00:06:30.499> long

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
use a lot and it doesn't last that long

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.779 
use a lot and it doesn't last that long
um<00:06:31.789> and<00:06:32.059> so<00:06:32.289> although<00:06:33.289> it<00:06:34.009> is<00:06:34.219> cheaper<00:06:34.759> than

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:36.790 
um and so although it is cheaper than
this<00:06:35.059> I<00:06:35.269> feel<00:06:35.479> like<00:06:35.539> it's<00:06:35.990> more<00:06:36.229> expensive<00:06:36.439> in
