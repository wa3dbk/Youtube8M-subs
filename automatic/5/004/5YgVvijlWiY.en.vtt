00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
legs or whatever then the more fat you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.980

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
times and every time I would try and

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.720 
times and every time I would try and
give<00:05:43.960> up<00:05:44.080> literally<00:05:44.380> everything<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:45.310> then<00:05:45.490> I

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
give up literally everything and then I

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.850
