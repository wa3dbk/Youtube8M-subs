00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.880
 usually the mysterious stories 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.360
 about strange places that exist are 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.849
 old places but not this the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.470
 denver international airport was 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.930
 built in 1995 and brings with it many 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.540
 mysteries from all corners of the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.829
 there are things that catch your eye 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.649
 as gargoyle symbols monuments in a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.550
 place where something very strange that only 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.440
 will be opened in 2000 and 94 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.289
 only one airport the place was 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.350
 built exaggeratedly as if it were 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.530
 the tip of the iceberg a cover that occupies 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.949
 something much bigger initial budget was 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.909
 1.7 billion dollars but the total 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.340
 work costing almost 4.8 billion 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.770
 three times more than planned 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.259
 several companies were hired and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.079
 worked on parts of the project each 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.210
 company performed the part of the 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.149
 airport so that none of them 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.969
 knew the whole project for the 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.380
 large tunnels were built 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.180
 apparently dispensable for the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.210
 airport operation 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.119
 the apocalyptic horse when 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.750
 we arrived at the airport we came across 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.360
 something at least curious about a sculpture 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.119
 chilling a giant blue horse that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.240
 bright red eyes tell the legend 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.450
 that horse because cupido by Luis 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.430
 jimÃ©nez another by the horse while 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.100
 finished and that a piece was released and 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.520
 collapsed on Luis that ended up dying 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 the illuminating stone in the main lobby 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.159
 from the airport there is a curious stone 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.850
 illuminati concerning the alleged new 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.509
 world order below this stone at a 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.020
 capsule of the time and according to its inscription 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.330
 will only be opened in 2000 94 100 years after 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.870
 have been placed there 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.049
 its content is unknown 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.840
 there are many allusions to the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.019
 Nazism at the airport is more evident 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.830
 of them is the format of the tracks 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.530
 high 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.629
 the project should be redone because 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.720
 many North American buildings that 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.610
 had this format by a totally 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.489
 reformed, avoiding reference to the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.829
 Nazi symbol but the situation in the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.340
 denver international airport is 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.519
 different gargoyles these sinister 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.859
 sculptures are used as lair douro 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.410
 of gutters in religious buildings and 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.709
 castles but there they are located 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.319
 the domestic airport side giving 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.530
 impression of being demonic guardians 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.370
 spying on the people who pass by 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.079
 apparently has no function 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.420
 besides complementing the sinister 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.239
 place decoration 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.180
 these paintings that resemble the 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.030
 extraterrestrial to faces flying over 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.500
 planet of the sky and its features I am not 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.319
 nothing normal 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.239
 the picture above is called peace and harmony 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.609
 with nature 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.000
 but when we look with a little more 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.819
 attention we receive the chaos of nature 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.639
 children mourning the death of animals and 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.090
 other animals trapped in glass cages 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:43.819
 and in the background the forest burns in the corner 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.769
 bottom of the image it is possible to observe 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.620
 three dead children 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.510
 each representing an ethnic group that 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.019
 does this mean 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.810
 at first glance this picture looks like a 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.379
 beautiful color painting representing 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.629
 happy children in the joyful world 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:05.480
 however the image is disturbing 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.629
 some children carry with them 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.449
 flags of their country weapons 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.299
 it seems that they are offering a 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:16.760
 German child what all these 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.099
 subliminal messages in one of the 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.539
 the busiest airports in the world 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:26.659
