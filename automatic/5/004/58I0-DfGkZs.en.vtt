00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
the where the sound would go into the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.960 
the where the sound would go into the
mic<00:00:05.819> between<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.049> outer<00:00:07.259> edge<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.730> cone

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
mic between the outer edge and the cone

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.459 
mic between the outer edge and the cone
not<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.960> cone

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
not on the cone

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.339 
not on the cone
but<00:00:11.160> between<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:12.150> there's<00:00:12.360> there's<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.200> outer

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
but between so there's there's the outer

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.340 
but between so there's there's the outer
edge<00:00:13.880> there's<00:00:14.880> paper<00:00:15.179> then<00:00:15.750> there's<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> cone

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
edge there's paper then there's the cone

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.060 
edge there's paper then there's the cone
and<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.609> try<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.940> capture<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:19.020> if<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.529> want<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
and I try to capture it if I want to

sound a little brighter I'll aim it more
toward<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> cone<00:00:23.369> yeah<00:00:24.180> are<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> mean<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
toward the cone yeah are you mean the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.769 
toward the cone yeah are you mean the
the<00:00:24.840> dome<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.619> dome<00:00:25.650> yeah<00:00:26.490> he's<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.630> if

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779

well you'll see it in the the video it's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.990 
well you'll see it in the the video it's
a<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.750> off<00:00:30.869> access<00:00:31.439> from<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.920> from<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
a little off access from the from the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.540 
a little off access from the from the
dome<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.390> speaker<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.219> next

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
dome of the speaker like just right next

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.549 
dome of the speaker like just right next
to<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.899> saw<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.200> silver

to it so if you if you saw the silver

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.740 
to it so if you if you saw the silver
dust<00:00:37.950> cover<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.879> would<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.300> next<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
dust cover it would be right next to it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
dust cover it would be right next to it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
well why don't you play a little sample

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.680

very nice
Oh<00:01:08.110> though<00:01:08.920> it<00:01:09.280> should<00:01:09.490> tell<00:01:09.670> our<00:01:09.790> listeners

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
Oh though it should tell our listeners

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.600 
Oh though it should tell our listeners
that<00:01:10.300> the<00:01:11.260> one<00:01:11.380> thing<00:01:11.500> that<00:01:11.560> excited<00:01:12.159> JD<00:01:12.369> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
that the one thing that excited JD the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.490 
that the one thing that excited JD the
most<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:13.090> far<00:01:13.119> right<00:01:13.600> now<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:13.960> he<00:01:14.080> gets<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.290> use

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
most so far right now so he gets to use

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.880 
most so far right now so he gets to use
his<00:01:14.530> reverb<00:01:15.040> on<00:01:15.310> his<00:01:15.460> amp<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.560> why<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.770> that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
his reverb on his amp so why is that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.290 
his reverb on his amp so why is that
that<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.280> can't<00:01:18.520> use<00:01:18.700> your<00:01:18.729> reverb<00:01:19.060> when<00:01:19.240> you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
that you can't use your reverb when you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.540 
that you can't use your reverb when you
go<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.540> do<00:01:19.630> sessions<00:01:19.869> well<00:01:20.560> normally<00:01:21.310> when

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
go and do sessions well normally when

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.810 
go and do sessions well normally when
you<00:01:21.670> go<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.880> do<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.149> session<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:24.070> when<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.610> do<00:01:24.790> a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
you go to do a session if when you do a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.570 
you go to do a session if when you do a
project<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.869> after<00:01:26.259> they<00:01:26.680> mix<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.369> put

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
project and after they mix and put

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.490 
project and after they mix and put
everything<00:01:27.820> together<00:01:28.090> then<00:01:28.899> they<00:01:29.080> add<00:01:29.229> reverb

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
everything together then they add reverb

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.740 
everything together then they add reverb
to<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.950> whole<00:01:30.159> picture<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:30.700> call<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.300> to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
to the whole picture I call it to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.930 
to the whole picture I call it to
everything<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.560> if<00:01:33.130> you've<00:01:33.280> already<00:01:33.520> added

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
everything and if you've already added

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.600 
everything and if you've already added
reverb<00:01:34.570> say<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.350> steel<00:01:35.619> or<00:01:35.950> any<00:01:36.160> any

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
reverb say to the steel or any any

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.790 
reverb say to the steel or any any
instrument<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.479> down<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.320> have<00:01:38.500> twice<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
instrument it down you have twice the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.150 
instrument it down you have twice the
reverb<00:01:39.340> on<00:01:39.520> there<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:39.910> it<00:01:40.119> washes<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.810> out<00:01:41.160> so

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
reverb on there and it washes it out so

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.950 
reverb on there and it washes it out so
that<00:01:42.520> they<00:01:42.850> don't<00:01:43.060> want<00:01:43.300> us<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.420> even<00:01:43.780> bring

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
that they don't want us to even bring

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.980 
that they don't want us to even bring
reverbs<00:01:44.500> or<00:01:44.800> delays<00:01:45.789> or<00:01:46.210> anything<00:01:46.630> they<00:01:46.810> want

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
reverbs or delays or anything they want

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.690 
reverbs or delays or anything they want
us<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.200> play<00:01:47.320> straight<00:01:47.649> through<00:01:47.950> kind<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.520> like

to have it really wet or just just a

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.700 
to have it really wet or just just a
slight<00:01:57.039> bit<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:58.509> between<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:59.020> two<00:01:59.259> that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
slight bit of it in between the two that

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.309 
slight bit of it in between the two that
you<00:01:59.920> just<00:02:00.190> mentioned<00:02:00.399> where<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.630> sings<00:02:02.080> to

you just mentioned where it it sings to

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.279 
you just mentioned where it it sings to
itself<00:02:02.979> it<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:04.240> reverb<00:02:04.569> brings<00:02:04.899> everything

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
itself it the reverb brings everything

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.920
