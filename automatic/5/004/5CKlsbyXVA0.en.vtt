00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.640
Even at the brink of death

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.900
preaching that path

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:31.140
“If there are some shadows in your heart, or otherwise…”

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.960
Even if you called out that name dear to you

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.600
no matter how much you don’t want to move on

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.220
that voice wasn’t facing this way anymore

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.940
not at all

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.920
“At least if I had even one or two

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.560
words to respond in the end

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.760
or otherwise if they took away

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.360
my grieving heart”

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.180
I deludedly think about the unreachable distance

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.760
from which no voice or sound of anguish can call awake

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.800
Like this I had become all on my own.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.960
Not anymore is there anyone. I’ll be in solitude.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920
If I question myself whether that’s something dreadful.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.080
Whether it is. Or if it isn’t.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
I still remain unable to understand why.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.180
Why my hands just tremble. Unable to be stopped.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.140
While I’m buried in that instinct.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.320
What am I afraid of.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.200
If I open up the hand I held firmly shut

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.840
and take a good look

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:38.620
without any visible shadows, I see aged whitened hair in my thinned withered hand

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.580
“If I’m not even

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.600
as strong as you…”

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.060
I couldn’t do anything like shake off a few shadows

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.780
from my heart

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.960
“If you reform your heart’s ways in things that

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.440
from the start are difficult to accept..”

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.880
If even my resorted teachings are now

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.340
empty, without any meaning

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.160
realizing that living for the purpose of change

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.740
is suffering, is inevitable

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.740
like this I am sinking into solitude.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.960
Yes, I want to keep living. I’ll end up disappearing.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.940
That is indeed dreadful. I realize.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.080
Without anything. Without anyone.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.420
Holding close this body alone.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.180
and growing old until fading away. Unable to be stopped.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.040
I’m overwhelmed by that shock.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.720
I am indeed afraid.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.220
Fading away like this as an imitation of the world

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.640
no longer can I accept

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.320
Even this hair that changed the shape and colour of that flower

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.500
no longer can I accept it

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.860
Therefore, I reel in. With both my hands

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.780
I sure shall stray from my path. That’s.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.960
The things I believed. The things I clung to.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.280
I shall certainly turn my back from everything.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.220
Losing myself. Shall be prevented.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.000
If only that wish were to come true.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.120
then off, towards things lead to only by living.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:16.860
―Not anymore, am I afraid of anything.
