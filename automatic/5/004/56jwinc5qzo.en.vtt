turn prompts when you're approaching a
junction<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:42.489> device<00:03:42.760> will<00:03:43.090> pop<00:03:43.300> up<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.540> turn

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
junction the device will pop up a turn

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.310 
the junction and a little arrow
indicating<00:03:48.820> where<00:03:49.300> you're<00:03:49.720> going<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.930> turn<00:03:50.110> so

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
indicating where you're going to turn so

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.900 
indicating where you're going to turn so
you<00:03:50.380> can<00:03:50.500> have<00:03:50.590> those<00:03:50.739> turned<00:03:51.160> on<00:03:51.340> or<00:03:51.459> off<00:03:51.580> and

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
you can have those turned on or off and

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.449 
you can have those turned on or off and
then<00:03:52.540> segment<00:03:53.020> prompts<00:03:53.440> are<00:03:53.620> fairly<00:03:53.980> similar

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
then segment prompts are fairly similar

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.990 
then segment prompts are fairly similar
so<00:03:54.489> if<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:55.000> have<00:03:55.830> put<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:57.070> segment<00:03:57.610> or<00:03:57.760> if<00:03:57.850> there

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
so if you have put a segment or if there

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.660 
so if you have put a segment or if there
is<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> segment<00:03:58.510> within<00:03:59.110> a<00:03:59.350> course<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.580> you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
is a segment within a course that you

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.210 
is a segment within a course that you

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
have mapped on Garmin Connect you can

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.070 
have mapped on Garmin Connect you can
choose<00:04:03.520> to<00:04:03.700> have<00:04:03.850> that<00:04:04.060> included<00:04:04.600> within<00:04:04.900> your

choose to have that included within your
course<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.709> then<00:04:06.130> as<00:04:06.280> you're<00:04:06.489> riding<00:04:07.090> the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
course and then as you're riding the

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.330 
course and then as you're riding the
course<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.780> segment<00:04:08.290> alert<00:04:08.590> will<00:04:08.800> pop<00:04:09.010> up<00:04:09.040> on

when<00:04:13.360> you've<00:04:13.480> completed<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:14.170> so<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.410> know

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
when you've completed it so you know

when to apply maximum efforts you can

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.630 
when to apply maximum efforts you can
have<00:04:16.989> those<00:04:17.169> either<00:04:17.470> turned<00:04:17.770> off<00:04:18.070> or<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:20.640> okay

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
have those either turned off or on okay

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.779 
have those either turned off or on okay
we<00:04:22.570> then<00:04:22.750> have<00:04:22.960> user<00:04:23.200> profile<00:04:23.800> which<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.460> some

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
we then have user profile which is some

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.040 
we then have user profile which is some
of<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:24.940> basic

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
of the basic

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.300 
of the basic
later<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.289> you<00:04:26.440> input<00:04:26.590> into<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.069> device

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
later that you input into the device

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.010 
later that you input into the device
when<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:27.789> turn<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.300> on<00:04:28.389> for<00:04:28.509> the<00:04:28.569> very<00:04:28.690> first

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
when you turn it on for the very first

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.689 
when you turn it on for the very first
time<00:04:29.319> but<00:04:29.500> if<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.710> wanted<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.039> adjust<00:04:30.159> some<00:04:30.610> of

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
time but if you wanted to adjust some of

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.129 
time but if you wanted to adjust some of
these<00:04:30.789> such<00:04:31.120> as<00:04:31.270> weight<00:04:31.449> if<00:04:31.690> you've<00:04:31.840> shed<00:04:32.110> a

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
these such as weight if you've shed a

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.710 
these such as weight if you've shed a
few<00:04:32.229> pounds<00:04:32.409> during<00:04:33.150> your<00:04:34.150> summer<00:04:34.419> training

few pounds during your summer training

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.210 
few pounds during your summer training
then<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.139> can<00:04:35.379> adjust<00:04:35.470> those<00:04:35.919> options<00:04:36.400> their

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
then you can adjust those options their

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.100 
then you can adjust those options their
system<00:04:39.220> settings<00:04:39.669> are<00:04:39.970> very<00:04:40.000> basic<00:04:40.569> things

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
system settings are very basic things

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.920 
system settings are very basic things
such<00:04:41.470> as<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.770> language<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.940> time<00:04:43.180> of<00:04:43.389> day<00:04:43.599> and

how that is displayed with that's

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.460 
how that is displayed with that's
24-hour<00:04:45.849> or<00:04:46.409> normal<00:04:47.409> then<00:04:48.129> backlight<00:04:48.639> timeout

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
chooses whether that automatically dims

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.279 
chooses whether that automatically dims
and<00:04:51.879> you'd<00:04:51.970> have<00:04:52.090> seen<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:52.509> doing<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:52.900> as<00:04:53.080> we've

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
and you'd have seen it doing it as we've

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.170 
and you'd have seen it doing it as we've
been<00:04:53.470> working<00:04:53.530> through<00:04:54.159> with<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.400> device<00:04:54.669> or

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
been working through with the device or

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.180 
been working through with the device or
whether<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:55.659> backlight<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.349> always<00:04:56.800> on<00:04:57.009> but

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
whether the backlight is always on but

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.379 
whether the backlight is always on but
obviously<00:04:57.250> that's<00:04:57.669> going<00:04:57.819> to<00:04:57.909> be<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.030> little

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
obviously that's going to be a little

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.719 
obviously that's going to be a little
bit<00:04:58.509> more<00:04:58.690> battery<00:04:59.289> hungry<00:04:59.680> we<00:05:00.370> can<00:05:00.490> turn

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
bit more battery hungry we can turn

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.550 
bit more battery hungry we can turn
tones<00:05:01.030> on<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.389> off<00:05:01.539> we<00:05:01.810> can<00:05:01.990> choose<00:05:02.289> whether

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
tones on and off we can choose whether

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.899 
tones on and off we can choose whether
we're<00:05:02.740> going<00:05:02.889> to<00:05:02.949> display<00:05:03.159> miles<00:05:03.669> or

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
we're going to display miles or

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.839 
we're going to display miles or
kilometers<00:05:04.479> and<00:05:05.009> then<00:05:06.009> we<00:05:06.099> can<00:05:06.280> choose<00:05:06.520> to

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
kilometers and then we can choose to

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.029 
kilometers and then we can choose to

have glow nest turned on or off now this

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.110 
have glow nest turned on or off now this
is<00:05:09.190> an<00:05:09.310> additional<00:05:09.849> I<00:05:10.060> guess<00:05:10.599> like<00:05:11.080> tracking

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120

is an additional I guess like tracking
GPS<00:05:13.620> mechanism<00:05:14.620> there's<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.490> little<00:05:15.699> bit<00:05:15.789> more

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
GPS mechanism there's a little bit more

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.439 
GPS mechanism there's a little bit more
accurate<00:05:16.710> but<00:05:17.710> we'll<00:05:17.949> just<00:05:18.490> increase<00:05:19.240> battery

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
accurate but we'll just increase battery

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.450 
accurate but we'll just increase battery
drain<00:05:19.930> by<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.199> small<00:05:20.590> amount<00:05:20.770> so<00:05:20.979> we<00:05:21.190> tend<00:05:21.400> to

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
drain by a small amount so we tend to

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.890 
drain by a small amount so we tend to
have<00:05:21.610> it<00:05:21.729> turned<00:05:21.940> on<00:05:22.150> unless<00:05:22.539> we're<00:05:22.719> going<00:05:22.840> to

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
have it turned on unless we're going to

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.119 
have it turned on unless we're going to
do<00:05:23.199> a<00:05:23.530> really<00:05:23.949> long<00:05:24.099> ride<00:05:25.620> okay<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:26.680> that<00:05:27.099> is

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
do a really long ride okay so that is

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.610 
do a really long ride okay so that is
