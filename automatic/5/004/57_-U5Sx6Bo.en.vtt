I<00:01:39.440> didn't<00:01:39.770> use<00:01:39.860> any<00:01:40.040> pulleys<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.970> probably

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
I didn't use any pulleys I probably

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.880 
I didn't use any pulleys I probably
should<00:01:41.750> have<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:41.990> would<00:01:42.170> have<00:01:42.290> been<00:01:42.410> smoother

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
should have it would have been smoother

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.480 
should have it would have been smoother
but<00:01:43.490> I've<00:01:43.670> got<00:01:43.910> PVC<00:01:44.630> pipe<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:46.010> bent<00:01:46.310> and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
but I've got PVC pipe that is bent and

shaped and brings the rope out on top of
my<00:01:51.470> aviary<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.690> PVC<00:01:54.380> pipe<00:01:54.940> is<00:01:55.940> at

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
my aviary so and that PVC pipe is at

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.490 
my aviary so and that PVC pipe is at
each<00:01:56.990> end<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.970> I<00:01:58.970> bring<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.420> rope<00:01:59.720> out<00:01:59.900> on<00:02:00.170> top

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
each end so I bring this rope out on top

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.600 
each end so I bring this rope out on top
I<00:02:01.390> could<00:02:02.390> then<00:02:02.540> grab<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:02.930> rope<00:02:03.350> when<00:02:03.860> I'm<00:02:04.040> time

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
I could then grab the rope when I'm time

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.550 
I could then grab the rope when I'm time
to<00:02:04.820> load<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.090> birds<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.810> could<00:02:05.990> slide<00:02:06.290> this

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
to load the birds and I could slide this
