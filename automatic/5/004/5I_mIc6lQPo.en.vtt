was where about nine vs Superman dawn of
Justice<00:02:28.959> was<00:02:29.230> filming<00:02:29.739> so<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.310> guess<00:02:30.370> him<00:02:30.730> being

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
Justice was filming so I guess him being

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.600 
Justice was filming so I guess him being
there<00:02:31.239> kind<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.599> brought<00:02:31.720> up<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.900> question<00:02:31.930> if

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
there kind of brought up the question if

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.940

General Zod will be back in batman vs.
superman<00:02:36.030> now<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.209> could<00:02:37.420> be<00:02:37.480> possible<00:02:38.140> for

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
superman now this could be possible for

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.550 
superman now this could be possible for
example<00:02:39.190> his<00:02:39.610> corpse<00:02:40.030> would<00:02:40.510> get<00:02:40.720> stolen<00:02:41.110> or

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
example his corpse would get stolen or

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.940 
example his corpse would get stolen or
acquired<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:43.030> some<00:02:43.540> science<00:02:44.379> experience

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
acquired and some science experience

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.660 
acquired and some science experience
goes<00:02:45.190> down<00:02:45.459> thus<00:02:46.299> giving<00:02:46.870> him<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.769> doomsday

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
goes down thus giving him the doomsday

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.839 
goes down thus giving him the doomsday
genome<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.540> yeah<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.859> that's<00:02:51.609> complicated

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
genome and yeah so that's complicated

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.170 
genome and yeah so that's complicated
but<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:53.019> still<00:02:53.379> is<00:02:53.590> possible<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.819> guess

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
but it still is possible so I guess

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.520 
but it still is possible so I guess
we're<00:02:55.359> just<00:02:55.390> gonna<00:02:55.569> have<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.930> find<00:02:55.959> out<00:02:56.349> or

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
we're just gonna have to find out or

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.619 
we're just gonna have to find out or
wait<00:02:56.709> if<00:02:56.829> someone<00:02:57.129> confirms<00:02:57.579> it<00:02:57.819> lastly<00:02:58.390> we
