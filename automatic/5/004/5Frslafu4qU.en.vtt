 message I just need to troll myself 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.920
 I see a lot of people really enjoyed it. 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.649
 a lot of people loved selecting some 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.479
 people did not like it very much, it's something else 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:00.180
 I say clear majority minority 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.340
 It is but it's still just relaxing 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.799
 so it is a little relaxing was the game for 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.840
 have fun and I know that I understand that 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.989
 many people may think that the game is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.790
 exchange the other is boring 5'll agree 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.170
 It can be annoying to some people but 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.849
 just relax 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.680
 I play the game but I 've already lost 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.599
 I count how many times I went to the side 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.730
 how many times did my bad luck team 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.560
 How many times have I stayed and I do not 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.330
 I have therefore died on the contrary in the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.660
 Other side even laughed wrote 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.830
 I thought it was funny and at the most it was 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.270
 leave the server 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.069
 so just the message that wanted to pass the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.140
 camera is for those who do not like the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.580
 This relaxes the guys there. 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140
 had cast that has another think I did 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.300
 a long time ago with a face of bad faith and 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.830
 let it be that you see little 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.349
 to see we have the best was the run for 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.930
 It was very funny to play until I liked it and 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.640
 I found the trollage funny, that is the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.900
 staff must have people who do not we enjoyed 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.910
 there are people who do not have people 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.230
 joking I'm kidding then 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.880
 leads in jest also pleases because 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.760
 This is what it's just a joke is not 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.350
 nothing serious is not a game with a lot of people in 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.180
 game is not just a joke the staff 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.560
 It was exchange and sure understand knows that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.230
 it was just a joke 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.239
 so go for video 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.970
 Good guys, let's go first, I'll go. 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.440
 explain what is rich with which 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.380
 his role and how he can give the team 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.670
 in fact it helps very shy was a 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.830
 King with only the team 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.870
 wilson alone can he help the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.370
 team of more intensely 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.440
 come on first as rich as ever 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.970
 said on Sunday is sold regional 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.690
 but that means recognition in 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.510
 Portuguese 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.130
 behold, it is a class of 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.739
 recognition he finds the people he 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.079
 look at the map to find the 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.540
 enemy the rich guys it helps 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.160
 the team has to have 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.959
 the icom to win 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.370
 You can see there that I'm going to show you the 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.220
 you a very nice place to stay 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.560
 because he has to be well 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.900
 always positioned when I say well 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.239
 Positioned guys I say a position 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.190
 cool it in the middle of the fight but you 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.630
 They are not found easily and this 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.910
 place like to you now is the place 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.190
 perfect on the Gulf of Oman is an example 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.530
 perfect where you should stay paulo ii 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.420
 with inaccessible places where you can 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.290
 fall staff can not achieve this goal 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.630
 of common 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.200
 etc. Then I leave a box of ammunition if 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.850
 can see 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.220
 is another tip for you guys is 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.160
 good you always leave in a box 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.070
 near you, you go with a 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.039
 class support throws the ammo pack 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.349
 leave it there and then back while 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.360
 you do not throw another pack of ammo 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.460
 here he will stay there 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.070
 so you can see there I have mavs 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.440
 infinite 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.090
 and infinite ammunition because the package 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.190
 Ammo on my side here then let's go 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.380
 galley oe with it mobile use what you 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.020
 want a bird or terrantez I advise 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.000
 thinner because terrorism is it's 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.460
 little one and talbisseh good to hide 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.140
 beauty but he has no mobility or 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.030
 be a better life you lead to the point 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.260
 if you want you destroy the equipment 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.500
 enemy for those who do not know but he 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.630
 can destroy other public furniture 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.250
 is other lands etc and others 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.230
 enemy equipment even some 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.060
 explosives with clay mors the husband 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.800
 manages to destroy and you also get 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.340
 amazed the enemy and is thinking 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.900
 what 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.030
 and I am astonishing the enemies like you 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.470
 You can see there I'm coming back, everybody. 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.660
 export part of the old one and we must 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.370
 driving a sport continues so without 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.080
 You win when someone killed a guy. 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.930
 which was detached from the equipment only 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.880
 example I just destroyed the 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.890
 carioca he is not reborn from near death 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.540
 between the other baby with the then if the guy 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.980
 to die will not be born there and to 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.570
 destroy equipment there is only you 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.910
 normally educate the equipment or 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.320
 maybe just keep the aim and take those 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.610
 three equipments are not all 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.490
 equipment can be mobile surgical 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.140
 but most may have another risk function 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.540
 is to find the guys that do not do now 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.320
 In this scene I found the guy destroyed a 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.590
 them after 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.840
 I deleted the two holy buildings so it's 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.730
 well you've been watching there watching 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.190
 everything there with maggi when you come 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.900
 someone some river with some guy who's 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.560
 The team is dangerous and you go there and 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.450
 kill 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.330
 This is clear if you can have vision 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.030
 Then, as he said, people smile. 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.770
 with great help the team has a 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.540
 metric the guys as I said 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.730
 very important indeed is a 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.960
 of the most important things in the gulf that 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.150
 keep this building there that gives me 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.950
 perfect positioning 100% perfect 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.300
 but some maps do not have places 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.030
 so to position yourself then you have 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.220
 that being creative has to find and 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.140
 It's a good place to stay and you're not 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.390
 with ease and that you have a 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.950
 good vision there to attack the guys there 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.630
 So let me explain to you the 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.550
 what a place needs to have to be 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.470
 considered good good place by a rich 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.480
 come on it 's first good that it be 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.310
 an enclosed place is not very cool you 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.080
 place is open if you do not have 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.940
 option you can stay but try to take 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.500
 care or use a suppressor you 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.800
 do not get exhausted on the map 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.830
 second it's good that a place is high and 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.210
 that has a field 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.830
 I made a good start at least more 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.570
 two three flags 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.070
 if you can keep the place where the 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.530
 cinema with a field of view the latest 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.760
 four flags such our perfect but 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.740
 if you can not try at least 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.330
 review of over two flags here a 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.550
 Good neighborly view of two more flags 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.380
 more or less third and more important 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.260
 everyone is extremely 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.690
 it is advisable that the site can not be 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.310
 accessed by common methods which I 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.740
 I mean, he can not be 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.340
 can not be accessed 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.020
 It is put ramps or anything for 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.820
 example and if you practiced the only 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.400
 if access it is sevin with a jet 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.070
 already here or if other suit a 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.480
