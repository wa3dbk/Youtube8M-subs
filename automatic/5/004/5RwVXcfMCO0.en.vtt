you should be set goes back down in
about<00:03:51.260> half<00:03:51.590> way<00:03:56.530> go<00:03:57.530> ahead<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.829> wipe<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:58.249> up

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:25.930 

and<00:04:16.760> tightening<00:04:24.010> these<00:04:25.010> boots<00:04:25.310> are<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.550> pain

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
and tightening these boots are a pain

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.910

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
but you have to put them on before you

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.400 
but you have to put them on before you

grab a spring let's slide it over let's

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.650 
grab a spring let's slide it over let's
turn<00:05:57.020> it<00:05:57.140> upside<00:05:57.470> down<00:05:58.030> we<00:05:59.030> need<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.420> get<00:05:59.630> a

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
turn it upside down we need to get a

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.820 
turn it upside down we need to get a
spring<00:06:00.320> retainer<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:02.180> pointy<00:06:02.900> end<00:06:03.170> is

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
spring retainer and the pointy end is

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.550 
spring retainer and the pointy end is
going<00:06:04.220> to<00:06:04.400> go<00:06:04.520> towards<00:06:05.090> the<00:06:06.050> bottom<00:06:06.200> of<00:06:06.500> the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
going to go towards the bottom of the

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.180 
going to go towards the bottom of the
shock<00:06:06.890> and<00:06:08.440> sometimes<00:06:09.440> it's<00:06:09.650> easier<00:06:09.920> just<00:06:09.980> to

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
shock and sometimes it's easier just to

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.420 
shock and sometimes it's easier just to
put<00:06:10.370> this<00:06:10.490> on<00:06:10.670> a<00:06:10.700> table<00:06:11.210> and<00:06:11.360> press<00:06:11.570> down<00:06:11.930> and

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
put this on a table and press down and

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.120 
put this on a table and press down and
there's<00:06:13.430> AC<00:06:13.640> portion<00:06:14.570> that's<00:06:15.410> going<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:15.830> slide

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
there's AC portion that's going to slide

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.650 
there's AC portion that's going to slide
over<00:06:16.670> the<00:06:16.820> shaft<00:06:18.430> and<00:06:19.430> you<00:06:19.910> have<00:06:20.090> to<00:06:20.270> work<00:06:20.480> it

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
over the shaft and you have to work it

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.100 
over the shaft and you have to work it
around<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:21.380> boot<00:06:21.560> as<00:06:21.860> well<00:06:22.190> and<00:06:22.960> then<00:06:23.960> you're

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
around the boot as well and then you're

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.379 
around the boot as well and then you're
going<00:06:24.290> to<00:06:24.410> pull<00:06:24.710> up

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
going to pull up

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.010 
going to pull up
and<00:06:27.389> that<00:06:27.539> will<00:06:27.659> set<00:06:27.900> it<00:06:29.750> against<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:30.900> edge

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
and that will set it against the edge

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.350 
and that will set it against the edge
just<00:06:31.439> like<00:06:31.560> so<00:06:31.919> make<00:06:32.879> sure<00:06:32.909> that<00:06:33.240> you're

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
just like so make sure that you're

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.360 
just like so make sure that you're
properly<00:06:33.539> seated<00:06:34.139> with<00:06:34.439> your<00:06:34.469> spring<00:06:34.979> on<00:06:35.219> the

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
properly seated with your spring on the

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.980 
properly seated with your spring on the
top<00:06:35.610> and<00:06:36.599> on<00:06:37.469> the<00:06:37.500> bottom<00:06:38.419> now<00:06:39.419> we<00:06:39.479> have<00:06:39.750> a

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
top and on the bottom now we have a

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.959 
top and on the bottom now we have a
completed<00:06:40.939> shock<00:06:41.939> absorber<00:06:43.729> let's<00:06:44.729> go<00:06:44.879> ahead

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969 
completed shock absorber let's go ahead

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:48.619 
completed shock absorber let's go ahead
and<00:06:45.180> do<00:06:45.270> that<00:06:45.419> one<00:06:45.569> more<00:06:45.810> time<00:06:46.969> go<00:06:47.969> ahead<00:06:48.090> and

and do that one more time go ahead and
put<00:06:49.590> the<00:06:49.710> spring<00:06:50.039> on<00:06:51.289> pull<00:06:52.289> the<00:06:52.409> spring<00:06:52.710> down

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
put the spring on pull the spring down

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.830 
put the spring on pull the spring down
go<00:06:54.960> ahead<00:06:55.169> and<00:06:55.319> slip<00:06:55.620> the<00:06:55.830> retainer<00:06:56.840> around
