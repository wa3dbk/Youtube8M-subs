because there's no real point in me
staying<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.450> into<00:01:24.600> my<00:01:24.750> room

staying in I know going out into my room
she<00:01:25.080> goes<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> hidden<00:01:26.009> power<00:01:26.479> I'm

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
she goes for the hidden power I'm

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.230 
she goes for the hidden power I'm
guessing<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.680> either<00:01:28.950> predicted<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.850> switch<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
guessing he either predicted a switch to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
guessing he either predicted a switch to
something<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.560> supposed<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> be

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
something or that was supposed to be

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039 
something or that was supposed to be
hidden<00:01:32.549> power<00:01:32.790> electric<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.720> make<00:01:33.840> much

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
hidden power electric and make much

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
hidden power electric and make much
don't<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.470> actually<00:01:34.829> um<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.850> he<00:01:36.150> ends<00:01:36.329> up

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
don't be actually um so he ends up

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.670 
don't be actually um so he ends up
switching<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.229> obviously<00:01:37.439> he

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
switching out now because obviously he

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.929 
switching out now because obviously he
doesn't<00:01:37.920> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.340> by<00:01:38.490> box<00:01:38.729> which

like created or something that doesn't

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.920 
like created or something that doesn't
happen<00:04:38.470> so<00:04:38.770> that's<00:04:38.949> kind<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.190> cool<00:04:39.310> but<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:40.840> we

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
happen so that's kind of cool but so we

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.150

can<00:04:41.080> end<00:04:41.199> up<00:04:41.320> living<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.650> hit<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:41.919> because

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
can end up living the hit and because

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.890 
can end up living the hit and because
the<00:04:42.280> lefties<00:04:42.669> I<00:04:42.789> think<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.330> lives<00:04:43.690> the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
the lefties I think it lives the

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.839 
the lefties I think it lives the
sandstorm<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.680> turn<00:04:44.889> as<00:04:45.070> well<00:04:45.280> which<00:04:45.820> is

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
sandstorm this turn as well which is

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.370 
sandstorm this turn as well which is
uber<00:04:46.419> annoying<00:04:46.539> because<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.199> would<00:04:47.289> have

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
uber annoying because that would have

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.529 
uber annoying because that would have
been<00:04:47.440> nice<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.650> get<00:04:47.919> nothing<00:04:48.220> out<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.430> way<00:04:48.539> but

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
been nice to get nothing out the way but

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.960 
been nice to get nothing out the way but
either<00:04:50.410> way<00:04:50.620> he<00:04:50.860> decides<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.310> switch<00:04:51.430> out<00:04:51.729> I

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
either way he decides to switch out I

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.570 
either way he decides to switch out I
think<00:04:52.570> I<00:04:52.690> double<00:04:53.289> out<00:04:53.440> here<00:04:53.770> as<00:04:53.889> well<00:04:54.130> he<00:04:54.430> ends

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
think I double out here as well he ends

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.089 
think I double out here as well he ends
up<00:04:54.639> going<00:04:54.789> out<00:04:54.910> into<00:04:55.120> his<00:04:55.479> inferni<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.949> end

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
up going out into his inferni and I end

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.100 
up going out into his inferni and I end
up<00:04:57.160> going<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.580> oh<00:04:57.610> sorry<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.360> end<00:04:58.539> up<00:04:58.599> staying<00:04:58.840> in

so<00:06:30.139> it<00:06:30.319> doesn't<00:06:30.349> make<00:06:30.620> a<00:06:30.680> difference<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.430> he's

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
so it doesn't make a difference so he's

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.920 
so it doesn't make a difference so he's
going<00:06:31.699> to<00:06:31.759> switch<00:06:31.939> into<00:06:32.060> a<00:06:32.180> brunette<00:06:32.599> hair<00:06:32.750> now

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
going to switch into a brunette hair now

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.140 
going to switch into a brunette hair now
I<00:06:33.199> didn't<00:06:33.979> know<00:06:34.069> what<00:06:34.219> to<00:06:34.310> expect<00:06:34.340> I<00:06:34.789> think<00:06:35.060> he

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
I didn't know what to expect I think he

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.209 
I didn't know what to expect I think he
actually<00:06:35.180> ends<00:06:35.689> up<00:06:35.750> making<00:06:35.930> a<00:06:36.319> prediction

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
actually ends up making a prediction

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.029 
actually ends up making a prediction
here<00:06:37.789> because<00:06:38.509> I<00:06:38.810> think<00:06:39.349> he<00:06:39.439> expected<00:06:39.860> me<00:06:39.919> to

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
here because I think he expected me to

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.860 
here because I think he expected me to
switch<00:06:40.250> wanted<00:06:40.550> to<00:06:40.669> save<00:06:40.879> my<00:06:41.090> cardio<00:06:41.419> but<00:06:41.719> I

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
switch wanted to save my cardio but I

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.179 
switch wanted to save my cardio but I
ended<00:06:42.139> up<00:06:42.199> just<00:06:42.409> staying<00:06:42.469> in<00:06:42.830> because<00:06:43.039> I<00:06:43.129> do

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
ended up just staying in because I do

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:45.490 
ended up just staying in because I do
have<00:06:43.310> the<00:06:43.580> spark<00:06:43.849> terrakion<00:06:44.300> so<00:06:44.569> and<00:06:45.349> I

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
have the spark terrakion so and I

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.929 
have the spark terrakion so and I
already<00:06:45.590> know<00:06:45.889> that<00:06:46.039> doesn't<00:06:46.250> have<00:06:46.460> priority

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
already know that doesn't have priority

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.640 
already know that doesn't have priority
so<00:06:47.449> I<00:06:47.479> know<00:06:47.599> that<00:06:47.810> I<00:06:47.840> can<00:06:47.930> sack<00:06:48.259> this<00:06:48.469> thing

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
so I know that I can sack this thing

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.439 
so I know that I can sack this thing
bring<00:06:49.099> in<00:06:49.250> terrakion<00:06:50.029> and<00:06:50.210> then<00:06:50.300> basically

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
bring in terrakion and then basically

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.170 
bring in terrakion and then basically
clean<00:06:50.990> up<00:06:51.169> but<00:06:51.889> now<00:06:52.159> I<00:06:52.189> end<00:06:52.370> up<00:06:52.490> staying<00:06:52.729> in<00:06:52.969> I

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
clean up but now I end up staying in I

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.700 
clean up but now I end up staying in I
think<00:06:53.569> he<00:06:53.659> ends<00:06:53.779> up<00:06:53.840> over<00:06:54.139> predicting<00:06:54.500> like<00:06:54.620> I

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
think he ends up over predicting like I

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.050 
think he ends up over predicting like I
