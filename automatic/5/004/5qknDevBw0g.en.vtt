00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.200
 Hello everyone, I'm with you from 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:09.040
 new and here I bring this novelty 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.900
 these are a phillips helmets 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.420
 of a few headset helmets 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.840
 headband headphones brand 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.779
 philips as you see they are very cheap 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.880
 and pretty good in terms of quality of 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.450
 It refers sound ie the vido 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.490
 regarding the price they have 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.140
 it's all for example they are blue 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.780
 but you know more models there are 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.870
 There are some browns there are browns 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.940
 that is already the customer's choice 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.000
 we have to say good that they are 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:45.710
 fantastic helmets are the model s hbl 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.780
 3000 well if I did not say it and have a 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.550
 great power as you see in the thousand box 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.760
 volts I already know unsealed from 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.500
 here and as I say you are at a very 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.600
 economic 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.850
 usually in physical stores these 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.370
 You can find helmets for twenty 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.280
 thirty euros I recommend you 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.310
 go to the Amazon website for 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.490
 find them because they come out much more 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.440
 cheap indeed these come from amazon 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.050
 and they have not cost me even thirteen euros 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.380
 so I think there's a big 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.079
 difference and it 's the same model 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.780
 As for quality the quality I am not 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.990
 dj or anything like that but they are for me 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.079
 really good they are very insulating from the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.179
 external interference and quality 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.189
 of the sound is great and can not be 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.110
 less because of the philips brand so much 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.649
 like philips or are and are pretty good 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.649
 the two brands 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.469
 has a reinforcement of finishes everything is 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.929
 made in plastic but has for example 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.710
 some pads that are very very 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.240
 comfortable are quite wide and the truth 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.459
 is that they allow the use of helmets 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.229
 for a long time they are not for nothing 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:00.159
 annoying the farms are very comfortable 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.090
 They have an adjustable headband as you see 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.719
 here you see fits all kinds of 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.610
 head sizes and then have a cable 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.459
 that is also pretty good is 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.670
 quite long it has a meter 20 so 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.760
 that it is difficult for you to lack cable for 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.090
 connect some connector 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.960
 the output slot is a 3- key 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.770
 millimeters and a half 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.200
 and the reinforcement is pretty fat 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.580
 that the truth is that it covers quite well 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.670
 the interferences and does not bother and the 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.750
 sound quality is pretty good 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.300
 what else to say good that they have 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.010
 quite powerful magnets with a material 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.400
 special event that prevents 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.400
 interference 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.110
 and in terms of quality of materials, 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.630
 refers is pretty good 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.610
 you can not see anymore are a few helmets 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.560
 Of course they are not of a price either 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.290
 exaggerated but I recommend that you 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.000
 buy because being so cheap and at 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.590
 hear also the sound is worth it 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 I have used them in different 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.570
 devices in a mobile phone I have 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.820
 used in an mp3 on computer and the 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.209
 truth is that the comments that say 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.740
 that if you do not have a powerful computer a 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.520
 powerful mp3 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.810
 the quality does not sound good so I des 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.700
 While all this the truth is that I 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.470
 tested and everywhere I 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.200
 they work the same, you can hear them very well 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.540
 bass you can hear the bass very well 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.000
 everything perfect then my recommendation 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.530
 is that you also buy what you 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.830
 I say through amazon if you want 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.940
 save a few euros and the truth that a 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.760
 little more than what to say has as you see 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.020
 rotate and have a turning amplitude of 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.020
 165 degrees 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.740
 and the truth is that little more 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.110
 I hope you like them 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.500
 and nothing we see in the next video a 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.500
 greeting
