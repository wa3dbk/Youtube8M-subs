a<00:02:15.710> ladder<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.610> top<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> ladder<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.330> don't<00:02:17.600> know

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
a ladder on top of a ladder I don't know

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.440 
a ladder on top of a ladder I don't know
something<00:02:17.960> like<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.790> Sandow<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:20.060> just

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
something like that and Sandow is just

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.070 
something like that and Sandow is just
one<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.660> those<00:02:20.840> guys<00:02:21.020> like<00:02:21.290> Wade<00:02:21.560> Barrett<00:02:22.040> that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
one of those guys like Wade Barrett that

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.780 
one of those guys like Wade Barrett that
is<00:02:24.080> more<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:24.470> like<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.650> Shamus<00:02:25.250> Wade<00:02:25.460> Barrett

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.090 
is more of like a Shamus Wade Barrett
status<00:02:26.210> not<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.630> sink<00:02:27.080> our<00:02:27.260> Rey<00:02:27.590> Mysterio

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
status not like a sink our Rey Mysterio

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.390 
status not like a sink our Rey Mysterio
Jeff<00:02:28.400> Hardy<00:02:28.730> type<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:30.110> think<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.920> Ziggler

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
Jeff Hardy type so I think that Ziggler

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.250 
Jeff Hardy type so I think that Ziggler
is<00:02:31.820> going<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> win<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.540> match<00:02:32.780> just

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
is going to win this match just

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.280 
is going to win this match just
considering<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.040> fact<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:35.050> he's<00:02:36.050> had

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
considering the fact that he's had

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.170 
considering the fact that he's had
multiple<00:02:36.590> World<00:02:37.280> Heavyweight<00:02:37.490> Championship

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
multiple World Heavyweight Championship

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.360 
multiple World Heavyweight Championship
matches<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.900> last<00:02:39.110> few<00:02:39.470> weeks<00:02:39.710> again<00:02:40.070> Sheamus

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
matches the last few weeks again Sheamus

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.390 
matches the last few weeks again Sheamus
I<00:02:40.700> think<00:02:40.730> they're<00:02:41.060> hinting<00:02:41.300> us<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:41.870> like

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
I think they're hinting us that like

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.670 
I think they're hinting us that like
he's<00:02:43.400> going<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.820> win<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.600> money<00:02:45.050> in<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.500> bank

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
he's going to win the money in the bank

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.620 
he's going to win the money in the bank
ladder<00:02:45.770> match<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.610> think<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.210> finally

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
ladder match and I think this is finally

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.040 
ladder match and I think this is finally
when<00:02:47.810> Ziggler<00:02:48.080> finally<00:02:48.620> gets<00:02:48.830> his<00:02:48.950> push<00:02:49.220> so

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
when Ziggler finally gets his push so

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.150 
when Ziggler finally gets his push so
Dolph<00:02:51.050> Ziggler<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.500> think<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.860> going<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.130> win

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
Dolph Ziggler I think is going to win

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.030 
Dolph Ziggler I think is going to win
the<00:02:52.400> world<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.820> championship<00:02:53.180> match<00:02:53.270> and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
real and Sheamus this is weird because i

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.650 
real and Sheamus this is weird because i
think<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.340> WT<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:31.880> trying<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.240> get<00:04:32.360> both

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
think that the WT is trying to get both

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.080 
think that the WT is trying to get both
contracts<00:04:33.260> cashed<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:34.010> on<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.250> same<00:04:34.430> night<00:04:34.460> so

triangle<00:05:33.740> thing<00:05:33.950> but<00:05:34.850> the<00:05:34.970> funny<00:05:35.180> thing<00:05:35.300> is<00:05:35.510> is

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
triangle thing but the funny thing is is

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.830 
triangle thing but the funny thing is is
that<00:05:36.190> Daniel<00:05:37.190> Bryan<00:05:37.520> simply<00:05:38.210> don't<00:05:38.450> even<00:05:38.690> like

I think Sam Punk is gonna win that match

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.980 
I think Sam Punk is gonna win that match
and<00:06:04.250> then<00:06:04.430> obviously<00:06:04.910> they're<00:06:05.720> gonna<00:06:05.840> have

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
and then obviously they're gonna have

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.050 
and then obviously they're gonna have
money<00:06:06.200> in<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.440> bank<00:06:06.530> ladder<00:06:06.650> matches<00:06:07.040> the<00:06:07.460> two

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
money in the bank ladder matches the two

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
money in the bank ladder matches the two
of<00:06:08.180> them<00:06:08.300> were<00:06:08.390> probably<00:06:08.600> going<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:08.900> be<00:06:08.960> the

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
of them were probably going to be the

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.500 
of them were probably going to be the
very<00:06:09.170> first<00:06:09.440> matches<00:06:09.680> way<00:06:10.400> whoever<00:06:11.150> wins<00:06:11.180> the

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
very first matches way whoever wins the

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.210 
very first matches way whoever wins the
matches<00:06:11.870> have<00:06:12.050> time<00:06:12.260> to<00:06:12.410> rest<00:06:12.650> and<00:06:12.830> stuff<00:06:13.070> so

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
matches have time to rest and stuff so

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.590 
matches have time to rest and stuff so
where<00:06:13.490> they<00:06:13.610> can<00:06:13.760> go<00:06:13.880> catch<00:06:14.120> them<00:06:14.330> in<00:06:14.420> that

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
where they can go catch them in that

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.870 
where they can go catch them in that
