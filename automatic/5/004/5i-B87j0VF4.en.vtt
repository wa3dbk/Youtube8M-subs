GTS<00:00:15.990> stands<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:16.590> gran<00:00:16.859> turismo<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
GTS stands for gran turismo this is

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.849 
GTS stands for gran turismo this is
exactly<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.260> says<00:00:19.619> high<00:00:20.100> speed<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
exactly that it says high speed and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.700 
exactly that it says high speed and
luxurious<00:00:22.859> riding<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.539> much<00:00:24.900> more<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
luxurious riding but much more of a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.519 
luxurious riding but much more of a
rider<00:00:26.010> emphasis<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.019> more<00:00:28.199> sporty

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
rider emphasis so it's a more sporty

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.740 
rider emphasis so it's a more sporty
ride<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.490> more<00:00:29.699> dynamic<00:00:29.849> ride<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
ride it's a more dynamic ride a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.410 
ride it's a more dynamic ride a
motorcycle<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.189> agile<00:00:32.669> by<00:00:32.969> comparison

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
motorcycle is really agile by comparison

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.090 
motorcycle is really agile by comparison
to<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> GTL<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.530> about<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> harder

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to the GTL it's about a harder

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.200 
to the GTL it's about a harder
suspension<00:00:35.360> more<00:00:36.360> firm<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.210> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
suspension more firm and so on and the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
suspension more firm and so on and the
riders<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> forward<00:00:40.680> position<00:00:40.710> which

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
riders more in a forward position which

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
riders more in a forward position which
is<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> want<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.989> want<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.559> very

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
is what you want if you want to go very

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
is what you want if you want to go very
fast<00:00:44.070> over<00:00:44.460> long<00:00:44.640> distances<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.989> it's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
fast over long distances and it's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.900 
fast over long distances and it's
clearly<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> motorcycle<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.309> has<00:00:47.430> got<00:00:47.640> more

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
clearly a motorcycle which has got more

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.360 
clearly a motorcycle which has got more
the<00:00:48.059> European<00:00:48.629> market<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.200> mind<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:50.340> maybe

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the European market in mind then maybe

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549 
the European market in mind then maybe
the<00:00:50.820> American<00:00:51.300> market<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> also<00:00:51.899> gives<00:00:52.350> very

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the American market it also gives very

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.029 
the American market it also gives very
good<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.430> ride<00:00:53.960> but<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.140> comparison<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
good to up ride but in comparison to the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:06.500 
good to up ride but in comparison to the
GTL<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.730> course<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.480> compromise<00:01:05.330> ended<00:01:06.330> up

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
GTL of course it's a compromise ended up

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.480 
GTL of course it's a compromise ended up
with<00:01:06.720> six-cylinder<00:01:07.500> in-line<00:01:07.710> engine<00:01:08.130> which

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
with six-cylinder in-line engine which

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.370 
with six-cylinder in-line engine which
is<00:01:08.520> only<00:01:08.880> four<00:01:09.180> actually<00:01:09.630> wider<00:01:09.930> than<00:01:10.260> our

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
is only four actually wider than our

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.789 
is only four actually wider than our
current<00:01:11.060> 1300<00:01:12.060> four-cylinder<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.380> challenge

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
current 1300 four-cylinder the challenge

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.890 
current 1300 four-cylinder the challenge
was<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.549> bring<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.360> engine

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
was how do you bring that engine

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.980 
was how do you bring that engine
successfully<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> motorcycle<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
successfully in a motorcycle and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.330 
successfully in a motorcycle and
actually<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.140> our<00:01:19.350> work<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> we've<00:01:20.310> done

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
actually now our work that we've done

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.640 
actually now our work that we've done
just<00:01:21.119> previously<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> development<00:01:22.590> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
just previously with the development of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
just previously with the development of
the<00:01:22.740> Superbike<00:01:23.220> helped<00:01:23.670> us<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> lot<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.360> in

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the Superbike helped us a lot because in

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.080 
the Superbike helped us a lot because in
the<00:01:24.900> Superbike<00:01:25.380> both<00:01:25.770> white<00:01:26.159> as<00:01:26.400> well<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.820> size

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the Superbike both white as well as size

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
the Superbike both white as well as size
and<00:01:27.119> packaging<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.170> critical<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.610> we've

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and packaging is critical and what we've

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.550 
and packaging is critical and what we've
learned<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.390> terms<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.869> production<00:01:31.200> processes

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
learned in terms of production processes

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.160 
learned in terms of production processes
we<00:01:32.250> could<00:01:32.430> apply<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> six<00:01:33.509> cylinder<00:01:33.960> now

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
we could apply in the six cylinder now

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.380 
we could apply in the six cylinder now
as<00:01:34.380> well<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.400> tells<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.939> something

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
as well and that tells you something

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.319 
as well and that tells you something
about<00:01:36.560> design<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.280> processes<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.180> we

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
about design and the processes that we

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
about design and the processes that we
need<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.780> make<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> engine<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.560> narrow<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
need to make in the engine so narrow and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.359 
need to make in the engine so narrow and
so<00:01:41.520> light<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.780> also<00:01:42.960> helped<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.740> because

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
so light it also helped that because

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.039 
so light it also helped that because
it's<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.640> touring<00:01:45.030> engine<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> want<00:01:45.810> talk

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it's a touring engine if you want talk

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.550 
it's a touring engine if you want talk
and<00:01:46.320> talk<00:01:46.649> means<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.399> stroke

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
and talk means you want stroke

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.319 
and talk means you want stroke
of<00:01:48.619> course<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.310> longer<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.759> stroke<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.210> in

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
of course the longer the stroke is in

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.690 
of course the longer the stroke is in
the<00:01:50.420> engines<00:01:50.810> smaller<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.470> four<00:01:51.740> years<00:01:52.040> that

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the engines smaller the four years that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.670 
the engines smaller the four years that
meant<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.090> cylinders<00:01:53.570> became<00:01:53.899> smaller<00:01:54.350> and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
meant the cylinders became smaller and

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.590 
meant the cylinders became smaller and
there's<00:01:55.130> only<00:01:55.369> between<00:01:55.880> cylinders<00:01:56.210> about

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
there's only between cylinders about

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.170 
there's only between cylinders about
five<00:01:56.899> millimeter<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:57.829> we<00:01:58.520> managed<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.909> keep

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
five millimeter so we managed to keep

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.060 
five millimeter so we managed to keep
that<00:01:59.240> overall<00:01:59.899> in<00:02:00.110> two<00:02:00.259> dimension<00:02:00.890> which<00:02:01.039> is

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
that overall in two dimension which is

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.070 
that overall in two dimension which is
critical<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:02.060> very<00:02:02.689> small<00:02:03.320> size

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
critical to that very small size

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.810 
critical to that very small size
besides<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.289> size<00:02:06.560> element<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.399> engine

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
besides the size element of the engine

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.309 
besides the size element of the engine
it's<00:02:07.970> also<00:02:08.179> important<00:02:08.780> where<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.019> place<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
it's also important where you place the

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.460 
it's also important where you place the
engine<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.459> we<00:02:10.789> use<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.209> dry<00:02:11.420> sump<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.230> by

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
engine so we use the dry sump and by

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.320 
engine so we use the dry sump and by
using<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:13.040> dry<00:02:13.220> sump<00:02:13.550> which<00:02:13.700> will<00:02:13.880> lower<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
using a dry sump which will lower the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.059 
using a dry sump which will lower the
engine<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.050> lowered<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.620> turn<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
engine and that lowered in turn the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.979 
engine and that lowered in turn the
center<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.459> gravity<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:17.390> engines<00:02:17.780> also
