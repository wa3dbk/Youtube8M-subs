00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
Mourinho there for a second because I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.499 
Mourinho there for a second because I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I think he's a silver the other four

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
I think he's a silver the other four
five<00:01:47.640> stars<00:01:47.909> Gilmore<00:01:48.390> na<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.049> yeah<00:01:49.320> it
