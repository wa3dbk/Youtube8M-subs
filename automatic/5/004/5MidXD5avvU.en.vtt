00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
 loose powder here in the testing room of the clear entourage also shows in fact 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.800
 follow that the first transmission of a match and then play 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.900
 the semi-final of the uefa champions league between Manchester and Barcelona in 3d 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 the reciprocal not special that only 703 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.609
 and everyone can also fit the machine labor can accompany the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.470
 channel 703 the smaller one can follow by the pipe 73 this transmission in 3d 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.529
 remembering that some cinemas also that brazil held in sÃ£o 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.220
 paulo rio de janeiro porto alegre also with tentos de ceos closed this 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.930
 I'm going to put the goalkeeper in the game as it is now for her to see you. 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.740
 pardon and the impressions noon accompanied world cup edition 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.019
 to movie theaters 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.249
 and now they will be able to monitor here in the patents a 3d tv is of 42 inches I 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.309
 I already perceive the depth of great fantastic depth and the 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.739
 the missive for example in case you want to invest the correct time the team 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.170
 of barcelona emotional score 0 to 0 also jumps a lot of the screen is fine 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.210
 interesting as the proposal of the game of color scenes is fantastic if you see 

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.359
 in 3d it seems that the player is not leaving the tv 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.020
 I'm going to buy some of the little match for the Brazilian Cup. 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 As interesting things come up, I'll do it for you. 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.870
 the staff from the series is almost two minutes into the game 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.090
 for the moment this one did not have any due to problems of locking in the transmission 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.440
 there is still any given signal 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.660
 everything is going well because besides working clear until dimensionality 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.460
 start now fantastic simonal is to pass on donatela 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.909
 which also evaluates the stability of the signal because 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.149
 is the first is not the first time he does this he has already done many tests 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.749
 this carnival tradition of the Indian formula itself 

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:47.489
 but it is the first time that pt announces to everyone that it has a peculiarity 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:52.100
 the possibility to see a match in real-time live 3d 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.539
 what is happening now 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.229
 and for now it was okay in the fight in the house left being transmitted too 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.150
 in high resolution hd 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.410
 for several days seeing the world cup we saw a lot that could be 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.369
 many years unconventional on the part of football 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.890
 is a guy but very close to the lawn and always looking to give 12 with 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.459
 now, because this is when you see the 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.090
 three-dimensionality you have a very great gain of depth 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.390
 and you also realize that the players are very close to the most good 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.950
 next to you is the final stop of the league of the uefa although the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.010
 than normal 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.119
 it's not being so strong so the features have been so used 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.949
 like in the final of the world cup, which in my opinion is better because 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.950
 accustomed to seeing the football match at the most open angle 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.690
 and I am satisfied in the pockets of the five kings one of the best phrases like now 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.610
 a ball more for nothing and then you end up having more sense of the game and the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.129
 At the same time the feeling of depth does not pass that I think 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.909
 interesting 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.090
 the cradle to the grave that is the horcrux in front of the camera to see if you 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:01.579
 can get a little better and who knows that the image she 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:02.720
 my double memory 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.199
 we are really devastated with you are seeing right 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.290
 I'm going to put on glasses I do not know if you can see it is perfectly 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.670
 is a specific password but it has not been much better 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.599
 and now with five minutes of play with you can see there over the chest is 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.680
 the first time 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.180
 and fails the audio sumiller remembering that one of its first 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.890
 classrooms 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.080
 and in one of its goals turned subject occur this type of dengue predicted 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.020
 but for example now with 5 minutes of starting itself is no longer the same as 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.340
 even though the transmission of images continues to occur normally 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.519
 now with seven minutes of play but the same only returned to normal 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.900
 and this scene that also drew a lot of attention goes to the world cup that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.350
 this face at the height of the lawn is awesome you see 3d game 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.470
 with this camera is impressive the feeling of depth and to who arrives 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.270
 closer to the movies or cinema animations that 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.589
 characters jump off the screen 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:02.709
 is the closest to arriving when you pick up this load at the height of the lawn and 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.269
 close to the players only that is a shirt that limits the game vision 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.409
 then it can be the entire startup if forwarded servers return to normal 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.569
 weighing more open 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.479
 that although it is loaded with age, it is not that sensation that 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.680
 world expects the situation of itself 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.000
 those who talk about saving tires are those jumps that come off the screen with this 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.199
 duel more open did not make certain the characters today be the score or else 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.930
 some information that appears there, this usually leaves the screen until the 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.809
 highest note 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:37.669
 I still see here the start of the Champions League final that 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.130
 I go from my impressions that I think I really think you 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.639
 lived games or any other type of sport three of them 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.930
 It is more interesting when the years are closed like schools of August Daniel 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.580
 alves now 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.950
 because when the fight over let you really have that feeling of 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.130
 this great event and more reserved dimensionality that is the 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.150
 that everyone looks for 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.080
 I think other sports like the one for beach volleyball came back but that is 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.190
 typical of those closest to the court is much more interesting 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.880
 but unfortunately does not have this type of transmission yet in Brazil list of 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.380
 The United States comes here to cprh to transmit our departures and transmitted 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.409
 games of other championships 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.499
 in Europe also since the sportv and tv channels 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.669
 and in Brazil it is given on a quarterly basis 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.499
 what I think I think it's going to be like this I think it's a great thing 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:32.680
 different thing 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.700
 and who wants 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.820
 Beijing has a 3d tv in time green city 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.909
 from the moment he got used to the music in the different 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.919
 but emphasized that three-dimensionality 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.519
 I really wanted to enjoy this resource.
