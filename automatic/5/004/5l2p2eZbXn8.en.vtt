okay<00:00:02.190> briefly<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.790> want<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.090> talk<00:00:03.270> about<00:00:03.589> again

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay briefly I want to talk about again

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.749 
okay briefly I want to talk about again
the<00:00:04.650> flow<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:04.950> cerebrospinal<00:00:05.160> fluid

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
the flow of cerebrospinal fluid

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.509 
the flow of cerebrospinal fluid
throughout<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.299> brain<00:00:06.529> okay<00:00:07.529> now

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
throughout the brain okay now

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.549 
throughout the brain okay now
cerebrospinal<00:00:09.000> fluid<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.170> type<00:00:10.530> of

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
cerebrospinal fluid is it's a type of

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.499 
cerebrospinal fluid is it's a type of
liquid<00:00:10.980> that's<00:00:11.309> very<00:00:11.490> similar<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> plasma

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
liquid that's very similar to the plasma

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.299 
liquid that's very similar to the plasma
of<00:00:12.540> our<00:00:12.719> blood<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.530> know<00:00:13.679> there<00:00:13.980> are<00:00:14.099> some

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
of our blood but you know there are some

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.640 
of our blood but you know there are some
different<00:00:15.299> compositions<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.170> compared<00:00:16.560> to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
different compositions of it compared to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.590 
different compositions of it compared to
plasma<00:00:17.070> mainly<00:00:17.490> there's<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.820> lot<00:00:18.060> less<00:00:18.270> protein

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
plasma mainly there's a lot less protein

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.140 
plasma mainly there's a lot less protein
in<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.380> there's<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> little<00:00:20.369> less<00:00:20.609> bicarb

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
in it and there's a little less bicarb

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.420 
in it and there's a little less bicarb
bicarbonate<00:00:21.960> within<00:00:22.289> cerebral<00:00:23.070> spinal<00:00:23.160> fluid

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
bicarbonate within cerebral spinal fluid

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.279 
bicarbonate within cerebral spinal fluid
as<00:00:23.760> well<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.600> that's<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.869> good<00:00:24.990> thing<00:00:25.050> because

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
as well but that's a good thing because

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.810 
as well but that's a good thing because
that<00:00:25.380> allows<00:00:25.619> us<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.949> respond<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.430> changes<00:00:26.760> in

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that allows us to respond to changes in

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.089 
that allows us to respond to changes in
PH<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.359> little<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> lot<00:00:27.840> more<00:00:27.960> rapidly<00:00:28.910> okay<00:00:31.099> so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
PH a little a lot more rapidly okay so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.860 
PH a little a lot more rapidly okay so
now<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.340> happens<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.910> now<00:00:33.059> what<00:00:33.570> happens

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
now what happens so now what happens

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.450 
now what happens so now what happens
here<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.370> are

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
here we have up here we have what are

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.709 
here we have up here we have what are
called<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> lateral<00:00:35.910> ventricles<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
called the lateral ventricles of the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.600 
called the lateral ventricles of the
brain<00:00:36.780> okay<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.739> these<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:38.010> deep<00:00:38.219> within<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
brain okay and these are deep within the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.430 
brain okay and these are deep within the
cerebral<00:00:39.030> hemispheres<00:00:39.059> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.899> found<00:00:42.440> just

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
cerebral hemispheres kind of found just

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.959 
cerebral hemispheres kind of found just
kind<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.649> underneath<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.250> along<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.730> sides

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
kind of underneath and along the sides

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549 
kind of underneath and along the sides
of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> corpus<00:00:45.660> callosum<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.469> can

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
of the corpus callosum and as you can

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.319 
of the corpus callosum and as you can
see<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:46.829> project<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.640> towards<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.030> exit

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
see they project back towards the exit

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.590 
see they project back towards the exit
pattullo<00:00:48.690> beer<00:00:48.989> okay<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.640> within<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.389 

within<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> lateral<00:00:55.199> ventricles<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
within the lateral ventricles and the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.709 
within the lateral ventricles and the
third<00:00:56.610> ventricle<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> fourth<00:00:57.539> ventricle

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
third ventricle in the fourth ventricle

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
third ventricle in the fourth ventricle
there's<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> specialized<00:00:58.890> group<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.460> blood

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
there's a specialized group of blood

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.200 
there's a specialized group of blood
capillaries<00:01:00.539> called<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.350> choroid<00:01:01.770> plexus

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
capillaries called the choroid plexus

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.860 
capillaries called the choroid plexus
basically<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:03.359> these<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:03.690> are

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
basically what these are these are

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.590 
basically what these are these are
capillaries<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:05.240> surrounded<00:01:06.240> by<00:01:06.270> cells

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
capillaries that are surrounded by cells

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.870 
capillaries that are surrounded by cells
called<00:01:06.869> ependymal<00:01:07.320> cells<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.490> happens

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
called ependymal cells that what happens

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
called ependymal cells that what happens
then<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.240> filter<00:01:09.689> blood<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
then we filter blood out of here and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
then we filter blood out of here and
then<00:01:11.640> those<00:01:11.820> cells<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:15.259> then<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.530> play

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
then those cells kind of then they play

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.880 
then those cells kind of then they play
a<00:01:16.770> role<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:18.049> basically<00:01:19.049> converting<00:01:19.590> blood

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
a role and basically converting blood

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.560 
a role and basically converting blood
the<00:01:20.130> plasma<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.790> filter<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.270> into

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the plasma that we filter out into

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.800 
the plasma that we filter out into
cerebral<00:01:21.990> spinal<00:01:22.080> fluid<00:01:22.430> ok<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.479> flow

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
cerebral spinal fluid ok now this flow

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.109 
cerebral spinal fluid ok now this flow
we<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.610> happens<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
we kind of go you know what happens this

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.920 
we kind of go you know what happens this
flow<00:01:27.390> begins<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.360> lateral<00:01:30.360> ventricles

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
flow begins up in the lateral ventricles

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.510 
flow begins up in the lateral ventricles
number<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> view

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
number this is just one this is a view

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
number this is just one this is a view
just<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:32.970> hemisphere<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> brain<00:01:33.689> ok<00:01:34.500> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
just one hemisphere of the brain ok so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.140 
just one hemisphere of the brain ok so
we<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.009> lateral<00:01:35.220> ventricle<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
we have one lateral ventricle here and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.310 
we have one lateral ventricle here and
there's<00:01:36.270> another<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> other<00:01:36.900> side

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
there's another one on the other side

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.380 
there's another one on the other side
okay<00:01:38.009> both<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.490> ventricles<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.150> filled

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
okay both these ventricles are filled

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.249 
okay both these ventricles are filled
with<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> choroid<00:01:39.930> plexus<00:01:40.189> ok<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:42.540> we

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
with the choroid plexus ok so then we

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.530 
with the choroid plexus ok so then we
start<00:01:43.799> fluid<00:01:44.520> starts<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.909> fill<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
start fluid starts to fill this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.450 
start fluid starts to fill this
ventricle<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:46.890> happens<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
ventricle up and then what happens it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.420 
ventricle up and then what happens it
passes<00:01:47.970> through<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.840> opening<00:01:49.250> called<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
passes through this opening called the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.340 
passes through this opening called the
foramen<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.060> Monro<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> interventricular

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
foramen of Monro or the interventricular

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
foramen of Monro or the interventricular
foramen<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.490> enter<00:01:53.729> meaning<00:01:54.030> in

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
foramen you know enter meaning in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
foramen you know enter meaning in
between<00:01:54.420> ventricular<00:01:55.320> ventricles<00:01:55.829> okay<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
between ventricular ventricles okay and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
between ventricular ventricles okay and
then<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.750> cerebral<00:01:58.049> spinal<00:01:58.259> fluid<00:01:58.590> then

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
then that cerebral spinal fluid then

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.200 
then that cerebral spinal fluid then
travels<00:01:59.369> from<00:01:59.460> these<00:01:59.610> two<00:01:59.790> lateral

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
travels from these two lateral

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.550 
travels from these two lateral
ventricles<00:02:00.719> down<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:01.110> what's<00:02:01.290> called<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
ventricles down into what's called the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.280 
ventricles down into what's called the
third<00:02:01.799> ventricle<00:02:02.189> okay<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.170> can

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
third ventricle okay and then as you can

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.719 
third ventricle okay and then as you can
see<00:02:04.560> there's<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> roof<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> third

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
see there's on the roof of the third

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.760 
see there's on the roof of the third
ventricle<00:02:06.060> there's<00:02:06.420> also<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.750> group<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
ventricle there's also a group of the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.139 
ventricle there's also a group of the
specialized<00:02:08.340> blood<00:02:08.489> vessels<00:02:08.910> called<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
specialized blood vessels called the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.520 
specialized blood vessels called the
choroid<00:02:09.390> plexus<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.899> these<00:02:10.170> are<00:02:10.379> also

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
choroid plexus and these are also

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.390 
choroid plexus and these are also
helping<00:02:11.099> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
helping to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.960 
helping to
cerebral<00:02:11.819> spinal<00:02:11.909> fluid<00:02:12.290> okay<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.250> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
cerebral spinal fluid okay so then the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.699 
cerebral spinal fluid okay so then the
flu<00:02:15.209> son<00:02:15.390> CSF<00:02:15.930> goes<00:02:16.140> from<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.319> lateral

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
flu son CSF goes from a lateral

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.130 
flu son CSF goes from a lateral
ventricles<00:02:17.220> down<00:02:17.430> into<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> third<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.360> then

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
ventricles down into the third and then

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.000 
ventricles down into the third and then
as<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.670> third<00:02:20.849> ventricle<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.420> filling<00:02:21.810> up

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
as the third ventricle is filling up

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.990 
as the third ventricle is filling up
through<00:02:23.010> bill<00:02:23.159> spinal<00:02:23.549> fluid<00:02:23.760> will<00:02:23.909> then

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
through bill spinal fluid will then

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.350 
through bill spinal fluid will then
travel<00:02:24.269> down<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:25.400> very<00:02:26.400> narrow<00:02:26.700> tubular

fluid travels down the aquaduct of
sylvius<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.230> will<00:02:37.680> then<00:02:37.890> start<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.579> pull

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
sylvius it will then start to pull

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.089 
sylvius it will then start to pull
within<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.750> fourth<00:02:40.079> ventricle<00:02:40.349> which<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:40.980> you

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
within the fourth ventricle which is you

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.860 
within the fourth ventricle which is you
can<00:02:41.220> see<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.489> triangular<00:02:42.060> shaped<00:02:42.390> structure

cerebral<00:03:49.979> spinal<00:03:50.099> fluid<00:03:50.569> flows<00:03:51.569> around<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
cerebral spinal fluid flows around and

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.899 
cerebral spinal fluid flows around and
the<00:03:52.349> various<00:03:52.650> areas<00:03:52.949> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.459> central<00:03:53.849> nervous

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
the various areas of the central nervous

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.969 
the various areas of the central nervous
system<00:03:54.449> that<00:03:54.599> CSF<00:03:55.109> flows<00:03:55.379> through<00:03:55.680> are<00:03:55.799> called

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
system that CSF flows through are called

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.339 
system that CSF flows through are called
cisterns<00:03:56.579> any<00:03:56.970> cisterns<00:03:57.389> are<00:03:57.569> named<00:03:57.810> based<00:03:58.139> on

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
cisterns any cisterns are named based on

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.930 
cisterns any cisterns are named based on
their<00:03:58.470> locations<00:03:59.040> like<00:03:59.159> for<00:03:59.340> example<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.760> chi

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
their locations like for example the chi

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.490 
their locations like for example the chi
asthmatic<00:04:00.479> cistern<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.109> followed<00:04:01.379> by<00:04:01.409> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
asthmatic cistern is followed by the

asthmatic cistern is followed by the
optic<00:04:01.919> chiasm<00:04:01.949> and<00:04:02.639> so<00:04:02.819> on<00:04:03.000> ok<00:04:03.720> we're<00:04:03.930> not

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
optic chiasm and so on ok we're not

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.149 
optic chiasm and so on ok we're not
going<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.199> go<00:04:04.260> over<00:04:04.290> all<00:04:04.470> these<00:04:04.590> sisters<00:04:04.979> but

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
going to go over all these sisters but

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.559 
going to go over all these sisters but
just<00:04:05.310> understand<00:04:05.819> those<00:04:05.970> are<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.180> regions

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
just understand those are the regions

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.809 
just understand those are the regions
where<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:07.349> fluid<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.459> following<00:04:08.819> ok<00:04:10.819> now

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
where this fluid is following ok now

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.430 
where this fluid is following ok now
cerebral<00:04:12.209> spinal<00:04:12.299> fluid<00:04:12.569> again<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.290> know<00:04:13.379> you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
cerebral spinal fluid again you know you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.330 
cerebral spinal fluid again you know you
can<00:04:13.650> see<00:04:13.829> down<00:04:14.040> here<00:04:14.340> at<00:04:14.549> this<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:17.070> know<00:04:17.190> at

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
can see down here at this you know at

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.159 
can see down here at this you know at
the<00:04:17.459> median<00:04:17.760> aperture<00:04:18.150> some<00:04:18.449> of<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.599> CSF<00:04:19.049> is

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
the median aperture some of the CSF is

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.949 
the median aperture some of the CSF is
traveling<00:04:19.590> down<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.010> stand<00:04:20.219> down<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.959> spinal

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
traveling down the stand down the spinal

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.070 
traveling down the stand down the spinal
cord<00:04:22.349> and<00:04:22.529> it's<00:04:22.710> kind<00:04:22.889> of

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
cord and it's kind of

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.960 
cord and it's kind of
you<00:04:23.409> know<00:04:23.500> engulfing<00:04:24.189> or<00:04:24.340> surrounding<00:04:24.849> this

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
you know engulfing or surrounding this

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.330 
you know engulfing or surrounding this
area<00:04:25.330> okay<00:04:26.319> and<00:04:26.620> then<00:04:26.919> it<00:04:27.069> will<00:04:27.159> eventually

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
area okay and then it will eventually

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.369 
area okay and then it will eventually
flow<00:04:27.849> its<00:04:28.060> way<00:04:28.180> back<00:04:28.449> up<00:04:28.689> as<00:04:28.870> well<00:04:29.050> and

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:29.379 
flow its way back up as well and

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.559 
flow its way back up as well and
cerebral<00:04:29.680> spinal<00:04:29.830> fluid<00:04:30.129> has<00:04:30.819> a<00:04:30.849> pressure<00:04:31.240> of

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
cerebral spinal fluid has a pressure of

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.570 
cerebral spinal fluid has a pressure of
oh<00:04:31.689> maybe<00:04:31.930> five<00:04:32.289> to<00:04:32.500> seven<00:04:32.860> five<00:04:33.159> point<00:04:33.400> five

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
oh maybe five to seven five point five

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.300 
oh maybe five to seven five point five
to<00:04:33.789> seven<00:04:34.090> seven<00:04:34.300> millimeters<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:34.960> mercury

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
to seven seven millimeters of mercury

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.110 
to seven seven millimeters of mercury
okay<00:04:36.310> now<00:04:36.460> that's<00:04:36.610> important<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.060> know

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
okay now that's important to know

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.429 
okay now that's important to know
because<00:04:37.210> you<00:04:37.840> know<00:04:37.870> let's<00:04:38.110> say<00:04:38.199> someone

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
because you know let's say someone

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.350 
because you know let's say someone
accumulates<00:04:39.009> excessive<00:04:39.460> amounts<00:04:39.759> of<00:04:39.759> CSF

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
accumulates excessive amounts of CSF

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.429 
accumulates excessive amounts of CSF
that's<00:04:40.599> going<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.810> increase<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.199> amount<00:04:41.379> of

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
that's going to increase the amount of

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.959 
that's going to increase the amount of
pressure<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.889> our<00:04:41.979> central<00:04:42.250> nervous<00:04:42.340> system

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 
pressure in our central nervous system

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.089 
pressure in our central nervous system
okay<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.080> they'll<00:04:44.199> see<00:04:44.409> that<00:04:44.620> when<00:04:44.889> we're

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
okay and they'll see that when we're

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.249 
okay and they'll see that when we're
doing<00:04:45.189> a<00:04:45.509> for<00:04:46.509> example<00:04:46.810> someone<00:04:46.960> has<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.169> have

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
doing a for example someone has to have

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.140 
doing a for example someone has to have
a<00:04:47.319> spinal<00:04:47.560> tap<00:04:47.879> okay<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:50.020> then<00:04:50.289> as<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:51.400> CSF<00:04:51.939> is

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
a spinal tap okay so then as the CSF is

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.170 
a spinal tap okay so then as the CSF is
is<00:04:52.569> passing<00:04:53.439> around<00:04:54.039> what<00:04:54.490> happens<00:04:54.879> is<00:04:55.060> it

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
is passing around what happens is it

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.990 
is passing around what happens is it
eventually<00:04:55.590> flows<00:04:56.590> up<00:04:56.979> and<00:04:57.219> meets<00:04:57.759> up<00:04:57.940> with

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
eventually flows up and meets up with

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.520 
eventually flows up and meets up with
what<00:04:58.330> are<00:04:58.419> called<00:04:58.629> these<00:04:58.900> arachnoid

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
what are called these arachnoid

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.209 
what are called these arachnoid
granulations<00:04:59.909> okay<00:05:00.909> basically<00:05:01.180> these<00:05:01.629> are

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
granulations okay basically these are

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.680 
granulations okay basically these are
there<00:05:03.219> are<00:05:03.310> some<00:05:03.430> fibers<00:05:03.819> and<00:05:03.940> some<00:05:04.090> folds

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
there are some fibers and some folds

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.839 
there are some fibers and some folds
within<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.080> arachnoid<00:05:05.530> mater<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:06.159> this<00:05:06.699> is

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
within the arachnoid mater and this is

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.140 
within the arachnoid mater and this is
where<00:05:07.000> cerebral<00:05:07.419> spinal<00:05:07.539> fluid<00:05:07.840> is<00:05:08.319> then

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
where cerebral spinal fluid is then

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.570 
where cerebral spinal fluid is then
absorbed<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.750> then<00:05:11.199> eventually<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.889> CSF<00:05:12.400> is

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
absorbed and then eventually the CSF is

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.300 
absorbed and then eventually the CSF is
absorbed<00:05:13.270> into<00:05:13.479> what's<00:05:14.259> called<00:05:14.319> the<00:05:14.590> superior

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
absorbed into what's called the superior

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.089 
absorbed into what's called the superior
sagittal<00:05:15.520> sinus<00:05:16.139> okay<00:05:17.139> and<00:05:17.409> then<00:05:17.770> it<00:05:17.889> will

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
sagittal sinus okay and then it will

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.070 
sagittal sinus okay and then it will
flow<00:05:18.310> through<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.849> superior<00:05:19.389> sagittal<00:05:19.569> sinus

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
flow through the superior sagittal sinus

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.779 
flow through the superior sagittal sinus
that<00:05:20.440> eventually<00:05:20.860> meet<00:05:21.039> up<00:05:21.219> with<00:05:21.400> venous

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
that eventually meet up with venous

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.670 
that eventually meet up with venous
blood<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.389> then<00:05:22.689> get<00:05:22.900> pumped<00:05:23.199> back<00:05:23.289> out<00:05:23.469> into

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
blood and then get pumped back out into

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.709 
blood and then get pumped back out into
the<00:05:23.860> system<00:05:24.250> okay<00:05:24.879> now<00:05:25.090> we<00:05:25.150> have<00:05:25.360> an<00:05:25.449> example

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
the system okay now we have an example

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.209 
the system okay now we have an example
right<00:05:25.930> here<00:05:26.199> of<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.590> superior<00:05:26.889> sagittal

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
right here of the superior sagittal

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.490 
right here of the superior sagittal
sinus<00:05:27.729> now<00:05:28.449> the<00:05:28.509> superior<00:05:28.960> sagittal<00:05:29.080> sinus

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
sinus now the superior sagittal sinus

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.790 
sinus now the superior sagittal sinus
again<00:05:29.889> is<00:05:30.009> caused<00:05:30.219> by<00:05:31.440> folds<00:05:32.440> in<00:05:32.529> the<00:05:32.560> dura

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
again is caused by folds in the dura

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.200 
again is caused by folds in the dura
mater<00:05:33.039> remember<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.550> dura<00:05:33.729> mater<00:05:33.909> and<00:05:34.150> the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
mater remember the dura mater and the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.320 
mater remember the dura mater and the
skull<00:05:34.599> is<00:05:34.960> is<00:05:35.440> by<00:05:36.129> layered<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.729> contains<00:05:37.090> the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.670 
periosteum layer then the cerebral layer
okay<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.509> then<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.810> area<00:05:40.960> where<00:05:41.199> these<00:05:41.319> two

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
okay and then the area where these two

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.189 
okay and then the area where these two
layers<00:05:42.009> needs<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:42.729> fold<00:05:43.060> they<00:05:43.779> form<00:05:44.110> the

fluid<00:05:49.839> is<00:05:49.900> absorbed<00:05:50.349> into<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:50.860> can<00:05:51.009> see

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
fluid is absorbed into and you can see

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.740 
fluid is absorbed into and you can see
right<00:05:51.279> here<00:05:51.580> i'm<00:05:51.729> putting<00:05:52.060> this<00:05:52.089> dull<00:05:52.389> probe

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
right here i'm putting this dull probe

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.409 
right here i'm putting this dull probe
into<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:55.440> superior<00:05:56.440> sagittal<00:05:56.620> sinus<00:05:57.099> of<00:05:57.460> the

into the superior sagittal sinus of the

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.659 
into the superior sagittal sinus of the
brain<00:05:58.659> itself<00:05:58.870> okay<00:05:59.529> of<00:05:59.770> the<00:05:59.919> dura<00:06:00.099> mater<00:06:00.310> and

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
brain itself okay of the dura mater and

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.329 
brain itself okay of the dura mater and
there's<00:06:01.210> also<00:06:01.419> an<00:06:01.719> inferior<00:06:02.650> sagittal<00:06:03.129> sinus

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:03.339 
there's also an inferior sagittal sinus

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.939 
there's also an inferior sagittal sinus
that<00:06:03.789> passes<00:06:04.719> long<00:06:04.900> inferior<00:06:05.440> aspect<00:06:05.560> of<00:06:05.889> the

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
that passes long inferior aspect of the

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.860 
that passes long inferior aspect of the
brain<00:06:06.159> as<00:06:06.310> well<00:06:06.339> okay<00:06:07.300> but<00:06:07.360> that's<00:06:07.599> the<00:06:07.719> basic

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
brain as well okay but that's the basic

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.320 
brain as well okay but that's the basic
route<00:06:08.349> of<00:06:08.680> cerebral<00:06:09.129> spinal<00:06:09.250> fluid<00:06:09.580> now<00:06:10.060> again

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
route of cerebral spinal fluid now again

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.089 
route of cerebral spinal fluid now again
the<00:06:10.719> whole<00:06:11.050> purpose<00:06:11.289> of<00:06:11.589> cerebral<00:06:11.979> spinal

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
the whole purpose of cerebral spinal

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.999 
the whole purpose of cerebral spinal
fluid<00:06:12.400> is<00:06:12.879> to<00:06:13.180> basically<00:06:13.960> kind<00:06:14.409> of<00:06:14.529> wash<00:06:14.740> the

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
fluid is to basically kind of wash the

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.860 
fluid is to basically kind of wash the
brain<00:06:15.250> kind<00:06:15.520> of<00:06:15.669> clean<00:06:15.909> metabolites<00:06:16.569> out<00:06:16.750> of

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
brain kind of clean metabolites out of

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.420 
brain kind of clean metabolites out of
the<00:06:16.930> brain<00:06:17.169> and<00:06:17.379> also<00:06:17.919> it<00:06:18.250> plays<00:06:18.460> a<00:06:18.490> role<00:06:18.879> in

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
the brain and also it plays a role in

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.499 
the brain and also it plays a role in
communication<00:06:21.430> with<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.729> brain<00:06:21.940> it<00:06:22.150> can<00:06:22.240> it

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
communication with the brain it can it

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.320 
communication with the brain it can it
can<00:06:22.889> circulate<00:06:23.889> some<00:06:24.520> neuro<00:06:24.969> endocrine

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
can circulate some neuro endocrine

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.510 
can circulate some neuro endocrine
hormones<00:06:25.810> and<00:06:26.500> prohormones<00:06:27.039> all<00:06:27.250> throughout

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
hormones and prohormones all throughout

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.430 
hormones and prohormones all throughout
the<00:06:27.669> central<00:06:27.879> nervous<00:06:28.120> system<00:06:28.539> so<00:06:28.690> that<00:06:28.719> so<00:06:29.199> we

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
the central nervous system so that so we

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.060 
the central nervous system so that so we
can<00:06:29.589> have<00:06:29.680> some<00:06:29.740> communication<00:06:30.460> going<00:06:30.610> on

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
can have some communication going on

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.770 
can have some communication going on
and<00:06:31.490> remember<00:06:31.670> we<00:06:31.910> produce<00:06:32.120> on<00:06:32.420> average

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
and remember we produce on average

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.120 
and remember we produce on average
depending<00:06:32.990> on<00:06:33.290> with<00:06:33.410> book<00:06:33.590> you<00:06:33.740> read<00:06:33.980> between

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
depending on with book you read between

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.460 
depending on with book you read between
4<00:06:34.610> to<00:06:34.640> 500<00:06:34.910> milliliters<00:06:35.840> of<00:06:35.870> cerebral<00:06:36.350> spinal

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
4 to 500 milliliters of cerebral spinal

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.160 
4 to 500 milliliters of cerebral spinal
fluid<00:06:36.800> per<00:06:37.190> day<00:06:37.490> and<00:06:37.760> we<00:06:38.330> completely<00:06:38.810> turn

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
fluid per day and we completely turn

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.930 
fluid per day and we completely turn
that<00:06:39.380> turn<00:06:39.710> that<00:06:39.770> over<00:06:39.950> about<00:06:40.430> three<00:06:40.700> times

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
that turn that over about three times

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.270 
that turn that over about three times
per<00:06:41.210> day<00:06:41.590> okay<00:06:42.590> so<00:06:43.010> left<00:06:43.190> the<00:06:43.340> flow<00:06:43.550> of<00:06:43.580> CSF<00:06:45.280> and

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
per day okay so left the flow of CSF and

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.860 
per day okay so left the flow of CSF and
again<00:06:46.670> right<00:06:46.880> here<00:06:47.030> you<00:06:47.180> can<00:06:47.330> also<00:06:47.480> see<00:06:47.750> the

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
again right here you can also see the

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.260 
again right here you can also see the
lateral<00:06:48.230> ventricles<00:06:48.790> okay<00:06:49.790> kind<00:06:50.210> of

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
lateral ventricles okay kind of

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.150 
lateral ventricles okay kind of
underneath<00:06:50.510> the<00:06:50.750> corpus<00:06:51.080> callosum<00:06:51.200> and<00:06:51.740> then

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
underneath the corpus callosum and then

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.770 
underneath the corpus callosum and then
as<00:06:52.280> we<00:06:52.400> look<00:06:52.580> at<00:06:52.700> some<00:06:52.850> other<00:06:52.940> cuts<00:06:53.330> of<00:06:53.570> the

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
as we look at some other cuts of the

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.450 
as we look at some other cuts of the
brain<00:06:54.020> you<00:06:54.410> will<00:06:54.530> get<00:06:54.740> to<00:06:54.860> see<00:06:55.010> the<00:06:55.130> choroid

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
brain you will get to see the choroid

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.680 
brain you will get to see the choroid
plexus<00:06:55.490> and<00:06:55.880> the<00:06:56.000> other<00:06:56.120> ventricles<00:06:56.570> for

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
plexus and the other ventricles for

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.940 
plexus and the other ventricles for
different<00:06:56.960> perspective<00:06:57.410> and<00:06:57.530> points<00:06:57.800> of<00:06:57.890> view

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
different perspective and points of view

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.880 
different perspective and points of view
okay
