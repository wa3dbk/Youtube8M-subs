want to know who do you think has the

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.359 
want to know who do you think has the
event<00:01:53.030> in<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.360> coaching<00:01:53.750> here's<00:01:54.380> my<00:01:54.920> early

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
event in the coaching here's my early

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.100 
event in the coaching here's my early
tape

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.010 

my<00:02:01.110> early<00:02:01.560> take<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.880> only<00:02:03.060> now<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.870> not

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
my early take this is only now it's not

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020 
my early take this is only now it's not
a<00:02:04.050> prediction<00:02:04.440> but<00:02:04.920> my<00:02:05.010> early<00:02:05.340> take<00:02:05.580> my

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
a prediction but my early take my

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.080 
a prediction but my early take my
feeling<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.660> this<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.800> I<00:02:08.070> don't<00:02:08.310> how

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
feeling on this is I have to I don't how

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.830 
feeling on this is I have to I don't how
is<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.470> tough<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.210> tough<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.780> right

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
is it it's tough it's a tough one right

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.080 
is it it's tough it's a tough one right
there<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:13.740> like<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.100> coaching<00:02:14.730> edge<00:02:14.880> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
there but I like the coaching edge I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.270 
there but I like the coaching edge I
like<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> momentum<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> defensive

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
like the momentum I like the defensive

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.700 
like the momentum I like the defensive
edge<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.960> Baltimore<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.200> they<00:02:19.470> know<00:02:19.680> that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
edge of Baltimore but they know that

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.220 
edge of Baltimore but they know that
frontline<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.820> Sims<00:02:21.030> goes<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.690> intense<00:02:22.080> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
frontline for Sims goes so intense and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.990 
frontline for Sims goes so intense and
Kaepernick<00:02:22.890> able<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.400> make<00:02:23.580> things<00:02:23.790> happen

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
Kaepernick able to make things happen

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.730 
Kaepernick able to make things happen
and<00:02:24.450> Flacco<00:02:24.840> seems<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.350> an<00:02:25.470> explainer

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
and Flacco seems to have an explainer

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.860 
and Flacco seems to have an explainer
not<00:02:25.950> level<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:26.820> I'm<00:02:27.000> slightly<00:02:27.420> leaning

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
not level I think I'm slightly leaning

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
not level I think I'm slightly leaning
towards<00:02:28.290> Baltimore<00:02:28.740> but<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.160> don't<00:02:29.400> know<00:02:29.550> about

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
towards Baltimore but I don't know about

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.820 
towards Baltimore but I don't know about
this<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.240> just<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.720> don't<00:02:30.780> know<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.350> don't<00:02:31.530> know
