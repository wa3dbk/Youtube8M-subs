00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.749
 Nestlé Avenue 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.749
 Nestlé CEO Peter Brabeck 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.000
 My name is Peter Brabeck, 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.750
 GENERAL QUARTER OF NESTLÉ, VEVEY AM GENFERSEE I come from Villach, city in Carinthia (Austria) 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.109
 and in the last 7 years I am ahead 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.859
 of the Nestlé group, 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.220
 the world's largest food corporation 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.000
 with an annual turnover of 90 billion Swiss francs 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.070
 or about 65 billion dollars / year 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.860
 and with about 275 thousand employees working directly with us. 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.360
 is a huge undertaking. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.789
 We are the 27th largest company in the world 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.090
 People today believe that everything that comes from nature is good. 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.320
 This represents a major change because until recently 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.210
 we have always been taught that nature could be merciless. 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.410
 the man is now in a position 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.650
 of being able to bring some balance to nature, 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.050
 but instead we have something resembling a 'moderation' 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.580
 saying that everything that comes from Nature is good. 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.920
 a good example is the organic movement: 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.870
 Organic, now, is the best possible. 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.240
 but organic is not the best 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.460
 after 15 years of eating genetically modified products 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 there has not been a single case of diseases caused by these products until today. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.710
 Despite this, people are so worried about this, in Europe 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.000
 that something happens to them. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.459
 It's more hypocrisy than anything else. 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:06.000
 The Nestlé Group is the world's largest drinking water bottler 

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:08.509
 There is a beautiful old Austrian folk song: 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:13.229
 "The beloved cattle need water, hollera, holleri" 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.299
 If you remember. 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.309
 The water is, of course, 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:19.109
 the most important raw material 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.429
 that we have today, in the world. 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.299
 It's a question of whether we should privatize 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.969
 the normal supply of water to the population. 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.829
 and there are 2 different opinions on this issue. 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.769
 One of them, which I think is extreme 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.999
 is represented by NGOs 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.289
 that hammer on 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.389
 declare water 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.000
 a public right. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.929
 It means that, as a human being, you should have the right to 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.669
 the water. 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.609
 This is an extreme solution. 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.469
 And another view is that 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.639
 water is a food like any other. 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.289
 and, like any other food, should have a market value. 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:14.749
 Personally, I think it's better ... 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.540
 price a food 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.000
 so that we are all aware of its price 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.000
 and then take specific measures ... 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.889
 for the part of the population that has no access to this water 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.139
 having many different possibilities there. 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.009
 I still think that ... 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.929
 the greater social responsibility ... 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.559
 of any Director is ... 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.779
 maintain and secure a future 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:04:01.029
 profitable and successful business. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.289
 Because, only if we can ensure our continued long-term existence ... 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.679
 we will be in a position to actively participate ... 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:14.239
 solutions to the world's problems. 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.000
 Being in a position to be able to create jobs: 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.349
 275,000 here 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.909
 1.2 million directly dependent on us at first. 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:27.479
 This amounts to around 4.5 million people, in total, 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.879
 for behind every one of us, there are three other people, 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.590
 so we have at least 4.5 million people 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.270
 which are directly dependent on us. 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.729
 If you want to create work 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.809
 you have to work yourself, 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.219
 Not like it was in the past ... 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.039
 where the existing work was distributed. 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:58.520
 if you remember, the main argument for ... 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.830
 for the 35 hour work week was ... 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.849
 that there was a certain amount of work and it would be better ... 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.050
 if we worked less and distributed the work among more people. 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.029
 This was clearly proven to be wrong. 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.620
 If you want to create more work, you have to work more yourself. 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.210
 And with that, we have to create a positive image of the world, for people, 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.460
 and I see absolutely no reason ... 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.569
 because we should not be positive about this future. 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.259
 We've never had so many good things, we've never had so much money, 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.050
 We have never been so healthy, 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.529
 We never live as much as we live today. 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.539
 We have everything we want ... 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.099
 and we still walk around as if we're whining about something. 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.009
 The Japanese. 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.509
 You can see... 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.900
 how modern these factories are; 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.479
 highly robotized, 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.319
 almost without anyone. 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:18.319
 We feed the world 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.000
 A movie of
