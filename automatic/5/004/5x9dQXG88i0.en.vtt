without having to move the blocks
themselves<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:18.060> begin<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:19.020> must<00:00:19.050> create<00:00:19.650> five

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
themselves to begin we must create five

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.950 
themselves to begin we must create five
holes<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> ground<00:00:20.850> preferably<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.840> a

obsidian<00:00:43.530> block<00:00:43.800> has<00:00:44.280> been<00:00:44.309> made<00:00:45.170> repeat<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
obsidian block has been made repeat the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:01:10.450 
obsidian block has been made repeat the
process<00:00:47.329> thoroughly<00:00:48.329> through<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.940> so

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.660 

there<00:01:11.060> we<00:01:11.690> have<00:01:11.900> our<00:01:12.170> for<00:01:12.619> obsidian<00:01:13.010> blocks<00:01:13.460> as

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
there we have our for obsidian blocks as

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.420 
there we have our for obsidian blocks as
a<00:01:13.700> base<00:01:13.970> notice<00:01:14.960> that<00:01:14.990> i<00:01:15.650> had<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:15.920> fifth<00:01:16.250> hole

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
a base notice that i had a fifth hole

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.940 
a base notice that i had a fifth hole
here<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.299> water<00:01:17.600> must<00:01:17.960> be<00:01:18.140> running<00:01:18.560> as<00:01:18.770> you

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
here the water must be running as you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.000 
here the water must be running as you
put<00:01:19.159> on<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.670> lava<00:01:19.850> otherwise<00:01:20.680> for<00:01:21.680> some

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
put on the lava otherwise for some

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.820 
put on the lava otherwise for some
glitchy<00:01:22.490> reason<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.600> will<00:01:23.840> be<00:01:24.020> override<00:01:24.650> it

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
glitchy reason it will be override it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.030 
glitchy reason it will be override it
and<00:01:24.950> not<00:01:25.190> create<00:01:25.580> an<00:01:26.030> obsidian<00:01:26.330> block<00:01:26.979> now<00:01:27.979> the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
and not create an obsidian block now the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.420 
and not create an obsidian block now the
next<00:01:28.460> step<00:01:28.670> is<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.690> create<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.380> new<00:01:30.680> mold<00:01:31.040> for

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
next step is to create a new mold for

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.230 
next step is to create a new mold for
the<00:01:31.580> next<00:01:31.909> blocks<00:01:32.570> jump<00:01:33.530> on<00:01:33.680> here<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.240> I'm

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
the next blocks jump on here and I'm

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.690 
the next blocks jump on here and I'm
using<00:01:35.509> sand<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:37.009> reason<00:01:37.399> will<00:01:37.490> become

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
using sand and the reason will become

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
using sand and the reason will become
apparent<00:01:37.790> once<00:01:38.390> i<00:01:38.690> am<00:01:39.380> done<00:01:39.890> this<00:01:40.720> tutorial

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
apparent once i am done this tutorial

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.650 
apparent once i am done this tutorial
well<00:01:42.080> near<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.500> end<00:01:42.649> not<00:01:42.890> done<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:47.300> then<00:01:47.420> put

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
well near the end not done and then put

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.260 
well near the end not done and then put
the<00:01:47.840> sand<00:01:48.170> in<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:49.130> middle

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.120 

now<00:01:55.869> you<00:01:55.930> place<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.380> water<00:01:56.560> down<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.950> game

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
now you place the water down the game

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.620 
now you place the water down the game
like<00:01:57.399> so<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.969> then<00:01:58.689> add<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.380> lava<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:01.149> do<00:02:01.390> a

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
like so and then add the lava you do a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.200 
like so and then add the lava you do a
game<00:02:01.960> here<00:02:02.969> at<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.149> lava<00:02:04.829> now<00:02:05.829> we<00:02:05.890> again<00:02:06.429> place

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
game here at the lava now we again place

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:40.950 
game here at the lava now we again place
more<00:02:07.570> blocks<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:08.080> increase<00:02:08.649> making<00:02:09.129> the<00:02:09.399> mold

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.070 

it<00:02:41.500> again<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:41.920> place<00:02:42.130> down<00:02:42.370> some<00:02:42.580> water<00:02:43.080> then

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
it again you place down some water then

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:55.260 
it again you place down some water then
lava<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:46.090> water<00:02:47.490> then<00:02:48.490> laughs<00:02:48.730> again

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:10.110 

and<00:02:55.360> we<00:02:56.170> gain<00:02:56.440> make<00:02:56.770> another<00:02:57.190> mold

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:21.370 

place<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.959> water<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.010> lava

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.050 

water<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.480> lava<00:03:23.480> for<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.650> part<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.340> we're

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
water and lava for this part here we're

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:38.760 
water and lava for this part here we're
going<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.330> have<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.600> fill<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:28.360> center

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:47.500 

make<00:03:39.130> them<00:03:39.400> all

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:57.410 

just<00:03:48.080> grabbing<00:03:48.349> some<00:03:48.590> more<00:03:48.739> sound<00:03:49.040> here

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:23.950 

and<00:03:57.650> placing<00:03:58.650> buckets

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:35.450 

and<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.979> place<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.460> final<00:04:26.169> obsidian<00:04:27.169> block

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.510 

now<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.090> base<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.470> portal<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:37.949> complete

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
now the base of the portal is complete

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.840 
now the base of the portal is complete
it<00:04:38.729> has<00:04:39.319> been<00:04:40.319> created<00:04:40.860> now<00:04:40.889> we<00:04:41.160> have<00:04:41.639> to

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
it has been created now we have to

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.550 
it has been created now we have to
remove<00:04:42.289> the<00:04:43.289> mold<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:45.319> henceforth<00:04:46.319> the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
remove the mold and henceforth the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.700 
remove the mold and henceforth the
reason<00:04:46.860> why<00:04:46.979> i<00:04:47.009> create<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.400> sand<00:04:47.729> for<00:04:48.180> easy

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
reason why i create the sand for easy
