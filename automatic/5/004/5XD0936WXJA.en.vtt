00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
harvest ah here we are after a long

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.930 
harvest ah here we are after a long
night<00:00:15.379> actually<00:00:16.379> not<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.590> long<00:00:16.920> yeah<00:00:17.670> for

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
night actually not that long yeah for

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.160 
night actually not that long yeah for
what<00:00:18.119> we've<00:00:18.270> done<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.570> past<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.990> it

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
what we've done in the past this it

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.590 
what we've done in the past this it
actually<00:00:19.410> came<00:00:19.529> together<00:00:19.740> quite<00:00:20.130> quickly<00:00:20.600> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
actually came together quite quickly and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.849 
actually came together quite quickly and
we'll<00:00:21.810> we've<00:00:22.050> done<00:00:23.039> tonight<00:00:24.500> we've<00:00:25.500> taken<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
we'll we've done tonight we've taken the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.540 
we'll we've done tonight we've taken the
Arduino<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.769> hooked<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.220> stepper

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
Arduino and hooked it up to a stepper

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
Arduino and hooked it up to a stepper
motor<00:00:31.279> with<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> nice<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:32.759> flag<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.360> there

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
motor with a nice little flag on there

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.680 
motor with a nice little flag on there
and<00:00:34.430> we<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.579> few<00:00:35.910> more<00:00:36.500> that<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
and we have a few more that are going to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.580 
and we have a few more that are going to
get<00:00:39.690> hooked<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:41.660> gears<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
get hooked up to gears like this and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.510 
get hooked up to gears like this and
then<00:00:44.160> we'll<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.300> able<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.510> control<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.520> dolly

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
then we'll be able to control a dolly

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.819 
then we'll be able to control a dolly
and<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.629> geared<00:00:49.079> head<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> camera<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> it's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and a geared head for a camera so it's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.110 
and a geared head for a camera so it's
pretty<00:00:53.010> standard<00:00:53.309> stuff<00:00:54.230> in<00:00:55.230> terminal<00:00:56.120> so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
pretty standard stuff in terminal so

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
pretty standard stuff in terminal so
basically<00:00:57.510> all<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> do<00:01:01.430> fire<00:01:02.430> up

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
basically all we have to do fire up

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.760 
basically all we have to do fire up
little<00:01:02.940> perl<00:01:03.120> script

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.640 

and<00:01:12.770> while<00:01:13.040> he's<00:01:13.250> getting<00:01:13.520> that<00:01:13.550> ready<00:01:14.650> yeah

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
and while he's getting that ready yeah

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.950 
and while he's getting that ready yeah
what's<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.100> protoboard<00:01:16.670> get<00:01:16.910> over<00:01:17.920> this<00:01:19.960> is

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
what's that protoboard get over this is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.540 
what's that protoboard get over this is
just<00:01:21.230> kind<00:01:21.410> of<00:01:21.500> your<00:01:21.620> standard<00:01:22.010> breadboard

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
just kind of your standard breadboard

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.290 
just kind of your standard breadboard
right<00:01:23.120> here<00:01:23.860> but<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:25.820> a<00:01:25.850> nice<00:01:26.120> little

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
right here but this is a nice little

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.640 
right here but this is a nice little
motor<00:01:26.570> controller<00:01:28.240> from<00:01:29.240> sparkfun<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:30.440> is

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
motor controller from sparkfun this is

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.430 
motor controller from sparkfun this is
the<00:01:31.010> easy<00:01:31.730> driver<00:01:32.470> v4<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:34.510> I<00:01:35.510> can<00:01:35.840> drive<00:01:36.020> up<00:01:36.260> to

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
the easy driver v4 and I can drive up to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.950 
the easy driver v4 and I can drive up to
a<00:01:36.470> 1<00:01:36.770> amp<00:01:36.980> stepper<00:01:37.850> motor<00:01:40.030> I'm<00:01:41.030> sorry<00:01:41.240> point<00:01:41.570> 75

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
a 1 amp stepper motor I'm sorry point 75

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.270 
a 1 amp stepper motor I'm sorry point 75
am<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.530> believe<00:01:43.540> but<00:01:44.650> this<00:01:45.650> guy<00:01:45.830> i<00:01:45.860> think<00:01:46.190> is

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
am I believe but this guy i think is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.770 
am I believe but this guy i think is
only<00:01:46.430> about<00:01:46.580> four<00:01:46.940> hundred<00:01:47.000> fifty<00:01:47.210> mili<00:01:47.570> amp

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
only about four hundred fifty mili amp

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.840 
only about four hundred fifty mili amp
so<00:01:49.300> nowhere<00:01:50.300> near<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:51.619> theoretical<00:01:52.280> max<00:01:52.550> but

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
so nowhere near the theoretical max but

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.790 
so nowhere near the theoretical max but
it<00:01:52.970> does<00:01:53.090> get<00:01:53.210> really<00:01:53.540> hot<00:01:53.930> even<00:01:54.560> when<00:01:54.680> it's

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
it does get really hot even when it's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.280 
it does get really hot even when it's
sitting<00:01:54.950> idle<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.030> i'm<00:01:56.690> not<00:01:56.869> sure<00:01:57.080> if<00:01:57.170> that's

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
sitting idle and i'm not sure if that's

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.080 
sitting idle and i'm not sure if that's
true<00:01:57.619> for<00:01:57.860> all<00:01:57.979> steppers<00:01:58.550> because<00:01:58.880> I've<00:01:59.060> had

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
true for all steppers because I've had

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.120 
true for all steppers because I've had
some<00:02:00.610> zila<00:02:01.610> Tech's<00:02:02.350> 3am<00:02:03.350> steppers<00:02:03.890> that

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
some zila Tech's 3am steppers that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.469 
some zila Tech's 3am steppers that
actually<00:02:04.460> stayed<00:02:04.670> pretty<00:02:04.820> cool<00:02:05.119> but<00:02:05.330> they

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
actually stayed pretty cool but they

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.940 
actually stayed pretty cool but they
also<00:02:05.600> had<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> lot<00:02:06.050> more<00:02:06.290> square<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:09.080> should<00:02:09.860> be

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
also had a lot more square you should be

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.650 
also had a lot more square you should be
giving<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.280> shout<00:02:10.520> out<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.820> open<00:02:10.970> woke<00:02:11.270> up<00:02:11.420> for

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
giving a shout out to open woke up for

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.940 
giving a shout out to open woke up for
making<00:02:12.050> this<00:02:12.110> all<00:02:12.260> possible<00:02:12.290> for<00:02:12.800> yeah

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
making this all possible for yeah

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.440 
making this all possible for yeah
definitely<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.760> software<00:02:14.090> running<00:02:14.269> on

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
definitely so the software running on

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.970 
definitely so the software running on
the<00:02:14.570> Arduino<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:16.090> from<00:02:17.090> open<00:02:17.450> moco<00:02:17.840> org<00:02:18.650> and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
the Arduino is from open moco org and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.860 
the Arduino is from open moco org and
the<00:02:19.670> guys<00:02:19.820> over<00:02:20.000> there<00:02:20.180> put<00:02:20.390> together<00:02:20.510> nice

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
the guys over there put together nice

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.930 
the guys over there put together nice
little<00:02:21.140> sweet<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.519> in<00:02:22.730> pearl<00:02:23.140> which<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.500> not

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
little sweet it's in pearl which is not

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.890 
little sweet it's in pearl which is not
the<00:02:25.940> most<00:02:26.090> angry<00:02:26.660> languages<00:02:27.440> but<00:02:27.800> so

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the most angry languages but so

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.170 
the most angry languages but so
hopefully<00:02:29.900> we'll<00:02:30.050> see<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.489> gy<00:02:31.489> for<00:02:31.850> this<00:02:32.000> at

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
hopefully we'll see you gy for this at

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.870 
hopefully we'll see you gy for this at
some<00:02:32.360> point<00:02:32.390> very<00:02:32.930> soon<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.880> everything's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
some point very soon and everything's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.070 
some point very soon and everything's
going<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.180> live<00:02:35.360> inside<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.750> here<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:38.080> this

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
going to live inside of here so this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.630 
going to live inside of here so this
will<00:02:39.470> hold<00:02:39.739> three<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.580> these<00:02:40.760> nice<00:02:41.720> little

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
will hold three of these nice little

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.640 
will hold three of these nice little
stepper<00:02:43.640> drivers<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.959> Arduino<00:02:45.350> and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.810 

hopefully<00:02:48.650> we'll<00:02:48.830> be<00:02:48.980> able<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.250> create<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.549> nice

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
hopefully we'll be able to create a nice

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.270 
hopefully we'll be able to create a nice
little<00:02:50.090> mobile<00:02:50.420> motion<00:02:51.080> timelapse<00:02:51.260> rig<00:02:51.709> so

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
little mobile motion timelapse rig so

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.830 
little mobile motion timelapse rig so
right<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.209> you<00:02:53.299> got<00:02:53.390> all<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.630> parameters

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
right so you got all the parameters

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.229 
right so you got all the parameters
entered<00:02:54.350> into<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.650> perl<00:02:54.860> script<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:56.060> get

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
entered into the perl script we get

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.699 
entered into the perl script we get
ready<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:57.170> hit<00:02:57.560> start<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.190> old<00:02:58.310> terminal

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
ready to hit start on the old terminal

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.890 
ready to hit start on the old terminal
and<00:03:00.709> as<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.760> can<00:03:01.940> see<00:03:01.970> there<00:03:02.930> she<00:03:03.170> goes<00:03:03.519> and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
and as you can see there she goes and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.130 
and as you can see there she goes and
while<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.049> may<00:03:06.500> not<00:03:06.530> seem<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.070> exciting

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
while this may not seem that exciting

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.440 
while this may not seem that exciting
keep<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.260> mind<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.860> when<00:03:10.790> hooked<00:03:11.060> up<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.390> a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
keep in mind that when hooked up to a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.710 
keep in mind that when hooked up to a
gear<00:03:11.750> head

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
gear head

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.770 
gear head
and<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.960> slider<00:03:13.410> dolly<00:03:14.090> these<00:03:15.090> little<00:03:15.420> turns

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
and a slider dolly these little turns

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.500 
and a slider dolly these little turns
will<00:03:16.680> actually<00:03:17.100> do<00:03:17.790> something<00:03:18.120> pretty<00:03:18.210> cool

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
will actually do something pretty cool

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.900 
will actually do something pretty cool
and<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.650> reason<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:19.980> stops<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.580> between<00:03:20.610> each

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
and the reason it stops in between each

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.490 
and the reason it stops in between each
movement<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.690> because<00:03:22.080> it's<00:03:22.260> actually

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
movement is because it's actually

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.270 
movement is because it's actually
pinging<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.680> optocoupler<00:03:26.550> down<00:03:27.390> here<00:03:28.280> which

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
pinging this optocoupler down here which

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.410 
pinging this optocoupler down here which
is<00:03:29.490> going<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.760> send<00:03:29.970> exposure<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:32.420> focus

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
is going to send exposure and focus

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.720 
is going to send exposure and focus
signals<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.140> camera<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.310> between<00:03:35.460> each

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
signals to the camera so in between each

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.440 
signals to the camera so in between each
step<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:37.440> camera<00:03:37.830> will<00:03:38.070> take<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.850> shot<00:03:39.150> and

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
step the camera will take a shot and

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.960 
step the camera will take a shot and
that<00:03:39.870> way<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.080> don't<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.890> camera<00:03:41.580> taking

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
that way you don't have a camera taking

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.560 
that way you don't have a camera taking
a<00:03:42.060> shot<00:03:42.270> while<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.720> motion<00:03:42.900> okay<00:03:43.710> blurry<00:03:46.220> so

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
a shot while in motion okay blurry so

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.140 
a shot while in motion okay blurry so
that's<00:03:48.570> pretty<00:03:48.810> much<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:48.990> well<00:03:49.970> pretend<00:03:50.970> that

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
that's pretty much it well pretend that

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:03.930 
that's pretty much it well pretend that
we<00:03:51.270> say<00:03:51.590> that's<00:03:52.590> nerd<00:03:52.860> night

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.000
