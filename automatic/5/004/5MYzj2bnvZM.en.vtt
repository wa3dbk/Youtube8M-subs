00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
so the first module that I'd like to

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.589 
so the first module that I'd like to
talk<00:00:10.910> to<00:00:11.059> you<00:00:11.150> about

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
talk to you about

pre<00:00:44.060> has<00:00:44.960> lovely<00:00:45.739> qualities<00:00:46.310> to<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:46.579> in<00:00:46.910> there

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
pre has lovely qualities to it in there

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.010 
pre has lovely qualities to it in there
it's<00:00:48.470> got<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:48.920> really<00:00:49.489> warm<00:00:49.790> sound<00:00:50.540> is<00:00:50.840> still

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
it's got a really warm sound is still

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.049 
it's got a really warm sound is still
quite<00:00:51.230> open<00:00:51.739> but<00:00:52.130> it's<00:00:52.280> got<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.489> lovely<00:00:52.730> warm

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
quite open but it's got a lovely warm

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.330 
quite open but it's got a lovely warm
sound<00:00:53.360> pretty<00:00:53.690> warms<00:00:54.079> up<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:55.010> know<00:00:55.130> your

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
sound pretty warms up you know your

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.460 
sound pretty warms up you know your
digital<00:00:55.760> recordings<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.690> stuff<00:00:57.050> like<00:00:57.230> that

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
digital recordings and stuff like that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.130 
digital recordings and stuff like that
but<00:00:58.370> also<00:00:58.579> it's<00:00:59.300> got<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.540> really<00:00:59.750> good<00:00:59.930> night

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
but also it's got a really good night

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.930 
but also it's got a really good night
pre<00:01:00.469> which<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:00.829> very<00:01:01.040> difficult<00:01:01.219> to<00:01:01.579> overload

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
pre which is very difficult to overload

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.940 
pre which is very difficult to overload
so<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.450> can<00:01:02.570> be<00:01:02.690> driven<00:01:02.870> very<00:01:03.200> hard<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:03.800> can

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
so it can be driven very hard you can

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.870 
so it can be driven very hard you can
still<00:01:04.159> get<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.400> good<00:01:04.670> sound<00:01:05.120> out<00:01:05.420> of<00:01:05.479> this

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.819 

so<00:01:10.880> one<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.210> major<00:01:11.450> major<00:01:12.020> important

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
so one of the major major important

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.050 
so one of the major major important
things<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.509> we<00:01:14.509> had<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.020> deal<00:01:15.229> with<00:01:15.259> with<00:01:15.710> the

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
things that we had to deal with with the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.580 
things that we had to deal with with the
reintroduction<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.329> classic<00:01:18.170> modules

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
reintroduction of the classic modules

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.679 
reintroduction of the classic modules
was<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.009> get<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.310> specifications<00:01:20.149> exactly

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
was to get the specifications exactly

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.910 
was to get the specifications exactly
right<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.310> originals<00:01:23.380> in<00:01:24.380> order<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.770> do

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
right to the originals in order to do

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.359 
right to the originals in order to do
this<00:01:25.100> we<00:01:25.340> had<00:01:25.579> to<00:01:25.750> source<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.110> original

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
this we had to source the original

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.580 
this we had to source the original
manufacturers<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:28.579> components<00:01:29.509> is<00:01:30.229> very

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
manufacturers of components is very

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.429 
manufacturers of components is very
difficult<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:31.310> had<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.509> lot<00:01:32.959> of<00:01:33.049> trouble

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
difficult and we had a lot of trouble

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.520 
difficult and we had a lot of trouble
making<00:01:34.009> sure<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:35.259> they're<00:01:36.259> all<00:01:36.289> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
making sure that they're all the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.609 
making sure that they're all the
components<00:01:37.069> that<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:37.399> had<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:39.020> reduce

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
components that we had to reduce

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.240 
components that we had to reduce
performs<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.610> specification<00:01:41.509> that<00:01:41.739> NIMH<00:01:42.739> had

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
performs the specification that NIMH had

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.639 
performs the specification that NIMH had
laid<00:01:43.489> down<00:01:43.520> at<00:01:44.270> which<00:01:44.450> incidentally<00:01:45.110> only

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
laid down at which incidentally only

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.389 
laid down at which incidentally only
need<00:01:45.860> no<00:01:46.390> nobody<00:01:47.390> else<00:01:47.509> knows<00:01:47.869> this<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.920> this

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
need no nobody else knows this so this

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.370 
need no nobody else knows this so this
was<00:01:49.640> important<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.360> we<00:01:50.479> got<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:50.899> right<00:01:51.140> and

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
was important that we got this right and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.249 
was important that we got this right and
that<00:01:51.829> we<00:01:52.099> made<00:01:52.819> it<00:01:52.970> perform<00:01:53.360> exactly<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.929> same

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
that we made it perform exactly the same

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.279 
that we made it perform exactly the same
because<00:01:54.500> as<00:01:55.069> you<00:01:55.880> know<00:01:56.090> lots<00:01:56.929> and<00:01:57.079> lots<00:01:57.200> of

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
because as you know lots and lots of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.209 
because as you know lots and lots of
people<00:01:57.739> have<00:01:58.780> 1070<00:01:59.780> 3s<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.200> 1080<00:02:00.500> 4s<00:02:00.979> racked

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
people have 1070 3s and 1080 4s racked

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.190 
people have 1070 3s and 1080 4s racked
up<00:02:01.459> which<00:02:01.789> have<00:02:01.969> come<00:02:02.149> out<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.329> old<00:02:02.599> consoles

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
up which have come out of old consoles

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.469 
up which have come out of old consoles
but<00:02:04.039> they<00:02:04.250> would<00:02:04.579> have<00:02:04.670> been<00:02:04.849> when<00:02:05.270> those

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
but they would have been when those

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.240 
but they would have been when those
goals<00:02:05.719> consoles<00:02:06.229> have<00:02:06.379> either<00:02:06.530> produced<00:02:07.009> they

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
goals consoles have either produced they

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.029 
goals consoles have either produced they
would<00:02:07.459> have<00:02:07.549> gone<00:02:07.729> through<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.030> thorough<00:02:09.039> tests

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
would have gone through a thorough tests

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.129 
would have gone through a thorough tests
and<00:02:10.250> rigorous<00:02:10.940> tests<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.540> make<00:02:11.690> sure<00:02:11.900> that

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:12.139 
and rigorous tests and make sure that

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.849 
and rigorous tests and make sure that
they<00:02:12.290> performed<00:02:12.739> exactly<00:02:12.859> for<00:02:13.840> frequency

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
they performed exactly for frequency

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.340 
they performed exactly for frequency
response<00:02:15.859> noise<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:17.000> distortion<00:02:17.329> and<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:18.109> had

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
response noise and distortion and we had

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.050 
response noise and distortion and we had
to<00:02:18.470> make<00:02:18.680> sure<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.280> turn<00:02:19.579> happened

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
to make sure that that turn happened

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.930 
to make sure that that turn happened
again<00:02:20.299> so<00:02:20.959> we<00:02:21.079> have<00:02:21.109> been<00:02:21.530> meticulous<00:02:22.310> about

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
again so we have been meticulous about

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.870

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
exactly what was designed and built in

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.580 
exactly what was designed and built in
