 that people think fuck is playing in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.850
 the fight is not used by many people but I know 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.370
 playing is a very good character I say 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.590
 from here even if it turns out to be a character 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.579

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.159

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.559
 well also that is a character that 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.269
 It's very fashionable now and since it can go 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.940

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.530
