00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.620
 hello friends who are welcome to the 

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:11.780
 chef cook recipe 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.999
 university today we are going to eat a 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.799
 Italian bread and for that we need a 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:20.600
 bread bun of these people from the village 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:23.180
 and two tomatoes 2 mozzarella salt oregano and 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.850
 olive oil 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.530
 the first thing we always do nothing 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.340
 space the table and with a knife 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.860
 saw we are cutting thick slices 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.910
 without arriving as you are seeing at the end 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.510
 of our bread 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.829
 that is a little subject with the base and 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.240
 the same thing that we have done 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.440
 along 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.519
 the same process without carrying 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.469
 to cut the base like this with all the bun 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.739
 once the bank is cut it is not 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.739
 boiling 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.900
 we take and we reserve it we take the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900
 tomato 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.660
 we take off the asses and we do it 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.330
 slices on this occasion we will use 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.100
 nothing more than a tomato and with the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.650
 mozzarella we do the same we're going 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.210
 cutting slices of mozzarella well 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.229
 we are going to put the two already having 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.930
 all cut we take our chicken and 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.729
 let's preheat the oven to 180 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.340
 degrees and what we are going to do for 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.790
 every hole and we open it and you 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.790
 let's put the tomato and the mozzarella 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.060
 the tomato is volunteered and we go 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.159
 well and so we do with all the bun and 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.810
 that's how the other Italian bread looks 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.210
 Now what we are going to do we have the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.170
 180 degree preheated oven 180 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.170
 degrees about 100 minutes 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 already gone out of the oven have passed the 10 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.409
 minutes and this is the look of our 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.430
 Italian bread now the only thing that we 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.950
 It is a little bit of olive oil 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.080
 or a little salt and a little bit of 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.480
 oregano good friends tell you this is 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.890
 a very cheap centerpiece for some 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.140
 family reunions when you have 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.550

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.110
