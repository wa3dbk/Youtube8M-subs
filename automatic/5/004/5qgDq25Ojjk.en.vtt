00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.260 
your host John Michael Booth and today
we're<00:00:18.890> talking<00:00:19.100> about<00:00:19.310> focal<00:00:19.850> length<00:00:20.030> and

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
we're talking about focal length and

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.060 
we're talking about focal length and
that<00:00:20.420> means<00:00:20.630> talking<00:00:20.960> about<00:00:21.170> lenses<00:00:21.440> and<00:00:21.860> what

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
that means talking about lenses and what

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.700 
that means talking about lenses and what
happens<00:00:22.490> when<00:00:22.790> you<00:00:22.940> zoom<00:00:23.350> focal<00:00:24.350> length<00:00:24.560> is

millimeter<00:01:21.799> lens<00:01:21.860> is<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.549> closest<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.270> what

the human eye can perceive and for this

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.310 
the human eye can perceive and for this
reason<00:01:25.790> it's<00:01:26.000> called<00:01:26.299> a<00:01:26.510> normal<00:01:26.930> lens

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320
