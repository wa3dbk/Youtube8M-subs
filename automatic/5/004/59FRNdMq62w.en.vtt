to break this and go home it's not going
to<00:03:53.049> do<00:03:53.349> much<00:03:53.530> damage<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:54.009> him<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.729> know

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
to do much damage to him you know

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.219

another<00:03:55.030> thing<00:03:55.150> not<00:03:55.389> to<00:03:55.419> forget<00:03:55.780> about<00:03:55.900> just

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
another thing not to forget about just

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.869 
another thing not to forget about just
using<00:03:56.379> a<00:03:56.560> good<00:03:56.709> piece<00:03:56.889> of<00:03:57.099> string<00:03:57.340> as<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.549> snare

using a good piece of string as a snare

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.879 
using a good piece of string as a snare
these<00:03:58.060> work<00:03:58.209> great<00:03:58.479> for<00:03:58.540> for<00:03:59.379> rabbits<00:03:59.769> and

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
these work great for for rabbits and

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.550 
these work great for for rabbits and
squirrels<00:04:00.219> just<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.090> nice<00:04:01.269> good<00:04:01.689> strong<00:04:02.079> string

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
squirrels just a nice good strong string

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.259 
squirrels just a nice good strong string
now<00:04:03.159> obviously<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.579> know<00:04:03.759> he<00:04:03.909> might<00:04:04.060> figure

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
now obviously you know he might figure

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.729 
now obviously you know he might figure
it<00:04:04.479> out<00:04:04.599> and<00:04:04.750> shoot<00:04:04.959> through<00:04:05.199> it<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:05.469> if<00:04:05.590> you're

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
it out and shoot through it so if you're

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.780 
it out and shoot through it so if you're
doing<00:04:05.919> it<00:04:06.009> this<00:04:06.129> way<00:04:06.189> you<00:04:06.370> probably<00:04:06.609> want<00:04:06.759> to

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
doing it this way you probably want to

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.369 
doing it this way you probably want to
put<00:04:06.969> out<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.090> lot<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.389> them<00:04:07.599> because<00:04:08.169> they<00:04:08.259> might

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
put out a lot of them because they might

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.499 
put out a lot of them because they might
get<00:04:08.620> out<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.919> it<00:04:09.039> but<00:04:09.219> I<00:04:09.609> use<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.030> nice<00:04:10.239> bright

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
get out of it but I use a nice bright

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.849 
get out of it but I use a nice bright
color<00:04:10.539> so<00:04:10.989> I<00:04:11.019> can<00:04:11.229> find<00:04:11.469> them<00:04:11.590> because<00:04:11.680> you're

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
color so I can find them because you're

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.309 
color so I can find them because you're
putting<00:04:11.949> so<00:04:12.219> many<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.489> these<00:04:12.609> out<00:04:13.319> sometimes

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
putting so many of these out sometimes

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.089 
putting so many of these out sometimes
it's<00:04:14.500> easy<00:04:14.889> to<00:04:15.069> forget<00:04:15.159> where<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.609> put<00:04:15.789> them

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
it's easy to forget where you put them

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.439 
it's easy to forget where you put them
you<00:04:18.099> know<00:04:18.219> the<00:04:18.280> same<00:04:18.519> thing<00:04:18.729> I<00:04:18.820> put<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.120> on<00:04:19.209> some

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
you know the same thing I put it on some

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.580 
you know the same thing I put it on some
kind<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.659> device<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:20.079> this<00:04:20.229> so<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.409> can<00:04:20.440> just

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
kind of device like this so I can just

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.170
