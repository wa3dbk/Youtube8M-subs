we<00:00:34.239> can<00:00:34.480> see<00:00:34.780> here<00:00:35.079> is<00:00:35.350> that<00:00:35.530> I've<00:00:35.649> already

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
we can see here is that I've already

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.360 
we can see here is that I've already
prepared<00:00:36.399> my<00:00:36.700> USB<00:00:37.090> stick<00:00:37.590> using<00:00:38.590> unetbootin

I've downloaded the 64-bit ISO for the

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.740 
I've downloaded the 64-bit ISO for the
Linux<00:00:43.450> image<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:44.280> put<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.430> onto<00:00:45.579> a<00:00:46.149> suitable

USB<00:00:47.170> stick<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:47.739> this<00:00:48.579> is<00:00:48.820> all<00:00:49.120> ready<00:00:49.329> and

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
USB stick and this is all ready and

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.190 
USB stick and this is all ready and
prepared<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.320> boot<00:00:50.590> up<00:00:50.800> in<00:00:51.100> UEFI<00:00:51.879> mode<00:00:52.239> so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
prepared to boot up in UEFI mode so

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.049 
prepared to boot up in UEFI mode so
rather<00:00:53.649> than<00:00:53.829> using<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.219> legacy<00:00:54.399> boot<00:00:54.760> we're

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
rather than using the legacy boot we're

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.680 
rather than using the legacy boot we're
using<00:00:55.210> UEFI<00:00:55.870> mode<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:56.500> installing<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:57.399> a<00:00:57.699> m2

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
so a PCIe m2 SSD not a traditional

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.929 
so a PCIe m2 SSD not a traditional
Sattar<00:01:03.789> SSD<00:01:04.420> as<00:01:04.660> you<00:01:04.930> might<00:01:05.140> use<00:01:05.520> so<00:01:06.520> now<00:01:06.549> what

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
Sattar SSD as you might use so now what

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.550 
Sattar SSD as you might use so now what
we<00:01:07.030> want<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.270> do<00:01:07.390> is<00:01:07.540> just<00:01:07.780> select<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:08.229> bootable

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
we want to do is just select a bootable

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.920 
we want to do is just select a bootable
device<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:09.220> we<00:01:09.340> hit<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.610> f10<00:01:10.000> key<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.510> go<00:01:10.659> into

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
device so we hit the f10 key to go into

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.760 
device so we hit the f10 key to go into
the<00:01:11.020> boot<00:01:11.170> menu<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:14.200> here<00:01:14.409> we're<00:01:14.619> going

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
the boot menu and from here we're going

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.120 
the boot menu and from here we're going
to<00:01:15.070> select<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:16.240> USB<00:01:16.990> stick<00:01:17.350> which<00:01:17.650> will<00:01:18.009> be

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
to select the USB stick which will be

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to select the USB stick which will be
listed<00:01:18.549> as<00:01:18.790> UEFI<00:01:19.659> mode<00:01:20.020> just<00:01:21.009> there<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.490> by

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
listed as UEFI mode just there and by

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.910 
listed as UEFI mode just there and by
running<00:01:22.330> that<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:22.869> selecting<00:01:23.560> install

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
running that and selecting install

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.820 
running that and selecting install
Ubuntu<00:01:24.750> now<00:01:25.750> this<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.320> going<00:01:26.439> to<00:01:26.500> be<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.590> very

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
Ubuntu now this is going to be a very

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.390 
Ubuntu now this is going to be a very
easy<00:01:26.920> install<00:01:27.580> process<00:01:28.259> we've<00:01:29.259> got<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.740> clean

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
easy install process we've got a clean

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.469 
easy install process we've got a clean
unused<00:01:31.119> SSD<00:01:31.750> so<00:01:32.710> it's<00:01:33.189> a<00:01:33.490> simple<00:01:33.909> install

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
unused SSD so it's a simple install

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.240 
unused SSD so it's a simple install
process<00:01:34.750> as<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.229> can<00:01:35.380> get<00:01:35.590> we<00:01:35.829> don't<00:01:36.009> have<00:01:36.159> to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
process as you can get we don't have to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.010 
process as you can get we don't have to
worry<00:01:36.430> about<00:01:36.490> any<00:01:36.820> partitioning<00:01:37.509> we<00:01:37.689> can<00:01:37.840> just

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
worry about any partitioning we can just

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.899 
worry about any partitioning we can just
allow<00:01:38.259> Ubuntu<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.130> set<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.490> up<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.790> the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
allow Ubuntu to set that up on the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.050 
allow Ubuntu to set that up on the
defaults<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.799> this<00:01:41.950> will<00:01:42.159> boot<00:01:42.520> us<00:01:42.670> into<00:01:42.970> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
defaults so this will boot us into the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.880 
defaults so this will boot us into the
graphical<00:01:43.479> installer<00:01:46.380> from<00:01:47.380> here<00:01:47.619> we<00:01:47.710> just

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
graphical installer from here we just

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.469 
graphical installer from here we just
select<00:01:48.159> language<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.970> want<00:01:52.180> it<00:01:52.329> to

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
select language and I want it to

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.300 
select language and I want it to
download<00:01:53.020> updates<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.680> install<00:01:53.979> some<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.250> the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
download updates and install some of the
