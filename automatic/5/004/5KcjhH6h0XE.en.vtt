00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.800
 Hello everyone for today's recipe I have 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.020
 thought a super sweet tooth that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 will certainly like both the great ones 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.370
 children 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.309
 it is very soft patties to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.059
 coke and you know for sure that the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.650
 coca cola and beloved by all this 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.660
 it could also be a great idea 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.239
 very pretty for the Epiphany party 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.790
 but still very suitable for the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.400
 daily breakfast for 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:58.710
 make them to give them back then 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:03.090
 patties c need 60 g of butter 120 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.080
 g of brown sugar 60 g of yogurt 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:12.420
 white I use this cereal to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:18.570
 natural a pinch of baking soda a 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.430
 egg 200 g of flour 00 10 grams of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:27.090
 powdered cocoa powder 90 grams of coca 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.190
 cola which is equivalent to about a glass 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.479
 poor I use this 0 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.690
 but you can use it 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:41.610
 quietly also the normal one e 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.470
 then a sachet of vanillin and sugar 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.649
 icing just enough for decoration 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.190
 of the surface while as tools 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.869
 we use a wooden message one 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.530
 whisk a ladle we needed 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.319
 to take the dough and pour it into the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.860
 there is stencils correlating the stencils from 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:09.630
 two bowls muffin is a pan 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.530
 non-stick to melt the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.530
 butter with others 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:21.150
 now let's get them ready first 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.150
 what are we going to pour into a saucepan 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.710
 in the non-stick pan the butter la 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.960
 coca cola bitter cocoa powder e 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.960
 we're going to heat it all up 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:58.510
 I always recommend a low flame 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.960
 once the butter has melted 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.070
 all 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.890
 we turn off the flame and put it on 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.810
 part we let it cool because 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.390
 however the compound will not have to 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:22.170
 reach boiling in a bowl 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:26.010
 we're going to pour the new yogurt 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.010
 we mix everything well 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:50.050
 now in the other bowl we will go to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:52.410
 pour all the flour the 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.410
 bicarbonate 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.880
 and sugar 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.470
 we mix well 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.800
 we also add the sachet of 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.800
 vanillin 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.050
 combine with this flour mixture 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.750
 bicarbonate and vanillin we add 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.750
 also place and yogurt 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.830
 we begin to amalgamate the low speed 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.020
 we also add coca cola cocoa 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:42.810
 bitter powder butter money 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:51.900
 previously and continue to da 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:54.350
 send once amalgamated well 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.350
 the whole 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:02.330
 we transfer the compound inside 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.330
 of the molds 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.009
 I recommend always remember not to 

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:15.709
 make them too full otherwise then 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.919
 during the leavening they will come out 

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:21.379
 the mixture will come out in the meantime 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.539
 that we do this operation we would have 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:27.129
 already lit in the oven and we do it for 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.129
 heat to 180 degrees 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.379
 and here is our pan ready for 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:50.680
 be informed 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:54.490
 we will inform the patties at 180 degrees for 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.500
 about 25 30 minutes anyway you 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.990
 always check by doing the test 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.379
 toothpick because as you know not all 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.009
 ovens are the same and then over completed 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:06.039

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:10.990
 I will tell you as for cooked as 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:13.479
 they baked with the oven and here is i 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:18.550
 our coca tarts are very soft 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:21.969
 ready cola once baked I have them 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.830
 let cool on a wire rack 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:25.659
 and then place them on the plate e 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.020
 sprinkle with a little sugar a 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:29.110
 veil 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.400
 in my oven they cooked in 25 minutes 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:35.289
