combination of flavors in here have been

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.040 
combination of flavors in here have been
proven<00:04:03.550> we've<00:04:03.730> tested<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.450> tested<00:04:04.600> have

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
proven we've tested and tested have

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.100

really<00:04:05.440> good<00:04:05.590> catch<00:04:05.830> results<00:04:06.790> in<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.450> UK<00:04:07.840> but

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
really good catch results in the UK but

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.170 
really good catch results in the UK but
also<00:04:08.170> in<00:04:08.650> France<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.459> fishing<00:04:09.760> all<00:04:09.910> over
