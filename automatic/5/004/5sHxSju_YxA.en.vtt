00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello here for our second video 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:10.769
 so three weeks ago we have 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.790
 sowed areas we sowed 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.160
 seeds park there are none that have 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.189
 pushed the binder note both on the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:27.689
 two there is one on the 2 g fit ssii 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.510
 month now you see on the pulls 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.770
 I do not have if you see very well there is 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.820
 small hairs on the stem they 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.710
 will give piquette roots 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.750
 now we are going to move to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.309
 potting 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.010
 so let's take a point that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.170
 can bigger for the progression of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.510
 our tomatoes 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:01.500
 now we are going to take some 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.559
 loam for m there for now we 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.970
 let's put potting soil in the bottom of 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.420
 poor here we are potting at 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:18.960
 account of the August pole to his good 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:25.460
 so now we will remove the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.460
 roots of tomatoes like this 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.390
 so we go but our tomatoes at 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.950
 bottom of the court 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.200
 we put the soil over it 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.680
 not to put a lot you tamp 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.960
 well around the stem I do not be 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:59.869
 To hide it too much for the abuse but sorry 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:04.039
 here we go well do not hesitate to 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:11.510
 bang on the potting soil and is a little bit 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:14.660
 wet then more than it is wet 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:20.769
 we do not need beasts of 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.769
 the water here is over 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.790
 like this so now this is the 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:30.090
 wife of another episode then we 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.400
 let's do a third video 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.650
 they will see us improving our 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.989
 tomatoes and we creeping plants 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.989
