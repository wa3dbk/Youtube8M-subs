00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.709
 for 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.489
 the 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.229
 for me 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.229
 again a child will have more 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 as for the roma 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.100
 in a video broadcast at the grand corporate meeting 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.550
 nightmare boss alain bouchard was clear the presence of 16 4 lead 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.869
 to financial problems 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.920
 and the closing of a convenience store is not excluded 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.690
 recently decided to close a convenience store that was in the process of 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.320
 unionization claiming it was not profitable the csn filed a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.450
 complaint to the Labor Relations Board accusing him of 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.410
 to try to influence them exercise this right of association of employees does that 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.220
 late night p anti union neutrality panel varied professor of relations 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.050
 at laval university in quebec common sense 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.100
 bar 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 my form I can say in your opinion what is late-night and escalated 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.800
 bouchard go too far 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.580
 marc darmon this context that we must understand that all the words of 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.850
 the employer% the first must comment on the relevance of a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.150
 international trade union presence taken by his employer enjoyed the freedom 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.420
 expression 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.009
 it's a country war advanced by the Canadian Bill of Rights and 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.810
 freedoms 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.680
 the fundamental question is is laurent sir bouchard 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.850
 raphael exercising what could be described as normal of his freedom 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.560
 of expression or did he go one step further and he poured into bullying 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.490
 and what he exerted 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.130
 on workers in order to get them to refrain from coming 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.960
 Kiss me his clothes from above 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.310
 and not your opinion past the protesters to give up going there and 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060
 I think there will be some discrimination that should be done to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.540
 the inside of prisoner remarks by Mr. Bouchard 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.710
 so she when sir bouchard said no troubleshooter who 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.329
 needed an example I think the Greeks get married decision makers 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.490
 when he says that unions are absolutely not necessary at home 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.470
 beaten from a point of view since 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.429
 and poetically normal in an employer over time 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.319
 the institute has been one of the many advantages to working here in a 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.239
 convenience store late-night beating that's part I think of the normal meteorite 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.179
 in the field of labor relations 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.959
 on the other hand where the situation could be a little more the nail 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.909
 problematic it's when the employer to do it to make 1 5 euro does that 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.640
 all Caennais in the same scenario so far be considered 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.630
 which clearly suggests that the closure scenario could 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.559
 may also be considered by the employer 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.429
 and all the more useful 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.709
 she is referring 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.189
 for that the reality in which some networks of 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.829
 retailers in quebec for everyone realized he was doing 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.850
 reference to mcdonald's restaurant 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.069
 and the situation of wal-mart 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.929
 - the employers for you closed corporate debt and national it 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:58.869
 must add the fact that some stars have just closed at the convenience store 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.770
 they are made must take into account that decision 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.330
 the csn it's this opposition to these stops because the convenience stores was 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.540
 by way of unionization costa had for its part not well% and that makes 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.140
 part of the deal has today announced 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.859
 this closing of the good 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.829
 well I think of things to consider there first peace that has 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.659
 been filed in relation to that intimidation of the intra have connected 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.829
 to the video question did the successful poya hinder or intimidate the 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:27.639
 workers 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.679
 and after sopot suppose a second question because I could not have 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.559
 a second complaint must be filed with the Relations Commission 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:34.350
 work 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.019
 a sentence that must be tackled on Tuesday 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.590
 so here does not consider the important judgment of the Supreme Court 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.770
 delivered in December 2009 in the second lesson map fleet 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.459
 you do not want to be caught anymore 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.829
 it's a number of rules 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.019
 and to be very clear in clarifying the question of 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.529
 can we be interested in the subjective motivation of the interior 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:57.630
 when he owns to close his business 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.330
 before he had maybe some speech that would let I lead 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.230
 this final hand 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.360
 threatened to close this esthete and 15 and 7 assists and intimidation 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.069
 closing a business is the exercise of rights he exercises his right to 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.729
 property now all this is no longer entirely true one can 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.519
 to take an interest in motivation under the influence of anger and to the extent 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.620
 where you were we able to demonstrate 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.879
 the employer 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.159
 was motivated by antisemitic considerations hold when he closes 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.449
 his business but this closing their hen made up of the intra ok he's 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.269
 with the association my name is mourning an interview that had perished with the 

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:36.509
 dad is going to have to stop him just a few years derby 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.889
 % he had said it was not a business model to have pain to have 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.229
 do that 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.229
 does that contradict the 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.860
 alfaro right to be able to challenge the power to unite that to say that the cska 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.990
 can not part of the business model of the company 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.130
 good these are very good questions asked at the center console this country 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.449
 Kosovo sooner or later 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.460
 duty to spread 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.910
 the probable unless in such a case it could be considered that 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.169
 employee motivation to ctv legend considerations of nature 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.820
 anti-Semite 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.360
 because he has to turn so design my physics not count that 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.060
 it was the sector that had to bear the burden of demonstrating this 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.210
 subjective motivation of the employer the first to close his business his 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.480
 establishment on the basis of considerations 35 discs ages 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.580
 think the race is also admitted that this font as a burden of 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.210
 proof for the tpf easy to assume 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.029
 in case of big blow realized 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.719
 me when we see business people that 5% of the voices that here sir 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.059
 bouchard at sunset 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:43.889
 for that it must be understood that the economic reasons valid is 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.189
 no the question of this no evidence corones dark affair 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.309
 the first is not the employer that europe has demonstrated before the 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.580
 Labor Relations Board 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.960
 they had motives of the economic reasons for the good reasons of the 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.520
 balaam economic reasons to close his business 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.840
 it's safe advice 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.660
 to hatch out of polio's state of mind at the right time there I choose 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.990
 to do that yesterday was 35 years old should you go to the 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.389
 late-night reputation 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.980
 out of steel for once it works it was going to bring to athens 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.059
 somewhat the reputation of 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:17.539
 of late-night so we could perhaps wonder about the 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.529
 strategy used by late-night when it's the hand ball of 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.840
 master thérèse and as soon as we find in this kind of trade 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.729
 and we remember the podium 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.389
 the genevois marc 5 6 to 5 and see you for you without a mandate from the office to 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.040
 the rear 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.560
 mac donald's restaurant school will once again have employers experienced 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.560
 with collective agreements but at the end of a first agreement 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.699
 collective concerned employers have more easily obtain 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.990
 the revocation of the certificate for loss of majority character very 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.030
 well done, thank you very much for these fun explanations 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.169
 it is imperative to see 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:51.870
 no
