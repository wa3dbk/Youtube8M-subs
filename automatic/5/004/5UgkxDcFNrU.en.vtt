00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.740
 hi this is baby secret and heading 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.930
 why exactly this me today 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.230
 interested in the opinion of moms but this 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.680
 beauties namely a stokke stroller 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.680
 xplory 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.480
 honestly surprised me drains 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.550
 Norwegians have managed to show the world not 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.610
 only unique design but also huge 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
 the number of advantages of the stroller 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 not at all a fan of the modern 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 design in strollers but drains me 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 conquered really impressive with her 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.010
 good height adjustment and she has 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.199
 the ease and maneuverability of the rack is very 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.119
 narrow to the same highway only 57 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.879
 centimeters which means she enters 

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:54.059
 in absolutely any elevator but at the same time 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.070
 it weighs only 10 kilograms of seat for me 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.949
 liked it easy perry stops 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.229
 the footrest is removed with one hand very 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.860
 soft back anatomic sitting 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.260
 comfortable slope waterproof material i 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.010
 wanted her on a very problematic road but u 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 it did not cause me any difficulties 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 unequivocally endorsing the choice despite 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.250
 quite high cost she's really 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:25.310
 worth it let's ask moms 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.310
 what they think and why exactly drains 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.119
 how do you think she is pretty yes 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.270
 satisfied 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.219
 in spite of the fact that everybody makes it explicit 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.649
 the disadvantage of small wheels and 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.679
 worried about the fact that she may not 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.890
 go through the snow that's over the snow she 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.409
 the stroller goes very well she is very light 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.670
 weighs only 10 kilos she has 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.009
 wonderful function on stepping on 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.020
 ladders or please tell me here 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.819
 as for transporting strollers you 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.659
 went somewhere to travel with her 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:05.869
 took her by ourselves we went by train a day 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.489
 along with this stroller and and unique 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.160
 design with this here is one stick 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.519
 allowed us to put the highway between two 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.010
 seat in the train and put the baby 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.930
 quietly at the table and also was very 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.720
 comfortable at night I did not have to sleep with her 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.989
 on one shelf because we put 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.660
 on the highway cradle my exact dream estesno 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.030
 winter overalls just plain and 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.849
 pajamas slept in comfort could 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.480
 roll over from side to side and very 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.920
 I liked it because the post shook a little 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.510
 this stroller is generally very good 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.030
 cradles like that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.489
 shake the handle and at night in the train she 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.170
 I did not even wake up, I think that this 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.079
 the stroller is very comfortable anatomical 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.450
 the shape of the seat itself is usually the seat 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.519
 all here at an angle of 90 degrees 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.970
 built on either deflected back 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:00.260
 back and sitting by this stroller 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.970
 she as made by such a bucket and by 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.669
 this anatomically shaped baby 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.269
 feeling very comfortable she can 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:10.400
 do not sit long enough and sleep too 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.870
 very convenient when knight opportunity 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.599
 sell a pram if you don't like it and 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.780
 buy some other new year we go 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.239
 on it and now we are going to acquire 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.549
 The new chassis which is now released 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.549
 company drains and i think that we will 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.549
 use her to three years at least 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.450
 here is in 3 words let's say why 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.520
 it drains it is due to the design 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.180
 there is she especially that is, it can be seen for 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.770
 kilometer 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.350
 that is, they are all the rest 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.660
 more or less since there is something similar 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.380
 a huge number of accessories shorter 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.500
 how expensive 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.800
 expensive car that can be there 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.700
 still 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.220
 tuning make accordingly we and the shadows 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.680
 then we tune the winter set here we are 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.570
 have not yet changed his leg with fur 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.670
 this white is so white beautiful 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.120
 respectively a little later when there is a sled 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.710
 for example grow up and there will be more 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.090
 we will buy one child accordingly 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.140
 this stand to baby 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.220
 rode here and plus but height naturally 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.500
 unpleasant because i'm not leaning 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.950
 I can feed the child to talk with him 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.400
 so in general, the child is fine 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.530
 visible all let's say all the vibration goes to 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.310
 direction of the legs due to the fact that 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.530
 there is a mount here but this one 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.900
 cradles yes there where the head she just 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.640
 swinging freely and there in principle 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.440
 Here is this small vibration on which 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.550
 minor roughness on the way I'm 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.919
 principle is not felt that is, it 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.690
 depreciates due to the plastic itself 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.820
 I was all very well fit here 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.110
 that is never seized any 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.419
 mechanisms that is how many we 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.070
 exploit has never been that somewhere 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.870
 something stuck or something broke and 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.310
 something cracked there that is very 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.340
 good plastic very good metals 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.310
 Fit all very buy
