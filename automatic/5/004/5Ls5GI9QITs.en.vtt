you or the 0.5 0 to 60 those numbers

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.280 
you or the 0.5 0 to 60 those numbers
aren't<00:02:01.890> exact<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:03.090> all<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.479> cars<00:02:03.719> but

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
aren't exact for all the cars but

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.540 
aren't exact for all the cars but
they're<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.189> general<00:02:05.670> area<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
they're just in that general area and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.729 
they're just in that general area and
you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.849> also<00:02:09.690> click<00:02:10.410> this

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
you can also click this

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.699 
you can also click this
and<00:02:12.010> you'll<00:02:12.459> car<00:02:12.939> your<00:02:13.420> car<00:02:13.629> will<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:14.019> eight

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
and you'll car your car will have eight

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.530 
and you'll car your car will have eight
gears<00:02:15.099> on<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.519> or<00:02:17.219> it's<00:02:18.219> basically<00:02:18.579> like<00:02:19.060> super

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
gears on it or it's basically like super

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.009 
gears on it or it's basically like super
traction<00:02:20.079> control<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:21.359> your<00:02:22.359> tires<00:02:22.629> won't

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
traction control but your tires won't

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.429 
traction control but your tires won't
spin<00:02:23.439> at<00:02:23.560> all<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.750> gives<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.170> faster

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
spin at all so it gives you a faster

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.179 
spin at all so it gives you a faster
zero-to-sixty<00:02:28.349> but<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.500> can't<00:02:29.709> really<00:02:29.920> do

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
zero-to-sixty but you can't really do

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.199 
zero-to-sixty but you can't really do
burnouts<00:02:30.760> or<00:02:31.090> anything<00:02:31.299> like<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:33.370> just

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
burnouts or anything like that so just

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.979 
burnouts or anything like that so just
