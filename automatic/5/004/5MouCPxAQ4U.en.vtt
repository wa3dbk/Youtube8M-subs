00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 quinio is so today I'm going to you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.449
 show how to fix problems 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.939
 relative to 25 pp so we go all the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.640
 see together now the first 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.920
 problem relating to 25 pc you open a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.170
 downloaded application with and it's going 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.609
 plant just so see it 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.410
 the application is often not the same 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.200
 for a possible not answer ben skull 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 all games downloaded with 25 bp do not 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.300
 do not suffer so that's the first 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.579
 problem i'm going to show you how 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.469
 correct that first problem all 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.809
 simply it's the easiest to 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.649
 correct you're going to open 25 was the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.160
 latest version so the most recent 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.230
 we wait for it to open once opened 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.610
 we find ourselves on this home screen 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.090
 who are asking us to connect a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.879
 apparatus 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.680
 so we'll do it hook up your 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.789
 device to your computer once 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.379
 it's done you enter your code 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.090
 of home screen because otherwise you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.500
 go can not access the whole 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.450
 your device there have been a lot of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.770
 problems just because of that so you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.530
 unlock let you on like 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 it's unlocked so once is that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.750
 it is done you will be able to 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.180
 render on the software like your 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.280
 device and is connected it is detected 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.140
 imperatively by software you click 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.479
 just on the lightning you press 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.250
 exactly on this button and you 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:33.000
 wait so we'll wait it's 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.570
 pretty fast normally now he 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.570
 there is 10% 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.360
 40 she's fixing everything up 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.800
 opening problems only one will see 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.380
 that there is 2 third case that of 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:54.430
 the opening is waiting for it to happen 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.330
 excuse me I'm shaking a little the camera 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.220
 is not very stable 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.840
 so here is once everything is in 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.810
 glass is it's ok you can 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.260
 close this little window could 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.940
 close 25 pp we do not care 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.680
 disconnected your your device 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.640
 it's true that it worked very well 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.080
 will check if it's ok so everything 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.150
 simply we will be on the page of 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.600
 the application that was that was not opening 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.250
 no and that's it works nickel all 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.830
 the apps have been repaired thanks to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.240
 the lightning is called like that and we 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.590
 So that's it for the first 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.330
 problem it's for applications that 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.420
 to be done in one go now we're going 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.740
 see a second problem the second 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.680
 problem I could not you 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.040
 to show because we have to repair 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.910
 can no longer catch them we're going to say 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.070
 second problem is this camp 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.350
 is when you open an application it 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.000
 asks you for an apple id and a 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.950
 password so I think that's 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.050
 happened to a lot of you and that 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.060
 many of you are still 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.190
 not out of this problem it's a 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.600
 pretty annoying problem because we have 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.680
 beautiful installed apps dab offered 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.050
 the lightning as we did earlier 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.550
 they ask us for an apple ID 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.500
 so we'll see how to fix this 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.019
 problem to remove the demand for 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.150
 identify it from the apple id for 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.220
 fix this problem you're going to have to 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.019
 download genome software in 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.519
 Ball in Lyon I pass it is pronounced 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.160
 like that is a second software 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.070
 Chinese that will allow you to get up 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.390
 the apple identification restriction 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.519
 asked at each opening 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.769
 of cracked applications how 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.000
 download this violin software i you 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.880
 would put a binder in the execution of the 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.570
 video that gives you the software so 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.709
 directly directly installed we will 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.269
 to say I do not know if we can say that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.950
 like that because I need you 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.380
 explains that the link of this software has 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.010
 been removed so wise and apple 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.540
 so 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.879
 more download this software it is very 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.079
 hard to find so I'm going 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.510
 give you a personalized link even 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:56.140
 that the link will be in the description of 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.060
 the video and so that will make you 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.430
 download a folder that will be called 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.420
 you will have to decompress it and 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.340
 you will have directly 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.750
 this in the folder you will not have 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.120
 the icon is with you will have this in the 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.280
 folder is simply you're going 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.150
 just open the app here with the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.169
 weird numbers so you'll rent that 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.699
 so the times you will end up 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.120
 on this home screen and you go 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:25.419
 so be able to connect your iphone to 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.039
 your computer you plug it in you 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.840
 wait for it to be recognized by 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.860
 the computer for now it's not 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.240
 the case that's it is it is recognized 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.960
 you unlock like just now 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.949
 that it is the total axis to your device 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.229
 even if white or code but that's the 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.990
 software should recognize him who 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.360
 should appear here ipad no why 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.910
 they see my ipod it's weird I 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.479
 think he did not totally understand 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.430
 but it's not big deal 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.169
 in any case what matters is that we 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.090
 saw olc iphone here it's the same 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.340
 case that 25 sores you forget so 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.300
 then here on this little logo of 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.620
 settings and you're going to press here 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.270
 until everything is good so I 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.370
 not going to do them otherwise it's okay 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.270
 apply the patch twice but it 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.810
 must it be finished you can 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:19.449
 close the software that jae-yong is at 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.680
 say this software allows you all a 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.289
 once it's closed you would reopen 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.370
 25bb I do not know if you follow me if 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.300
 you have difficulties do not hesitate 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.639
 to ask your questions in the 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.289
 comments 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.840
 once you have reopened 25bp you 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.159
 go ahead and press lightning so like 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.680
 just now except there instead 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.940
 to press here nickname then you go on 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.300
 wii so what are you going to install 25 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.909
 pp with do not worry it takes 25 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.039
 tp will be installed could then the 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:48.270
 delete I do not know why it works 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:52.060
 when we install 25bp and not before so 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.500
 here you press you will support here and 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.900
 you will let download any software 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.550
 you are in that everything is towards here 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.340
 so there has to be some 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.350
 the validation logo goes until 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.580
 that everything is good and so once everything 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.350
 is good you can open your 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.510
 applications and you will not have the 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.130
 request the apple id if ever 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.260
 the demand for apple electrification 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.130
 appears I advise you to delete 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.680
 your applications that you had 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.690
 download and read reinstall with 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.950
 25 points and in my turn is 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.360
 sanctioned there should not be any 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.980
 worry so that's all for this 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.310
 for this video I quoted both 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.420
 big problems relating to 25 pp so 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.920
 ie the automatic closure 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.080
 applications and the demand for 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.690
 apple identification after all that 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.930
 you should be able to open normally 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.160
 your application without problem 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.450
 so I want to note that all these 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.610
 techniques are to be redone 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.960
 from the moment you re 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.670
 download an app from the app 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.020
 store is to say that the cij establish it 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.240
 that I'm downloading an app to 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.910
 from the app store and well all 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.730
 applications cracked we get stuck 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.020
 you will not be able to open them anymore 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.540
 should avoid updating by here have 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.260
 updated apps that have been 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.660
 really paid well it's crashing 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.250
 the cracks and so that's the end of 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.020
 this video do not hesitate to ask your 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.880
 questions in the comments if you 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.830
 I will answer it as soon as possible 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.270
 possible and so here we are 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.830
 for future videos and the next 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.830
