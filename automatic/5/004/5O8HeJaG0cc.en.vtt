00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
have anything yet it's just a matter of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.940

what we're actually gonna get and it's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.910 
what we're actually gonna get and it's
looking<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.520> either<00:00:35.880> gold<00:00:36.450> come<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.500> gold

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
looking like either gold come on gold

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.940 
looking like either gold come on gold
maybe<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.870> does<00:00:40.079> look<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.620> actually

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
maybe and it does look like we actually

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.540 
maybe and it does look like we actually
get<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> gold<00:00:41.640> mutant<00:00:43.160> which<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.250> guess<00:00:44.399> is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
get the gold mutant which I guess is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.100 
get the gold mutant which I guess is
okay<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.000> wish<00:00:45.180> i<00:00:45.270> had<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.600> spins<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
okay I really wish i had more spins to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.100 
okay I really wish i had more spins to
this<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:47.239> it's<00:00:48.239> better<00:00:48.450> than<00:00:48.539> nothing<00:00:49.079> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
this but it's better than nothing so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.910 
this but it's better than nothing so
there's<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.190> four<00:00:51.149> more<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.860> do

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
there's one down four more to go if I do

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.380 
there's one down four more to go if I do
have<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> use<00:00:53.309> some<00:00:53.460> gold<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.820> my<00:00:53.940> end<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.210> using

it<00:00:54.690> next<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:57.710> we<00:00:58.710> ready<00:00:58.859> off<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it next one up and we ready off to a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.799 
it next one up and we ready off to a
good<00:00:59.340> start<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.850> we're<00:01:00.270> gonna<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.570> another

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
good start so we're gonna get another

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.139 
good start so we're gonna get another
mutant<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.350> actually<00:01:01.710> need<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.879> wish<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
mutant we actually need I really wish I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.719 
mutant we actually need I really wish I
had<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.359> two<00:01:03.570> more<00:01:03.750> spins<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.640> maybe<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
had like two more spins and maybe I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.920 
had like two more spins and maybe I
would<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:05.939> gotten<00:01:06.150> another<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
would have gotten another one and then I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.240 
would have gotten another one and then I
were<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> seize<00:01:07.290> gold<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> last<00:01:07.950> day<00:01:08.130> or

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
were to seize gold on the last day or

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.590 
were to seize gold on the last day or
something<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.580> go<00:01:11.610> two

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
something like that but there you go two

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
something like that but there you go two
out<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.140> five<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.860> two<00:01:14.520> gold<00:01:14.670> ones<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
out of the five we get two gold ones of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.510 
out of the five we get two gold ones of
course<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:16.439> still<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:17.009> gold<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
course and we still have one gold a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
course and we still have one gold a
silver<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.420> bronze<00:01:18.450> left<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:20.930> use<00:01:21.930> gold

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
silver and a bronze left I will use gold

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.570 
silver and a bronze left I will use gold
most<00:01:22.470> likely<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> last<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.369> cuz<00:01:23.520> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
most likely for the last one cuz I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.830 
most likely for the last one cuz I
usually<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:23.909> stuck<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.720> time

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
usually get stuck on that all the time

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.050 
usually get stuck on that all the time
unless<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.380> actually<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:25.740> five<00:01:25.950> four<00:01:26.100> five<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
unless I actually go five four five that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.490 
unless I actually go five four five that
would<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.240> amazing<00:01:27.479> some<00:01:27.900> people<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.200> did<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
would be amazing some people have did it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
would be amazing some people have did it
already<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.509> use<00:01:30.630> some

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
already but if I do have to use some

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.740 
already but if I do have to use some
gold<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> end<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.710> will<00:01:32.360> hopefully<00:01:33.360> this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
gold in the end I will hopefully this

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.999 
gold in the end I will hopefully this
one<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.079> stays<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> little

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
one actually stays in here for a little

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
one actually stays in here for a little
bit<00:01:35.130> longer<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
bit longer because we do need up for the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.260 
bit longer because we do need up for the
bingo<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:38.250> don't<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.579> any<00:01:38.729> tokens<00:01:39.090> saved

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
bingo and I don't have any tokens saved
