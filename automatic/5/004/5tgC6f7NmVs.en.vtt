about<00:02:44.220> video<00:02:44.520> games<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:44.850> who<00:02:44.940> doesn't<00:02:45.360> think

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
about video games like who doesn't think

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.960 
about video games like who doesn't think

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
they're art and they never will it's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.700 
they're art and they never will it's
very<00:02:48.180> interesting<00:02:48.480> concept<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.440> an<00:02:49.590> ongoing

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
very interesting concept it's an ongoing

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.220 
very interesting concept it's an ongoing
debate<00:02:50.040> almost<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.910> older<00:02:51.750> generation<00:02:52.140> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
debate almost like older generation and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.110 
debate almost like older generation and
younger<00:02:52.290> generation<00:02:52.950> well<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.460> would<00:02:53.850> say<00:02:54.000> this

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
younger generation well I would say this

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000 
younger generation well I would say this
to<00:02:54.180> Roger<00:02:54.620> Roger<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:55.800> you're<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:55.980> know

watches in 150 years ago
it's<00:03:02.880> longer<00:03:03.180> than<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.569> man<00:03:03.780> when<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
it's longer than that man when the

it's longer than that man when the
camera<00:03:04.380> was<00:03:04.470> invented<00:03:04.680> people<00:03:05.430> said<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.940> same

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
camera was invented people said the same

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.620 
camera was invented people said the same
thing<00:03:06.360> about<00:03:06.540> photography<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.300> not<00:03:09.480> an

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
thing about photography this is not an

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.350 
thing about photography this is not an
art<00:03:09.780> form<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.890> just<00:03:11.130> merely<00:03:11.459> taking<00:03:12.239> an

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
art form this is just merely taking an

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.510 
art form this is just merely taking an
image<00:03:12.599> of<00:03:12.750> something<00:03:13.080> already<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.560> now<00:03:14.099> we

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
image of something already there now we

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.600 
image of something already there now we
all<00:03:14.640> know<00:03:14.880> today<00:03:15.560> artists<00:03:16.560> gravitated<00:03:17.340> toward

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
all know today artists gravitated toward

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.479 
all know today artists gravitated toward
photography<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.510> tools<00:03:18.810> got<00:03:19.140> better<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.800> no

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
photography the tools got better and no

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.449 
photography the tools got better and no
one<00:03:20.790> would<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.569> say<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.319> an<00:03:23.130> incredible

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
one would not say that an incredible

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.180 
one would not say that an incredible
photographer<00:03:23.849> is<00:03:24.420> not<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.599> fine<00:03:24.810> artist<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.560> we

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
photographer is not a fine artist and we

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.490 
photographer is not a fine artist and we
I<00:03:26.640> think<00:03:26.760> went<00:03:27.300> through<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> same<00:03:27.900> thing<00:03:28.230> here

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
I think went through the same thing here

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.460 
I think went through the same thing here
it's<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.040> computer<00:03:29.550> it's<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.940> digital<00:03:30.420> tool<00:03:30.690> then

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
it's a computer it's a digital tool then

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.710 
it's a computer it's a digital tool then
it<00:03:31.769> can't<00:03:32.010> be<00:03:32.190> art<00:03:32.370> it's<00:03:32.670> not<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.970> case<00:03:33.150> these

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
it can't be art it's not the case these

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.479 
it can't be art it's not the case these
are<00:03:33.780> fine<00:03:34.319> artists<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:34.950> we're<00:03:35.190> trying<00:03:35.430> to
