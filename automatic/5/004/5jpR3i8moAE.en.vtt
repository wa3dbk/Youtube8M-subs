sections<00:00:29.599> what<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> blade<00:00:30.929> does<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:31.800> your

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
sections what you blade does what your

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.740 
sections what you blade does what your
body<00:00:32.099> does<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.000> focus

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.930 

what's<00:00:38.380> this<00:00:38.530> next<00:00:38.860> short<00:00:38.980> video<00:00:39.160> clip<00:00:39.550> look

what's this next short video clip look

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.580 
what's this next short video clip look
closely<00:00:40.180> at<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.480> blade<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:40.870> think<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.380> some

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
closely at the blade and think of some

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:56.250 
closely at the blade and think of some
key<00:00:41.770> features<00:00:42.190> which<00:00:42.370> you<00:00:42.550> can<00:00:42.700> see

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.869 

but<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:57.350> should<00:00:57.379> have<00:00:57.530> noticed<00:00:57.980> just<00:00:58.309> then<00:00:58.460> is

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
but you should have noticed just then is

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.549 
but you should have noticed just then is
that<00:00:59.059> my<00:00:59.180> hands<00:00:59.540> are<00:00:59.629> an<00:00:59.750> equal<00:00:59.960> distance<00:01:00.320> from

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
that my hands are an equal distance from

that my hands are an equal distance from
each<00:01:00.890> blade<00:01:01.190> blade<00:01:02.059> was<00:01:02.300> then<00:01:02.420> entered<00:01:02.870> in

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
each blade blade was then entered in

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.509 
each blade blade was then entered in
line<00:01:03.410> with<00:01:03.649> my<00:01:03.800> toes<00:01:03.920> into<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.369> water

it's<00:02:00.320> sure<00:02:00.530> better<00:02:00.770> picture<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.160> what<00:02:01.370> goes<00:02:01.520> on

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
it's sure better picture of what goes on

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.390 
it's sure better picture of what goes on
with<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:01.940> body<00:02:02.090> while<00:02:02.300> paddling<00:02:02.540> for<00:02:02.900> words

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
with the body while paddling for words

firstly<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:04.460> can<00:02:04.490> see<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.850> Jack's<00:02:05.030> head<00:02:05.240> is

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
firstly you can see that Jack's head is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.359 
firstly you can see that Jack's head is
always<00:02:05.690> facing<00:02:05.840> forwards<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.890> stops<00:02:07.160> any

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
always facing forwards it stops any

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.130 
always facing forwards it stops any
unwanted<00:02:07.640> edging<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.390> boat<00:02:08.570> and<00:02:08.750> puts<00:02:08.990> his

secondly<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.320> see<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.590> rim<00:02:12.770> rotation

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
secondly you can see that rim rotation

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.160 
secondly you can see that rim rotation
is<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.490> key<00:02:13.730> movement<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.870> held<00:02:15.050> by

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
is a key movement this is held by

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.170 
is a key movement this is held by
contracted<00:02:15.650> abdominal<00:02:16.160> muscles<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.850> increase

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
contracted abdominal muscles to increase

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.460 
contracted abdominal muscles to increase
the<00:02:17.300> force<00:02:17.480> throughout<00:02:17.720> each<00:02:17.990> stroke<00:02:18.230> and

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
the force throughout each stroke and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
closely at the boat the think of some

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:39.319 
closely at the boat the think of some
key<00:02:28.349> features<00:02:28.560> which<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.069> can<00:02:29.250> see<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:39.090> you've

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
key features which you can see as you've

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.449 
key features which you can see as you've
just<00:02:39.360> seen<00:02:39.680> with<00:02:40.680> regards<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.280> belt

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
just seen with regards to the belt

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.830 
just seen with regards to the belt
there's<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.909> really<00:02:42.060> much<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.329> look<00:02:42.569> at<00:02:42.690> with

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
there's not really much to look at with

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.800 
there's not really much to look at with
