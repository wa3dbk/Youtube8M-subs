00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
fine you signed in um but what I found
is<00:03:01.520> when<00:03:01.850> I<00:03:01.880> did<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:03.080> was

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
is when I did this is that it was

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.449 
is when I did this is that it was
lagging<00:03:03.700> quite<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> bit<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:06.350> really<00:03:07.310> was

lagging quite a bit and I really was
tempting<00:03:07.910> whether<00:03:08.180> or<00:03:08.330> not<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.750> should<00:03:09.080> move

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
tempting whether or not I should move

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.970 
tempting whether or not I should move
