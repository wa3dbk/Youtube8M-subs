had alpha doesn't contain parts of our

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.740 
had alpha doesn't contain parts of our
normal<00:03:06.410> hot<00:03:06.910> Casey<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:10.030> therefore<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.209> texts

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
normal hot Casey and therefore the texts

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.460 
normal hot Casey and therefore the texts
are<00:03:11.900> shown<00:03:12.230> normal<00:03:12.830> in<00:03:13.010> our<00:03:14.140> qualified<00:03:15.140> but

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
are shown normal in our qualified but

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.710 
are shown normal in our qualified but
the<00:03:15.739> Hutt's<00:03:15.920> are<00:03:16.190> overlaid<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.060> therefore<00:03:17.510> we

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
the Hutt's are overlaid so therefore we

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.890 
the Hutt's are overlaid so therefore we
have<00:03:17.930> firstly<00:03:19.000> change<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.150> compositing<00:03:20.870> mode

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
have firstly change the compositing mode

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.520 
have firstly change the compositing mode
compose<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:22.010> three<00:03:22.220> notes<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:24.160> editors<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.870> so

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
compose the three notes to editors so so

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.250 
compose the three notes to editors so so
that's<00:03:27.800> how<00:03:28.100> our<00:03:28.400> Radha<00:03:28.760> ng<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.450> can't<00:03:29.810> normally

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
that's how our Radha ng I can't normally

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.340 
that's how our Radha ng I can't normally
look<00:03:30.470> in<00:03:30.739> counter-strike<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.989> next<00:03:32.989> step<00:03:33.140> is

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
look in counter-strike and next step is

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.060 
look in counter-strike and next step is
to<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:34.760> use<00:03:34.940> our<00:03:35.270> hat<00:03:35.720> as<00:03:36.470> our<00:03:36.880> show<00:03:37.880> also<00:03:38.600> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
to to use our hat as our show also the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.560 
to to use our hat as our show also the
texts<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.630> counter-strike<00:03:42.850> correctly<00:03:43.850> so

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
texts of counter-strike correctly so

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.479 
texts of counter-strike correctly so
therefore<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:46.030> change<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.120> little<00:03:47.239> bit<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.600> scale

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
therefore I change a little bit of scale

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.530 
therefore I change a little bit of scale
we<00:03:49.489> have<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.910> create<00:03:50.209> an<00:03:50.360> alpha<00:03:51.080> mass<00:03:51.350> from<00:03:52.250> our

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
we have to create an alpha mass from our

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.990 
we have to create an alpha mass from our
good<00:03:53.540> alpha<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:55.090> for<00:03:56.090> example

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.650 

maybe<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.300> picture<00:04:02.860> show<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.880> unmute

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
maybe that picture show you so unmute

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.280 
maybe that picture show you so unmute
the<00:04:06.080> alpha<00:04:06.380> channel<00:04:06.880> click<00:04:07.880> on<00:04:08.060> video<00:04:08.690> fix<00:04:09.020> and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
the alpha channel click on video fix and

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.910 
the alpha channel click on video fix and
we<00:04:09.319> use<00:04:10.010> math<00:04:10.580> generator<00:04:11.150> plymouth<00:04:11.810> mass<00:04:12.140> and

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
we use math generator plymouth mass and

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.650 
we use math generator plymouth mass and
that<00:04:13.340> create<00:04:13.730> us<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.330> mess<00:04:14.569> and<00:04:15.459> now<00:04:16.459> cut<00:04:16.820> or<00:04:17.090> to

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
that create us a mess and now cut or to

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.590 
that create us a mess and now cut or to
the<00:04:17.870> black<00:04:18.380> parts<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:19.040> only<00:04:19.549> show<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:20.060> why

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
the black parts and only show you why

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.460 
the black parts and only show you why
you<00:04:21.230> can<00:04:21.470> also<00:04:21.650> invert<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:23.050> we<00:04:24.050> don't<00:04:24.230> need

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
you can also invert that we don't need

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.320 
you can also invert that we don't need
to<00:04:24.680> in<00:04:25.070> our<00:04:26.030> case<00:04:26.680> so<00:04:27.680> close<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.930> now<00:04:29.930> we<00:04:29.960> can

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
to in our case so close and now we can

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.900 
to in our case so close and now we can
bring<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.630> second<00:04:33.320> time<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.220> hot<00:04:34.370> color<00:04:34.640> in

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
bring a second time is the hot color in

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.840 
bring a second time is the hot color in
our<00:04:35.150> progress<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:37.190> we<00:04:37.580> scale<00:04:38.290> rescale<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.860> we

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
our progress so we scale rescale and we

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.450 
our progress so we scale rescale and we
have<00:04:40.970> sauce<00:04:41.240> alpha<00:04:41.750> so<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.470> means<00:04:42.740> this

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
have sauce alpha so that means this

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.610 
have sauce alpha so that means this
timeline<00:04:44.030> uses<00:04:44.630> thought<00:04:44.840> either<00:04:45.110> from<00:04:45.470> our

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
timeline uses thought either from our

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.150 
timeline uses thought either from our
math<00:04:46.180> generator<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.620> make<00:04:48.620> now<00:04:48.860> a

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
math generator and make now a

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.990 
math generator and make now a
compositing<00:04:50.090> child<00:04:50.390> from<00:04:51.050> our<00:04:51.260> hot<00:04:51.560> color<00:04:52.000> so

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
compositing child from our hot color so

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.100 
compositing child from our hot color so
now<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:53.840> use<00:04:54.400> multiple<00:04:55.400> mask<00:04:55.640> so<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.060> use<00:04:56.750> our

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
now we use multiple mask so that use our

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.580 
now we use multiple mask so that use our
masks<00:04:57.530> from<00:04:58.300> transparent<00:04:59.300> mask<00:04:59.570> from<00:04:59.930> our

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
masks from transparent mask from our

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.430 
masks from transparent mask from our
hood<00:05:00.919> alpha<00:05:01.340> timeline<00:05:02.090> in<00:05:02.630> this<00:05:02.840> case<00:05:03.110> number

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
hood alpha timeline in this case number

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.850 
hood alpha timeline in this case number
two<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:04.510> that's<00:05:05.510> all<00:05:05.750> we<00:05:05.900> have<00:05:06.050> true<00:05:06.260> we<00:05:06.680> have

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
two and that's all we have true we have

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.880 
two and that's all we have true we have
our<00:05:07.130> taxes<00:05:07.729> in<00:05:07.880> normal<00:05:08.270> view<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:08.630> we<00:05:09.380> have<00:05:09.590> all

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
our taxes in normal view and we have all

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.740 
our taxes in normal view and we have all
to<00:05:10.220> our<00:05:11.620> yeah<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:12.800> can<00:05:13.160> our<00:05:13.550> weather<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.360> so<00:05:14.510> on

we can also turn that off so i hope you

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.030 
we can also turn that off so i hope you
liked<00:05:22.730> my<00:05:22.760> tutorial<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.720> give<00:05:24.710> me<00:05:24.860> some
