with this we've been toying around with

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
with this we've been toying around with

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the script for a while it's just that we

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.810 
the script for a while it's just that we
wanted<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.409> sure<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.549> made<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
wanted to make sure that we made it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.179 
wanted to make sure that we made it
right<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.920> work<00:01:11.070> on

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
right so first of all we have to work on

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.460 
right so first of all we have to work on
the<00:01:11.280> technology<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.049> hard<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the technology and it's really hard to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.130 
the technology and it's really hard to
add<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> multiplayer<00:01:14.580> mode<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> sandbox<00:01:15.780> game

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
add a multiplayer mode to a sandbox game

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.580 
add a multiplayer mode to a sandbox game
because<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> systems<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
because of all the systems and it's a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.679 
because of all the systems and it's a
complex<00:01:19.590> games<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:20.970> also<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
complex games and then we also have to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
complex games and then we also have to
make<00:01:21.930> sure<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.439> had<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> narrative

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
make sure that we had the narrative

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
lick you know adding to the concept of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780 
lick you know adding to the concept of
reliving<00:01:34.009> someone's<00:01:35.009> memory<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> machine

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
reliving someone's memory to a machine

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.200 
reliving someone's memory to a machine
had<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.049> expanded<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> having<00:01:38.759> multiple

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
had to be expanded to having multiple

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.240 
had to be expanded to having multiple
subjects<00:01:39.689> playing<00:01:40.530> together<00:01:40.829> train<00:01:41.490> together

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
subjects playing together train together

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.940 
subjects playing together train together
that's<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.480> was<00:01:43.630> our<00:01:43.780> initial<00:01:43.990> idea<00:01:44.500> for<00:01:44.860> the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
that's that was our initial idea for the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.400 
that's that was our initial idea for the
for<00:01:45.160> this<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.850> we've<00:01:46.000> decided<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.720> put<00:01:47.230> it<00:01:47.320> on

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
for this so we've decided to put it on

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.200 
for this so we've decided to put it on
the<00:01:47.500> side<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.400> Templars<00:01:48.820> designer

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.170 
the side of the the Templars designer
just<00:01:49.930> because<00:01:50.260> we<00:01:51.250> could<00:01:51.430> we<00:01:51.850> could<00:01:51.970> easily

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
just because we could we could easily

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.320 
just because we could we could easily
justify<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:52.960> true<00:01:53.430> true<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.970> idea<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.240> a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
justify it true true the idea of a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.930 
justify it true true the idea of a
training<00:01:55.630> program<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.380> Abstergo<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.580> taking

so far I believe we've seen a cast of

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.420 
so far I believe we've seen a cast of
characters<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.020> are<00:02:14.170> fighting<00:02:14.380> with<00:02:15.190> ezio

infielders<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:44.050> whole<00:02:44.230> idea<00:02:44.590> was<00:02:44.770> basically

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
infielders the whole idea was basically

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.820 
infielders the whole idea was basically
to<00:02:45.520> translate<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.090> core<00:02:46.480> gameplay<00:02:46.830> mechanics

of the single-player interview to play
environments<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:52.000> was<00:02:52.209> kind<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.480> a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
environments and that was kind of a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.190 
environments and that was kind of a
challenge<00:02:53.410> because<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:54.310> high<00:02:55.299> expectation<00:02:56.049> for

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
challenge because a high expectation for

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.229 
challenge because a high expectation for
that<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:56.920> had<00:02:57.370> come<00:02:57.610> up<00:02:57.760> with<00:02:57.880> something

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
that and we had come up with something

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.440 
that and we had come up with something
quite<00:02:58.480> innovative

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
quite innovative

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.250 
quite innovative
the<00:03:00.110> whole<00:03:00.290> idea<00:03:00.440> was<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:02.330> sort<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.930> you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
the whole idea was to sort of it you

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.680 
the whole idea was to sort of it you
know<00:03:03.290> kiddo<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:04.190> every<00:03:04.760> player<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.180> stinky

around so you will find the same

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.140 
around so you will find the same
mechanics<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:22.099> trying<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.760> approach<00:03:23.030> the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
mechanics like trying to approach the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.720 
mechanics like trying to approach the
target<00:03:23.390> silently<00:03:24.110> but<00:03:24.950> at<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.130> same<00:03:25.340> time<00:03:25.549> you

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
target silently but at the same time you

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.160 
target silently but at the same time you
have<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.000> watch<00:03:26.420> your<00:03:26.450> back<00:03:26.630> because<00:03:27.080> you

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
have to watch your back because you

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.740 
have to watch your back because you
might<00:03:27.349> have<00:03:27.530> one<00:03:27.890> or<00:03:27.920> multiple<00:03:28.519> axes<00:03:29.239> right

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
might have one or multiple axes right

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.050 
might have one or multiple axes right
