00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
comfortable what I use is sitting us

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
comfortable what I use is sitting us
first<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> pre<00:00:26.580> block<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.210> dental

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570

first as a pre block into the dental
mucosal<00:00:28.410> mucosa<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> reason<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
mucosal mucosa and the reason for that

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.849 
mucosal mucosa and the reason for that
is<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:30.900> doesn't<00:00:31.019> burn<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.619> doesn't

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
is that it just doesn't burn it doesn't

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.950 
is that it just doesn't burn it doesn't
really<00:00:31.980> create<00:00:32.130> much<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.910> an<00:00:33.270> anesthetic<00:00:33.719> load

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
really create much of an anesthetic load

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.049 
really create much of an anesthetic load
in<00:00:34.200> terms<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.559> benefits<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.219> reinforced

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
in terms of benefits so I reinforced

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.119 
in terms of benefits so I reinforced

that with plain car became I find that

using a 4% septa cane for two reasons
one<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.350> gives<00:00:46.500> me<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.829> 30<00:00:47.070> minute<00:00:47.309> time<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
one it gives me that 30 minute time to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
one it gives me that 30 minute time to
do<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> reduction<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.629> also<00:00:48.960> rides<00:00:49.350> them

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
do the reduction it also rides them

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.779 
do the reduction it also rides them
through<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> next<00:00:50.250> few<00:00:50.430> hours

through the next few hours

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
through the next few hours
so<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.570> don't<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.530> discomfort

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
so that they don't have the discomfort

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
so that they don't have the discomfort
level<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.399> first<00:00:53.610> first<00:00:54.239> few<00:00:54.480> hours<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
level in the first first few hours and I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
level in the first first few hours and I
then<00:00:55.890> add<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> 1%<00:00:56.879> lidocaine<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.510> before

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
then add a 1% lidocaine with that before

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
then add a 1% lidocaine with that before
hemostasis<00:00:58.590> into<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> actual<00:00:59.219> direct

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

hemostasis into the actual direct
infiltration<00:01:00.300> into<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> lip<00:01:01.469> obviously

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
infiltration into the lip obviously

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
infiltration into the lip obviously
after<00:01:02.190> I've<00:01:02.399> already<00:01:02.460> marked<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.120> so

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
after I've already marked them out so

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.509 
after I've already marked them out so
what<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> advantage<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.920> silicone<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
what are the advantage of silicone I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.859 
what are the advantage of silicone I
think<00:01:05.760> part<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> thing<00:01:06.360> there's<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.600> lot<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
unless you're pushing it I'm going to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870

lips<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.210> can't<00:01:42.390> even<00:01:42.570> feel<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
lips you can't even feel it and and the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.350 
lips you can't even feel it and and the
only<00:01:44.280> thing<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> want<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.850> careful<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
only thing you want to be careful is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.539 
only thing you want to be careful is
that<00:01:45.390> lips<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.049> change<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.740> age<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.189> lips<00:01:47.369> do

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that lips do change with age and lips do

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.950 
that lips do change with age and lips do
change<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.030> style<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.420> aesthetic<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.899> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
change with style and aesthetic so you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480 
change with style and aesthetic so you
want<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.380> conservative<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.220> you

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
want to be more conservative and you

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.950 
want to be more conservative and you
certainly<00:01:50.790> want<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.060> avoid<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.540> bad

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
certainly want to avoid back bad

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.170 
certainly want to avoid back bad
technique<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> strategies

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
technique so what are the strategies

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.179 
technique so what are the strategies
here<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.350> silicone<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.040> my

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
here I really use silicone as my

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.100 
here I really use silicone as my
baseline<00:01:56.640> work<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.149> get<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> patient<00:01:57.840> looking

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
baseline work to get a patient looking

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
baseline work to get a patient looking
great<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> come<00:01:59.460> back<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.909> there's

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
great and then I come back if there's

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
great and then I come back if there's
you<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.719> really<00:02:01.170> want<00:02:01.350> aggressive<00:02:01.770> lips

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
you know I really want aggressive lips

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
you know I really want aggressive lips
well<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.340> when<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> start<00:02:02.969> looking<00:02:03.030> at

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
well then that's when I start looking at

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.719 
well then that's when I start looking at
why<00:02:03.899> don't<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> few<00:02:04.619> months<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> years<00:02:05.640> of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
why don't we do a few months to years of

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.390 
why don't we do a few months to years of
Juvederm<00:02:06.180> Restylane<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.930> top

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
Juvederm Restylane on top

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.249 
Juvederm Restylane on top
the<00:02:07.460> silicon<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.509> make<00:02:08.690> sure<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.020> really

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
the silicon just to make sure you really

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.930 
the silicon just to make sure you really
want<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.619> big<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:10.369> hard<00:02:10.580> for<00:02:10.729> me<00:02:10.820> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
want it that big is it's hard for me to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.530 
want it that big is it's hard for me to
reverse<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:12.700> avoiding<00:02:13.700> complications<00:02:14.390> I

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
reverse it avoiding complications I

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.570 
reverse it avoiding complications I
really<00:02:14.810> don't<00:02:14.990> use<00:02:15.110> more<00:02:15.350> than<00:02:15.530> 0.4<00:02:16.010> cc<00:02:16.340> what

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
really don't use more than 0.4 cc what

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.790 
really don't use more than 0.4 cc what
is<00:02:16.670> your<00:02:16.850> load<00:02:17.180> top<00:02:17.600> what<00:02:18.500> do<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.620> how<00:02:18.710> much

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
is your load top what do you how much

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.350 
is your load top what do you how much
how<00:02:19.100> much<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.370> put<00:02:19.520> per<00:02:19.700> live<00:02:22.090> point<00:02:23.090> seven

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
how much do you put per live point seven

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.830 
how much do you put per live point seven
total<00:02:23.480> or<00:02:24.110> seven<00:02:24.770> seven<00:02:25.450> okay<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.510> it's<00:02:26.720> pretty

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
total or seven seven okay so it's pretty

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.120 
total or seven seven okay so it's pretty
similar<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> mine<00:02:27.350> because<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.620> do<00:02:27.680> three<00:02:28.040> and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
similar to mine because I do three and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.400 
similar to mine because I do three and
four<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.610> I've<00:02:29.240> heard<00:02:29.450> anything<00:02:29.990> for<00:02:30.200> point

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
four so I've heard anything for point

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.660 
four so I've heard anything for point
two<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.950> 0.5

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
two to 0.5

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.910 
two to 0.5
I<00:02:31.700> find<00:02:32.240> point<00:02:32.510> four<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.870> very<00:02:33.080> safe<00:02:33.350> amount<00:02:33.680> in

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
I find point four be very safe amount in

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.500 
I find point four be very safe amount in
point<00:02:34.160> three<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.550> slightly<00:02:34.760> smaller<00:02:35.090> level

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
point three and a slightly smaller level

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.810 
point three and a slightly smaller level
and<00:02:35.660> I'm<00:02:36.320> only<00:02:36.560> putting<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.980> hundredth<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.520> CC

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
and I'm only putting a hundredth of a CC

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.910 
and I'm only putting a hundredth of a CC
per<00:02:37.970> pass<00:02:38.240> my<00:02:38.570> nurse<00:02:39.080> Diane<00:02:39.440> who's<00:02:39.590> very<00:02:39.709> OCD

per pass my nurse Diane who's very OCD

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.410 
per pass my nurse Diane who's very OCD
actually<00:02:40.580> counted<00:02:40.970> how<00:02:41.060> many<00:02:41.120> injections

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
actually counted how many injections

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.350 
actually counted how many injections
like<00:02:41.840> 75<00:02:42.380> passes<00:02:42.950> for<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:43.610> thirty<00:02:43.910> simper

lip and the key with this is you're
going<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.760> don't<00:02:46.850> know<00:02:46.970> really<00:02:47.120> what<00:02:47.420> plane

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
going you don't know really what plane

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.030 
going you don't know really what plane
everyone<00:02:47.990> asked<00:02:48.140> me<00:02:48.260> what<00:02:48.440> plane<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> ten

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
everyone asked me what plane is a ten

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.070 
everyone asked me what plane is a ten
well<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.340> sort<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.610> deep<00:02:50.240> to<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.450> mucosa<00:02:50.780> but

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
well it's sort of deep to the mucosa but

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.449 
well it's sort of deep to the mucosa but
I<00:02:51.170> don't<00:02:51.350> know<00:02:51.440> what<00:02:51.590> plane<00:02:51.740> I'm<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.130> just

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
I don't know what plane I'm in I just

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.490 
I don't know what plane I'm in I just
sort<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.820> go<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.120> there<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.720> only<00:02:53.750> caveat<00:02:54.200> is

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
sort of go in there the only caveat is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.199 
sort of go in there the only caveat is
you<00:02:54.680> don't<00:02:54.920> want<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.130> pass<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.370> pass<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
you don't want to pass it pass to the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.960 
you don't want to pass it pass to the
other<00:02:56.330> side<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.990> back<00:02:57.260> mucosa<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.040> always

of my results here usual average is

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.600 
of my results here usual average is
about<00:03:14.870> two<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.230> three<00:03:15.260> treatments<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.130> this

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
about two to three treatments and this

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.540 
about two to three treatments and this
is<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.790> five<00:03:17.120> treatment<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.750> result<00:03:18.650> her<00:03:19.010> lip<00:03:19.250> lip

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
is a five treatment a result her lip lip

is a five treatment a result her lip lip
is<00:03:19.730> slightly<00:03:20.000> firm<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:21.140> actually

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
is slightly firm and I actually

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.960 
is slightly firm and I actually
encourage<00:03:21.709> her<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.010> stop<00:03:22.280> she<00:03:22.519> wanted<00:03:22.760> more

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
really don't see that problem and the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.500 
really don't see that problem and the
experienced<00:04:04.160> colleagues<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:05.180> are<00:04:05.209> friends

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
experienced colleagues that are friends

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.699 
experienced colleagues that are friends
of<00:04:05.600> mine<00:04:05.720> really<00:04:05.900> don't<00:04:06.110> see<00:04:06.230> those<00:04:06.320> problems

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
of mine really don't see those problems

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.380 
of mine really don't see those problems
because<00:04:07.070> they<00:04:07.370> really<00:04:07.790> take<00:04:07.970> care<00:04:08.150> not<00:04:08.330> to

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
because they really take care not to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.300 
because they really take care not to
create<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:08.959> kind<00:04:09.110> of<00:04:09.230> travesty<00:04:09.860> so<00:04:10.280> I

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
create this kind of travesty so I

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.070 
create this kind of travesty so I
actually<00:04:10.760> this<00:04:10.880> is<00:04:11.060> two<00:04:11.269> lip<00:04:11.450> reductions<00:04:11.959> on

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
actually this is two lip reductions on

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.920 
actually this is two lip reductions on
the<00:04:12.170> upper<00:04:12.470> lip<00:04:12.799> taking<00:04:13.580> both<00:04:13.850> wet<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:14.299> dry<00:04:14.570> me

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
the upper lip taking both wet and dry me

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.840 
the upper lip taking both wet and dry me
cosa<00:04:15.170> down<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.739> then<00:04:16.160> going<00:04:16.430> back<00:04:16.489> and

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
cosa down and then going back and

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.640 
cosa down and then going back and
building<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.570> bottom<00:04:17.900> lip<00:04:18.079> over<00:04:18.410> three

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
building the bottom lip over three

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.479 
building the bottom lip over three
sessions<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:19.639> that<00:04:19.670> I<00:04:19.820> can<00:04:20.060> create

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
sessions so that I can create

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.249 
sessions so that I can create
paradis<00:04:20.970> member<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.389> lower<00:04:21.630> lip<00:04:21.870> must<00:04:22.139> be

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
paradis member the lower lip must be

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:23.930 
paradis member the lower lip must be
larger<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.009> number<00:04:23.039> one<00:04:23.550> thing<00:04:23.789> when

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
larger the number one thing when

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.430 
larger the number one thing when
patients<00:04:24.330> come<00:04:24.479> in<00:04:24.630> they<00:04:24.660> want<00:04:24.990> their<00:04:25.139> upper

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
patients come in they want their upper

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.200 
patients come in they want their upper
lip<00:04:25.590> done<00:04:25.830> but<00:04:26.370> always<00:04:26.699> make<00:04:26.880> sure<00:04:26.910> you

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
lip done but always make sure you

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.999 
lip done but always make sure you
balance<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:27.630> with<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.810> bottom<00:04:28.169> lip<00:04:28.410> another

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
balance it with a bottom lip another

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.650 
balance it with a bottom lip another
lady<00:04:29.220> here<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.729> when<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:29.970> talked<00:04:30.210> about<00:04:30.419> nice

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
lady here and when I talked about nice

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.330 
lady here and when I talked about nice
shape<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.199> is<00:04:31.349> the<00:04:31.440> antithesis<00:04:31.740> it's<00:04:32.160> too

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
shape this is the antithesis it's too

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.990 
shape this is the antithesis it's too
much<00:04:32.520> shape

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
much shape

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.550 
much shape
there's<00:04:33.300> too<00:04:33.569> much<00:04:33.690> collective<00:04:34.289> vision<00:04:34.380> on

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
there's too much collective vision on

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.230 
there's too much collective vision on
the<00:04:34.650> bottom<00:04:34.949> lip<00:04:35.130> there<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.759> upper<00:04:35.910> lip<00:04:36.150> is

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
the bottom lip there the upper lip is

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.029 
the bottom lip there the upper lip is
too<00:04:36.419> big<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.870> then<00:04:37.229> there's<00:04:37.380> also<00:04:37.530> too<00:04:37.710> much

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
too big and then there's also too much

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.240 
too big and then there's also too much
of<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.280> show<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.699> I<00:04:38.729> soften<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.300> upper<00:04:39.509> lip<00:04:39.660> I

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
of a show so I soften the upper lip I

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.650 
of a show so I soften the upper lip I
narrowed<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.460> break<00:04:41.759> on<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.060> bottom<00:04:42.360> lip<00:04:42.509> and

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
narrowed the break on the bottom lip and

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.240 
narrowed the break on the bottom lip and
then<00:04:42.720> augmented<00:04:43.259> the<00:04:43.319> bottom<00:04:43.590> lip<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:43.979> more

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
then augmented the bottom lip with more

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.520 
then augmented the bottom lip with more
silicone<00:04:44.699> to<00:04:44.819> fix<00:04:45.030> her<00:04:45.120> silicone<00:04:45.599> to<00:04:46.110> balance

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
silicone to fix her silicone to balance

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.930 
silicone to fix her silicone to balance
it<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:46.889> is<00:04:47.009> actually<00:04:47.280> not<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.460> reduction

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
it so this is actually not a reduction

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.550 
it so this is actually not a reduction
this<00:04:48.030> is<00:04:48.180> adding<00:04:48.509> more<00:04:48.539> silicone<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.259> fix

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
this is adding more silicone to fix

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.710 
this is adding more silicone to fix
someone<00:04:49.830> else's<00:04:50.099> silicone<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.759> this<00:04:51.300> is<00:04:51.479> some

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
someone else's silicone and this is some

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.050 
someone else's silicone and this is some
weird<00:04:52.080> gore-tex<00:04:53.069> that<00:04:53.310> was<00:04:53.430> actually<00:04:53.729> removed

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
weird gore-tex that was actually removed

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.270 
weird gore-tex that was actually removed
leaving<00:04:54.240> scar<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.050> white<00:04:55.289> portion<00:04:56.099> of<00:04:56.190> the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
leaving scar to the white portion of the

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.980 
leaving scar to the white portion of the
upper<00:04:56.490> lip<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.849> looks<00:04:57.030> very<00:04:57.240> unnatural<00:04:57.389> it

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
upper lip it looks very unnatural it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.300 
upper lip it looks very unnatural it
looks<00:04:58.259> like<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.409> duck<00:04:58.860> lip

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
looks like a duck lip

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.370 
looks like a duck lip
shelf<00:04:59.639> and<00:04:59.880> so<00:05:00.330> what<00:05:00.449> I<00:05:00.479> did<00:05:00.569> was<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:00.900> built<00:05:01.139> the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
shelf and so what I did was I built the

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.350 
shelf and so what I did was I built the
bottom<00:05:01.740> lip<00:05:01.889> with<00:05:02.069> two<00:05:02.280> sessions<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.909> 0.4

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
bottom lip with two sessions of 0.4

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.360 
bottom lip with two sessions of 0.4
silicone<00:05:03.900> then<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.409> just<00:05:04.770> went<00:05:05.009> in<00:05:05.130> there<00:05:05.250> and

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
silicone then I just went in there and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.969 
silicone then I just went in there and
just<00:05:05.430> touched<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.389> little<00:05:06.810> bit<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.169> that<00:05:07.289> shape

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
just touched a little bit to that shape

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.309 
just touched a little bit to that shape
again<00:05:08.250> this<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.550> an<00:05:08.669> example<00:05:09.210> of<00:05:09.720> some<00:05:10.139> lips

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
again this is an example of some lips

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.870 
again this is an example of some lips
you<00:05:10.409> see<00:05:10.560> they're<00:05:10.740> just<00:05:10.770> too<00:05:11.099> big<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.550> flat

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
you see they're just too big and flat

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.879 
you see they're just too big and flat
some<00:05:12.539> lips<00:05:12.780> have<00:05:12.960> too<00:05:13.110> much<00:05:13.259> shape<00:05:13.560> this<00:05:13.710> is

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
some lips have too much shape this is

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.279 
some lips have too much shape this is
breaking<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:15.479> shape<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.110> lip

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
breaking the the shape of the lip

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.600 
breaking the the shape of the lip
without<00:05:16.650> actually<00:05:17.159> going<00:05:17.280> there<00:05:17.460> and

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
without actually going there and

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.010 
without actually going there and
augmenting<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.210> upper<00:05:18.419> lip<00:05:18.569> because<00:05:18.720> you

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
augmenting the upper lip because you

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.200 
augmenting the upper lip because you
want<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.319> de-emphasize<00:05:20.099> that<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.819> white

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
want to de-emphasize that that white

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.930 
want to de-emphasize that that white
rolled<00:05:21.599> duck<00:05:22.560> looking<00:05:22.889> lip<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.430> that's

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
rolled duck looking lip and that's

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.129 
rolled duck looking lip and that's
something<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:24.330> just<00:05:24.360> very<00:05:24.599> hard<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:24.930> take

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
something that just very hard to take

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.740 
something that just very hard to take
out<00:05:25.320> you<00:05:25.560> just<00:05:25.740> want<00:05:25.889> to<00:05:25.949> add<00:05:26.099> emphasis<00:05:26.340> I

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
out you just want to add emphasis I

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.879 
out you just want to add emphasis I
emphasizes<00:05:27.750> by<00:05:27.840> creating<00:05:28.169> more<00:05:28.710> of<00:05:28.800> the

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
emphasizes by creating more of the

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.649 
emphasizes by creating more of the
bottom<00:05:29.039> lip<00:05:29.310> this<00:05:29.849> is<00:05:30.000> actually<00:05:30.360> just<00:05:30.479> this

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
bottom lip this is actually just this

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.420 
bottom lip this is actually just this
weird<00:05:30.960> silicone<00:05:31.469> bull<00:05:31.710> genus<00:05:32.039> on<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.250> outer

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
weird silicone bull genus on the outer

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.580 
weird silicone bull genus on the outer
lips<00:05:32.729> I<00:05:32.849> just<00:05:33.030> curtailed<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.110> just<00:05:34.289> shaved

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
lips I just curtailed the it just shaved

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.100 
lips I just curtailed the it just shaved
off<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.070> cut<00:05:35.490> out<00:05:35.639> the<00:05:36.120> outer<00:05:36.479> portion<00:05:36.990> of<00:05:37.020> the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
off and cut out the outer portion of the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.570 
off and cut out the outer portion of the
lip<00:05:37.199> and<00:05:37.289> then<00:05:37.409> built<00:05:37.710> her<00:05:37.919> bottom<00:05:38.310> lip<00:05:38.340> with

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
lip and then built her bottom lip with

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.459 
lip and then built her bottom lip with
that<00:05:38.699> heart-shaped<00:05:39.240> lip<00:05:39.509> with<00:05:39.780> two<00:05:39.960> rounds<00:05:40.320> to

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
that heart-shaped lip with two rounds to

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.189 
that heart-shaped lip with two rounds to
get<00:05:40.800> her<00:05:40.979> more<00:05:41.250> balanced<00:05:41.820> so<00:05:42.479> managing

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
get her more balanced so managing

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.899 
get her more balanced so managing
complications<00:05:43.860> really<00:05:44.370> it's<00:05:44.610> almost

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
complications really it's almost

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.490 
complications really it's almost
impossible<00:05:45.210> extract<00:05:45.719> don't<00:05:45.930> try<00:05:46.080> to<00:05:46.139> go<00:05:46.259> cut

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
impossible extract don't try to go cut

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.200 
impossible extract don't try to go cut
it<00:05:46.590> out<00:05:46.740> what<00:05:47.430> you<00:05:47.520> got<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:47.729> do<00:05:47.820> is<00:05:47.909> just<00:05:47.940> cut

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
it out what you got to do is just cut

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.610 
it out what you got to do is just cut
the<00:05:48.330> lip<00:05:48.479> down<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:48.900> that's<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.259> best<00:05:49.440> way<00:05:49.590> to

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
the lip down and that's the best way to
