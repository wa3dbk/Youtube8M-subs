00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.720 
moisturized I've even done that little
test<00:02:38.410> where<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.590> drop<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:39.280> pluck<00:02:39.700> a

test where you drop you know pluck a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.790 
test where you drop you know pluck a
string<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.210> hair<00:02:40.420> put<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.990> water<00:02:41.140> my<00:02:41.650> hair

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
string of hair put in the water my hair

string of hair put in the water my hair
is<00:02:41.860> moisturize<00:02:42.460> but<00:02:42.700> why<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.330> dry<00:02:43.510> here

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
and I'm guessing it's because of the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.250 
and I'm guessing it's because of the
sweat<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.730> everything<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.810> I'm<00:02:46.900> making<00:02:47.050> this

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
every day and then again I was thinking

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.490 
every day and then again I was thinking
maybe<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.540> could<00:03:16.570> just<00:03:16.750> wet<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:16.959> roots<00:03:17.290> but

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
maybe I could just wet the roots but

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.699 
maybe I could just wet the roots but
sometimes<00:03:17.920> even<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.550> even<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:20.080> ends<00:03:20.410> are<00:03:20.470> dry

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
sometimes even the even the ends are dry

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.590 
sometimes even the even the ends are dry
it<00:03:20.920> just<00:03:21.070> doesn't<00:03:21.280> look<00:03:21.519> right<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.510> don't
