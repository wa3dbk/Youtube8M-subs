back after the 15 20 first half and
they're<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.380> great<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.250> about<00:02:20.670> an<00:02:20.910> IP

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
they're really great but about an IP

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.210 
they're really great but about an IP

game they're trying to build us after

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.040 
game they're trying to build us after
very<00:02:26.730> early<00:02:27.150> beginning<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:30.180> saw<00:02:30.870> that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
very early beginning and I I saw that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.620 
very early beginning and I I saw that
they<00:02:31.440> are<00:02:31.500> trying<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.160> they're<00:02:33.090> didn't

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
they are trying and they're didn't

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.870 
they are trying and they're didn't
underestimate<00:02:34.050> us<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.830> they're<00:02:35.430> doing<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
underestimate us and they're doing the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.030 
underestimate us and they're doing the
best<00:02:36.030> work<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.570> they<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:36.960> but<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.740> were<00:02:37.800> just

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
best work as they can but we were just

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.410 
best work as they can but we were just
well<00:02:38.700> prepared<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.300> we<00:02:40.310> would<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.910> give<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
well prepared and we would just give the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.660 
well prepared and we would just give the
good<00:02:42.540> resistance<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.230> them<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:44.460> was<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
good resistance to them and it was a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.840 
good resistance to them and it was a
nice<00:02:44.910> match<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.300> guess<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.100> good<00:02:47.310> was<00:02:47.520> is

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
nice match I guess so how good was is

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.760 
nice match I guess so how good was is

cash<00:02:57.860> cash<00:02:58.860> was<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.220> was<00:02:59.490> one<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.240> best

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
cash cash was that was one of the best

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.810 
cash cash was that was one of the best
maps<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:01.080> hours<00:03:01.560> before<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.280> tournament

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
maps of hours before this tournament

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.970 
maps of hours before this tournament
were<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.840> encash<00:03:04.680> up<00:03:05.330> overpass<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.980> mirage

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
were like encash up overpass and mirage

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.240 
were like encash up overpass and mirage
where<00:03:08.630> we<00:03:09.630> thought<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.020> they're<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.950> best

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
where we thought that they're the best

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.530 
where we thought that they're the best
maps<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.760> ours<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:13.670> hope<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.880> play<00:03:15.000> cash<00:03:15.300> or

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
maps of ours so we hope to play cash or

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.710 
maps of ours so we hope to play cash or
overpass<00:03:16.020> versus<00:03:16.650> an<00:03:16.800> IP<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.330> they<00:03:18.330> removed

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
overpass versus an IP and they removed

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.979 
overpass versus an IP and they removed
overpass<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:20.070> was<00:03:20.220> our<00:03:21.209> best<00:03:21.480> map<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.810> guess

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
overpass and it was our best map I guess

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.310 
overpass and it was our best map I guess
we<00:03:22.530> hope<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.860> play<00:03:22.980> overpass<00:03:23.550> against<00:03:23.880> an<00:03:23.970> IP

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
we hope to play overpass against an IP

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.250 
we hope to play overpass against an IP
but<00:03:25.320> we're<00:03:26.100> happy<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:26.489> cash<00:03:26.700> also<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
but we're happy with cash also and I

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.670 
but we're happy with cash also and I
think<00:03:29.070> we<00:03:29.190> played<00:03:29.700> pretty<00:03:29.880> well<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.750> want<00:03:31.380> both

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
think we played pretty well we want both

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.900 
think we played pretty well we want both
pistols<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:33.690> should<00:03:33.959> give<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.530> match

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
pistols so it should give you a match

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.300 
pistols so it should give you a match
actually<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.050> didn't<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.070> pulse

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
actually but but it didn't the the pulse

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.690 
actually but but it didn't the the pulse
just<00:03:38.820> killed<00:03:39.660> our<00:03:39.840> momentum<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:41.400> let

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
just killed our momentum and just let

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.160 
just killed our momentum and just let
them<00:03:41.820> win<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.300> game<00:03:42.480> but<00:03:42.690> they<00:03:42.840> play<00:03:43.110> it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
them win the game but they play it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.820 
them win the game but they play it
really<00:03:43.500> excellent<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.630> I'm<00:03:45.630> glad<00:03:45.810> they<00:03:46.680> won

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830

and<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.010> half<00:04:21.040> grand<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:22.150> we<00:04:22.990> were<00:04:23.050> just

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
and a half grand so we were just

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.770 
and a half grand so we were just
thinking<00:04:23.350> about<00:04:23.890> force<00:04:24.310> by<00:04:24.520> aurico<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.390> we

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
thinking about force by aurico and we

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.560 
thinking about force by aurico and we
decided<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.320> eco<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:26.950> yeah<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.120> play<00:04:28.420> with

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
decided to eco and yeah and play with

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.750 
decided to eco and yeah and play with
double<00:04:28.870> up<00:04:29.020> set<00:04:29.230> up<00:04:29.380> because<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:30.310> was<00:04:30.460> working

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
double up set up because it was working

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.260 
double up set up because it was working
well<00:04:30.910> for<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.330> whole<00:04:31.480> map<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:33.880> don't<00:04:34.180> know

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
well for the whole map and I don't know

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.500 
well for the whole map and I don't know
if<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.840> would<00:04:35.170> have<00:04:35.560> another<00:04:35.890> chance<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.510> repeat

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
if I would have another chance to repeat

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.770 
if I would have another chance to repeat
the<00:04:37.690> round<00:04:37.870> out<00:04:38.230> first<00:04:38.680> by<00:04:38.860> definitely<00:04:39.520> we<00:04:40.030> we

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
the round out first by definitely we we

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.300 
the round out first by definitely we we
made<00:04:41.170> a<00:04:41.200> mistake<00:04:41.590> there<00:04:41.740> maybe<00:04:42.040> lack<00:04:42.280> of

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
made a mistake there maybe lack of

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.940 
made a mistake there maybe lack of
experience<00:04:42.760> causes<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.140> match<00:04:44.290> because

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
experience causes the the match because

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.000 
experience causes the the match because
we<00:04:45.220> really<00:04:45.460> played<00:04:45.640> well<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.950> don't<00:04:47.950> know

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
we really played well and I don't know

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.270 
we really played well and I don't know
it's<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.669> past<00:04:48.880> now<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.150> we<00:04:49.900> can<00:04:50.890> think<00:04:51.130> about

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
it's the past now and we can think about

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.870 
it's the past now and we can think about
it<00:04:51.610> what<00:04:51.880> could<00:04:52.270> go<00:04:52.660> possibly<00:04:53.290> better<00:04:53.860> we<00:04:54.669> just

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880

it what could go possibly better we just
lost<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.300> we're<00:04:55.750> happy<00:04:56.080> about<00:04:56.200> our<00:04:56.770> score<00:04:57.250> it

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
tournament I said that fanatic should

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.330 
tournament I said that fanatic should
win<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:22.460> tournament<00:06:22.940> easily<00:06:23.330> but<00:06:23.720> I<00:06:24.310> now<00:06:25.310> I

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
win the tournament easily but I now I

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.300 
win the tournament easily but I now I
think<00:06:25.490> they<00:06:25.730> want<00:06:26.530> LDS<00:06:27.530> you<00:06:27.680> should<00:06:27.890> take<00:06:28.130> them

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
think they want LDS you should take them

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.290 
think they want LDS you should take them
to<00:06:28.730> the<00:06:29.210> one<00:06:29.390> I<00:06:29.630> guess<00:06:30.020> and<00:06:30.610> dignitas<00:06:31.610> vs<00:06:32.090> na'vi

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
to the one I guess and dignitas vs na'vi

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.380 
to the one I guess and dignitas vs na'vi
it's<00:06:33.290> really<00:06:33.500> hard<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.710> predict<00:06:34.040> because

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
it's really hard to predict because

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.450 
it's really hard to predict because
we're<00:06:35.390> playing<00:06:35.630> against<00:06:35.960> Dignitas<00:06:36.590> the<00:06:37.160> one

wishing<00:07:02.120> from<00:07:02.480> virtus<00:07:02.900> Pro<00:07:03.050> obviously<00:07:03.530> but

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
wishing from virtus Pro obviously but

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.680 
wishing from virtus Pro obviously but
who<00:07:04.130> do<00:07:04.190> you<00:07:04.340> actually<00:07:04.490> expect<00:07:04.790> to<00:07:05.180> and<00:07:05.330> do<00:07:05.630> you

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.260 
who do you actually expect to and do you
think<00:07:05.900> I'll<00:07:06.290> do<00:07:06.470> so<00:07:06.560> you<00:07:06.680> can<00:07:06.800> take<00:07:06.950> it<00:07:07.130> I<00:07:07.280> don't

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
think I'll do so you can take it I don't

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.560 
think I'll do so you can take it I don't
know<00:07:08.419> if<00:07:08.630> I<00:07:08.960> think<00:07:09.260> if<00:07:09.410> VP<00:07:10.220> players<00:07:10.490> would<00:07:11.210> play

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
know if I think if VP players would play

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.230 
know if I think if VP players would play
their<00:07:11.780> game<00:07:12.140> they<00:07:12.890> can<00:07:13.070> do<00:07:13.190> this<00:07:13.340> I<00:07:13.640> mean<00:07:14.090> they

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
their game they can do this I mean they

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.870 
their game they can do this I mean they
won<00:07:14.419> the<00:07:14.570> major<00:07:14.750> before<00:07:15.230> in<00:07:15.500> Katowice<00:07:16.220> and<00:07:16.669> I

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
won the major before in Katowice and I

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.970 
won the major before in Katowice and I
don't<00:07:17.090> think<00:07:17.240> the<00:07:17.450> homestyle<00:07:17.900> gave<00:07:18.169> them<00:07:18.380> that

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
don't think the homestyle gave them that

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.920 
don't think the homestyle gave them that
advantage<00:07:19.400> that<00:07:19.850> they<00:07:20.090> couldn't<00:07:20.450> repeat<00:07:20.720> that

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
advantage that they couldn't repeat that

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.980 
advantage that they couldn't repeat that
in<00:07:20.990> here<00:07:21.500> in<00:07:21.620> Sweden<00:07:21.980> so<00:07:22.820> yeah<00:07:23.150> i<00:07:23.180> would<00:07:23.570> say<00:07:23.780> i
