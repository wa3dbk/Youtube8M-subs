00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
all right so here we are just a little

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.970 
all right so here we are just a little
preview<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.779> some<00:00:07.020> things<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.589> can<00:00:07.799> talk

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
preview of some things that we can talk

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.470 
preview of some things that we can talk
about<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.639> things<00:00:08.880> I'm<00:00:09.030> going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> talk<00:00:09.450> about

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
about and things I'm going to talk about

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.430 
about and things I'm going to talk about
in<00:00:10.170> future<00:00:11.000> lectures<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.300> also<00:00:12.809> hands-on

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
in future lectures and also hands-on

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.730 
in future lectures and also hands-on
courses<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.280> perhaps<00:00:14.849> maybe<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> lab<00:00:16.410> near

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
courses and perhaps maybe in a lab near

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.070 
courses and perhaps maybe in a lab near
you<00:00:18.619> talk<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> little<00:00:19.859> about<00:00:19.980> contour<00:00:20.730> here

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
you talk a little about contour here

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.050 
you talk a little about contour here
contour<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.430> probably<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.760> now<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
contour is probably right now the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.140 
contour is probably right now the
hottest<00:00:24.539> topic<00:00:25.109> indentures<00:00:25.760> everybody<00:00:26.760> wants

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
hottest topic indentures everybody wants

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.640 
hottest topic indentures everybody wants
to<00:00:27.210> contour<00:00:27.720> their<00:00:27.900> dentures<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.289> make<00:00:28.500> them

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to contour their dentures to make them

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.939 
to contour their dentures to make them
look<00:00:28.769> natural<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.310> think<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.640> wonderful<00:00:30.949> I've

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
look natural I think it's wonderful I've

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.090 
look natural I think it's wonderful I've
been<00:00:32.160> doing<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.700> years<00:00:33.680> there's<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.770> bit<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
been doing it for years there's a bit of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
been doing it for years there's a bit of
an<00:00:35.190> art<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.000> there's<00:00:36.510> also<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.960> bit<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
an art to it and there's also a bit of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.910 
an art to it and there's also a bit of
common<00:00:37.649> sense<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.350> rely<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
common sense and I kind of rely on a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
common sense and I kind of rely on a
little<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.280> both<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.670> little<00:00:42.059> common<00:00:42.420> sense<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
little of both a little common sense a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
little of both a little common sense a
little<00:00:42.960> bit<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.410> art<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.829> there<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.640> some

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
little bit of art and there are some

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.430 
little bit of art and there are some
techniques<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.930> talk<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
techniques which we can talk about a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.520 
techniques which we can talk about a
later<00:00:46.710> date<00:00:47.039> um<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.750> show<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.170> here

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
later date um but I just show this here

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.920 
later date um but I just show this here
just<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.460> illustrate<00:00:50.840> what<00:00:51.840> I'm

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
just to kind of illustrate what I'm

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.869 
just to kind of illustrate what I'm
talking<00:00:52.260> about<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:53.039> simplistic<00:00:53.520> at

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
talking about it's very simplistic at

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639 
talking about it's very simplistic at
this<00:00:54.059> point<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.570> said<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:55.079> teeth<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
this point I just said some teeth is I

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.900 
this point I just said some teeth is I
didn't<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.250> talk<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.760> empty

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
didn't want to just talk to an empty

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.110 
didn't want to just talk to an empty
screen<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:59.430> six<00:00:59.670> teeth<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
screen so here I have just six teeth and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
screen so here I have just six teeth and
I<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.359> kind<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.629> point<00:01:00.840> things<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.590> go

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
I can kind of point things out as we go

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.240 
I can kind of point things out as we go
along<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:06.030> basic<00:01:06.420> gist<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> this

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
along so the basic gist of it is this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.810 
along so the basic gist of it is this
what<00:01:08.250> effects<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.299> creates<00:01:10.110> contour<00:01:10.760> you<00:01:11.760> know

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
what effects or creates contour you know

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.440 
what effects or creates contour you know
teeth<00:01:12.180> okay<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.020> course<00:01:13.369> but<00:01:14.369> also<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.210> rip

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
teeth okay of course but also the rip

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.170 
teeth okay of course but also the rip
forms<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> teeth<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.790> know

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
forms of the teeth you know

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.350 
forms of the teeth you know
narrow<00:01:18.689> roots<00:01:19.140> long<00:01:20.009> roots<00:01:20.400> short<00:01:20.880> roots<00:01:21.090> wide

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
narrow roots long roots short roots wide

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.170 
narrow roots long roots short roots wide
roots<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.840> those<00:01:22.439> six<00:01:22.770> teeth<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> wide

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
roots in those six teeth you have a wide

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.660 
roots in those six teeth you have a wide
variation<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:25.140> root<00:01:25.320> forms<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.950> because

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
variation of root forms and because

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
variation of root forms and because
those<00:01:26.850> root<00:01:27.180> forms<00:01:27.479> are<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.840> varied<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.350> such

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
those root forms are so varied and such

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.640 
those root forms are so varied and such
a<00:01:28.770> wide<00:01:29.100> variation<00:01:30.170> there's<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
a wide variation there's going to be a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.609 
a wide variation there's going to be a
variation<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.549> contour<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.900> relates<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
variation in contour that relates to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
variation in contour that relates to
them<00:01:37.189> arch<00:01:38.189> form<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.850> another<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.390> believe

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
them arch form is another thing believe

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.340 
them arch form is another thing believe
it<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.220> arch<00:01:41.220> form<00:01:41.700> whether<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.689> narrow

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
it or not arch form whether it's narrow

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.810 
it or not arch form whether it's narrow
or<00:01:43.799> wide<00:01:44.810> tapering<00:01:45.829> those<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:47.070> affect<00:01:47.520> how

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
or wide tapering those all affect how

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.450 
or wide tapering those all affect how
much<00:01:48.060> Anatomy<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
much Anatomy we actually see in the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.910 
much Anatomy we actually see in the
tissue<00:01:51.229> wider<00:01:53.570> arches<00:01:54.570> tend<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.350> very

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
tissue wider arches tend to have very

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.770 
tissue wider arches tend to have very
little<00:01:57.649> contour<00:01:58.649> whereas<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.939> narrow<00:02:00.240> arches

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
little contour whereas the narrow arches

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.719 
little contour whereas the narrow arches
tend<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.890> quite<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.310> bit<00:02:02.430> because

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
tend to have quite a bit because

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.840 
tend to have quite a bit because
everything's<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.420> grot<00:02:03.840> crowded<00:02:04.439> together

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
everything's all grot crowded together

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
everything's all grot crowded together
and<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> end<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.210> getting<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.570> more<00:02:06.750> skeletal

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and you end up getting a more skeletal

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.660 
and you end up getting a more skeletal
look<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.789> know<00:02:09.470> investigate<00:02:10.470> nature<00:02:11.099> if

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
look so you know investigate nature if

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
look so you know investigate nature if
you<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> doctor<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.959> are

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you have a doctor that you are

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.730 
you have a doctor that you are
with<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.880> would<00:02:15.300> hope<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.510> would<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.990> since<00:02:16.320> you

molded the molded see EJ's I tend to get

molded the molded see EJ's I tend to get
away<00:04:51.380> from<00:04:51.560> them<00:04:51.890> because<00:04:52.760> whenever<00:04:53.240> they're

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
away from them because whenever they're

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.530 
away from them because whenever they're
followed<00:04:54.260> what<00:04:55.070> they<00:04:55.220> do<00:04:55.280> is<00:04:55.670> they<00:04:55.850> they<00:04:56.060> make

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
followed what they do is they they make

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.930 
followed what they do is they they make
the<00:04:56.690> dentures<00:04:57.110> look<00:04:57.320> trenched<00:04:58.070> they<00:04:58.490> make<00:04:58.700> the

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
the dentures look trenched they make the

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.940 
the dentures look trenched they make the
area<00:04:59.390> above<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.260> tooth<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.710> where<00:05:00.830> the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
area above the tooth and where the

tissue meets the tooth

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.050 
tissue meets the tooth
it<00:05:03.080> makes<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.470> look<00:05:03.560> trenched<00:05:04.190> because<00:05:04.880> the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
it makes it look trenched because the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.060 
it makes it look trenched because the
contour<00:05:05.510> comes<00:05:05.750> in<00:05:06.170> and<00:05:06.380> then<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.680> goes<00:05:06.860> out

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
contour comes in and then it goes out

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.090 
contour comes in and then it goes out
and<00:05:07.580> I<00:05:08.240> would<00:05:08.420> prefer<00:05:08.570> to<00:05:08.780> have<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.710> tissue

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
and I would prefer to have the tissue

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.670 
and I would prefer to have the tissue
laying<00:05:10.580> on<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.970> surface<00:05:11.390> of<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.660> tooth<00:05:11.870> so

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
laying on the surface of the tooth so

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.560 
laying on the surface of the tooth so
that<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.950> projects<00:05:13.400> that<00:05:13.520> emergence<00:05:14.000> look<00:05:14.480> at

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
that it projects that emergence look at

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.450 
that it projects that emergence look at
your<00:05:14.720> fingernails<00:05:15.050> sometime<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.770> fingernail

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
your fingernails sometime a fingernail

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.810 
your fingernails sometime a fingernail
comes<00:05:17.330> out<00:05:17.720> emerges<00:05:18.500> kind<00:05:19.070> of<00:05:19.220> keep<00:05:19.550> that

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
comes out emerges kind of keep that

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.980 
comes out emerges kind of keep that
mindset<00:05:20.630> when<00:05:21.020> you're<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.970> know<00:05:23.000> coloring<00:05:23.750> or

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
mindset when you're you know coloring or

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.050 
mindset when you're you know coloring or
I<00:05:24.020> should<00:05:24.380> say<00:05:24.560> carving<00:05:25.070> your<00:05:25.160> wax<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:25.880> and

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
I should say carving your wax and and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.030 
I should say carving your wax and and
contouring<00:05:26.960> your<00:05:27.110> bases<00:05:27.560> is<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.920> you're

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
contouring your bases is it you're

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.740 
contouring your bases is it you're
trying<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.430> mimic<00:05:28.790> this<00:05:28.910> emergence<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:29.450> can't

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
trying to mimic this emergence I can't

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.890 
trying to mimic this emergence I can't
stress<00:05:30.230> that<00:05:30.260> enough<00:05:31.390> stay<00:05:32.390> away<00:05:32.630> from<00:05:32.690> the

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
stress that enough stay away from the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.070 
stress that enough stay away from the
trenching<00:05:33.410> so<00:05:33.620> how<00:05:33.980> do<00:05:34.040> I<00:05:34.160> do<00:05:34.280> that<00:05:35.050> what<00:05:36.050> I

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
trenching so how do I do that what I

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.800 
trenching so how do I do that what I
usually<00:05:36.410> do<00:05:36.860> is<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.190> always<00:05:37.460> select<00:05:37.760> a<00:05:38.120> longer

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
usually do is I always select a longer

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.510 
usually do is I always select a longer
mold<00:05:39.220> than<00:05:40.220> I<00:05:40.580> need<00:05:40.850> not<00:05:41.810> a<00:05:42.080> not<00:05:42.620> a<00:05:42.650> bigger<00:05:43.130> mold

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
mold than I need not a not a bigger mold

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.900 
mold than I need not a not a bigger mold

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
but a longer mold because that then

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.130 
but a longer mold because that then
takes<00:05:47.270> away<00:05:47.660> from<00:05:48.340> take<00:05:49.340> away<00:05:49.640> that<00:05:49.850> cej<00:05:50.780> puts
