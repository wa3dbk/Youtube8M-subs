00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
so here we have the little teapot demo

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.449 
so here we have the little teapot demo
up<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.180> running<00:03:44.510> on<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.690> Leonardo<00:03:45.500> if<00:03:45.769> the

because my computer can't keep up with

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.330

the D pot demo was working it was time

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.560 
the D pot demo was working it was time
to<00:04:03.210> start<00:04:03.600> on<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.930> PID<00:04:04.290> side<00:04:04.800> of<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.070> code

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570

the<00:04:53.970> code<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.780> car's<00:04:55.080> motors<00:04:55.530> would<00:04:55.710> go

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
the code and the car's motors would go

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.340 
the code and the car's motors would go
crazy<00:04:56.190> for<00:04:56.610> some<00:04:56.880> moments<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.570> then<00:04:57.720> more

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
crazy for some moments and then more

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.230 
crazy for some moments and then more
often<00:04:58.650> than<00:04:58.830> not<00:04:58.860> settle<00:04:59.490> into<00:04:59.610> some<00:04:59.910> kind<00:05:00.180> of

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
often than not settle into some kind of

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.320 
often than not settle into some kind of
fix<00:05:00.630> turn<00:05:01.280> so<00:05:02.280> it's<00:05:02.460> pretty<00:05:02.610> clear<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.150> mote

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
fix turn so it's pretty clear the mote

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.990 
fix turn so it's pretty clear the mote
with<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.630> motors<00:05:03.930> in<00:05:04.080> play<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:05.250> Leonardo<00:05:05.850> was

with the motors in play the Leonardo was

that<00:05:11.729> was<00:05:11.940> a<00:05:11.970> problem<00:05:12.270> wasn't<00:05:12.810> nearly<00:05:13.020> as

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
that was a problem wasn't nearly as

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.590 
that was a problem wasn't nearly as
obvious<00:05:13.770> my<00:05:14.640> first<00:05:14.880> thought<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.300> was<00:05:15.330> some

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
obvious my first thought it was some

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.960 
obvious my first thought it was some
kind<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.900> electrical<00:05:16.410> interference<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.940> I

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
kind of electrical interference so I

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.880 
kind of electrical interference so I
tried<00:05:18.360> every<00:05:18.600> trick<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.140> book<00:05:19.440> I<00:05:19.710> could

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
tried every trick in that book I could

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.860 
tried every trick in that book I could
think<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.310> including<00:05:20.850> adding<00:05:21.510> external

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
think of including adding external

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.500 
think of including adding external
pull-up<00:05:22.350> resistors<00:05:22.919> to<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.220> i2c<00:05:23.820> lines<00:05:24.120> as

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
pull-up resistors to the i2c lines as

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.010 
pull-up resistors to the i2c lines as
well<00:05:25.229> as<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:26.070> PWM<00:05:26.850> and<00:05:26.970> enable<00:05:27.450> leads

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
well as the PWM and enable leads

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.710 
well as the PWM and enable leads
I<00:05:28.050> also<00:05:28.710> added<00:05:29.070> capacitors<00:05:29.910> at<00:05:30.060> various<00:05:30.450> power

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
I also added capacitors at various power

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.010 
I also added capacitors at various power
points<00:05:31.380> and<00:05:31.410> even<00:05:31.890> went<00:05:32.070> so<00:05:32.100> far<00:05:32.430> as<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.870> set<00:05:33.870> up

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
points and even went so far as to set up

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.140 
points and even went so far as to set up
separate<00:05:34.470> battery<00:05:34.919> systems<00:05:35.669> for<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:35.940> motor

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
separate battery systems for the motor

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.810 
separate battery systems for the motor
and<00:05:36.360> logic<00:05:36.840> none<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.830> which<00:05:38.010> really<00:05:38.310> saw<00:05:38.760> the

tangible<00:05:44.250> improvement<00:05:44.910> I've<00:05:45.240> left<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.110> in

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
tangible improvement I've left it in

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.170 
tangible improvement I've left it in
place<00:05:46.470> just<00:05:46.860> because<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.220> like<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.760> idea<00:05:48.120> that

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
place just because I like the idea that

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.719 
place just because I like the idea that
the<00:05:48.630> logic<00:05:49.050> side<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.530> system<00:05:49.950> can

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
the logic side of the system can

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.730 
the logic side of the system can
continue<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.300> operate<00:05:51.660> even<00:05:52.260> if<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.500> motor

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
continue to operate even if the motor

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.600 
continue to operate even if the motor
batteries<00:05:53.490> should<00:05:53.520> get<00:05:53.880> sucked<00:05:54.180> down<00:05:54.360> to<00:05:54.600> zero

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
batteries should get sucked down to zero

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.730 
batteries should get sucked down to zero
eventually<00:05:56.610> I<00:05:56.820> tried<00:05:57.240> placing<00:05:57.780> point<00:05:58.110> 1<00:05:58.320> micro

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
eventually I tried placing point 1 micro

eventually I tried placing point 1 micro
farad<00:05:58.919> capacitors<00:05:59.669> across<00:06:00.030> each<00:06:00.600> motor<00:06:01.080> and

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
farad capacitors across each motor and

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.740 
farad capacitors across each motor and
that<00:06:01.830> didn't<00:06:02.610> yield<00:06:02.910> of<00:06:03.090> improvement

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
that didn't yield of improvement

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.120 
that didn't yield of improvement
particularly<00:06:04.350> when<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.710> motors<00:06:05.010> were

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
particularly when the motors were

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.150 
particularly when the motors were
actually<00:06:05.520> running<00:06:06.020> but<00:06:07.020> as<00:06:07.200> luck<00:06:07.890> would<00:06:07.950> have

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
actually running but as luck would have

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.330 
actually running but as luck would have
it<00:06:08.370> that<00:06:09.090> wasn't<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.570> whole<00:06:09.690> story

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
it that wasn't the whole story

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.820 
it that wasn't the whole story
even<00:06:11.270> when<00:06:11.419> the<00:06:11.510> motors<00:06:11.840> weren't<00:06:12.139> energized

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
even when the motors weren't energized

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.400 
even when the motors weren't energized
the<00:06:13.610> program<00:06:14.090> would<00:06:14.360> eventually<00:06:14.630> go<00:06:14.960> off<00:06:15.169> and

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
the program would eventually go off and

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.430 
the program would eventually go off and
hide<00:06:15.970> which<00:06:16.970> meant<00:06:17.210> to<00:06:17.330> me<00:06:17.480> it<00:06:17.780> was<00:06:17.990> picking<00:06:18.350> up

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
hide which meant to me it was picking up

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.189 
hide which meant to me it was picking up
some<00:06:18.710> kind<00:06:19.010> of<00:06:19.190> strange<00:06:20.030> data<00:06:20.449> that<00:06:20.780> it<00:06:20.900> didn't

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090

more stable eventually that led me to

the FIFO was getting out of step so to
