00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.770 
solution that Rob's the rub used in the
back<00:01:52.880> ARB<00:01:53.569> fridge<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.889> literally<00:01:55.639> a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
back ARB fridge and a literally a

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.510 
back ARB fridge and a literally a
laundry<00:01:56.780> list<00:01:56.929> of<00:01:57.079> additional<00:01:57.319> items<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.369> this

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
laundry list of additional items so this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.520 
laundry list of additional items so this
truck<00:01:58.759> is<00:01:58.939> particularly<00:01:59.420> well<00:01:59.780> outfitted<00:02:00.350> for

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
truck is particularly well outfitted for

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.410 
truck is particularly well outfitted for
long<00:02:00.679> distance<00:02:01.100> travel<00:02:01.189> now<00:02:02.090> one<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.359> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
long distance travel now one of the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.300 
long distance travel now one of the
things<00:02:02.689> that<00:02:02.899> for<00:02:03.649> me<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:03.799> thought<00:02:04.130> was

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
things that for me I thought was

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.919 
things that for me I thought was
interesting<00:02:04.490> about<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.149> truck<00:02:05.450> I'm<00:02:05.689> not<00:02:05.899> a

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
interesting about this truck I'm not a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.199 
interesting about this truck I'm not a
particular<00:02:06.560> fan<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.069> 200<00:02:07.459> series<00:02:07.490> because

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
particular fan of the 200 series because

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.969 
particular fan of the 200 series because
of<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.420> size<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.020> but<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.619> found<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.950> really

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
of the size of it but I found it really

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.070 
of the size of it but I found it really
interesting<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.640> Rob<00:02:10.970> who<00:02:11.300> literally<00:02:11.780> does

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
interesting that Rob who literally does

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.140 
interesting that Rob who literally does
hundreds<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.980> thousands<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.490> kilometers<00:02:13.700> a

we found with this vehicle was really
low<00:02:24.069> driver<00:02:24.430> fatigue<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.510> he's<00:02:25.660> able<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.900> do

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
low driver fatigue so he's able to do

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.440 
low driver fatigue so he's able to do
long<00:02:26.319> long<00:02:26.620> distances<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.459> be<00:02:27.910> able<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.269> feel

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
fresh at the end of the day and in my

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.160 
fresh at the end of the day and in my
time<00:02:30.670> using<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.150> which<00:02:31.300> has<00:02:31.450> now<00:02:31.569> been<00:02:31.780> several

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
time using it which has now been several

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.170 
time using it which has now been several
weeks<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.650> have<00:02:33.010> found<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.400> exact<00:02:33.730> same<00:02:33.940> thing

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
weeks I have found the exact same thing

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.119 
weeks I have found the exact same thing
to<00:02:34.300> be<00:02:34.420> true<00:02:34.599> so<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.560> doesn't<00:02:35.890> matter<00:02:36.040> if

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
to be true so it doesn't matter if

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.550 
to be true so it doesn't matter if
you're<00:02:36.250> doing<00:02:36.370> 140<00:02:37.030> K<00:02:37.330> down<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.690> highway<00:02:38.049> or

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
you're going over sand dunes or even

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.759 
you're going over sand dunes or even
moderately<00:02:43.390> technical<00:02:43.989> terrain<00:02:44.319> this

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
moderately technical terrain this

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.949 
moderately technical terrain this
vehicle<00:02:45.310> really<00:02:45.610> does<00:02:45.790> perform<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.780> just

large truck it's very heavy it's not

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.710 
large truck it's very heavy it's not
going<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.430> do<00:02:51.549> that<00:02:51.730> well<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.269> really

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
going to do that well in really

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.380 
going to do that well in really
technical<00:02:53.290> terrain<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.160> use<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.640> as<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.120> great

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
technical terrain so use it as the great

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.449 
technical terrain so use it as the great
adventure<00:02:55.930> tour<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.530> then<00:02:56.980> leave<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.340> at<00:02:57.430> that

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
adventure tour and then leave it at that

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.490 
adventure tour and then leave it at that
another<00:02:58.150> downside<00:02:58.450> obviously<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.200> huge

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
another downside obviously is huge

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.920 
another downside obviously is huge
expense<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.700> an<00:03:00.790> expensive<00:03:01.120> vehicle<00:03:01.750> and
