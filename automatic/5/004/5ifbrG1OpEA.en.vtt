00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
like to go to a little bit of a proxy

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.180 
like to go to a little bit of a proxy
here<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.079> I'm<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.379> surprised<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:52.949> this

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
here and I'm not surprised because this

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.180 
here and I'm not surprised because this
is<00:00:53.430> flash<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.780> he<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.199> kind<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.770> wouldn't

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is flash and he is kind of I wouldn't

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.380 
is flash and he is kind of I wouldn't
call<00:00:56.309> him<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.640> return<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> don't

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
call him an all return because I don't

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.849 
call him an all return because I don't
think<00:00:57.539> he's<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.899> creative<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.440> his<00:00:58.590> cheese

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
think he's as creative with his cheese

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.549 
think he's as creative with his cheese
but<00:00:59.190> uh<00:00:59.219> definitely<00:01:00.210> more<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.289> cheese

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
but uh definitely more of a cheese

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.020 
but uh definitely more of a cheese
player<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> interestingly<00:01:02.370> enough<00:01:02.820> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
player and interestingly enough I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.340 
player and interestingly enough I
wouldn't<00:01:03.270> even<00:01:03.359> call<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.780> proxy<00:01:04.199> that's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
wouldn't even call that a proxy that's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.770 
wouldn't even call that a proxy that's
almost<00:01:04.559> hidden<00:01:04.830> tech<00:01:05.299> he's<00:01:06.299> building<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
almost hidden tech he's building that

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.750 
almost hidden tech he's building that
barracks<00:01:07.110> kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.580> mid

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
barracks kind of out at the the mid

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.570 
barracks kind of out at the the mid
location<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.540> ramp<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.830> surprised

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
location on that ramp and I'm surprised

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.830 
location on that ramp and I'm surprised
that<00:01:11.790> he's<00:01:11.880> doing<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.299> we'll<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.810> if

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that he's doing that and we'll see if

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
that he's doing that and we'll see if
Savior<00:01:13.229> basically<00:01:13.680> goes<00:01:13.830> 12<00:01:14.159> pool<00:01:14.369> or<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.729> he

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
Savior basically goes 12 pool or if he

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.450 
Savior basically goes 12 pool or if he
goes<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.390> hatchery<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:17.040> standard

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
goes for that hatchery pretty standard

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
goes for that hatchery pretty standard
I've<00:01:17.670> seen<00:01:17.939> Savior<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.689> earlier<00:01:18.960> but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
I've seen Savior go for that earlier but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
I've seen Savior go for that earlier but
really<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> think<00:01:20.189> he<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
really I think he is going for that

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.399 
really I think he is going for that
early<00:01:21.360> pool<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.259> difficult

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
early pool so it's going to be difficult

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.050 
early pool so it's going to be difficult
for<00:01:22.650> flash<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> pull<00:01:23.250> anything<00:01:23.460> out<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
for flash and pull anything out here I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.060 
for flash and pull anything out here I
think<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:24.780> been<00:01:24.960> stronger<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.590> Savior<00:01:25.920> on

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
think that's been stronger for Savior on

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.249 
think that's been stronger for Savior on
this<00:01:26.250> map<00:01:26.430> being<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.330> zerglings<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.020> then

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this map being going zerglings and then

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.010 
this map being going zerglings and then
later<00:01:28.470> directly<00:01:28.979> into<00:01:29.820> muta<00:01:30.060> lists<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.540> when

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
later directly into muta lists and when

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.390 
later directly into muta lists and when
he's<00:01:31.140> been<00:01:31.350> doing<00:01:31.500> Wow<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.250> very

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
he's been doing Wow going for very

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.830 
he's been doing Wow going for very
actually<00:01:33.030> no<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.329> looks<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.600> he<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.810> just

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
actually no it looks like he was just

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.719 
actually no it looks like he was just
doing<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.860> extractor<00:01:35.340> trick<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> get

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
doing that extractor trick to get

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
doing that extractor trick to get
another<00:01:35.939> drone<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.659> thought<00:01:37.170> he<00:01:37.229> was<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
another drone I thought he was going to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
another drone I thought he was going to
basically<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> gas<00:01:38.340> down<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.270> go

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
basically get the gas down and not go go

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.469 
basically get the gas down and not go go
kind<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> heavy<00:01:40.710> zerglings<00:01:41.360> instead<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
kind of heavy zerglings instead just

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.730 
kind of heavy zerglings instead just
kind<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> doing<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.930> extractor<00:01:43.409> trick<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
kind of doing that extractor trick and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
kind of doing that extractor trick and
I'm<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:43.920> even<00:01:44.100> sure<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I'm not even sure if that's out of the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.080 
I'm not even sure if that's out of the
range<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.020> Overlord<00:01:46.409> maybe<00:01:47.310> we'll<00:01:47.880> see

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
range of that Overlord maybe we'll see

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.249 
range of that Overlord maybe we'll see
and<00:01:48.270> maybe<00:01:48.390> flash<00:01:48.659> was<00:01:48.840> counting<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and maybe flash was counting on that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.899 
and maybe flash was counting on that
Overlord<00:01:49.649> being<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.310> position<00:01:50.490> as

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
Overlord being right at that position as

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.850 
Overlord being right at that position as
that<00:01:51.119> barracks<00:01:51.479> went<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.470> produce<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that barracks went up to produce a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.260 
that barracks went up to produce a
marine<00:01:53.100> basically<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.579> catch<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.790> Overlord

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
marine basically and catch that Overlord

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.850 
marine basically and catch that Overlord
and<00:01:54.390> kill<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:54.990> we'll<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and kill it and we'll see here that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.469 
and kill it and we'll see here that
would<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.399> clever<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.060> was<00:01:57.270> his

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
would be very clever if that was his

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.630 
would be very clever if that was his
plan<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> admit<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:59.070> really

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
plan and I have to admit that's really

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.399 
plan and I have to admit that's really
really<00:01:59.969> creative<00:02:00.509> we'll<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.320> though

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
really creative we'll see here though

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.090 
really creative we'll see here though
because<00:02:01.469> they're<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.950> some

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
because they're going to be some

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.649 
because they're going to be some
zerglings<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.610> even<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.420> looks<00:02:03.600> like

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
zerglings so even if it looks like

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.359 
zerglings so even if it looks like
Savior<00:02:04.049> has<00:02:04.229> spotted<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:04.890> he's<00:02:05.070> moving

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
Savior has spotted that out he's moving

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.680 
Savior has spotted that out he's moving
his<00:02:05.430> Overlord<00:02:05.850> away<00:02:06.750> from<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.049> barracks

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
his Overlord away from that barracks

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.109 
his Overlord away from that barracks
so<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.590> has<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.100> second<00:02:09.430> overlord<00:02:09.760> out<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.030> now

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
so and has a second overlord out and now

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.940 
so and has a second overlord out and now
six<00:02:10.360> servings<00:02:10.630> gun<00:02:10.900> are<00:02:11.320> going<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.860> be

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
six servings gun are going to be

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.900 
six servings gun are going to be
produced<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.400> that's<00:02:12.550> going<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.700> be<00:02:12.790> very

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
produced and that's going to be very

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.060 
produced and that's going to be very
dangerous<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:14.200> my<00:02:14.380> opinion<00:02:14.590> for<00:02:14.860> flash

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
dangerous in my opinion for flash

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.290 
dangerous in my opinion for flash
because<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.520> don't<00:02:15.670> know<00:02:15.760> if<00:02:15.880> he's<00:02:16.090> going<00:02:16.210> to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
because I don't know if he's going to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.000 
because I don't know if he's going to
have<00:02:16.390> first<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.750> all<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.350> barracks<00:02:17.680> not<00:02:17.830> very

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
have first of all that barracks not very

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.350 
have first of all that barracks not very
protected<00:02:18.400> here<00:02:18.640> he's<00:02:18.790> going<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.060> see<00:02:19.180> those

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
protected here he's going to see those

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.360 
protected here he's going to see those
serling's<00:02:19.780> coming<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.770> think<00:02:20.950> he<00:02:21.190> feels

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
serling's coming and I think he feels

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.040 
serling's coming and I think he feels
like<00:02:21.610> screwed<00:02:22.090> at<00:02:22.210> this<00:02:22.300> point<00:02:22.570> he<00:02:22.690> does<00:02:22.870> have

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
like screwed at this point he does have

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.500 
like screwed at this point he does have
two<00:02:23.260> Marines<00:02:23.560> out<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:24.910> even<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.240> he<00:02:25.360> manages

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
two Marines out but even if he manages

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.240 
two Marines out but even if he manages
yeah<00:02:25.960> he's<00:02:26.110> going<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.290> pull<00:02:26.620> them<00:02:26.740> back<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.100> his

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
yeah he's going to pull them back to his

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.950 
yeah he's going to pull them back to his
base<00:02:27.430> but<00:02:28.030> even<00:02:28.120> if<00:02:28.240> he<00:02:28.330> does<00:02:28.510> pull<00:02:28.660> them<00:02:28.810> back

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
base but even if he does pull them back

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.150 
base but even if he does pull them back
to<00:02:29.110> his<00:02:29.200> base<00:02:29.380> he's<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.770> have<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.920> steal

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
to his base he's going to have to steal

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.680 
to his base he's going to have to steal
his<00:02:30.250> front<00:02:30.490> door<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.450> going<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.600> be

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
his front door and it's going to be

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.120 
his front door and it's going to be
difficult<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.140> see<00:02:32.260> his<00:02:32.440> front<00:02:32.650> door<00:02:32.830> and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
difficult to see his front door and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.520 
difficult to see his front door and
produce<00:02:33.430> Marines<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:35.050> basically<00:02:35.170> do

produce Marines and and basically do
everything<00:02:35.620> he<00:02:35.890> needs<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.100> do<00:02:36.250> lifting<00:02:36.580> off

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
everything he needs to do lifting off

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.830 
everything he needs to do lifting off
that<00:02:36.850> barracks<00:02:37.120> he<00:02:37.240> has<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.420> barracks<00:02:37.750> in

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
that barracks he has that barracks in

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.510 
that barracks he has that barracks in
that<00:02:37.960> oh<00:02:37.990> word<00:02:38.230> vulnerable<00:02:38.620> position<00:02:39.070> and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
that oh word vulnerable position and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.130 
that oh word vulnerable position and
here<00:02:39.670> come<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.880> zerglings<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:41.020> the

pulling<00:02:49.510> zerglings<00:02:49.990> into<00:02:50.200> his<00:02:50.320> base<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.910> flash

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
pulling zerglings into his base so flash

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.850 
pulling zerglings into his base so flash
get<00:02:52.210> really<00:02:52.690> paying<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.230> price<00:02:53.440> for<00:02:53.500> doing

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
get really paying the price for doing

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.440 
get really paying the price for doing
some<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.400> basically<00:02:54.730> going<00:02:55.060> early

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
some of that basically going early

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.660 
some of that basically going early
cheese<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:56.470> blue<00:02:56.740> storm<00:02:56.980> instead<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.430> going

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
cheese on blue storm instead of going

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.190 
cheese on blue storm instead of going
through<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.270> middle<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:58.990> looks<00:02:59.140> like

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
through that middle and it looks like

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.920 
through that middle and it looks like
Savior<00:02:59.620> going<00:03:00.430> through<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.700> top<00:03:00.940> lane<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:01.450> it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
Savior going through that top lane so it

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.360 
Savior going through that top lane so it
looks<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.140> an<00:03:02.290> engineering<00:03:02.620> Bay<00:03:02.800> down<00:03:03.010> so

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
looks like an engineering Bay down so

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.090 
looks like an engineering Bay down so
that<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.630> looks<00:03:05.320> like<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.800> blocked

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
that is that looks like that is blocked

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.230 
that is that looks like that is blocked
so<00:03:06.190> Savior<00:03:06.580> he's<00:03:06.700> going<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.880> have<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.030> pull

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
so Savior he's going to have to pull

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.940 
so Savior he's going to have to pull
those<00:03:07.390> Earthlings<00:03:07.570> back<00:03:07.990> but<00:03:08.770> in<00:03:08.860> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
those Earthlings back but in the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.440 
those Earthlings back but in the
meantime<00:03:09.130> denying<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.700> secondary<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.240> flash

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
meantime denying that secondary to flash

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.510 
meantime denying that secondary to flash
flash<00:03:10.750> not<00:03:10.960> producing<00:03:11.320> any<00:03:11.500> forces<00:03:11.830> that's

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
flash not producing any forces that's

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.740 
flash not producing any forces that's
going<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.730> allow<00:03:12.790> Savior<00:03:13.180> basically<00:03:13.570> to

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
going to allow Savior basically to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.320 
going to allow Savior basically to
either<00:03:14.230> expand<00:03:14.739> or<00:03:14.980> tech<00:03:15.250> up<00:03:15.459> meantime<00:03:16.209> he's

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
either expand or tech up meantime he's

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.520 
either expand or tech up meantime he's
going<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.510> bring<00:03:16.630> some<00:03:16.840> more<00:03:16.959> zerglings<00:03:17.320> down

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
going to bring some more zerglings down

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.260 
going to bring some more zerglings down
it<00:03:17.739> looks<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.070> spring<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.430> drone<00:03:18.670> down<00:03:18.820> too<00:03:19.090> so

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
it looks like spring a drone down too so

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.910 
it looks like spring a drone down too so
maybe<00:03:19.360> he's<00:03:19.540> going<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.720> plan<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> hatchery<00:03:20.170> no

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
maybe he's going to plan a hatchery no

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.320 
maybe he's going to plan a hatchery no
he's<00:03:21.040> going<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.250> go<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:21.550> that<00:03:21.580> it<00:03:22.120> looks<00:03:22.270> like

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
he's going to go for that it looks like

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.460 
he's going to go for that it looks like
he's<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.660> going<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.900> plan<00:03:23.020> his<00:03:23.170> second

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
he's just going to plan his second

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.710 
he's just going to plan his second
hatchery<00:03:23.830> at<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.610> national<00:03:25.239> expansion<00:03:25.450> and

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
hatchery at that national expansion and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.110 
hatchery at that national expansion and
I'm<00:03:25.780> surprised<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.290> flash<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:27.120> basically

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
I'm surprised that flash on basically

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.940 
I'm surprised that flash on basically
considering<00:03:28.930> saviors<00:03:29.260> prior<00:03:29.470> behavior<00:03:29.650> on

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
considering saviors prior behavior on

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.260 
considering saviors prior behavior on
this<00:03:30.100> bathroom<00:03:30.400> surprise<00:03:30.670> flash<00:03:30.940> did<00:03:31.150> that

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
this bathroom surprise flash did that

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.600 
this bathroom surprise flash did that
maybe<00:03:31.480> he<00:03:31.660> wasn't<00:03:31.870> expecting<00:03:32.440> Savior<00:03:32.739> kind<00:03:33.550> of

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
maybe he wasn't expecting Savior kind of

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.340 
maybe he wasn't expecting Savior kind of
back<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.790> those<00:03:33.940> mind<00:03:34.180> matches<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.690> try<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.170> do

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
back to those mind matches to try to do

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.320 
back to those mind matches to try to do
something<00:03:35.560> like<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:35.950> in<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> meantime<00:03:36.970> I

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
something like this in the meantime I

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.090 
something like this in the meantime I
Savior<00:03:37.750> scouting<00:03:38.170> out<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.440> s<00:03:38.530> TVO's<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:39.040> the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
Savior scouting out that s TVO's in the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.430 
Savior scouting out that s TVO's in the
bottom<00:03:39.310> right-hand<00:03:39.459> corner<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:40.000> think<00:03:40.480> flash

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
bottom right-hand corner I think flash

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.930 
bottom right-hand corner I think flash
still<00:03:41.739> trying<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.040> dedicate<00:03:42.430> some<00:03:42.700> cheese

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
still trying to dedicate some cheese

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.120 
still trying to dedicate some cheese
still<00:03:43.209> trying<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.450> get<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.600> barracks<00:03:43.930> out

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
still trying to get a barracks out

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.229 
still trying to get a barracks out
basically<00:03:45.130> we're<00:03:45.310> Savior<00:03:45.580> didn't<00:03:45.850> see<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.090> but

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
basically we're Savior didn't see it but

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.170 
basically we're Savior didn't see it but
that<00:03:46.420> being<00:03:46.660> spotted<00:03:47.019> out<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:48.040> really<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> it

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
that being spotted out and really a it

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.280 
that being spotted out and really a it
doesn't<00:03:49.480> look<00:03:49.510> like<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.870> engineering-based

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
doesn't look like that engineering-based

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.570 
doesn't look like that engineering-based
finish<00:03:50.680> doesn't<00:03:50.920> look<00:03:51.010> like<00:03:51.130> it's<00:03:51.280> producing

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
finish doesn't look like it's producing

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.860 
finish doesn't look like it's producing
any<00:03:51.760> Marines<00:03:52.000> going<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.209> get<00:03:52.300> a<00:03:52.330> factory<00:03:52.750> up

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
any Marines going to get a factory up

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.120 
any Marines going to get a factory up
and<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.110> think<00:03:53.290> what<00:03:53.410> he's<00:03:53.500> contrite<00:03:53.800> ooh<00:03:53.860> do<00:03:54.010> is

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
and I think what he's contrite ooh do is

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.320 
and I think what he's contrite ooh do is
going<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.370> try<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.580> build<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.910> factory

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
going to try to build that factory

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.810 
going to try to build that factory
floated<00:03:56.170> over<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.739> produce<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.220> vulture<00:03:57.580> and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
floated over and produce a vulture and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.150 
floated over and produce a vulture and
then<00:03:57.970> send<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.360> back<00:03:58.510> side<00:03:58.720> into<00:03:59.160> saviors

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
then send that back side into saviors

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.979 
then send that back side into saviors
base<00:04:00.370> really<00:04:00.790> flash<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.300> guess<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.870> doesn't

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
base really flash I guess it doesn't

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.509 
base really flash I guess it doesn't
feel<00:04:02.170> like<00:04:02.320> he<00:04:02.470> can<00:04:02.560> play<00:04:02.709> Savior<00:04:03.100> straight<00:04:03.370> up

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
feel like he can play Savior straight up

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.729 
feel like he can play Savior straight up
but<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.150> knowing<00:04:04.810> saviors<00:04:05.170> behavior<00:04:05.530> looks

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
but a knowing saviors behavior looks

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.780 
but a knowing saviors behavior looks
like<00:04:05.890> he's<00:04:06.010> going<00:04:06.160> for<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.400> triple<00:04:06.670> hatch

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
like he's going for a triple hatch

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.270 
like he's going for a triple hatch
actually<00:04:07.500> but<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.560> wouldn't<00:04:08.769> be<00:04:08.830> surprised<00:04:09.160> if

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
actually but I wouldn't be surprised if

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.400
