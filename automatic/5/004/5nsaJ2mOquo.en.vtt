00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.330
 I'm capois I'm 26 years old and I started 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.970
 play out strategy in the little one 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.439
 from 14 with competitive form and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.529
 At the moment I am Juan downloads the 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.390

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.520
 beta and I'm currently playing the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.250
 expansion of highlights that came out this 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.410
 year my favorite race are the protoss and 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.660
 the reality is that I chose them because I 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.239
 they like the technologies that they have and I 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.730
 like the aggressive way in which one 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.469
 can play with that I am a player 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.510
 professional since I started competing 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.089
 with downloads 2 even though 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.570
 I have previously traveled and competed for 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.210
 other games 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.570
 and well , I started to deliver several 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.250
 teams and I started taking the game in 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.570
 more technical form and method of 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 training consists in playing 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.790
 approximately 23 hours per day and 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.400
 also try to study possible 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.990
 rivals that have events besides seeing 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.420
 repetitions of the best players 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.660
 of the world especially products like the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.580
 old kingdom parents support me in my 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.340
 gamer race and they are very happy 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.650
 when I tell them that they have gone to some 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.230
 event or that I'm going to travel to compete 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.240
 outside 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.730
 and good the reality is that it is very 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.850
 good to follow me in all this is 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.830
 worry about me you care how 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.920
 is progressing 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.660
 the race thanks to winning tournaments I had 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.730
 the opportunity to travel to different 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.380
 places in the world and know countries like 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:44.140
 china china france france among others and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.510
 I also had the opportunity to generate 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.630
 different friendships with other players 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.730
 gamers know the different cultures of 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.140
 these countries and in this way enrich 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.450
 my personal life 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.010
 also my career as we saw inside 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.409
 Latin American players I 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.390
 I consider to have a high level despite 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.060
 that there is increasing competition in the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.490
 region and increasingly appear 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.310
 number of new players with a lot 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.530
 skill that generate greater difficulty 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.120
 to win events 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.400
 nowadays I see how the scene 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.860
 competitiveness of the 6% Latin America has 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.989
 grown noticeably with respect to days 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.360
 previous despite this I would like 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.520
 that there are more events in the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.680
 region I am currently finishing the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.230
 career in business administration and 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.840
 always tried to manage my time the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.900
 better way to meet the objectives 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.000
 that I have in both races to improve 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.640
