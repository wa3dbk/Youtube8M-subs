computer and go properties and then open

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.320 
computer and go properties and then open
up<00:00:09.900> hardware<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.769> device<00:00:11.130> manager<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:12.120> is

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
up hardware and device manager this is

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.020 
up hardware and device manager this is
where<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:13.769> device<00:00:14.130> manager<00:00:14.400> lives<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.880> here

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
where the device manager lives in here

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
where the device manager lives in here
as<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.330> see<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.900> pretty<00:00:16.230> basic<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:16.800> most

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
as you see it's pretty basic but most

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310 
as you see it's pretty basic but most
technicians<00:00:17.760> come<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.390> find<00:00:18.660> any<00:00:18.930> driver

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
technicians come here to find any driver

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.830 
technicians come here to find any driver
issues<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.010> stuff<00:00:20.160> like<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.300> problems

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
issues and stuff like that and problems

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.410 
issues and stuff like that and problems
were<00:00:21.990> there<00:00:22.170> any<00:00:22.470> devices<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.269> pretty

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
were there any devices so it's pretty

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.120 
were there any devices so it's pretty
limited<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.050> limited<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.010> can

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
limited to what limited to what you can

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.400

you another piece of kit that you can

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.530 
you another piece of kit that you can
actually<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:32.460> far<00:00:32.730> superior<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.270> this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
actually use that's far superior to this

remover it works with Windows 2000 XP

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
remover it works with Windows 2000 XP
Vista<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.840> Windows<00:00:57.899> 7<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.190> are

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
Vista and Windows 7 now if you are

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.939

running<00:00:59.489> XP<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.390> 2000<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> will<00:01:01.590> need<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
running XP and 2000 you will need to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.370 
running XP and 2000 you will need to
install<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.520> microsoft.net<00:01:03.510> framework<00:01:04.220> 2.0

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
install the microsoft.net framework 2.0

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.700 
install the microsoft.net framework 2.0
plus<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.880> works<00:01:09.290> Windows<00:01:10.290> Vista<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
plus so it works Windows Vista and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
plus so it works Windows Vista and
Windows<00:01:10.890> 7<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.520> only<00:01:11.670> got<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.030> installed

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
Windows 7 have only got that installed

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
Windows 7 have only got that installed
so<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.570> won't<00:01:12.780> need<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> worry<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.530> he

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so you won't need to worry about that he

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.880 
so you won't need to worry about that he
also<00:01:14.400> works<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.000> 32-bit<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.780> 64-bit

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
also works with 32-bit and 64-bit

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.499 
also works with 32-bit and 64-bit
operating<00:01:16.890> systems<00:01:17.310> ok<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.180> let's<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
operating systems ok so let's have a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.100 
operating systems ok so let's have a
look<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> actual<00:01:19.229> application<00:01:19.799> itself

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
look at the actual application itself

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.960 
look at the actual application itself
I've<00:01:22.110> already<00:01:22.350> installed<00:01:22.650> mine<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I've already installed mine so as you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.010 
I've already installed mine so as you
can<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> actual<00:01:24.840> application

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
can see this is the actual application

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.760 
can see this is the actual application
here<00:01:26.900> they<00:01:27.900> were<00:01:27.990> looking<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> device

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
here they were looking at the device

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
here they were looking at the device
tree<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.340> which<00:01:29.520> looks<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:29.850> similar<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
tree here which looks pretty similar to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.910 
tree here which looks pretty similar to
the<00:01:31.350> Windows<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:33.420> Windows<00:01:33.750> version<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.799> we

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the Windows the Windows version so if we

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.280 
the Windows the Windows version so if we
look<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.280> say<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.729> instance<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.240> floppy<00:01:36.540> disk

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
look at say for instance the floppy disk

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
look at say for instance the floppy disk
controllers<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.850> right-click<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
controllers and I right-click on this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.140 
controllers and I right-click on this
it's<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> give<00:01:40.860> us<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> same<00:01:41.460> similar

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's going to give us the same similar

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.730 
it's going to give us the same similar
information<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.409> here

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
information but as you can see here

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.370 
information but as you can see here
we've<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:43.860> device<00:01:44.430> registry<00:01:45.390> data<00:01:45.750> details

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
we've got device registry data details

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.440 
we've got device registry data details
so<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.250> click<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.060> will<00:01:48.299> actually

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so if I click on this we will actually

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.069 
so if I click on this we will actually
open<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:50.399> actual<00:01:50.759> panel<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
open up the actual panel here and you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.410 
open up the actual panel here and you
can<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> registry<00:01:53.280> hive<00:01:53.549> key

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
can actually see the registry hive key

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.770 
can actually see the registry hive key
path<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.920> actual<00:01:56.250> controller<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
path for the actual controller and that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.300 
path for the actual controller and that
takes<00:01:58.079> us<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.560> registry<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> can

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
takes us into the registry now I can

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
takes us into the registry now I can
actually<00:01:59.750> print<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.960> information<00:02:01.290> if<00:02:01.799> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
actually print this information if I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
actually print this information if I
wanted<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.310> export<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.030> information<00:02:03.240> or

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
wanted to export this information or

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
wanted to export this information or
open<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> key<00:02:04.740> narrow<00:02:05.130> open<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> key<00:02:05.700> this

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
open the key narrow open the key this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.680 
open the key narrow open the key this
will<00:02:06.060> open<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.860> location<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
will open up the location of that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.910 
will open up the location of that
controller

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920

so<00:02:10.130> as<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:10.490> see<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.700> was<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.120> registry<00:02:11.540> up

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
so as you can see I was the registry up

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.199 
so as you can see I was the registry up
and<00:02:11.930> there<00:02:12.230> we<00:02:12.349> go<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:13.610> it's<00:02:13.730> pretty<00:02:13.880> useful

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
and there we go so it's pretty useful

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.040 
and there we go so it's pretty useful
for<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.900> let's<00:02:15.709> got<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> few<00:02:16.160> other<00:02:16.280> tabs<00:02:16.520> here

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
for that let's got a few other tabs here

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.500 
for that let's got a few other tabs here
device<00:02:18.050> lists<00:02:18.880> therefore<00:02:19.880> click<00:02:20.060> on<00:02:20.209> device

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
device lists therefore click on device

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.870 
device lists therefore click on device
list<00:02:20.810> if<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.560> hover<00:02:21.770> over<00:02:21.980> these<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.489> can<00:02:22.640> see<00:02:22.849> a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
list if I hover over these you can see a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.580 
list if I hover over these you can see a
big<00:02:23.180> yellow<00:02:23.360> box<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.840> comes<00:02:24.170> up<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.530> it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
big yellow box that comes up and it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.870 
big yellow box that comes up and it
gives<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.920> all<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.099> information<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.670> you

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
gives you all the information that you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.729 
gives you all the information that you
may<00:02:26.060> need

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
may need

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.380 
may need
ok<00:02:27.739> now<00:02:28.069> I'm<00:02:28.370> only<00:02:28.580> gonna<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:28.880> scratching

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
ok now I'm only gonna be scratching

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.880 
ok now I'm only gonna be scratching
along<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.690> surface<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.410> program

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
along the surface of this program

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.040 
along the surface of this program
because<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.520> quite<00:02:31.940> large<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.750> don't

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
because it is quite large and I don't

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.270 
because it is quite large and I don't
think<00:02:33.260> I'll<00:02:33.380> have<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.530> time<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.980> cover<00:02:34.130> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
think I'll have the time to cover the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.850 
think I'll have the time to cover the
whole<00:02:34.660> lot<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.750> information<00:02:36.019> but<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.680> come

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
whole lot of information but if you come

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.820 
whole lot of information but if you come
over<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.220> right-hand<00:02:37.400> side<00:02:37.580> here<00:02:38.800> you<00:02:39.800> can

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
over to the right-hand side here you can

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.309 
over to the right-hand side here you can
see<00:02:39.980> copy<00:02:40.489> or<00:02:40.760> copy<00:02:41.450> selected<00:02:41.599> you<00:02:42.200> can

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
see copy or copy selected you can

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.550 
see copy or copy selected you can
actually<00:02:42.470> copy<00:02:42.800> information<00:02:43.090> ok<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:45.319> that's

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
actually copy information ok so that's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.410 
actually copy information ok so that's
and<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:46.069> can<00:02:46.220> actually<00:02:46.370> remove<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.390> can

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
and you can actually remove you can

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.229 
and you can actually remove you can
actually<00:02:47.720> remove<00:02:48.140> selected<00:02:48.670> as<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.940> can<00:02:50.060> see

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
actually remove selected as you can see

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.630 
actually remove selected as you can see
so<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.410> do<00:02:51.709> get<00:02:51.980> quite<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.310> lot<00:02:52.610> of

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
so you can you do get quite a lot of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.520 
so you can you do get quite a lot of
information<00:02:52.940> here<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.750> you've<00:02:53.870> gotten<00:02:54.170> also

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
information here and you've gotten also

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.380 
information here and you've gotten also
a<00:02:54.560> command<00:02:55.010> line<00:02:55.400> that's<00:02:55.670> down<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.060> bottom

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
a command line that's down the bottom

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.449 
a command line that's down the bottom
here<00:02:56.420> which<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.380> can<00:02:57.530> actually<00:02:57.680> use<00:02:57.860> as<00:02:58.220> well

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
here which you can actually use as well

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.080 
here which you can actually use as well
it's<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.269> run<00:02:59.510> command<00:02:59.989> line<00:03:00.260> ok<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.910> that's

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
it's a run command line ok so that's

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.550 
it's a run command line ok so that's
actually<00:03:02.299> move<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.080> next<00:03:03.290> tab<00:03:03.530> is

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
actually move on to the next tab is

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.009 
actually move on to the next tab is
called<00:03:03.799> drivers<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.400> services<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.090> as<00:03:05.840> you

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
called drivers and services and as you

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.470 
called drivers and services and as you
can<00:03:06.080> see<00:03:06.250> again<00:03:07.250> loads<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.090> useful

can actually right click on here save

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.159 
can actually right click on here save
information<00:04:16.060> kill<00:04:17.060> process<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.109> can

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
information kill process so you can

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.520 
information kill process so you can
actually<00:04:18.530> kill<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.890> process<00:04:19.370> okay

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
actually kill the process okay

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
actually kill the process okay
so<00:04:21.040> that's<00:04:21.250> very<00:04:21.340> useful<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.860> as<00:04:24.130> you<00:04:24.250> can<00:04:24.340> see

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
so that's very useful and as you can see

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.970 
so that's very useful and as you can see
a<00:04:24.580> lot<00:04:24.790> more<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:25.030> debugging<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:26.290> can<00:04:26.470> do<00:04:26.650> loads

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
a lot more of debugging you can do loads

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.660 
a lot more of debugging you can do loads
of<00:04:27.190> other<00:04:27.340> stuff<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:28.090> this<00:04:28.360> area<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.460> let's

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
of other stuff in this area so let's

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.340 
of other stuff in this area so let's
have<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:30.880> look<00:04:31.030> what<00:04:31.180> else<00:04:31.390> we<00:04:31.630> can<00:04:31.810> find<00:04:31.840> on

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
have a look what else we can find on

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.230 
have a look what else we can find on
this<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.980> as<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.250> can<00:04:33.310> see<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.520> process<00:04:34.000> and

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
this and as you can see a process and

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.360 
this and as you can see a process and
service<00:04:34.450> on<00:04:34.750> sort<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.020> right<00:04:35.230> here<00:04:35.560> lets<00:04:36.220> you

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
service on sort of right here lets you

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.000 
service on sort of right here lets you
flick<00:04:36.640> between<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.270> two<00:04:37.650> so<00:04:38.650> let's<00:04:38.830> have<00:04:38.950> a

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
flick between the two so let's have a

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.360 
flick between the two so let's have a
look<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.820> voice<00:04:40.000> events<00:04:40.770> so<00:04:41.770> if<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.950> put<00:04:42.190> the

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
look the voice events so if I put the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.870 
look the voice events so if I put the
device<00:04:42.880> events<00:04:43.390> up<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.990> click<00:04:44.590> on<00:04:44.800> this<00:04:45.040> it

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
device events up and click on this it

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.930 
device events up and click on this it
gives<00:04:46.060> me<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.390> device<00:04:46.720> events<00:04:47.320> okay<00:04:47.980> which<00:04:48.790> is

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
gives me the device events okay which is

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.750 
gives me the device events okay which is
very<00:04:49.180> useful<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.720> can<00:04:49.870> save<00:04:50.140> this<00:04:50.760> events

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
very useful and you can save this events

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.110 
very useful and you can save this events
list<00:04:51.970> okay<00:04:52.390> I'll<00:04:52.690> clear<00:04:53.080> it

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
list okay I'll clear it

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.010 
list okay I'll clear it
we've<00:04:55.120> also<00:04:55.330> got<00:04:55.919> print<00:04:56.919> process<00:04:57.220> list<00:04:58.020> we've

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
we've also got print process list we've

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.130 
we've also got print process list we've
also<00:04:59.230> got<00:04:59.530> search<00:04:59.800> for<00:05:00.280> devices<00:05:00.900> search<00:05:01.900> for

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
also got search for devices search for

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.460 
also got search for devices search for
the<00:05:02.290> service<00:05:03.160> device<00:05:03.720> drivers<00:05:04.720> have<00:05:05.320> also

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
the service device drivers have also

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.120 
the service device drivers have also
reload<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.390> display<00:05:07.390> mode

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
reload and display mode

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.920 
reload and display mode
so<00:05:09.130> we've<00:05:09.550> if<00:05:09.850> we<00:05:10.000> come<00:05:10.180> up<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.540> top<00:05:10.780> here

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
so we've if we come up to the top here

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.920 
so we've if we come up to the top here
file<00:05:11.400> as<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.580> can<00:05:12.669> see<00:05:12.850> here<00:05:13.240> we've<00:05:13.720> got<00:05:13.870> a

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
file as you can see here we've got a

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.200 
file as you can see here we've got a
pretty<00:05:14.169> much<00:05:14.470> same<00:05:15.250> that's<00:05:15.490> down<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:15.910> bottom

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
pretty much same that's down the bottom

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.810 
pretty much same that's down the bottom
there<00:05:16.419> really<00:05:16.660> it's<00:05:17.380> just<00:05:17.620> another<00:05:17.890> area<00:05:18.430> so

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
there really it's just another area so

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.490 
there really it's just another area so
let's<00:05:19.030> have<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.180> look<00:05:19.330> at<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.570> application

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
let's have a look at the application

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.670 
let's have a look at the application
as<00:05:20.980> you<00:05:21.220> can<00:05:21.280> see<00:05:21.490> applications<00:05:22.390> you've<00:05:23.380> got<00:05:23.650> a

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
as you can see applications you've got a

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.940 
as you can see applications you've got a
load<00:05:23.980> of<00:05:24.010> useful<00:05:24.550> bits<00:05:24.790> here<00:05:25.950> force

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
load of useful bits here force

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.620 
load of useful bits here force

application termination translate error
codes<00:05:31.930> which<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:33.040> quite<00:05:33.400> useful<00:05:34.000> also<00:05:34.870> for

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
codes which is quite useful also for
