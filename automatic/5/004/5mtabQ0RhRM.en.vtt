00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.900
 hello very good I come to add you a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.270
 variant 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.770
 to the game of the sixth sense I guess that 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.300
 you remember this if you have a game 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.120
 spent on promotion for a few days 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.660
 de cali trick a game that I showed you his 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.140
 revelation a few days ago in me gal in 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.140
 the p 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.739
 or samper in the summary consists of 28 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:31.310
 letters I think remembered are 28 up to 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:33.260
 a repetition of cards 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.450
 I do not know if you're in order now 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.160
 I do not remember what the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.360
 hearts to 62 are not ordered in my 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.949
 now our tidy deck 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.090
 good men a sequence of seven 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:50.030
 letters x 4 when they total 28 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.040
 four buttons are made obviously not 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 appreciates to the public the repetition of 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.860
 cards ends by choosing a lot after 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.430
 a mixture using the principle of 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.379
 gilbert the order is not modified if 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.210
 the placement but not the order in each 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.630
 one of the heaps say that in each 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.119
 one of the seven same letters and that 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:20.090
 way 1 2 3 4 5 6 next is not 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:25.070
 both in 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 now these are 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.600
 the 7 cards that repeat in my deck 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.190
 therefore when the viewer 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.810
 end by choosing one of the piles and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.970
 he has the seven cards and the magician proceeds 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.030
 to 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.299
 to reveal them 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.369
 by mentalism power that happens if not 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.900
 do you like the mentalism method is to say 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.640
 that the mere fact of having to 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.290
 name them the viewer observes them and 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.110
 while the dale then the magician leaves 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.840
 naming good so we can make another 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.600
 totally different method 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.130
 prediction may like more how 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.240
 carry out prediction method for 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.460
 have a convenient full hit by 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.259
 example first that a deck 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.880
 be of one color in the other be of another and 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.880
 this is the circumstance that is a 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.649
 Beveled deck for salty javi like 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.010
 well you know the one who does not know it also gives 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.440
 a small summary is one that the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.250
 width of the letters on one of their sides 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.560
 is wider than the other is that the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.470
 amount that you turn around this one 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.620
 excels by the other stones we have 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.319
 controlled we will take a 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.690
 caravel bevelled if you already have it 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.920
 you can make use of it if you do not 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.800
 I recommend man is one be 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.500
 economic or basic 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.350
 those found in mexico well then here 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.580
 we look for the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.580
 more than hearts 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.370
 49 on 9 diamonds 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.390
 to see that I love her but all at once 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.920
 I messed up how it was carried out 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.920
 directly if you already control 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.569
 j 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.569
 two 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.960
 6 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.960
 between 10 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.420
 of errors 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.840
 the project of the past I have not seen the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.730
 plus 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.950
 again , it had happened to me 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.600
 the 10 of spades 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.470
 and the range of 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.470
 shamrocks 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.490
 I see less 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.170
 perfect to look for many letters to the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.170
 time 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.800
 Well, these letters are inserted 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.150
 on the opposite side giving them a half turn 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.890
 by any point in the deck 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.600
 exactly the same and without any 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.770
 inconvenience without any kind of 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.420
 problems are delivered to a 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.420
 spectator the deck 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.320
 so that the mixture 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.620
 they all stand out as I say for a 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:13.490
 cost so the public can 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.490
 proceed with all I have just 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.090
 once mixed by the public you 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.340
 You can make a series of cuts in 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.080
 those that 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.710
 clearly 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.069
 you can it becomes difficult to work with 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.490
 an injured finger fernando you can 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:37.860
 take you after and after mixing 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.650
 made by the public can take you 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.189
 calmly the 7 letters to the 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.389
 top and without any doubt 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.389
 keep them in control 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.380
 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 and then they make them 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.280
 appear with this what I want to say then 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.620
 that you control the letters to the party 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.900
 top of the deck after the 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.360
 mixed public tells him he was at 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.100
 public proceeding is the same thing 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.280
 allows me to leave each series of cuts 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.410
 and you cut short short until 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.520
 have the seven cards controlled 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.259
 above the low and tell him I'm going to take 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.830
 seven letters to make a 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.830
 prediction of these 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.440
 1234567 and proceed to tell you let 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.330
 to the rhythm 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.390
 and proceed with the game so that the 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.050
 spectator finished by choosing seven 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.720
 letters of the four engines that 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.700
 perform in the original game all 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.280
 good style well first of all I 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.800
 I would do the personal mode I think the best 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.110
 way stress in the bullet lower classes the 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.680
 red, blue, red, you can adjust it to 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.560
 quietly because it does not contain any 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.230
 nothing strange or a secret is the 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.780
 The secret that it contains is that the 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.090
 sequence but how will it be the second 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.510
 what's going to appear is going to be from a method 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.700
 in a slightly more fleeting way 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.590
 this deck will deliver it to a 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.810
 viewer as I say that the mix you 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.880
 you end up making the cuts you say 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.670
 I'm going to choose seven cards from this 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.830
 shuffle and proceed from the 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.590
 top no problem and the 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.510
 you leave aside and then extract this you 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.630
 you make a fake mix if you wish 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.500
 you make an exhibition I already say must of 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.570
 sorry letters that you will then divide the 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.130
 28 what you need and you're going to tell the 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:41.680
 public that is going to be a spectator who 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:45.270
 choose seven letters of the choose your 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:50.350
 from the other one he chooses them and in this way 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:52.930
 prediction made and completed with 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.850
 total success to disappear the same 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.930
 which the public chose 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.480
 I think it has a show 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.640
 sensational without any doubt I hope that 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.020
 has helped you one more idea 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.050
 that will add 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.350
 to the possible routines that you think that 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.920
 can you? 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.020
 make your audience 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.520
 and enjoy the magic thank you very much 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.520
 and until the next video
