Auckland somehow we came across the
street<00:00:19.949> or<00:00:20.160> something<00:00:20.189> must've<00:00:20.730> showed<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
street or something must've showed it to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.750 
street or something must've showed it to
us<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.800> just<00:00:22.859> go<00:00:23.160> straight<00:00:23.550> up

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
us and it just it's just go straight up

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.140 
us and it just it's just go straight up
why<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:26.160> newly<00:00:26.490> paved<00:00:26.730> roads

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
why that you know the newly paved roads

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.660 
why that you know the newly paved roads
and<00:00:27.539> lack<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.960> houses<00:00:28.590> would<00:00:29.130> provide<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and lack of houses would provide the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
and lack of houses would provide the
cruisers<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> venue<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:30.840> speed<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.710> pure

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
cruisers with a venue for speed so pure

00:00:32.070 --> 00:01:01.619 
cruisers with a venue for speed so pure
that<00:00:32.610> was<00:00:32.910> perfect
