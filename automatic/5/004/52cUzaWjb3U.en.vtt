 Of course, they are pretty 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.350
 interesting let's start first 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.140
 speaking a little about metal gear 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.670

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.500
 and we can take it this way and it's 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.030
 that you already know is a kind of 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.590
 prologue of what is still metal 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.210
 gear solid 5 phantom paint that of 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.829
 moment has no release date nor 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.809
 much less but good let's focus 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.300

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.190

 playstation 4 xbox 360 and xbox one 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.060
 well what I wanted to comment on this 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.880
 case the video you have on the screen is 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.659
 about 6 minutes of video in which 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.119
 they perform 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.159
 an interview with kojima the developer 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.079
 follow one of the great developers 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.539
 of the industry and the loaded to carry 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.280
 out this video game in which in 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.630
 these six minutes gives us a little more 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.250
 of information on the one hand on the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.499
 video game that is about to reach 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.579
 a serious yes so also about phantom 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:32.829
 paint what is already the 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.780
 Official video game of metal gear solid 5 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.069
 so if you are interested then I leave it to you 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.140
 in the description so that you throw him a 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.849
 glance is a Japanese interview 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.319
 but it's subtitled in English so 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.599
 nothing that you have a minimum knowledge 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.459
 of the safe language that you know is very 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:47.200
 simple English that is used and 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.579
 from what is quite interesting the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.810
 interview let's talk now too 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.489
 about another video game that is at 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.709
 around the corner a little bit more 

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:55.179
 late that tomorrow same as the metal 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.099
 gear solid 5 but yes I feel that it is 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.409
 also very close is not about in 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.170
 flames second are the third installment of 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.849
 this saga without small saga of 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.619
 videogames which I wanted 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.060
 comment is a little video a 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.590
 little bit longer than the previous one is 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.109
 For approximately 8 minutes 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.090
 of gameplay in which we can see how 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:15.860
 the protagonist's character unfolds 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.090
 from the point of view 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.340
 You already know that in this good videogame 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.470
 in this saga there has always been the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.290
 possibility of taking different types of 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.210
 moral decisions and accordingly that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.160
 we also have certain powers 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.870
 different and some missions we can 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.970
 face them one way or another 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.220
 well in this case you already know that it is something 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.200
 quite expected the issue of seeing the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.600
 bad missions and good missions 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.420
 fire, here I leave you a bad one 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.950
 about 8 minutes approximately luce 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.990
 pretty good the video game you know 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.150
 As I say it goes on sale on the 21st 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.620
 March for playstation 4 exclusively 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.660
 for this platform it will not get to 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.580
 no other so there will have to be a 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.410
 little bit aware that it has very good 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.610
 paint from my point of view I do not know if 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.110
 would you agree with me 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.120
 let's continue now with another title that does not 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.620
 is not much less so close with 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.900
 our previous two is about 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.150
 someone to isolate a video game that you 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.920
 talk about him a few months ago 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.870
 Not to mention weekdays like a video 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.270
 of this game that I certainly had 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.920
 pretty good looking or at least promised 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.080
 a lot that was supposed to be the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.570
 first video game of which I remember 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.880
 has limited the franchise of someone who 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.980
 I was not going to be the typical generic shooter 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.170
 you kill and in this case it's going to be a 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.940
 survival horror in the end I'll leave you in the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.010
 description the trailer you are watching 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.200
 right now on screen in which in 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.610
 this little video the developers 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.920
 they commented a little more about the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.200
 video game what they want to get to 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.150
 transmit and above all the essence that 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.830
 they care so much about the first movie 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.020
 original of someone who in this case is 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.490
 in what has been inspired precisely 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.380
 this video game of the moment does not have a 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.180
 release date is supposed to 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.860
 will be released later this year but not 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.380
 we know exactly when to 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.030
 playstation 4 xbox one and computer like 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.530
 I say it looks good if we go 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.000
 talking about another video game that 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.010
 he was also expected to come out 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.320
 sale later this year we have to 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.060
 speak in this case of the witcher 3 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.310
 weigand subtitle that was announced by 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.320
 first time in e3 last year if 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.350
 bad I do not remember is the third installment of 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.880
 this well-known role-playing saga 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.410
 if we could call it that way it 's a 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.150
 genre a mixture of genres but 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.430
 honestly, it would not be the most 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.560
 it fits in this case even though 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.720
 officially there had not been any 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.850
 statement that ensures that 100% that was going 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 to leave at the end of this year the truth 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.960
 is that we all had that in mind and that 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.819
 but in the end the developers have 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.830
 confirmed that it is going to delay a 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:34.440
 little they also thought to take it out 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.300
 end of this year but in the end they are going 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.520
 to postpone until the month of February of 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.590
 2015 it 's good to finally give us a month 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.599
 because that means that in principle 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.729
 it's not going to be delayed any longer or much 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.229
 less not the specific day yet but 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.599
 Of course, good, finally we have 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.250
 a more specific date regarding the 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.930
 launch and a pity that delay it 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.240
 but from something that they assure that 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.710
 is to be able to ensure 100% quality 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.870
 of this video game and that is at 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.580
 height than expected so let's wait 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.259
 he falls short as I say the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.940
 expectations of fans of the saga and 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.280
 remember that this video game will be released 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.509
 playstation 4 xbox one computer and and 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.159
 finally let's also discuss another 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.509
 news not as important as the 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.639
 previous ones but yes it is true that 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.319
 sure will interest all of you all 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.330
 those sorry that you are fans of the 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.000

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.860
 many will know the last of lcd this 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.530

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.090
 episode 2 or bourgelat if episode 2 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.500
 whatever you want to call it is around the corner 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.389
 from the particular corner the 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.210
 March 25 you know for 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.099

 the developers of this franchise 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.470
 about five minutes 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.479
 which resolve the moments that most 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.069

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.160
