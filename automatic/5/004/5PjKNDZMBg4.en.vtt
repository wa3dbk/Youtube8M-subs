00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.040
 hello the drilling hrige ago some 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.980
 I was in a popular month 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.660
 Restoration called BÃ¼rgeramt im 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.670
 interesting berlin city district 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.260
 friedrichshain and there I have 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.000
 eaten sweet potato fries 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 I found her delicious and ready 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.199
 they go since then, and again to himself and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.830
 I thought that could be you too 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.590
 interest 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.960
 The preparation is very simple and there 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.910
 they are baked in the oven they are in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.170
 ratio to conventional fries too 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.649
 relatively calories 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.079
 we need logically sweet potatoes 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 and please use fresh and that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.530
 means you should then also relative 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.190
 process quickly and not for long 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.289
 let lie 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.120
 That's important because of that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.010
 they are also nice crispy on 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.379
 spices we need salt and paprika 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.090
 noble sweet who wants to have something else 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.520
 sharp use so black 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.920
 pepper cayenne pepper and chili powder 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.809
 and depending on the taste can also 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.760
 Some garlic powder can be used 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.070
 We also need some oil 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.740
 if possible taste-neutral it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.650
 So sunflowers or rapeseed oil or too 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 until ten we count the sweet potatoes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.700
 and as well as it from 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.250
 they know conventional 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 Depending on size may be bisected in half 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 and then sliced 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.520
 which are about one centimeter thick 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.049
 should and better a few millimeters 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.180
 more than less 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.520
 and then they become the well-known celebrities 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.470
 Form brought so long in stripes 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.350
 cut and also applies here 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.450
 gauge of about a centimeter and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 the way everyone is 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.930
 cut sweet potatoes accordingly 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.860
 are 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.740
 then we enter into a bowl 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.619
 two tablespoons of oil, a paste 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.659
 teaspoons of salt are like that and just as much 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.130
 teaspoon of paprika powder should you 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.290
 then use more spices 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.299
 these and mix everything thoroughly 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.170
 together 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.750
 Now we give the cut 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.030
 sweet potato into it and mix everything 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.189
 I do that with a spoon for so long 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.409
 is also a sweet potato pieces something 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.599
 have gotten for a spice mixture 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.160
 and here is a short note who the 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.890
 sweet potatoe is free 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.390
 She wants to have it crispy before she leaves 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.459
 in the bowl come in one 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.709
 Freezer bag along with one 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.730
 tablespoon of starch and mix everything 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.530
 thoroughly with each other 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.000
 I do not do that for mine 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.950
 they will also be so on the taste 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 baking tray breaks loose enough and one 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.060
 We prove this with baking paper 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.950
 I'll use it again, but I have to 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.140
 you do not give the ponies on it now 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.180
 and then distribute it so that 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.549
 they lie next to each other and not on top of each other 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.310
 after that is done they come too 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.910
 already in the oven and that at 220 degrees 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.950
 circulating air 200 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.569
 stays in the last few minutes in the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.519
 do not close that you are too dark 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.799
 they can ever be baked ready 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.989
 to be salted again after taste 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.269
 However, it is important that already in 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.650
 the mixture with the salt in it is if 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.329
 it deprives the sweet potatoes 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.670
 moisture when baking then 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.590
 evaporates and that's important to them 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.599
 just get really crispy sour 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.849
 bremen or a spicy yurt 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.370
 fit in well but you can as well 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.079
 ketchup and mayo added so as 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.299
 as we do for the conventional ones 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.190
