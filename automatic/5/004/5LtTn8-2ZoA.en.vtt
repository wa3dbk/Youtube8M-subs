00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.990
 is cut and there is very windy 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.420
 is doing today and if necessary 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.430
 something neighbor now definitely the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.430
 market and curious when back again 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.780
 Meanwhile, we are the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.880
 I can watch you time lapse 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.170
 a little something to tell about the engine 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.910
 one because of the dimming 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.010
 We fertilize the plants for the first time 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.719
 march / april as soon as with the high 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.000
 Temperatures around 5 degrees already have 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.410
 because then the trees are already growing and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.940
 You can also get it from the city 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.020
 Lumberjack the percent definitely 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 already grown up at five degrees 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.750
 soil temperature and because he already came 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.760
 beginning to be allowed 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.230
 they usually live in the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.390
 year that is now in the spring for 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.500
 and if you have very poor soil 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.780
 then you can still have a afterglow 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.799
 june / july depending on how vox full-bodied 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 develop 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.900
 You can see that in Buch from too 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.689
 plastic green really strong here 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.119
 I would not really be in the kokon 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.140
 could have strong dark green then 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.509
 definitely stoking again 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.979
 otherwise enough once a year 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.710
 Spring is definitely different 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.750
 to plant as a pot plant 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.860
 once accustomed to the week in head 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.780
 because they can reproduce not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.640
 from the ground pick possibility have 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.320
 and therefore we make sure that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.010
 the box trees then sufficient 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.570
 nutrients 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.640
 This is what you do once a week 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.110
 once a week then one if 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 you already strong green yes and to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.750
 So we can cut now 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 earlier the first time we cut 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 had not cut before 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.110
 otherwise we will cut the first one from may onwards 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.390
 sometimes and depending on the basta perform 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.800
 have if the form does not get bigger 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.630
 but should really stay that way 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.380
 then cut a second time 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.960
 in the year 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.480
 so that the reform can get well and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.250
 the whole does not grow out of high forest 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.990
 made the contours more difficult 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 we cut that off so we do that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:20.090
 country regular business what to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.090
 cut to tell
