00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hey people welcome to this 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.460
 Video today is about unboxing 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.770
 most flagship from home htc 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.719
 that the htc one with the small one 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.719
 Addendum r is great fun 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.220
 I personally found him predecessor so 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.010
 the original htc was already pretty 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.600
 cool from the build quality of the design and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.920
 from the specifications, of course 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.670
 That's why it's cool that we are 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.949
 now the part 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 here on the channel have the box 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.340
 smaller than I thought and you 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.529
 Do not keep boring now 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.070
 we also directly with the unboxing 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.200
 after that by the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.399
 you can fight plastic packaging 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500
 even the lid quite normal 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.210
 lose weight and who would have thought it under 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 this of course you can see directly the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 htc we do as but typical of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.360
 blogs moderately first to the side and 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.520
 look at what else in the world 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.500
 box we is I find even the whole 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.640
 normal longer in every cellphone box 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.739
 should be in it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.090
 however, htc was something here when 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.190
 generous but I'll come to that soon 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.989
 still here the normal sockets 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.000
 adapter we still have that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.680
 USB cable what you get in these sockets 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.199
 adapter can plug in and of course 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.119
 also sync to the data and still 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.460
 a couple of cool high headphones 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 they look a bit like beats 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.150
 have such a nice flat cable that 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.430
 Do not get them tangled and of course 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.810
 one more remote and something else 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.340
 i think thats just in the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.400
 telekom edition so I'm not there yet 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.619
 most certainly a cpu case for that 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 hdz if you like this beautiful 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.909
 aluminum frame would not touch 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 otherwise we still have the small one 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.180
 adapter to take out the sim card 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.520
 and of course Euro sd card 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.950
 to insert and a bit of paper 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.540
 zeugs then we have this was only 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.250
 yet away from this small bowl 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.229
 They also pull on the bag 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.210
 at the same time serves the other 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.220
 make plastic protection off again to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.990
 Can that be so on every cellphone 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.909
 and as soon as we have agreed 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.189
 we can finally get the aluminum 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.740
 touch the phone and that feels 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.030
 really incredibly good at it has the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.130
 first time in hand now 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.710
 It 's a bigger phone than me 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.250
 I'm used to it and the build quality is now 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.990
 cool times 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.729
 it almost feels like it at the time 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.170
 extremely thin on the side 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.790
 but that is also because it is here 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.740
 around 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.380
 100 is on the back we have 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.990
 This dual camera allows us 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.880
 subsequently to change the focus so 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.250
 once in front towards the back 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.620
 focus and on the front of this 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.920
 sound speaker and the camera for 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.510
 video calls or self we still look 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.800
 once around the device to we 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.660
 on the bottom once the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.130
 micro-usb connection and the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.720
 headphones connection, I think very good 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.000
 that he is down here that it definitely is 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.200
 the right side smartphones with the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.240
 Connections above are always one 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.520
 bit on the left is one 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.890
 sim card slot so you can yours 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.180
 insert sim card to stand on it once 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.270
 the on and off switch is real 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.230
 annoying up there to press and one 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.990
 then you faded with what you for example 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.670
 the htc can use as a remote control 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.620
 on the right is another one 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.600
 slot for microsd sd cards 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.310
 you can expand your memory and 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.380
 to the left is a speaker 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.180
 let's turn on the HTC want the first 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.400
 let's have an eternity 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.760
 long boat animation to go over us 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.070
 to let 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.600
 that somehow has something I know about 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.520
 not taken ten minutes with 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.110
 security and then we can do that 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.300
 Handy then but finally for us 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.150
 set up when we do that falls us 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.820
 really first on why immediately below 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.769
 this fat htc biking I have to be 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.750
 mean that the predecessor had the 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.269
 then buttons on those two 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.459
 Now they are on screen and it is 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.180
 it's a bit of a waste of space 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.160
 the display 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.260
 okay there is hardware underneath 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.880
 but if you still have one there 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.190
 Touchpanel clapped or not 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.320
 I think that's the big place 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.670
 difference would have made what I have so far 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.010
 So looked at the finished 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.360
 established operating system, I think 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.370
 is also very good looks association 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.930
 First of all I am pretty chic 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.209
 not so much the blatant now 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.130
 android expert and that's why i leave 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.989
 I also have a little time to fall 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.239
 then more videos to come 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.560
 you see and also important this on 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.510
 screen buttons but I find another 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.760
 See you later , I hope 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.440
 you have the unboxing video I like 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.360
 like that gets very good I thought it was 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.299
 from the pictures just this space gray 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.830
 Variation not quite so cool though 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.250
 still it works with the rear 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.020
 Industries around then relatively well and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.790
 I 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.970
 little more so small display from the iphone 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.280
 therefore please have a new apple 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.470
 iphone display bigger like this today 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.630
 Zion is really really horny 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.610
 from then thank you for always for 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.260
 what then your opinion on the 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.820
 smartphone below in the comments and 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.110
 Of course, to the video only 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.310
 Support with a like or something 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.850
 Of course, as always, I would be very 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.740
 looking forward 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.950
 then see you in the next video 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.950
