00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello everyone today as promised 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.790
 I'll tell you how to fix all the shortcomings 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.280
 xiaomi yi cameras so the first bug is 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.560
 poor microphone recording quality like this 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.050
 here is an example of a sound test recording on 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 about half a meter to start 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.920
 we need to disassemble the camera itself for 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.080
 this we need very thin 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640
 screwdriver or stationery knife as well 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 steel eggs as the body is assembled 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.170
 very good front cover holds on 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.850
 snaps they are very strong so you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.920
 unlikely to break them when trying to open 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.780
 try to snap the camera off 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.969
 starting from one corner and further along 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.920
 perimeter important point do not thrust 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.140
 screwdriver or knife too deep under 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.059
 case especially near the record button 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.690
 video there is a loop that can 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.050
 to harm 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.870
 cheers we opened the lid further unscrew 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.399
 4 bolts that hold the board are important if 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.890
 you do not want to lose the warranty 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.640
 very carefully remove the seals from one 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 out bolt 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 me a damn is a guarantee so i 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.769
 take it off not very neatly further and 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.890
 boldly but with utmost care 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.420
 get the board out of the case and again 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.880
 pay attention to the loop from the button 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.920
 shutter release be careful not to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.450
 damage here we got to this 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 scum who spoiled everything to me 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.020
 impression of the camera when i got 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210
 my microphone scrolled in my head 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 a list of all swear words but here I am 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.500
 I write it so what a nightmare how could they 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 allow such a mistake the microphone was 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.700
 practically isolated from the outside world 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.290
 the Chinese were so eager to protect him from 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.479
 the wind that covered it with a piece of cloth 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.189
 that even light does not pass not 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.909
 that there is some kind of sound a little 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.250
 resented 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.500
 and then cut a piece of foam rubber from the old 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 headphones and put him on the microphone a 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.579
 did I have any thoughts 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.250
 the safety of the microphone itself 1 this dust 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.110
 the second is the wind, yet at least some 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.060
 protection as some craftsmen 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.159
 left this microphone just 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.840
 open I do not think this is right 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.729
 how in time dust gets there and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.350
 dirt and sound will not be like that again 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.450
 quality as I would like by the way 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 You can also trim a little gum 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.110
 maybe it also improves the quality 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.110
 sound well and in the end the sound was saved 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.709
 probably the most unpleasant minus 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.510
 some cameras it is very fast discharge 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.760
 and it happens because in this place 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.130
 most cameras simply do not have 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.590
 insulating pads I was lucky and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.900
 I'm so present, but if you have her 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.090
 no you need between a capacitor and 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.459
 pay just a piece of it 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.230
 paper or other dielectric then 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.760
 the fee will not be short and the camera will be 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.760
 adequately keep the battery charge 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.360
 the third flaw that makes me straight 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.069
 very annoyed it incomprehensible 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.360
 crack when you record a video with 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.340
 included wi-fay so that from him 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.590
 you just need to get rid of the antenna 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:59.670
 which is on the front cover and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:03:01.920
 then the problem disappears 4 bug which 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.690
 occurs less often this is bad 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.430
 focus on the camera to fix it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.530
 will need to sweat and manually 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.630
 twist and adjust the camera focus 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.430
 I'm fine with this so touch everything 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.500
 i wo n't be anything here now she 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.450
 200 percent satisfied with the camera and hopefully 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.519
 that you can get rid of these 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.739
 trouble but for now you can check it out 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.079
