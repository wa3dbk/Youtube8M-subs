00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
there's a couple of versions she did one

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.950 
there's a couple of versions she did one
of<00:00:19.259> them<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> sort<00:00:19.919> I<00:00:20.300> think<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.599> an<00:00:21.689> album

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
of them was a sort I think was an album

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.999 
of them was a sort I think was an album
version<00:00:22.290> or<00:00:22.349> something<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.890> got

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
version or something like that it's got

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.010 
version or something like that it's got
a<00:00:23.040> really<00:00:23.279> really<00:00:23.640> cool<00:00:23.820> groove<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.329> and<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
a really really cool groove to it and I

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.299 
a really really cool groove to it and I
thought<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.380> would<00:00:25.529> song<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.070> start

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:26.309 
thought it would song to start

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:27.799 
thought it would song to start
developing<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.730> bit<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.939> groove<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.689> is

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:27.809 
developing a bit of groove and this is

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.690 
developing a bit of groove and this is
not<00:00:28.020> a<00:00:28.050> song<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.680> unless<00:00:29.009> you<00:00:29.220> know<00:00:29.369> your

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
not a song to do unless you know your

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.410 
not a song to do unless you know your
major<00:00:30.890> 7-7<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.130> dominant<00:00:32.520> 7<00:00:32.820> Barre<00:00:33.030> chords

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
major 7-7 and dominant 7 Barre chords

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.560 
major 7-7 and dominant 7 Barre chords
and<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> don't<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:35.570> it's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and if you don't know what they are it's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.030 
and if you don't know what they are it's
probably<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.080> a<00:00:37.140> good<00:00:37.260> idea<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.890> can

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
probably not a good idea but if you can

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.380 
probably not a good idea but if you can
play<00:00:38.160> bar<00:00:38.370> chords<00:00:38.640> they'll<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.880> fairly<00:00:39.180> easy

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
play bar chords they'll be fairly easy

strumming groove and then you squeeze

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
strumming groove and then you squeeze
the<00:01:24.060> chord<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:31.640> sort<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> thing<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the chord that sort of thing and if you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.420 
the chord that sort of thing and if you
