00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
annoyed and this is the impact shell

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.339 
annoyed and this is the impact shell
from<00:00:09.929> tech<00:00:10.260> 21<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.460> Apple<00:00:11.880> iPhone<00:00:12.300> 5<00:00:12.690> and

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
from tech 21 for the Apple iPhone 5 and

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.620 
from tech 21 for the Apple iPhone 5 and
this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.830> these<00:00:13.920> cases<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.639> d3o

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
this is one of these cases with d3o

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.750 
this is one of these cases with d3o
technology<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:17.220> these<00:00:17.490> three<00:00:17.730> Oh

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
technology in here what these three Oh

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.689 
technology in here what these three Oh
technology<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.990> pliable<00:00:19.320> material

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
technology is it's a pliable material

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.490 
technology is it's a pliable material
until<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.820> meets<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.449> resistance<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.320> then<00:00:22.410> it

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
until it meets a resistance and then it

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
until it meets a resistance and then it
becomes<00:00:22.800> harder<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.490> great<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:23.880> shock

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
becomes harder so it's great for shock

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.349 
becomes harder so it's great for shock
protection<00:00:24.859> now<00:00:25.859> Tech<00:00:26.160> 21s<00:00:26.760> cases<00:00:27.150> are

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
protection now Tech 21s cases are

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
we go this is the case itself there's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.479 
we go this is the case itself there's
nothing<00:00:36.899> else<00:00:37.020> inside<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> packaging<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
nothing else inside the packaging I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.910 
nothing else inside the packaging I
don't<00:00:39.059> think<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.780> get<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> screen<00:00:40.379> protector<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
don't think we get a screen protector in

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.190 
don't think we get a screen protector in
here<00:00:41.129> let's<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.700> look<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.960> there

going to show you the orange portions in
here<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.559> where<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> d3o<00:00:53.430> technology

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
here this is where the d3o technology

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.270 
here this is where the d3o technology
lives<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> concentrates<00:00:55.949> around

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
lives you can see it concentrates around

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
lives you can see it concentrates around
the<00:00:56.460> edge<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.090> corners<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the edge and the corners and this is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.650 
the edge and the corners and this is
this<00:00:58.620> pliable<00:00:58.949> material<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this pliable material and when that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.869 
this pliable material and when that
meets<00:01:00.870> an<00:01:01.020> impact<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.980> becomes<00:01:02.309> rigid<00:01:02.579> I've

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
meets an impact it becomes rigid I've

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.640 
meets an impact it becomes rigid I've
seen<00:01:03.120> tests<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.809> where<00:01:04.019> people<00:01:04.049> hit<00:01:04.500> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
seen tests on this where people hit it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.620 
seen tests on this where people hit it
with<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> hammer<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.210> hit<00:01:06.479> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
with a hammer and then as they hit this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.230 
with a hammer and then as they hit this
with<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.900> hammer<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:08.340> goes<00:01:08.520> hard<00:01:08.880> so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
with a hammer it just just goes hard so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.289 
with a hammer it just just goes hard so
it<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.869> great<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.320> impact<00:01:10.920> protection<00:01:11.299> so

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it is great for impact protection so

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.090 
it is great for impact protection so
let's<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.659> my<00:01:12.840> iPhone<00:01:13.290> 5<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.799> gonna<00:01:13.950> go

sort of top in first and just sort of
ease<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.090> put<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> controls<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
ease that in put the controls in a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
ease that in put the controls in a
little<00:01:19.080> bit<00:01:19.170> first<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.650> well<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.970> I'm

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
little bit first as well and then I'm

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
little bit first as well and then I'm
gonna<00:01:21.330> ease<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.869> round<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.740> bottom<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.400> the

we are in to the case so let's have a
look<00:01:28.799> around<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.250> once<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> case

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
look around this once it's in the case

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.929 
look around this once it's in the case
and<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> feels<00:01:30.720> very<00:01:30.930> safe<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.790> I've

also this or raised profile button

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.530 
also this or raised profile button
it<00:02:13.439> taking<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.769> extra<00:02:14.010> effort<00:02:14.220> no<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.150> doesn't

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it taking the extra effort no it doesn't

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.140 
it taking the extra effort no it doesn't
very<00:02:15.870> very<00:02:16.140> easy<00:02:16.379> let's<00:02:17.040> test<00:02:17.370> these<00:02:17.610> volume

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
very very easy let's test these volume

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.740 
very very easy let's test these volume
controls<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:19.459> they<00:02:20.459> take<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:21.120> little<00:02:21.420> bit<00:02:21.659> of

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
controls and they take a little bit of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.929 
controls and they take a little bit of
an<00:02:21.870> extra<00:02:22.110> push<00:02:22.379> actually<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.489> get<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
an extra push actually to get these to

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.670 
an extra push actually to get these to
work<00:02:23.970> let's<00:02:24.299> just<00:02:24.450> try<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:24.750> again<00:02:24.870> yeah<00:02:25.620> you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
work let's just try that again yeah you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.830 
work let's just try that again yeah you
do<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.430> give<00:02:26.579> an<00:02:26.730> extra<00:02:27.180> push<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:27.659> these

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
do have to give an extra push on these

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.839 
do have to give an extra push on these
that<00:02:28.470> will<00:02:28.590> probably<00:02:28.920> soften<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.400> with<00:02:29.549> time

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
that will probably soften up with time

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.970 
that will probably soften up with time
and<00:02:30.180> probably<00:02:31.019> help<00:02:31.319> if<00:02:31.409> I<00:02:31.530> had<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.829> edge

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and probably help if I had the edge

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.890 
and probably help if I had the edge
pushed<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.459> properly<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:33.000> but<00:02:33.209> certainly

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
pushed on properly there but certainly

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.410 
pushed on properly there but certainly
now<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.319> properly<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:35.700> takes<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.180> little

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
now it's on properly it takes a little

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.240 
now it's on properly it takes a little
bit<00:02:36.540> more<00:02:36.810> effort<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.379> get<00:02:37.500> those<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.860> work<00:02:38.040> but

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
bit more effort to get those to work but

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.130 
bit more effort to get those to work but
not<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> lot<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.879> remember<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> brand

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
not a lot and remember this is a brand

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.559 
not a lot and remember this is a brand
new<00:02:40.319> case<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.849> going<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.060> take<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.299> little

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
new case so it's going to take a little

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.780 
new case so it's going to take a little
bit<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> while<00:02:43.379> for<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.769> just<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.189> become<00:02:44.609> a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
bit of a while for this just to become a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.030 
bit of a while for this just to become a
little<00:02:45.030> bit<00:02:45.150> more<00:02:45.239> pliable<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.739> let's<00:02:46.890> turn

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
little bit more pliable so let's turn

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.119 
little bit more pliable so let's turn
this<00:02:47.220> on<00:02:47.370> once<00:02:47.609> more<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.620> unlock<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.920> have<00:02:50.099> a

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
this on once more and unlock and have a

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.770 
this on once more and unlock and have a
look<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.700> what<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:50.940> looks<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.599> case

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
look see what it looks like in the case

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.830 
look see what it looks like in the case
it<00:02:52.019> looks<00:02:52.139> very<00:02:52.440> nice<00:02:52.739> indeed<00:02:53.720> liking<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it looks very nice indeed liking the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.319 
it looks very nice indeed liking the
look<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.139> that<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:56.040> very<00:02:56.340> cool<00:02:56.609> now<00:02:57.180> it's

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
look of that very very cool now it's

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.449 
look of that very very cool now it's
quite<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> thick<00:02:57.840> case<00:02:58.230> we've<00:02:58.829> got<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.129> raised

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
quite a thick case we've got this raised

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.910 
quite a thick case we've got this raised
edge<00:02:59.700> profile<00:03:00.299> so<00:03:00.629> it's<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.870> nice<00:03:01.319> sort<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.739> lay

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
edge profile so it's a nice sort of lay

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.220 
edge profile so it's a nice sort of lay
on<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.280> table<00:03:02.459> friendly<00:03:03.030> design<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.989> this

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
on the table friendly design so this

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.680 
on the table friendly design so this
screen<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.980> your<00:03:05.040> device<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:06.269> not<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.629> to

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.030 
touch to the table when you put it down
face<00:03:09.239> down<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.569> that's<00:03:09.840> really<00:03:10.139> nice<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.680> it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
face down so that's really nice and it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.619 
face down so that's really nice and it
offers<00:03:11.250> up<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.459> decent<00:03:11.970> amount<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.389> shock
