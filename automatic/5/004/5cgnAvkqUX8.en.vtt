for the sentiment and a left wing spot
we<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:16.980> affect<00:00:17.279> go<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.520> pick<00:00:17.609> up<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.850> catfish<00:00:18.390> 88

we do affect go and pick up a catfish 88
passing<00:00:19.350> looks<00:00:19.830> pretty<00:00:20.070> nice<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:20.820> that

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850

up off the line how has he done that
consecutive<00:00:44.730> episodes<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.870> we've<00:00:45.930> managed

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
consecutive episodes and we've managed

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160 
consecutive episodes and we've managed
to<00:00:46.559> clear<00:00:46.860> our<00:00:47.010> chances<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.510> game<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
to clear our chances but as this game it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
to clear our chances but as this game it
just<00:00:49.200> felt<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.680> dodgy<00:00:50.340> because<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
just felt so dodgy because of the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
just felt so dodgy because of the
chemistry<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.780> players<00:00:52.050> weren't<00:00:52.320> moving<00:00:52.739> but

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
chemistry my players weren't moving but

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.080 
chemistry my players weren't moving but
we<00:00:53.010> were<00:00:53.129> through<00:00:53.340> comment<00:00:53.640> lame-o<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:53.969> can

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
he do of course he can finish that Nikon

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
he do of course he can finish that Nikon
no<00:00:56.579> he<00:00:56.670> can't<00:00:56.879> cause<00:00:57.059> he<00:00:57.180> car<00:00:57.360> cuz<00:00:57.719> he's<00:00:57.840> on

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
no he can't cause he car cuz he's on

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.260 
no he can't cause he car cuz he's on
three<00:00:58.199> chemistry<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.890> last<00:00:59.219> my<00:00:59.430> passing<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
three chemistry and last my passing the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.029 
three chemistry and last my passing the
positioning<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.079> runs<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.800> felt<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
positioning the runs it just felt so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.310 
positioning the runs it just felt so
dodgy<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.760> he's<00:01:02.940> gone<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.180> scored<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:04.019> he's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
dodgy and he's gone and scored and he's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.620 
dodgy and he's gone and scored and he's
gonna<00:01:04.500> scored<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.489> wasn't<00:01:06.060> enjoying<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
gonna scored and I wasn't enjoying this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
gonna scored and I wasn't enjoying this
and<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.320> were<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.590> wasn't<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.100> wasn't

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and we were it wasn't because I wasn't

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.859 
and we were it wasn't because I wasn't
creating<00:01:08.700> chances<00:01:08.880> last<00:01:09.180> look<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.659> look

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
creating chances last look at this look

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
creating chances last look at this look
how<00:01:10.020> he<00:01:10.080> takes<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.619> shot<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.970> he

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
how he takes that shot on what is he

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.450 
how he takes that shot on what is he
even<00:01:12.330> trying<00:01:12.780> Lukaku<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:14.130> he's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> lot

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
even trying Lukaku I think he's a lot

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.520 
even trying Lukaku I think he's a lot
one<00:01:14.670> chemistry<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.299> look<00:01:15.509> we're<00:01:15.900> through<00:01:16.140> he

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
one chemistry but look we're through he

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.990 
one chemistry but look we're through he
should<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.710> easily<00:01:16.890> scored<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.460> again

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
should have easily scored that again

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
should have easily scored that again
another<00:01:18.270> chance<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.619> Kadesh

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
another chance and here we are at Kadesh

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
another chance and here we are at Kadesh
past<00:01:20.369> Pedro<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.119> racket<00:01:21.390> ish<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.689> he

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
past Pedro back to racket ish can he

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.090 
past Pedro back to racket ish can he
finish<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.110> annoyed<00:01:22.320> Congress<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:22.740> straight

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
finish it annoyed Congress go straight

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.399 
finish it annoyed Congress go straight
to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.369> goalkeeper<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> was

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to the goalkeeper and that is what I was

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.380 
to the goalkeeper and that is what I was
finding<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:26.009> game<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.970> Knights<00:01:27.180> are

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
finding all game and if you Knights are

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.910 
finding all game and if you Knights are
wondering<00:01:27.810> does<00:01:28.140> chemistry<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.799> make

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
wondering does chemistry you really make

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
wondering does chemistry you really make
a<00:01:28.950> difference<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.520> last<00:01:29.759> year<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> wasn't<00:01:30.689> so

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
a difference now last year it wasn't so

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.440 
a difference now last year it wasn't so
like<00:01:31.049> problem<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.009> year<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.090> bad

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
like problem but this year it is so bad

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660

struggling<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> chemistry<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.369> in

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
struggling with the chemistry and in

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.889 
struggling with the chemistry and in
that<00:01:59.579> happens<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.180> players<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.659> didn't

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that happens my players just didn't

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.359 
that happens my players just didn't
really<00:02:00.990> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> play<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.439> me<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.340> felt

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
really want to play for me and it felt

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.789 
really want to play for me and it felt
like<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.329> didn't<00:02:03.540> even<00:02:03.570> feel<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
like it didn't even feel like a like you

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.380 
like it didn't even feel like a like you
know<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> feels<00:02:05.130> slow<00:02:05.430> anyway<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:06.180> yet

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
know it feels slow anyway know yet

know it feels slow anyway know yet
another<00:02:06.540> golf<00:02:06.810> room<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.590> feels<00:02:07.740> slow

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
another golf room you know it feels slow

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.040 
another golf room you know it feels slow
if<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.000> someone<00:02:09.270> else's<00:02:09.750> pulling

if it was like someone else's pulling
you<00:02:10.170> wow<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.979> already<00:02:11.310> slow<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.150> were

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you wow it's already slow and we were

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.730 
you wow it's already slow and we were
through<00:02:12.480> again<00:02:12.750> obviously

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
through again obviously

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.170 
through again obviously
it's<00:02:13.950> off<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.250> buy<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.730> didn't<00:02:15.030> feel<00:02:15.120> good

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
it's off to buy it just didn't feel good

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.180 
it's off to buy it just didn't feel good
lads<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.900> don't<00:02:16.170> advise<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.710> playing<00:02:16.980> with

less than or 80 chemistry 90 chemistry
it's<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:20.820> bad<00:02:21.030> especially<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.660> informs

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
it's so bad especially with the informs

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.230 
it's so bad especially with the informs
you<00:02:22.290> do<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.620> fact<00:02:22.770> get<00:02:22.980> punished<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.090> in

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
you do in fact get punished but we do in

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.090 
you do in fact get punished but we do in
fact<00:02:24.360> go<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.930> upgrade<00:02:25.620> Santi<00:02:25.980> Cazorla

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
fact go and upgrade Santi Cazorla

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.790 
fact go and upgrade Santi Cazorla
because<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.880> thought<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:28.110> might<00:02:28.290> as<00:02:28.410> well<00:02:28.440> get<00:02:28.740> a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
because I thought we might as well get a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
because I thought we might as well get a
little<00:02:29.010> bit<00:02:29.100> more<00:02:29.220> chemistry<00:02:29.550> especially

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
little bit more chemistry especially

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.700 
little bit more chemistry especially
with<00:02:30.150> petrol<00:02:30.570> are<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:30.990> can<00:02:31.140> upgrade<00:02:31.260> long

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
with petrol are we can upgrade long

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.980 
with petrol are we can upgrade long
later<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.550> know<00:02:32.700> babe<00:02:32.970> both<00:02:33.150> got<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.480> seven

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
later on I know babe both got a seven

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.290 
later on I know babe both got a seven
rating<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.560> as<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.610> no<00:02:35.820> surprise

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
rating and as you see here no surprise

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.720 
rating and as you see here no surprise
at<00:02:36.630> all<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.470> do<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.800> fact<00:02:37.980> go<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.490> pick

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
at all that we do in fact go and pick

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.390 
at all that we do in fact go and pick
ourselves<00:02:38.880> up<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:40.020> for<00:02:40.230> me<00:02:40.350> ask<00:02:40.680> oh<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.280> now

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
ourselves up and in for me ask oh so now

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.040 
ourselves up and in for me ask oh so now
hopefully<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.030> remember<00:02:42.300> rightly<00:02:42.480> Pedro

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
hopefully if I remember rightly Pedro

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.600 
hopefully if I remember rightly Pedro
does<00:02:43.260> actually<00:02:43.410> receive<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> 10<00:02:44.040> chemistry<00:02:44.460> as

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
does actually receive a 10 chemistry as

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.040 
does actually receive a 10 chemistry as
he's<00:02:44.850> getting<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> nationality<00:02:45.690> link<00:02:45.900> and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
he's getting the nationality link and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.770 
he's getting the nationality link and
also<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.980> league<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.850> do<00:02:47.970> move<00:02:48.180> into<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
also the league so we do move into the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.750 
also the league so we do move into the
next<00:02:48.870> game<00:02:49.080> with<00:02:49.260> 76<00:02:49.770> overall<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.340> chemistry

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
next game with 76 overall the chemistry

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
next game with 76 overall the chemistry
hopefully<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.540> will<00:02:51.660> change<00:02:51.720> our<00:02:52.110> fluency

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
hopefully that will change our fluency

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.470 
hopefully that will change our fluency
in<00:02:52.860> play<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:53.700> do<00:02:53.820> find<00:02:54.030> ourselves<00:02:54.120> coming

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
in play and we do find ourselves coming

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.450 
in play and we do find ourselves coming
up<00:02:54.540> against<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.900> Premier<00:02:55.500> Li<00:02:55.650> excited<00:02:56.040> russian

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
the shooting and passing feel bad it's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.180 
the shooting and passing feel bad it's
