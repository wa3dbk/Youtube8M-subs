00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
awesomeness see that's proof of how fast

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.280 
awesomeness see that's proof of how fast
I<00:01:59.330> can<00:02:00.070> say<00:02:01.070> that<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:01.660> anyway<00:02:02.660> I'm<00:02:02.930> not<00:02:02.990> sure

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
I can say that but anyway I'm not sure

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.840 
I can say that but anyway I'm not sure
whether<00:02:03.470> I'm<00:02:03.650> hitting<00:02:03.950> her<00:02:04.070> or<00:02:04.220> not<00:02:04.400> it's<00:02:04.640> kind

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
whether I'm hitting her or not it's kind

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.200 
whether I'm hitting her or not it's kind
of<00:02:04.880> hard<00:02:05.120> to<00:02:05.150> tell<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:06.020> damn<00:02:06.380> freaking

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
of hard to tell the damn freaking

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.270 
of hard to tell the damn freaking
blanket<00:02:08.380> blocking<00:02:09.380> her<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.979> know<00:02:10.040> i<00:02:10.100> would

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
blanket blocking her you know i would

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.200 
blanket blocking her you know i would
think<00:02:10.430> that<00:02:10.550> because<00:02:10.970> these<00:02:11.060> are

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
think that because these are

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.490 
think that because these are
tranquilizer<00:02:11.750> rounds<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.140> they<00:02:12.260> wouldn't

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
tranquilizer rounds that they wouldn't

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.470 
tranquilizer rounds that they wouldn't
go<00:02:12.620> through<00:02:13.070> Twila<00:02:13.370> they<00:02:14.150> wouldn't<00:02:14.390> go

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
go through Twila they wouldn't go

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.940 
go through Twila they wouldn't go
through<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.810> blanket<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.650> now<00:02:15.830> apparently

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
through that blanket and now apparently

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.650 
through that blanket and now apparently
they're<00:02:16.370> becoming<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.790> painter<00:02:17.060> her<00:02:17.210> ass<00:02:17.360> so

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
they're becoming a painter her ass so

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.870 
they're becoming a painter her ass so
she's<00:02:17.930> deciding<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.560> take<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.830> down<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.340> tried

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
she's deciding to take you down I tried

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.280 
she's deciding to take you down I tried
to<00:02:19.970> shoot<00:02:20.150> her<00:02:20.240> in<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.390> meantime<00:02:20.600> but<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.960> could

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
to shoot her in the meantime but I could

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.590 
to shoot her in the meantime but I could
and<00:02:21.680> now<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.490> can<00:02:22.730> see<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.270> movements

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
and now you can see that your movements

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.510 
and now you can see that your movements
starting<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.900> slow<00:02:24.080> down<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.560> my<00:02:25.070> reaction

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
starting to slow down and my reaction

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.030 
starting to slow down and my reaction
time<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:25.940> not<00:02:26.150> improving<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:27.740> she's<00:02:27.980> not

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
time is not improving so now she's not

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.440 
time is not improving so now she's not
smart<00:02:28.370> enough<00:02:28.490> to<00:02:28.730> look<00:02:28.820> on<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.030> other<00:02:29.120> side

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
smart enough to look on the other side

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.650 
smart enough to look on the other side
