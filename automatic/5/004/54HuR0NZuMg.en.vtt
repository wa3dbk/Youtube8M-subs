or in my case handling a deck of cards
you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.699> obtain<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> special<00:00:30.570> connection<00:00:31.109> with

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you can obtain a special connection with

you can obtain a special connection with
the<00:00:31.470> item<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.800> you're<00:00:31.890> using<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.489> then

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the item that you're using and then

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.850 
the item that you're using and then
every<00:00:33.149> time<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.360> use<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:34.170> intuition<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
every time you use it your intuition is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.459 
every time you use it your intuition is
taken<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> whole<00:00:35.880> new<00:00:36.300> level<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.380> were

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.110 
taken to a whole new level if you were
to<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> strong<00:00:38.460> connection<00:00:38.820> with

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
to then get a strong connection with

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.910 
to then get a strong connection with
another<00:00:39.210> person<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.530> share<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
another person they would share that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
object is that's exactly what's going to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
object is that's exactly what's going to
happen<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> minute<00:00:46.230> because<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.190> both

connected to me you'll be able to pick
up<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.920> strong<00:00:50.219> connection<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.510> deck<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
up a strong connection with my deck of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.350

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.719 
these four and what I find fascinating
is<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.870> managed<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.530> find<00:02:04.830> all<00:02:05.870> four<00:02:06.870> of

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
is that you managed to find all four of

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.930 
is that you managed to find all four of
the<00:02:08.990> faces<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> power<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the faces and that is a power of a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.670 
the faces and that is a power of a
strong<00:02:12.450> intuitive<00:02:13.050> connection<00:02:15.470> now<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:16.530> won't

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
strong intuitive connection now we won't

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.500 
strong intuitive connection now we won't
need<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> Aces<00:02:17.310> anymore<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.360> go

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
need the Aces anymore so we can just go

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.720 
need the Aces anymore so we can just go
ahead<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:19.020> get<00:02:19.620> them<00:02:19.800> right<00:02:19.950> back<00:02:20.190> into<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
ahead and get them right back into the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.090 
ahead and get them right back into the
deck<00:02:20.910> let's<00:02:21.750> focus<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> selections<00:02:23.010> that

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
deck let's focus on the selections that

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.470 
deck let's focus on the selections that
we<00:02:23.220> made<00:02:23.340> at<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.459> beginning<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.970> trick<00:02:24.209> on

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
we made at the beginning of the trick on

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960 
we made at the beginning of the trick on
the<00:02:25.200> count<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.500> three<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.100> want<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.580> two<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.760> you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
the count of three I want the two of you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.280 
the count of three I want the two of you
to<00:02:27.060> each<00:02:27.209> turn<00:02:27.450> over<00:02:27.660> your<00:02:27.780> card

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
to each turn over your card

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.990 
to each turn over your card
one<00:02:29.450> two<00:02:30.770> three

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.160 

well<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.180> two<00:02:36.390> definitely<00:02:36.570> have<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> strong

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
well you two definitely have a strong

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.140 
well you two definitely have a strong
connection<00:02:37.440> with<00:02:37.680> each<00:02:37.800> other<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.400> both

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
connection with each other as you both

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.780 
connection with each other as you both
picked<00:02:39.480> red<00:02:39.660> ace<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:41.160> interesting<00:02:41.459> that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
picked red ace and it's interesting that

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.449 
picked red ace and it's interesting that
you<00:02:41.910> both<00:02:42.120> picked<00:02:42.480> an<00:02:42.600> eight<00:02:42.720> because<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.470> have

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
you both picked an eight because I have

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.330 
you both picked an eight because I have
to<00:02:44.550> go<00:02:44.850> for<00:02:45.450> an<00:02:45.570> eight<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:45.989> well<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.280> think

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
to go for an eight as well and I think

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.740 
to go for an eight as well and I think
that<00:02:47.640> for<00:02:47.790> everything<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.300> come<00:02:48.480> full<00:02:48.720> circle

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
that for everything to come full circle

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.830 
that for everything to come full circle
it<00:02:49.560> only<00:02:49.800> seems<00:02:50.190> right<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> deck<00:02:51.150> gives<00:02:51.540> us

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
it only seems right if the deck gives us

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.030 
it only seems right if the deck gives us
the<00:02:52.230> fourth<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.830> final<00:02:53.489> eight
