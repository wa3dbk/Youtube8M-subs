00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
in here I've got a repeater loop linked

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.999 
in here I've got a repeater loop linked
to<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> dispenser<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> chicken's<00:01:16.020> ass<00:01:16.259> or

X

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.639 

and<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.850> all<00:01:31.060> giant<00:01:31.420> chickens<00:01:31.810> it's<00:01:32.259> got<00:01:32.619> a

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
and like all giant chickens it's got a

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.700 
and like all giant chickens it's got a
stat<00:01:33.130> button<00:01:33.399> on<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.609> outside<00:01:34.109> so<00:01:35.109> just<00:01:35.500> hit

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
stat button on the outside so just hit

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:44.039 
stat button on the outside so just hit
that<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.229> now<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.829> can<00:01:42.130> see<00:01:42.429> a<00:01:43.049> giant

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
that and so now you can see a giant

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.139 
that and so now you can see a giant
chicken<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.710> foaming<00:01:45.069> the<00:01:45.189> eggs<00:01:45.429> out<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.789> his

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
chicken is foaming the eggs out of his

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:53.459 
chicken is foaming the eggs out of his
ass<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:50.799> eggs<00:01:51.219> up<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.729> one-in-eight<00:01:52.329> chance<00:01:52.469> to

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
ass now eggs up a one-in-eight chance to

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.149 
ass now eggs up a one-in-eight chance to
hatch<00:01:53.950> into<00:01:54.250> chickens<00:01:54.759> when<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.209> fire<00:01:56.159> at

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
hatch into chickens when the fire at

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.179 
hatch into chickens when the fire at
least<00:01:57.219> that's<00:01:57.579> what<00:01:57.789> i've<00:01:57.850> read<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.649> can

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
least that's what i've read so you can

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.160 
least that's what i've read so you can
see<00:02:00.399> I'm<00:02:00.729> already<00:02:00.849> starting<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.659> build<00:02:02.020> up

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
see I'm already starting to build up

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.270 
see I'm already starting to build up
some<00:02:02.409> chickens<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:05.170> chickens<00:02:05.590> float<00:02:06.009> on

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
some chickens and the chickens float on

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.630 
some chickens and the chickens float on
the<00:02:06.340> water<00:02:06.939> block<00:02:07.390> they<00:02:07.719> can't<00:02:07.989> get<00:02:08.200> through

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the water block they can't get through

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.819 
the water block they can't get through
but<00:02:09.640> when<00:02:09.819> they<00:02:09.970> lay<00:02:10.149> eggs<00:02:10.230> the<00:02:11.230> eggs<00:02:11.260> can<00:02:11.650> get

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
but when they lay eggs the eggs can get

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:19.500 
but when they lay eggs the eggs can get
through<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.290> got<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.650> couple<00:02:17.920> escape<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.760> that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
through so got a couple escape and that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.630 
through so got a couple escape and that
can<00:02:19.720> happen<00:02:19.900> when<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.440> eggs<00:02:20.650> sometimes<00:02:21.010> splits

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
can happen when it eggs sometimes splits

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:31.140 
can happen when it eggs sometimes splits
into<00:02:21.849> four<00:02:22.120> chickens<00:02:22.599> but<00:02:23.110> no<00:02:23.709> worries<00:02:29.700> okay<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
into four chickens but no worries okay I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.110 
into four chickens but no worries okay I
fast<00:02:31.660> forward<00:02:32.079> a<00:02:32.170> bit<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:33.760> full<00:02:34.000> of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
fast forward a bit and it's full of

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.509 
fast forward a bit and it's full of
chickens<00:02:34.510> now<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:38.069> dispensers<00:02:39.069> empty

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
chickens now and the dispensers empty

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.890 
chickens now and the dispensers empty
i'll<00:02:39.670> just<00:02:39.880> show<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.299> circuit<00:02:40.810> in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
i'll just show you that circuit in

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.900 
i'll just show you that circuit in
action<00:02:42.569> we'll<00:02:43.569> see<00:02:43.810> just<00:02:44.049> doing<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.470> loop<00:02:47.910> they

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
action we'll see just doing a loop they

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.729 
action we'll see just doing a loop they
have<00:02:49.180> been<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> bit<00:02:49.660> lazy<00:02:49.840> here<00:02:50.290> we're<00:02:50.500> going<00:02:50.680> to

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
have been a bit lazy here we're going to

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.500 
have been a bit lazy here we're going to
pare<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.130> down<00:02:51.160> by<00:02:51.549> knocking<00:02:51.970> out<00:02:52.060> one<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.329> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
pare it down by knocking out one of the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:01.259 
pare it down by knocking out one of the
repeaters<00:02:59.220> okay<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:00.489> we<00:03:00.579> go<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.060> back

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
repeaters okay so if we go in the back

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.300 
repeaters okay so if we go in the back
here<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:04.150> can<00:03:04.359> see<00:03:04.630> about<00:03:04.980> chickens<00:03:05.980> lay<00:03:06.280> eggs

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
here you can see about chickens lay eggs

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.930 
here you can see about chickens lay eggs
and<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:08.260> eggs<00:03:08.319> got<00:03:08.650> down<00:03:08.889> and<00:03:09.220> they<00:03:09.700> can<00:03:09.910> be

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
and the eggs got down and they can be

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.200 
and the eggs got down and they can be
collected

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210
