00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.229
 What is the most natural meat beef 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.470

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.050
 clean b and will beef you even without 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.820
 bones because bones we planted in 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:27.920
 earth to grow the laptop helen we 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:30.560
 suddenly we love this pasha kid too 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.460
 we need it was a pencil but his 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.620
 undermined 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.730
 little runaway all 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:44.040
 Well, you know, like metal perfume, that's a bow 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.300
 I hope I will not cut it but he is 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.480
 delicious you can imagine it 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.010
 here 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:56.540
 spicy chili sauce can't imagine how 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.780
 chili ketchup will trankar something to wit 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.360
 Astrid sits joking tells such in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.910
 this burger is most important to us 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.230
 will need a couple of french 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.390
 crispy bun such lot of pop here 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.820
 while the barbecue is warming us in our canals 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.930
 subscribers we will cook meat that our 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.600
 most like them that can not 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.590
 pronounce at vegetarians yes she doesn't 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.390
 worry 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.880
 next gear specifically for 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.690
 vegetarians we cook fruit 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:36.470
 a salad of arsenic and mercury here we have 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.660
 there are two pieces of choice beef tenderloin 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.209
 if the meat does not take the fat 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.920
 cutlets will get too dry but also 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.340
 too fat on not suitable either 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.239
 so do not rush to take your mother 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.720
 on a picnic and 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.310
 to make it so tasty 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.230
 saturated and not too dry percentage 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.370
 15-10 should be fat in it because 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.140
 he will lose weight in prayer 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.240
 another meat cooking feature 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.340
 in nature this is what should be 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.920
 as cold as possible so 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.850
 making heart over him 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.610
 their ex 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.520
 and the fat on the meat will stick to the hands 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.000
 to the meat grinder get up too 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.330
 chill before cooking 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.720
 we cut a package we get a beef 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.240
 the beef is still so frozen that 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.860
 don't even bend we need to cut on 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.640
 pieces for small ones 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.640
 ice and bloody heart my ears 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.020
 grind meat to the maximum 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.390
 wormhole as my first spoke 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.300
 the teacher is not smaller 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.700
 basically you can just knife it into small ones 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.190
 such cous and cut so there well 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.840
 Normally in general will be but still 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.250
 it is better 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.140
 extremely recommend using a meat grinder 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.670
 use for this radio room 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.010
 useless idea 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.560
 when forming cutlets knead strong 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.930
 meat is not necessary because you break it 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.730
 fine mental organization and he 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.480
 lose juice and all lovers 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.810
 puffin 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.910
 let google ip30 drac it and here we are 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.100
 spun our pieces of meat look 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.050
 delightfully look i added by 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.800
 minimum spice to emphasize the taste 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.280
 meat 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.460
 Well, the word stress will not work 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.830
 to make a mistake on first in the meat 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.350
 salt is not necessary because salt 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.410
 takes the juice you need already when the burgers 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.990
 formed the diameter of her so well 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.850
 how do you imagine the diameter of the chop 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.110
 Here it should be in thickness 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.400
 somewhere centimeter 2 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.830
 it's around the edges a 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.690
 directly in the center where this one 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.850
 radius begins there a half centimeter 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.759
 Here we put there and and in order to 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.160
 our cutlets are not burnt we grease them 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:23.199
 themselves and also the bars and also 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:27.479
 olive oil caplin there cap-cap that 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.479
 Well let's try what we did 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:42.340
 even the meat turned out just magically I 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.979
 I'll try marbled beef here 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:51.750
 much better at least 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:54.900
 teeth do not break more than 5 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.900
 can be
