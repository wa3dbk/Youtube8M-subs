00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
guess at this point for the force

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.849 
guess at this point for the force
awakens<00:00:17.960> just<00:00:18.960> has<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> origin

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
awakens just has to do with the origin

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.580 
awakens just has to do with the origin
of<00:00:19.949> Poe<00:00:20.130> dameron's<00:00:20.580> name<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.050> I<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.560> just

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
of Poe dameron's name and I we're just

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.830 
of Poe dameron's name and I we're just
trying<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> speculate<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.269> where<00:00:24.689> these

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
trying to speculate on on where these

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.200 
trying to speculate on on where these
names<00:00:25.050> came<00:00:25.289> from<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.980> first<00:00:26.250> person<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.789> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
names came from the first person that I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
names came from the first person that I
think<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.779> name<00:00:28.019> damron<00:00:28.920> came<00:00:29.130> from<00:00:29.369> is

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
think the name damron came from is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.200 
think the name damron came from is
Morgan<00:00:30.449> damron<00:00:30.810> who<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.980> JJ<00:00:32.460> Abrams<00:00:32.820> personal

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
Morgan damron who was JJ Abrams personal

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.760 
Morgan damron who was JJ Abrams personal
assistant<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.719> star<00:00:34.110> trek<00:00:34.230> into<00:00:34.440> darkness

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
assistant on star trek into darkness

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
assistant on star trek into darkness
which<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.880> they<00:00:36.540> probably<00:00:36.719> worked<00:00:36.960> pretty

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
which I they probably worked pretty

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.650 
which I they probably worked pretty
closely<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.890> he<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.219> doing<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.940> her<00:00:39.149> games

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
closely so he was doing it for her games

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.660 
closely so he was doing it for her games
and<00:00:40.320> he<00:00:40.440> made<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:41.070> before<00:00:41.219> he<00:00:41.460> came<00:00:41.610> on

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and he made that right before he came on

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
and he made that right before he came on
the<00:00:41.910> Star<00:00:42.149> Wars<00:00:42.300> yeah<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.989> that's<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.410> pretty

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the Star Wars yeah so that's a pretty

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.590 
the Star Wars yeah so that's a pretty
big<00:00:44.040> coincidence<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.940> I'm<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
big coincidence like I'm sure it's not a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.380 
big coincidence like I'm sure it's not a
coincidence<00:00:45.870> yeah<00:00:46.649> plus<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:48.059> this

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
coincidence yeah plus I like at this

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.819 
coincidence yeah plus I like at this
point<00:00:48.600> they're<00:00:48.780> probably<00:00:48.960> pretty<00:00:49.140> close<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
point they're probably pretty close so

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.319 
point they're probably pretty close so
he<00:00:50.039> was<00:00:50.129> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.340> doing<00:00:50.489> her<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> favor<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
he was kind of doing her a favor and it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.729 
he was kind of doing her a favor and it
does<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.600> Star<00:00:51.870> Wars<00:00:52.079> bring<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.410> anyways

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
does have Star Wars bring to it anyways

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.170 
does have Star Wars bring to it anyways
he<00:00:52.920> probably<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.550> maybe<00:00:54.000> he<00:00:54.149> just

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
he probably just like maybe he just

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.430 
he probably just like maybe he just
thought<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.690> his<00:00:54.809> close<00:00:54.989> friends<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
thought of all his close friends and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.720 
thought of all his close friends and
decided<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.890> choose<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.370> had<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> really
