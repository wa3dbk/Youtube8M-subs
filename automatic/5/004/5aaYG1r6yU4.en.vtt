00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
get into it and I started pulling off

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.970 
get into it and I started pulling off
certain<00:03:02.430> maneuvers<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.990> built<00:03:04.710> up<00:03:04.860> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
certain maneuvers and I built up a

rhythm and all of a sudden my whole
approach<00:03:08.460> becomes<00:03:08.940> spontaneous<00:03:09.750> even<00:03:10.470> then

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
approach becomes spontaneous even then
