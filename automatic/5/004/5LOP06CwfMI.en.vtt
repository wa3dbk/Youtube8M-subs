I'm throwing a baseball or something but

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.780 
I'm throwing a baseball or something but
it's<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:04.680> my<00:02:04.770> dominant<00:02:05.250> hand<00:02:05.280> when<00:02:05.700> I'm

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it's not my dominant hand when I'm

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.429 
it's not my dominant hand when I'm
playing<00:02:05.939> guitar<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> reason<00:02:07.110> why<00:02:07.259> I'm

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
playing guitar and the reason why I'm

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.059 
playing guitar and the reason why I'm
learning<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> play<00:02:08.250> guitar<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.910> is

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
learning to play guitar like this is

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.320 
learning to play guitar like this is
because<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:12.200> don't

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
because I don't

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.590 
because I don't
on<00:02:13.390> one<00:02:13.750> side<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.530> me<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.270> more<00:02:16.270> prominent

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
on one side of me to be more prominent

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.100 
on one side of me to be more prominent
more<00:02:17.140> dominant<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.940> what<00:02:19.360> what<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
more dominant what what what and and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.600 
more dominant what what what and and
it's<00:02:20.470> also<00:02:20.620> because<00:02:20.860> I'm<00:02:20.950> starting<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.490> play

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
it's also because I'm starting to play

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.560 
it's also because I'm starting to play
piano<00:02:21.820> now<00:02:22.120> too<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:23.910> when<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.940> when<00:02:25.420> I'm

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570

playing<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.410> noticed<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.600> when<00:02:28.600> i'm<00:02:28.780> working
