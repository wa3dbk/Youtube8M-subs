percent<00:01:34.500> every<00:01:35.040> single<00:01:35.460> pound<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.090> fat<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
percent every single pound of fat you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.149 
percent every single pound of fat you
lose<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:36.990> knock<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> body<00:01:37.950> fat

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
lose as you knock that body fat

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.770 
lose as you knock that body fat
percentage<00:01:38.759> down<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> gets<00:01:39.360> harder<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
percentage down it gets harder and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230 
percentage down it gets harder and
harder<00:01:39.840> until<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.979> reach<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.430> limit<00:01:41.790> right

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
harder until you reach a limit right

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.270 
harder until you reach a limit right
past<00:01:42.899> sixty<00:01:43.259> percent<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.680> gets<00:01:43.799> incredibly

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
past sixty percent it gets incredibly

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.730 
past sixty percent it gets incredibly
hard<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.390> same<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:45.960> said<00:01:46.079> when<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> comes

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
hard the same can be said when it comes

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.490 
hard the same can be said when it comes
to<00:01:47.130> muscle<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.820> muscle<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.540> both<00:01:48.810> harder

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to muscle and that muscle is both harder

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
to muscle and that muscle is both harder
to<00:01:49.649> gain<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.009> takes<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> long<00:01:50.520> time<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.149> know

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to gain it takes a long time we all know

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.109 
to gain it takes a long time we all know
this<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:52.530> harder<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.460> lose<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
this and it's also harder to lose so I

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.749 
this and it's also harder to lose so I
just<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> say<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.930> before<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.500> on

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
just want to say that before we go on

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.010 
just want to say that before we go on
now<00:01:56.759> you're<00:01:56.969> probably<00:01:57.180> wondering<00:01:57.360> maybe<00:01:57.930> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
now you're probably wondering maybe you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.109 
now you're probably wondering maybe you
have<00:01:58.110> friends<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.500> train<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.829> friends<00:01:59.189> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
have friends you train with friends and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
have friends you train with friends and
you<00:02:00.329> notice<00:02:00.689> some<00:02:01.170> people<00:02:01.409> experience<00:02:01.770> great

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you notice some people experience great

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.200 
you notice some people experience great
results<00:02:02.250> or<00:02:02.340> maybe<00:02:02.369> you're<00:02:02.670> experiencing<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
results or maybe you're experiencing a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.670 
results or maybe you're experiencing a
lot<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> results<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.869> someone<00:02:04.140> else<00:02:04.259> isn't

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
lot of results and someone else isn't

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.770 
lot of results and someone else isn't
what<00:02:05.310> determines<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.630> are<00:02:06.719> the

what determines this and here are the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
what determines this and here are the

factors the first one the heavy one
hates<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> minute<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.509> truth

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.660 
hates the minute but it's the truth
genetics<00:02:10.739> I'll<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> whole<00:02:11.280> video<00:02:11.640> on

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
genetics I'll have a whole video on

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.100 
genetics I'll have a whole video on
there

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
there

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.290 
there
how<00:02:12.440> genetics<00:02:13.040> influence<00:02:13.400> strength<00:02:14.000> how<00:02:14.240> to

how genetics influence strength how to

how genetics influence strength how to
influence<00:02:14.630> muscle<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:15.740> genetics<00:02:16.190> is

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
influence muscle but genetics is

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.670 
influence muscle but genetics is

just genetic freaks genetics will trump

just genetic freaks genetics will trump
everything<00:02:31.460> yes<00:02:32.060> even<00:02:32.450> hard<00:02:32.690> work<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.990> know

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
everything yes even hard work I know

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.140 
everything yes even hard work I know
that's<00:02:33.320> hard<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.590> accept<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.400> honestly<00:02:35.000> that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
that's hard to accept but honestly that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.030 
that's hard to accept but honestly that
doesn't<00:02:35.420> even<00:02:35.510> matter<00:02:35.720> because<00:02:35.900> you're<00:02:36.650> given

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
doesn't even matter because you're given

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.949 
doesn't even matter because you're given
your<00:02:37.070> genetics<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:37.730> what<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.330> choose<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.840> do

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
your genetics as what you choose to do

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.449 
your genetics as what you choose to do
with<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.230> body<00:02:39.440> that's<00:02:39.709> most<00:02:39.920> important<00:02:40.370> so

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
with the body that's most important so

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.730 
with the body that's most important so
one<00:02:40.730> genetics<00:02:41.480> influences<00:02:42.080> everything<00:02:42.350> right

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
one genetics influences everything right

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.370 
one genetics influences everything right
we<00:02:43.130> know<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.310> too<00:02:44.150> though<00:02:44.450> however<00:02:44.720> comes

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
we know that too though however comes

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.020 
we know that too though however comes
down<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.709> drugs<00:02:45.980> where<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.250> supplement<00:02:46.850> with

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
down to drugs where you supplement with

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.110 
down to drugs where you supplement with
or<00:02:47.390> also<00:02:48.080> good<00:02:48.410> training<00:02:49.130> if<00:02:49.670> you're<00:02:49.850> doing

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
or also good training if you're doing

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.699 
or also good training if you're doing
high<00:02:50.330> repetitions<00:02:51.020> if<00:02:51.200> you're<00:02:51.320> trying<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
high repetitions if you're trying to

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.979 
high repetitions if you're trying to
lose<00:02:52.370> fat<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.209> you're<00:02:53.360> doing<00:02:53.510> just<00:02:53.720> high

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
lose fat and you're doing just high

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.900 
lose fat and you're doing just high
repetitions<00:02:54.620> with<00:02:54.770> light<00:02:55.010> weight<00:02:55.220> you're

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
repetitions with light weight you're

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.160 
repetitions with light weight you're
gonna<00:02:56.000> start<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.420> lose<00:02:56.600> that<00:02:56.630> muscle<00:02:56.959> you're

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
gonna start to lose that muscle you're

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.050 
gonna start to lose that muscle you're
not<00:02:57.290> given<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.890> muscle<00:02:58.160> any<00:02:58.340> reason<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.850> stay

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
not given that muscle any reason to stay

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.630 
not given that muscle any reason to stay
so<00:02:59.360> smart<00:02:59.959> training<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.920> second<00:03:01.340> factor

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
so smart training is that second factor

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.920 
so smart training is that second factor
of<00:03:01.730> course<00:03:01.880> also<00:03:02.480> we're<00:03:02.600> talking<00:03:02.720> about

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
of course also we're talking about

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.080 
of course also we're talking about
anabolic<00:03:03.770> steroids<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> goes<00:03:04.550> without<00:03:04.790> saying

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
anabolic steroids it goes without saying

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.350 
anabolic steroids it goes without saying
but<00:03:05.150> how<00:03:06.020> you<00:03:06.080> train<00:03:06.650> greatly<00:03:07.580> influences

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
but how you train greatly influences

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.180 
but how you train greatly influences
your<00:03:08.690> composition<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.590> we<00:03:09.709> know<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:10.040> of

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
your composition so we know that of

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.380 
your composition so we know that of
course<00:03:10.220> women<00:03:10.640> want<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.820> lose<00:03:11.000> weight<00:03:11.209> we

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
course women want to lose weight we

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.880 
course women want to lose weight we
should<00:03:11.600> stick<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.900> compound<00:03:12.410> movements

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
should stick to the compound movements

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.320 
should stick to the compound movements
really<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.340> comes<00:03:13.520> down<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.790> smart

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
really it comes down to smart

really it comes down to smart

getting<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.940> little<00:03:20.120> bit<00:03:20.299> stronger<00:03:20.570> will<00:03:21.410> make

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
getting a little bit stronger will make

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.949 
getting a little bit stronger will make
you<00:03:21.890> bigger<00:03:22.190> right<00:03:22.580> handling<00:03:23.269> more<00:03:23.450> volume

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
you bigger right handling more volume

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.080 
you bigger right handling more volume
over<00:03:24.200> time<00:03:24.410> will<00:03:24.799> once<00:03:25.040> again<00:03:25.190> make<00:03:25.820> you

over time will once again make you

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950

outside of genetics you can't influence

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.840 
outside of genetics you can't influence
genetics<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.650> can<00:03:30.920> influence<00:03:31.310> how<00:03:31.790> you

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
train the third thing that we have to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.250 
train the third thing that we have to
talk<00:03:34.580> about<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:34.970> adequate<00:03:35.480> protein<00:03:35.900> intake

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
talk about is adequate protein intake

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.039 
talk about is adequate protein intake
right<00:03:36.549> there's<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.670> debate<00:03:37.880> as<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.660> how<00:03:38.900> much

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
right there's a debate as to how much

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.890 
right there's a debate as to how much
protein<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.860> really<00:03:40.370> need<00:03:40.580> we<00:03:41.360> can<00:03:41.390> all<00:03:41.720> agree

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
protein you really need we can all agree

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.350 
protein you really need we can all agree
that<00:03:42.140> at<00:03:42.739> least<00:03:42.980> one<00:03:43.310> gram<00:03:43.580> per<00:03:43.610> panel<00:03:44.000> lean

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
that at least one gram per panel lean

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.420 
that at least one gram per panel lean
body<00:03:44.690> weight<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.019> more<00:03:45.410> than<00:03:45.680> sufficient<00:03:45.980> if

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
body weight is more than sufficient if

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.789 
body weight is more than sufficient if
you<00:03:46.549> don't<00:03:46.910> have<00:03:47.299> enough<00:03:47.989> protein<00:03:48.260> we've<00:03:48.650> made

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
you don't have enough protein we've made

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.050 
you don't have enough protein we've made
videos<00:03:49.100> on<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:49.610> I'll<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:49.730> keep<00:03:49.940> it

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
videos on this so I'll just keep it

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.250 
videos on this so I'll just keep it
short<00:03:50.239> but<00:03:50.420> if<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.600> don't<00:03:50.840> have<00:03:51.019> enough

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
short but if you don't have enough

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.080 
short but if you don't have enough
protein<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:52.160> will<00:03:52.280> not<00:03:52.430> have<00:03:52.700> adequate

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
protein you will not have adequate

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.960 
protein you will not have adequate
amount<00:03:54.049> of<00:03:54.170> nutrients<00:03:54.799> in<00:03:54.920> order<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.489> build<00:03:55.670> or

maintain or keep the muscle when you're

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.920 
maintain or keep the muscle when you're
trying<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.459> lose<00:03:58.700> weight<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:59.269> there's<00:03:59.870> a

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
trying to lose weight so there's a

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.630 
trying to lose weight so there's a
debate<00:04:00.200> how<00:04:00.500> much<00:04:00.680> protein<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.370> should<00:04:01.400> be

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
debate how much protein you should be

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.759 
debate how much protein you should be
taken<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.209> but<00:04:02.510> at<00:04:02.630> least<00:04:02.870> one<00:04:03.290> gram<00:04:03.530> per<00:04:03.739> pound

of<00:04:04.220> lean<00:04:04.519> body<00:04:04.820> weight<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.180> think<00:04:05.330> about<00:04:05.480> it

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
of lean body weight and think about it

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.570 
of lean body weight and think about it
if<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.750> can<00:04:05.870> see<00:04:06.080> more<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.769> little<00:04:07.220> bit<00:04:07.310> beyond

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
if you can see more a little bit beyond

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.250 
if you can see more a little bit beyond
that<00:04:07.760> threshold<00:04:08.000> what's<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.870> worst<00:04:09.079> that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
that threshold what's the worst that

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.420 
that threshold what's the worst that
could<00:04:09.320> happen<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.799> you<00:04:09.920> right<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.250> eat<00:04:10.400> a

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
could happen for you right you eat a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.190 
could happen for you right you eat a
little<00:04:10.730> bit<00:04:11.000> more<00:04:11.180> protein<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.720> then<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:11.989> pee

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
little bit more protein and then you pee

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.900 
little bit more protein and then you pee
it<00:04:12.320> out<00:04:12.410> it's<00:04:12.769> no<00:04:12.920> big<00:04:13.130> deal

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
it out it's no big deal

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.150 
it out it's no big deal

more<00:04:37.500> important<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.010> supplements<00:04:38.580> right<00:04:38.760> if

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
more important the supplements right if

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
you could bottle sleep in to supplement

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.409 
you could bottle sleep in to supplement
it<00:04:41.010> would<00:04:41.130> be<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.400> best<00:04:41.669> supplement<00:04:42.270> out

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
it would be the best supplement out

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.840 
it would be the best supplement out
there<00:04:42.690> when<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.470> comes<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.979> making<00:04:44.250> gains

the gym being consistent managing that

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.260 
the gym being consistent managing that
stress<00:04:49.860> because<00:04:50.040> let's<00:04:50.220> face<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.490> training<00:04:51.120> is

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
stress because let's face it training is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.990 
stress because let's face it training is
a<00:04:51.300> stress<00:04:51.750> is<00:04:51.960> most<00:04:52.919> important<00:04:53.370> so<00:04:53.490> these

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
a stress is most important so these

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.790 
a stress is most important so these
three<00:04:54.300> factors<00:04:54.690> right<00:04:54.930> here<00:04:55.199> good<00:04:55.500> training

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
three factors right here good training

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.460 
three factors right here good training
adequate<00:04:56.699> protein<00:04:57.090> intake<00:04:57.510> right<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.320> then

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
adequate protein intake right and then

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.020 
adequate protein intake right and then

enough sleep are hugely crucial the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.250 
enough sleep are hugely crucial the
fifth<00:05:03.030> one<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.300> we<00:05:03.449> want<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.660> talk<00:05:03.750> about<00:05:03.810> and

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
fifth one that we want to talk about and

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.020 
fifth one that we want to talk about and
this<00:05:04.350> is<00:05:04.410> one<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:04.770> haven't<00:05:05.190> talked<00:05:05.370> about<00:05:05.520> in<00:05:05.880> a

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
this is one I haven't talked about in a

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.710 
this is one I haven't talked about in a
long<00:05:06.060> time<00:05:06.720> is<00:05:06.960> Jie<00:05:07.919> flux<00:05:08.250> having<00:05:08.639> a<00:05:08.789> high<00:05:09.060> g

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
long time is Jie flux having a high g

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.200 
long time is Jie flux having a high g
flux<00:05:10.020> which<00:05:10.320> means<00:05:10.590> consuming<00:05:11.370> in<00:05:11.490> burning

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
flux which means consuming in burning

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.180 
flux which means consuming in burning
more<00:05:12.389> calories<00:05:12.660> there<00:05:13.139> is<00:05:13.260> research<00:05:13.770> showing

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
more calories there is research showing

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.270 
more calories there is research showing
that<00:05:14.400> if<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.479> consume<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.320> also<00:05:16.530> burn<00:05:17.039> more

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
that if you consume but also burn more

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.950 
that if you consume but also burn more
calories<00:05:17.520> they'll<00:05:17.940> have<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> favorable<00:05:18.870> effect

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
calories they'll have a favorable effect

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.689 
calories they'll have a favorable effect
on<00:05:19.350> your<00:05:19.470> body<00:05:19.620> composition<00:05:20.070> what<00:05:20.550> am<00:05:20.639> I

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
on your body composition what am I

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.879 
on your body composition what am I
talking<00:05:20.760> about<00:05:21.090> it's<00:05:21.660> like<00:05:21.780> this<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.650> more

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
talking about it's like this the more

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.279 
talking about it's like this the more
you<00:05:23.070> move<00:05:23.220> around<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.940> more<00:05:24.180> you<00:05:24.360> do<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:25.260> more

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
you move around the more you do the more

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.589 
you move around the more you do the more
food<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:25.800> can<00:05:26.250> eat<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.700> still<00:05:27.090> be<00:05:27.270> in<00:05:27.479> a

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
food you can eat and still be in a

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.810 
food you can eat and still be in a
deficit<00:05:28.139> this<00:05:28.710> is<00:05:28.919> better<00:05:29.130> than<00:05:29.550> moving

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
deficit this is better than moving

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.390 
deficit this is better than moving
around<00:05:30.180> less<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:30.930> eating<00:05:31.620> less<00:05:31.770> in<00:05:32.010> order<00:05:32.220> to

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
around less and eating less in order to

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.120 
around less and eating less in order to
lose<00:05:32.550> weight<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:33.090> to<00:05:33.419> give<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.630> some<00:05:33.810> numbers

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
lose weight so to give you some numbers

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.680 
lose weight so to give you some numbers
if<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.460> consume<00:05:36.110> 3,000<00:05:37.110> calories<00:05:37.260> but<00:05:37.979> expend

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
if you consume 3,000 calories but expend

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.940 
if you consume 3,000 calories but expend
3,500<00:05:39.690> calories<00:05:39.780> that's<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.169> 500<00:05:40.650> calorie

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
3,500 calories that's a 500 calorie

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.940 
3,500 calories that's a 500 calorie
deficit<00:05:41.370> right<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:41.880> then<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.660> do<00:05:42.950> 2,000

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
deficit right and then you do 2,000

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.430 
deficit right and then you do 2,000
calories<00:05:44.430> you<00:05:44.880> consume<00:05:45.030> but<00:05:45.780> then<00:05:45.930> you<00:05:46.080> expand

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
calories you consume but then you expand

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.580 
calories you consume but then you expand
2500<00:05:47.280> calories<00:05:47.370> that<00:05:48.139> 3,000<00:05:49.139> calories<00:05:49.349> you

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
2500 calories that 3,000 calories you

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.230 
2500 calories that 3,000 calories you
consume<00:05:49.740> in<00:05:50.130> the<00:05:50.190> 3,500<00:05:50.910> will<00:05:51.090> have<00:05:51.210> a

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
consume in the 3,500 will have a

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.719 
consume in the 3,500 will have a
superior<00:05:51.870> effect<00:05:52.530> on<00:05:52.680> your<00:05:52.889> body<00:05:53.160> composition

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
superior effect on your body composition

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.580 
superior effect on your body composition
so<00:05:54.389> moving<00:05:54.750> around<00:05:54.930> I've<00:05:55.139> said<00:05:55.320> this<00:05:55.440> before

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
so moving around I've said this before

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.219 
so moving around I've said this before
that<00:05:55.770> nepa<00:05:56.430> non<00:05:57.330> exercise<00:05:57.780> physical<00:05:58.050> activity

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
that nepa non exercise physical activity

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.129 
that nepa non exercise physical activity
maybe<00:05:59.190> do<00:05:59.729> some<00:06:00.000> technique<00:06:00.419> practice<00:06:00.690> at<00:06:01.080> the

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
maybe do some technique practice at the

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.770 
maybe do some technique practice at the
gym<00:06:01.349> so<00:06:01.530> you<00:06:01.590> work<00:06:01.830> on<00:06:02.039> less<00:06:02.699> than<00:06:02.880> 50%<00:06:03.210> weight

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
gym so you work on less than 50% weight

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.290 
gym so you work on less than 50% weight
when<00:06:04.169> it<00:06:04.199> comes<00:06:04.440> to<00:06:04.530> the<00:06:04.620> squat<00:06:04.860> bench

composition but this is it this is the

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.510 
composition but this is it this is the
