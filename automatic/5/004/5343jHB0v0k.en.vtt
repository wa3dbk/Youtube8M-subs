maybe we'll see more backing from
Microsoft<00:03:30.109> now<00:03:30.349> they'll<00:03:30.590> have<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:31.010> larger

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
Microsoft now they'll have a larger

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.339 
Microsoft now they'll have a larger
budget<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.090> spend<00:03:32.150> they<00:03:32.569> won't<00:03:32.780> be<00:03:33.139> in<00:03:33.500> fear<00:03:34.040> of

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
budget to spend they won't be in fear of

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.479

constantly<00:03:36.349> having<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.709> get<00:03:37.129> every<00:03:37.370> single

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
constantly having to get every single

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.979 
constantly having to get every single
product<00:03:37.849> right<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.449> know<00:03:38.540> they<00:03:38.720> can<00:03:38.840> take

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
product right you know they can take

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.869 
product right you know they can take
more<00:03:39.319> risks<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:42.109> know<00:03:42.489> they<00:03:43.489> can<00:03:43.669> be<00:03:43.849> a

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
more risks and you know they can be a

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.400 
more risks and you know they can be a
bit<00:03:43.910> funky<00:03:44.480> with<00:03:44.629> their<00:03:44.750> products<00:03:45.169> again

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
bit funky with their products again

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.369 
bit funky with their products again
maybe<00:03:45.730> because<00:03:46.730> they're<00:03:47.090> not<00:03:47.180> scared<00:03:47.629> of<00:03:47.780> at

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
maybe because they're not scared of at

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.619 
maybe because they're not scared of at
any<00:03:49.280> moment<00:03:49.400> being<00:03:49.879> bought<00:03:50.150> out<00:03:50.180> because

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
any moment being bought out because

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.599 
any moment being bought out because
that's<00:03:50.840> already<00:03:51.019> gone<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.949> mean<00:03:52.489> their

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
that's already gone so I mean their

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.670 
that's already gone so I mean their
biggest<00:03:52.879> fear<00:03:53.239> we're<00:03:53.599> going<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.900> be<00:03:54.019> not

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
biggest fear we're going to be not

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.770 
biggest fear we're going to be not
selling<00:03:55.099> enough<00:03:55.159> devices<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.510> can<00:03:56.659> never

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
selling enough devices and you can never

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.839 
selling enough devices and you can never
go<00:03:56.900> wrong<00:03:57.049> with<00:03:57.290> trying<00:03:57.919> more<00:03:58.280> than<00:03:58.430> one<00:03:58.579> thing

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
go wrong with trying more than one thing

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.119 
go wrong with trying more than one thing

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
that Microsoft runs that maybe we'll

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.000
