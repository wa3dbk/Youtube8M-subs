00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.270 
that's why we chose the plie for horsy
the<00:01:20.670> plie<00:01:20.910> is<00:01:21.300> actually<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.560> gives<00:01:23.070> me

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
freedom in many many ways because it has

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
freedom in many many ways because it has
a<00:01:26.460> battery<00:01:26.910> which<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.990> only<00:01:28.020> having<00:01:28.590> a

concerned because I played in the
sprinklers<00:01:53.320> I've<00:01:53.590> gone<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:53.800> jet<00:01:54.130> skis<00:01:54.160> and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
sprinklers I've gone on jet skis and

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.540 
sprinklers I've gone on jet skis and
they've<00:01:55.390> worked<00:01:55.600> fine<00:01:55.980> the<00:01:56.980> other<00:01:57.130> good<00:01:57.340> thing

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
they've worked fine the other good thing

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.850 
they've worked fine the other good thing
about<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.970> is<00:01:58.120> it's<00:01:58.390> super<00:01:58.600> lightweight<00:01:58.960> for

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
about it is it's super lightweight for

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.790 
about it is it's super lightweight for
me<00:02:00.040> as<00:02:00.160> a<00:02:00.190> bilateral<00:02:00.670> having<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.780> need<00:02:02.590> that

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
me as a bilateral having a need that

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800 
me as a bilateral having a need that
slight<00:02:03.100> weight<00:02:03.370> is<00:02:03.640> super<00:02:04.030> important

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
slight weight is super important

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.720 
slight weight is super important
it<00:02:05.260> does<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.680> stumble<00:02:06.040> recovery<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.580> most

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
it does have stumble recovery and most

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.370 
it does have stumble recovery and most
people<00:02:07.000> say<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.150> don't<00:02:07.390> need<00:02:07.510> it<00:02:07.690> well<00:02:08.229> yeah<00:02:08.350> I

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
people say you don't need it well yeah I

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.950 
people say you don't need it well yeah I
do<00:02:08.500> because<00:02:09.070> there<00:02:10.060> are<00:02:10.090> times<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.540> kicks<00:02:10.750> in

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
do because there are times it kicks in

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.900 
do because there are times it kicks in
and<00:02:11.170> I'm<00:02:11.260> very<00:02:11.380> grateful<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:12.460> so

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
safety they have saved me several times

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160 
safety they have saved me several times
where<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.640> probably<00:02:18.820> cracked<00:02:19.390> my<00:02:19.570> head<00:02:19.600> open

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
where I probably cracked my head open

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.120 
where I probably cracked my head open
they're<00:02:21.040> definitely<00:02:21.310> safe<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.000> my<00:02:22.150> levels

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
they're definitely safe for my levels

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.280 
they're definitely safe for my levels
you<00:02:24.130> can't<00:02:24.400> really<00:02:24.730> make<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.360> decision<00:02:25.900> on<00:02:26.110> a

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
you can't really make a decision on a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.680 
you can't really make a decision on a
component<00:02:26.680> unless<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.280> try<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.910> for

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
component unless you try it and for

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.210 
component unless you try it and for
instance<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.260> feet<00:02:29.440> I'm<00:02:29.590> wearing<00:02:29.860> now<00:02:29.980> which

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
instance the feet I'm wearing now which

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.090 
instance the feet I'm wearing now which
are<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.840> Highlanders<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.080> love<00:02:32.560> them<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.860> never

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
are the Highlanders I love them I never

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.620 
are the Highlanders I love them I never
would<00:02:33.370> have<00:02:33.400> thought<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.150> wouldn't<00:02:34.510> love

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
would have thought that I wouldn't love

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.240 
would have thought that I wouldn't love
them<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:35.110> someone<00:02:35.350> had<00:02:35.590> mentioned<00:02:35.950> them<00:02:36.040> to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
them but someone had mentioned them to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.640 
them but someone had mentioned them to
me<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.820> wouldn't<00:02:37.780> not<00:02:37.990> give<00:02:38.170> them<00:02:38.320> up<00:02:38.440> for

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
me and I wouldn't not give them up for

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.740 
me and I wouldn't not give them up for
anything<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.970> reason<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.330> love<00:02:40.600> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
anything the reason I love the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.410 
anything the reason I love the
highlander<00:02:41.290> foot<00:02:41.680> or<00:02:42.160> feet<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.760> my<00:02:42.940> case<00:02:43.180> is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
highlander foot or feet in my case is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.870 
highlander foot or feet in my case is
because<00:02:43.840> they<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.860> shock<00:02:45.430> absorption

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
because they have shock absorption

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.690 
because they have shock absorption
forward<00:02:46.720> they<00:02:47.200> also<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.620> multiaxial<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:48.670> I

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
forward they also have multiaxial so I

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.220 
forward they also have multiaxial so I
can<00:02:48.970> actually<00:02:49.150> literally<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> split

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
can actually literally do a split

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.050 
can actually literally do a split
sideways<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.340> when<00:02:51.489> you're<00:02:51.640> on<00:02:51.760> uneven

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
sideways and when you're on uneven

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.690 
sideways and when you're on uneven
terrain<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:53.140> always<00:02:53.800> feel<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.070> my<00:02:54.400> feet<00:02:54.670> are

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
terrain I always feel like my feet are

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.210 
terrain I always feel like my feet are
flat<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.300> ground<00:02:55.560> part<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.680> being<00:02:56.860> able<00:02:56.980> to

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
flat on the ground part of being able to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.400 
flat on the ground part of being able to
do<00:02:57.340> what<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.610> can<00:02:57.790> do<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.150> having<00:02:58.480> some<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
do what I can do is having some of the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.710 
do what I can do is having some of the
greatest<00:02:59.620> component<00:03:00.250> around<00:03:00.610> I'm<00:03:01.450> very

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
greatest component around I'm very

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.930 
greatest component around I'm very
blessed<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.260> say<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.800> I'm<00:03:03.250> fortunate<00:03:03.640> to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
blessed to say that I'm fortunate to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.580 
blessed to say that I'm fortunate to
have<00:03:04.209> what<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.540> would<00:03:04.720> consider<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.260> top<00:03:05.290> of

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
have what I would consider the top of

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.430 
have what I would consider the top of
line<00:03:05.769> technology
