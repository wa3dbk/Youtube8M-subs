00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.999 
ride today in the heat so looks like we
are<00:00:25.480> good<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.599> go<00:00:26.630> with<00:00:27.050> those<00:00:27.199> sensors<00:00:27.650> but

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
are good to go with those sensors but

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.669 
are good to go with those sensors but
since<00:00:28.429> I<00:00:28.519> ordered<00:00:28.759> the<00:00:28.849> sensor<00:00:29.470> I'm<00:00:30.470> just

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
since I ordered the sensor I'm just

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.320 
since I ordered the sensor I'm just
going<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:30.920> change<00:00:31.550> all<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:31.789> sensors<00:00:32.119> out

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
going to change all the sensors out

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.060 
going to change all the sensors out
because<00:00:32.720> that's<00:00:33.020> how<00:00:33.200> I<00:00:33.230> am<00:00:33.530> I<00:00:33.740> guess<00:00:33.920> I'm
