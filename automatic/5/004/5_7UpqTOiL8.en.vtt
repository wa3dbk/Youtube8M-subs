00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.250
 so one too big portrait one is Aleks OTZ one had the guest is in 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.140
 Großlittgen 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.140
 Once I am not introduced he has a reputation 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.710
 of 84 percent in the subsequent period 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.540
 Hello Mr. Beck 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.220
 yes, an 85 percent in Germany or maybe in Switzerland 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.500
 of course, feel a lot 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.350
 yes who after German Television ago Yes, but I know 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.010
 yes the places local television and love 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.460
 there is a sign that you realize that here on individual groups 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.220
 Nowadays they are unusually common and now they are sitting here and not 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.890
 there because features interview people 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.500
 we come with it the ice 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.770
 i belonged to June people Oliver w 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.960
 I think mine and Orgass so not the Uecker so I can 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.070
 think I could imagine doing that Merkel also wants great fun 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.880
 So I am very curious and I am very happy to ask that he has a normal one 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.020
 so if i am mostly about the viewer he and other car and ours 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.340
 Grandson a Dr 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.289
 and so 17 looks familiar to the victims 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.720
 Ingolf Lück from the Wochenshow 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.900
 and then 4 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.830
 For years, there were a few sentences that thought so »day was 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.430
 use the USK too spontaneously 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.840
 from then it was about mother to use 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.260
 Of course there are things you just like he wants back to Lück 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.530
 and thanks Anke that was the thought that i even got more the rbi one has 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.880
 just say that and then you see 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.310
 Again, one reads but according to Morgan, the editor already 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.899
 and said 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.090
 but it is not supposed to do what we have said before 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.340
 after that the citizen should say what man man man man man man man and then over 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.749
 Adults as well as insane Petry now 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.200
 Peres had become a household word and people's percent 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.690
 that would have liked to hear remains despite all the topics for the Angeles 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.000
 So for years we have embittered one of their friends' men in percent 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.170
 the center of defense with the thank you but now is over and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.040
 Higher 2003 around the release, they go again and again in new edition 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.330
 He has been busy repeating his work for two years 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.070
 But now we have set it but a bit more peace 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.659
 So Kozená said it most urgently 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:29.780
 thanks Anke 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.780
 Dr and that was our wish it is already called Tradeshow Doors 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.169
 Often, however, especially a new program will be a new stage program 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.649
 most of the time they can withdraw that they feel better 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:44.349
 the premiere was again this year, too where this is all again 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.229
 and then what happens spontaneously what they are doing so and then suddenly 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.989
 then arises 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.739
 She is spontaneous, but otherwise she is the size of this one 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.300
 Dare cars together and want 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.350
 They have also defined texts very precisely because we are a very very 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.330
 weak time corset have on TV 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.230
 under the forecasts that we do not now 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.760
 Exuberantly talking percent in the 2 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.900
 because with us both in the as well as there are as with most other formats 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.510
 Takes in a TV show after kicked this football we come 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.120
 and now we too will be doing so was in next in World Cup 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.329
 Year but knows that live broadcast what 45 minutes are the topics 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:20.960
 hip, trendy, popular 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.970
 and you have to be content as a moderate services content after 43 30 out 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.400
 Percent after 43 44 once the broadcasting center just divide the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.079
 News purely Euro new singers Osterloh that there also work whom 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.179
 is quality and live broadcasts 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:37.899
 to moderate and just get out on time 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:41.090
 Alone, that's quite a challenge 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.599
 we see the UN there as well, that's the same thing 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.769
 Is funny 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.150
 Percent of everything I'm told right now 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.000
 Who else except the audience, yes and that shapes the audience and 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.929
 this is dirt immediately is uncut 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.529
 and that from but very different live one is of course much more nervous here 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.310
 percentage STA before the transmission line on the board one with the set one 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.930
 tested and then the man is called 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.260
 and Kate still 30 still 5 and now need then comes the musician 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.079
 a nightmare that's great fun 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.549
 I always know the work done show and three years 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.299
 everything live out then as a record so in matters of me 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.309
 do the work so the quiz show 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:23.339
 or Falko that's all on vocal show then afterwards 

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:24.380
 get cut 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.360
 Numan 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.949
 two and a half hours the account but still always possible that live 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:30.680
 not to make 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.250
 and as little as possible little out is new bike path between a first power 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.530
 it 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.830
 a lot of work in post-processing what all the money costs 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.999
 newer and second, the viewer will notice the same 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.400
 That's why the a Tent occasion is a live 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.680
 if he likes to live and loves to be with the latter or to do that 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.469
 but guilty, I also enjoyed it 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.469
 the city is prepared the mother to the water everything spontaneously 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.909
 who prepared the things that said the video monitors 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.250
 Of course you have to have information 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.349
 Munich otherwise 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.599
 Of course, there is also room for spontaneity, I believe the best thing 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.790
 Do it now, that's the best example 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.080
 Weiner has interviewed someone who needs to be interviewed in the interview 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.520
 and September so a point should be an adventurer and a point would be the one 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.790
 Both tight points Waldemar and be in between great opportunity 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.409
 Percent for improvisations and also to be real and to respond 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.050
 what the interviewee says and they do it only 4 8 has the penultimate race 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.070
 promises short 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.700
 So to look at the other and to say candlelight 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.319
 Color or do you have a teleprompter organize corp 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.460
 nobody has me in the ear than that careers gives little to the process 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.080
 Colleagues Mahler as well as can say without the one and only a few percent 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.580
 Percent of the major promise we have the weekly show we have complete 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.879
 us previously inscribed in the teleprompter yes% and other countries 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.699
 are Ungers in most shows I do so here was the guy 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:57.410
 even so 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.670
 that at the end of the day we have partially read the values ​​of skits 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.479
 from the teleporter played directly on the wall rh-reviewer or 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.639
 Therefore, he is very many authors that we have also filled out 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.669
 the standing balls as well as we talked 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.949
 never and hesitated legal bit sloppy should not be that 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.470
 you integrated these sketches for the first time 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.800
 and since they play there but mostly but the community Kerken right 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.559
 because I am somebody 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:26.089
 can look very bad so I have synonymous only one out almost this eye 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.719
 looks bright and dark and Faber looks very bad that k 3 Mainz 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:30.499
 watch and can 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:33.799
 No font Xing I can see just a lot of notice already that of 

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:34.949
 Child at so parr 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:37.150
 and percent he should be so 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.530
 I can send two hours with all camera settings 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.219
 good reinforcement for me 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:45.120
 and that's why I counted Interrail but then 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.529
 that is written so big so it does not fit that much 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:50.899
 Shell I have before that their car double victory 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:51.949
 Madame Gentlemen 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.550
 I look forward to the next sample iPhone Reusch tog until then
