00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.710
 about a quarter 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.550
 today which is not and 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.879
 nameless sabbaths 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.659
 in this huge encyclopedia under 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:12.799
 title bible 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.599
 the word bible is missing 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.019
 these are made-up words 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.839
 using the Greek word bible he what 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.239
 means book 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.499
 scientists were concocted 40 days before 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.289
 bible bible means candida 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.099
 this is not a name 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.919
 although today we use before them 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.210
 own but to the harsh bible like 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.559
 called car 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.380
 missing 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.380
 I would not say well, but if the book of God 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.890
 we will now prove that in any drives for god 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.530
 but let's first look at the pledge 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.819
 variants of this book 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:47.540
 the peasants themselves 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.970
 I have around you with that name 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.920
 is the favorite word of god 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.110
 with a big question 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.160
 familiar 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.870
 This question about how to Perm Jalil 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.780
 the book has been released to one of the leading 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 Jewish institutions of the year 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.880
 the idea of ​​writing a book is 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.060
 to prove that the bible is the word 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.190
 gods 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.350
 and go the way of reviewing the book 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.520
 Tatar movement 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.770
 I will say that I can give my answer I gave the answer 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.760
 to this question 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.880
 your brochure with the same name 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.760
 is killed by the word of god 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.140
 this brochure was supposed 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530
 give each of you 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.260
 if you fail its customs protection 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.130
 brochure after our meeting 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.689
 according to him failed to achieve 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.850
 to those who are just in the center 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.850
 Stanislav Zingel us free 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.600
 a brochure will give us an idea 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.470
 what is offensive what is on rab links 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.490
 gospel 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.770
 Muslims generally know little about it 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.650
 and especially since Victor 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.719
 recall the celtic gospel 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.560
 and what do these words mean 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.860
 Muslim woman do not know 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.880
 so if you want to know more about 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.030
 this is a book that will tell you 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.950
 oh by all like 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.299
 but then 40 40 Russians what they say about 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.370
 this bible book series 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.230
 civilian doctor 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.230
 quotes his book on the settings page 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.279
 Rosneft 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.590
 no doctor joseph parker 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.519
 This is proof that once 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.299
 have tried 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.569
 will tell about 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.879
 what is this book r 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.939
 American writes about it 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.589
 these cute people are fantastic 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.689
 eyes park tells that 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.309
 is a hybrid in terms of 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:29.679
 the content is more varied 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.059
 i became positive chanting situation and 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.489
 nothing else 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.249
 as for the content and 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.369
 diversity 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.149
 it was established that on saturday 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.219
 on the eve of winter so that there would be no 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.009
 on the topic that you never in your life 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.019
 not heard but anyway 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.799
 and the Norwegian media and blogs began to gain 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.609
 found nothing to say did not give 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.029
 the inevitability of the day of judgment 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.989
 I think it's just not the intended 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.169
 but despite the fact that after what not 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.689
 is ending 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.449
 civilian doctor 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:01.909
 regarding your book 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.510
 if anything in religious 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.749
 literature owned 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:05.869
 tula pie 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.829
 to make it ceremonial comparable to this 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.939
 we have to admit that nothing like that 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.769
 not 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.209
 but to prove either coercion that 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.409
 the bible is the word of god 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.049
 let's analyze 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.769
 forecast reflects 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.699
 frankly such a person let's 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:22.489
 seriously analyze 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.620
 championship this kind of these conclusions 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.219
 which he does 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.529
 Yes, because already simply hypnotizes 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.369
 people asked the words rather than the fun of words 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.719
 words but not telling what any meaning 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:34.859
 listen to 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.109
 according to him, tsoi will go mad 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.159
 incomprehensible inevitable 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.219
 and what are we talking about here you do not know 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.559
 and it will be brighter 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.159
 but now they considered these incomprehensible peacefully 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.969
 need to be called never in 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.599
 life would not hear would ever hear 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.499
 Boris live to be a hundred years old 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.679
 listen to 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:59.389
 moussa ibrahim u vadim and in march 2 5 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.089
 inches on the way is not enough because sima cash 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.729
 films 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.099
 from which will be performed 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.229
 inspector neman 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.329
 I am Michael Kristev st 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.329
 I just consider the first book 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.169
 Chronicles chapter first verse one of 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.459
 Scandinavian 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.450
 I want to know 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.670
 if in this huge audience this is one 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.449
 person 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.749
 hear surprisingly before 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:23.689
 just raise your hand 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:25.740
 and those projects with high 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.530
 best on them were probably bad 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.590
 because sim 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.099
 as he reported 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.680
 just amazing 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.779
 blame it on this book 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.769
 on the yacht next year was not easy 

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:40.180
 dictate it 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.389
 but what's even more amazing so to us 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.090
 nobody wants 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.690
 All last year, we still have to admit that we 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.870
 we will find sewage 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.900
 I think you a chance to earn since 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.699
 god is anyone who can bring up 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.229
 end of proximity to the center by 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.419
 the spread of Islam this one 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.490
 human 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.819
 I feel that this is exactly what is in it 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.080
 there was a day at the same time was referred to the fact that 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.020
 they asked Kosopkin 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.759
 a hundred pounds for each 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.249
 in the end, the court of the North Ossetia bible but be 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:11.800
 Someone delivered a kovach testimony 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.050
 about birth 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.569
 Dr. Schorsch

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:21.639
 another feature 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.360
 suffering with the application when that 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.159
 something simpler 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.449
 like the united arab emirates when 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.379
 this court in one of them 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.779
 where is the chair 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.580
 was the interpretation of the law 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.770
 muslim palestinian 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.349
 notice muslim 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.610
 it's time to sell 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.089
 historically 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:42.500
 the doctor asked me 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.370
 their number is fast 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.639
 no he noted 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.370
 does not hear 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.860
 shame on you 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.180
 said shame on you 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.389
 on something the pockets of a very foreigner 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:55.030
 asked 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.749
 why shouldn't we be ashamed 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:59.710
 it's your price machine 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.060
 what the bible says is 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.750
 the ancestors of almost all 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.150
 and you being the Palestinians are you not 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.849
 you know 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.089
 know these lovely names 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.469
 so he just read 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:14.909
 the doctor show that caused the creation or 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:15.710
 court 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.850
 because today you need just because 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.650
 something like that 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.849
 on the side of the list is this water 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.199
 Arabs it's time to society 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.520
 children of nations doctor show 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.289
 gives us the genealogy of nations 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.660
 of the world, that is, where the nations come from 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.670
 ballet more than 40 ka dwellers he 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.960
 I think what exactly got burned

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.149
 he spends over 40 different me there 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:47.300
 it always surprises the lawyer not 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.939
 mentions the name of one of his ancestors 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:50.919
 on the floor
