00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
on the ground so your but I think of

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.840 
on the ground so your but I think of
some<00:01:43.420> cool<00:01:43.770> useful<00:01:44.770> things<00:01:45.040> for<00:01:45.340> this<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
some cool useful things for this you

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.590 
some cool useful things for this you
create<00:01:49.150> like<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.330> maze<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:51.150> zigzag<00:01:52.150> through<00:01:52.390> if

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
create like a maze and zigzag through if

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.330 
create like a maze and zigzag through if
a<00:01:52.690> zombies<00:01:52.990> chasing<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.830> just<00:01:54.010> like<00:01:54.190> this

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
a zombies chasing you can just like this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.870 
a zombies chasing you can just like this
and<00:01:54.550> go<00:01:54.640> up<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.420> get<00:01:55.570> trapped<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.990> guy<00:01:56.880> so

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
and go up and get trapped in a guy so

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.530 
and go up and get trapped in a guy so
you<00:01:57.940> just<00:01:58.000> go<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.100> use<00:02:00.310> oh<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.910> just<00:02:01.000> move<00:02:01.210> so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
you just go and use oh you just move so

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.010 
you just go and use oh you just move so
slow<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:03.270> figure<00:02:04.270> out<00:02:04.300> what<00:02:04.420> percentage<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.930> is

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
slow I figure out what percentage it is

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.290 
slow I figure out what percentage it is
it's<00:02:05.200> just<00:02:05.260> as<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.460> see<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.610> just<00:02:06.820> utterly

it's just as you can see a just utterly

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.919 
it's just as you can see a just utterly
slow<00:02:07.660> you<00:02:07.870> just<00:02:08.019> can<00:02:08.379> stack<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.619> because<00:02:09.129> it's

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
slow you just can stack it because it's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.640 
slow you just can stack it because it's
X<00:02:10.929> like<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.140> block

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650
