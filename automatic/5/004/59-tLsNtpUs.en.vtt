00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.550
 there is a team that is working that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 are the forecasts taken ie 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.620

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.690
 people who want to be evacuated and who 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.150
 the necessary elements are planned 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.160
 so they can be there 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.070
 conditions not only in places 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.140
 that I mentioned where there are already evacuees 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 but they already announced us for example 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.910
 that the velodrome already has beds 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.880

 making mention and that we have taken the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.550
 decision to centralize calls from 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 the population and this is what we are 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.100
 asking the media 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.600
