in<00:00:04.940> this<00:00:05.210> video<00:00:05.450> I'll<00:00:05.930> be<00:00:05.990> demonstrating<00:00:06.700> five

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
in this video I'll be demonstrating five

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.390 
in this video I'll be demonstrating five
of<00:00:08.059> the<00:00:08.210> six<00:00:08.420> stages<00:00:08.719> of<00:00:09.590> fish<00:00:10.330> anesthesia<00:00:12.400> the

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
of the six stages of fish anesthesia the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.579 
of the six stages of fish anesthesia the
sixth<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:14.059> final<00:00:14.120> stage<00:00:14.780> of<00:00:14.990> course<00:00:15.259> is

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
sixth and final stage of course is

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.890 
sixth and final stage of course is
respiratory<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.730> then<00:00:17.450> cardiac<00:00:17.990> arrest<00:00:19.900> here

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
respiratory and then cardiac arrest here

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.689 
respiratory and then cardiac arrest here
I'm<00:00:21.050> adding<00:00:21.230> try<00:00:21.800> cane<00:00:22.100> with<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.519> nose

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
I'm adding try cane with a nose

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.730 
I'm adding try cane with a nose
sulfonate<00:00:23.359> otherwise<00:00:23.869> known<00:00:24.199> as<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.500> miserable

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
sulfonate otherwise known as a miserable

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.900 
sulfonate otherwise known as a miserable
-<00:00:25.420> at<00:00:26.420> a<00:00:26.720> rate<00:00:26.960> of<00:00:26.990> 100<00:00:27.320> milligrams<00:00:28.010> per<00:00:28.640> liter

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
- at a rate of 100 milligrams per liter

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.509 
- at a rate of 100 milligrams per liter
and<00:00:30.220> you<00:00:31.220> notice<00:00:31.670> that<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.059> fish<00:00:32.330> are

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 
and you notice that the fish are

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.920 
and you notice that the fish are
starting<00:00:34.519> to<00:00:34.879> feel<00:00:35.089> the<00:00:35.239> effects<00:00:35.510> of<00:00:35.750> the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
starting to feel the effects of the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.340 
starting to feel the effects of the
anesthetic<00:00:36.379> solution<00:00:37.960> they're<00:00:38.960> sort<00:00:39.290> of

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
anesthetic solution they're sort of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.039 
anesthetic solution they're sort of
swimming<00:00:39.620> aimlessly<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.580> crashing<00:00:41.479> into<00:00:41.930> the

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:42.049 
swimming aimlessly and crashing into the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.399 
swimming aimlessly and crashing into the
sides<00:00:42.350> of<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.799> tank<00:00:44.019> what<00:00:45.019> you'll<00:00:45.199> also

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
sides of the tank what you'll also

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.829 
sides of the tank what you'll also
notice<00:00:45.650> is<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:46.190> when<00:00:46.699> as<00:00:47.030> fish<00:00:47.360> become

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
notice is that when as fish become

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.439 
notice is that when as fish become
anesthetized<00:00:48.549> they<00:00:49.549> lose<00:00:49.760> their<00:00:49.940> ability<00:00:50.000> to

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
anesthetized they lose their ability to

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.060 
anesthetized they lose their ability to
maintain<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:52.360> level<00:00:53.360> in<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:54.140> water<00:00:54.619> column

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
maintain the level in the water column

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.750 
maintain the level in the water column
and<00:00:55.220> they'll<00:00:55.489> sink<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:56.119> the<00:00:56.269> floor<00:00:57.580> here<00:00:58.580> we've

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
and they'll sink to the floor here we've

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.030 
and they'll sink to the floor here we've
entered<00:00:59.180> stage<00:00:59.479> one<00:00:59.839> of<00:01:00.080> anesthesia<00:01:00.710> and

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
entered stage one of anesthesia and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.240 
entered stage one of anesthesia and
within<00:01:01.909> ten<00:01:02.269> seconds<00:01:02.689> we'll<00:01:03.019> jump<00:01:03.350> into<00:01:03.979> stage

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
within ten seconds we'll jump into stage

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.300 
within ten seconds we'll jump into stage
2<00:01:04.610> anesthesia<00:01:05.180> stage<00:01:06.049> 1<00:01:06.409> is<00:01:06.590> where<00:01:06.860> they<00:01:07.250> are

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
2 anesthesia stage 1 is where they are

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.210 
2 anesthesia stage 1 is where they are
lightly<00:01:07.790> sedated<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.650> slight<00:01:09.650> loss<00:01:09.980> of

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
lightly sedated the slight loss of

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.040 
lightly sedated the slight loss of
reactivity<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:11.030> stimuli<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:11.750> slight

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
reactivity to stimuli and slight

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.400 
reactivity to stimuli and slight
decrease<00:01:12.710> respiratory<00:01:13.460> rate<00:01:13.700> in<00:01:14.540> stage<00:01:14.960> 2

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
decrease respiratory rate in stage 2

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.010 
decrease respiratory rate in stage 2
there's<00:01:15.860> total<00:01:16.280> loss<00:01:16.550> of<00:01:16.760> reactivity<00:01:17.450> to

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
there's total loss of reactivity to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.650 
there's total loss of reactivity to
external<00:01:18.560> stimuli<00:01:19.130> an<00:01:19.400> exception<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.300> strong

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
external stimuli an exception of strong

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.040 
external stimuli an exception of strong
pressure<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.880> there<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.000> slight<00:01:23.300> decrease

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
pressure and there is a slight decrease

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.880 
pressure and there is a slight decrease
in<00:01:24.200> respiratory<00:01:25.010> rate<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.540> here<00:01:26.960> they're<00:01:27.200> more

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
in respiratory rate so here they're more

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.350 
in respiratory rate so here they're more
deeply<00:01:28.430> sedated<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:30.130> then<00:01:31.130> now<00:01:31.670> we'll<00:01:32.090> move

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
deeply sedated and then now we'll move

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.360 
deeply sedated and then now we'll move
into<00:01:32.920> stage<00:01:33.920> 3<00:01:34.580> of<00:01:36.159> anesthesia<00:01:37.720> here<00:01:38.720> this

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
into stage 3 of anesthesia here this

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.970 
into stage 3 of anesthesia here this
partial<00:01:40.370> loss<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.909> equilibrium<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.980> muscle

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
partial loss of equilibrium and muscle

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.840 
partial loss of equilibrium and muscle
tone<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.909> may<00:01:44.150> have<00:01:44.420> erratic<00:01:44.930> swimming<00:01:45.320> and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
tone you may have erratic swimming and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.210 
tone you may have erratic swimming and
increased<00:01:46.850> respiratory<00:01:47.510> rate<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.350> they

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
increased respiratory rate and they

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.040 
increased respiratory rate and they
react<00:01:49.580> illness<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.870> strong<00:01:51.290> stimuli<00:01:53.050> so

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
react illness to strong stimuli so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.640 
react illness to strong stimuli so
different<00:01:54.500> fish<00:01:54.710> may<00:01:54.950> react<00:01:55.850> differently<00:01:56.650> in

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
different fish may react differently in

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.219 
different fish may react differently in
this<00:01:57.860> case<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.450> sort<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.690> their<00:01:59.900> site

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
this case this is sort of their site

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.310 
this case this is sort of their site
Ettore<00:02:00.799> phase<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:01.490> they<00:02:02.240> don't<00:02:02.450> look<00:02:02.600> all<00:02:02.840> too

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
Ettore phase but they don't look all too

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.280 
Ettore phase but they don't look all too
excited<00:02:04.040> at<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.310> moment<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:05.270> some<00:02:05.510> some<00:02:06.049> fish

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
excited at the moment but some some fish

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.160 
excited at the moment but some some fish
do<00:02:06.530> go<00:02:06.890> through<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.539> so<00:02:08.539> you<00:02:08.569> can<00:02:08.780> see<00:02:08.959> that

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
do go through that so you can see that

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.220 
do go through that so you can see that
there's<00:02:09.409> still<00:02:09.860> spinal<00:02:10.489> reflexes<00:02:11.180> at<00:02:11.810> this

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
there's still spinal reflexes at this

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.160 
there's still spinal reflexes at this
stage

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
stage

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.250 
stage
so<00:02:14.560> we're<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:14.920> quite<00:02:15.310> at<00:02:15.550> stage<00:02:15.879> 4<00:02:16.330> yet<00:02:16.659> but

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
so we're not quite at stage 4 yet but

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.350 
so we're not quite at stage 4 yet but
depending<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.739> what<00:02:17.799> fish<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.819> have<00:02:19.030> like

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
depending on what fish you have like

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.199 
depending on what fish you have like
this<00:02:19.540> one<00:02:19.750> here<00:02:19.959> it's<00:02:20.230> not<00:02:20.409> reacting<00:02:20.890> at<00:02:20.980> all

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
this one here it's not reacting at all

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.710 
this one here it's not reacting at all
so<00:02:22.260> right<00:02:23.260> now<00:02:23.500> all<00:02:23.799> fish<00:02:24.400> are<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.879> stage<00:02:25.180> 4

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
so right now all fish are in stage 4

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.039 
so right now all fish are in stage 4
anesthesia<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.799> how<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.549> can<00:02:27.790> tell<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.360> if

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
anesthesia and how you can tell is if

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.539 
anesthesia and how you can tell is if
you<00:02:29.310> provide<00:02:30.310> some<00:02:30.580> pressure<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.780> its<00:02:31.959> tail

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
you provide some pressure on to its tail

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.650 
you provide some pressure on to its tail
you'll<00:02:33.549> see<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:34.299> there<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.540> no<00:02:35.220> reaction<00:02:36.220> to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you'll see that there is no reaction to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.619 
you'll see that there is no reaction to
the<00:02:37.660> slight<00:02:38.019> noxious<00:02:38.709> stimuli<00:02:39.519> that<00:02:39.849> we're

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
the slight noxious stimuli that we're

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.520 
the slight noxious stimuli that we're
applying<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:43.030> here<00:02:43.390> we<00:02:43.569> have<00:02:43.720> stage<00:02:44.049> 5

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
applying so here we have stage 5

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.819 
applying so here we have stage 5
anesthesia<00:02:45.360> where<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.480> respiratory<00:02:46.900> rate<00:02:47.170> is

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
anesthesia where the respiratory rate is

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.930 
anesthesia where the respiratory rate is
slow<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.620> irregular<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.709> for<00:02:54.129> surgery<00:02:54.670> you'll

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
slow and irregular so for surgery you'll

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.210 
slow and irregular so for surgery you'll
want<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.209> keep<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.480> fish<00:02:55.959> between<00:02:56.379> stage<00:02:56.680> 4

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
want to keep the fish between stage 4

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.089 
want to keep the fish between stage 4
and<00:02:57.549> stage<00:02:57.849> 5<00:02:59.010> and<00:03:00.010> not<00:03:00.690> too<00:03:01.690> far<00:03:01.959> into<00:03:02.410> stage<00:03:02.799> 5

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
and stage 5 and not too far into stage 5

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.110 
and stage 5 and not too far into stage 5
otherwise<00:03:03.700> you'll<00:03:04.030> run<00:03:04.239> into<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.569> danger<00:03:05.019> of

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
otherwise you'll run into the danger of

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.610 
otherwise you'll run into the danger of
respiratory<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.569> then<00:03:08.349> cardiac<00:03:08.980> arrest<00:03:09.489> and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
respiratory and then cardiac arrest and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.160 
respiratory and then cardiac arrest and
so<00:03:11.620> from<00:03:11.829> time<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.190> time<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.640> can<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:13.170> check

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
so from time to time you can just check

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.020 
so from time to time you can just check
whether<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.709> spinal<00:03:15.220> reflexes<00:03:15.730> are<00:03:15.940> still

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
whether the spinal reflexes are still

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.379 
whether the spinal reflexes are still
there<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.709> keep<00:03:18.519> an<00:03:18.639> eye<00:03:18.790> on<00:03:19.120> their

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
there and keep an eye on their

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.710 
there and keep an eye on their
particular<00:03:19.780> movement<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.940> now<00:03:22.150> we've<00:03:22.359> put<00:03:22.569> the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
particular movement so now we've put the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.720 
particular movement so now we've put the
fish<00:03:22.959> back<00:03:23.319> into<00:03:23.650> fresh<00:03:24.040> water<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:26.519> can<00:03:27.519> see

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
fish back into fresh water you can see

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.089 
fish back into fresh water you can see
the<00:03:27.910> respiratory<00:03:28.630> rate<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:28.930> slowly<00:03:29.410> it's

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
the respiratory rate is slowly it's

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.920 
the respiratory rate is slowly it's
pretty<00:03:30.370> much<00:03:30.459> way<00:03:30.700> through<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.060> reversal<00:03:31.720> of

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
pretty much way through the reversal of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.400 
pretty much way through the reversal of
anesthesia<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:34.120> your<00:03:34.269> attic<00:03:34.660> respiratory

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
anesthesia I get your attic respiratory

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.550 
anesthesia I get your attic respiratory
rates<00:03:36.840> sort<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.900> more<00:03:38.440> stronger<00:03:39.160> movements

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
rates sort of more stronger movements

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.440 
rates sort of more stronger movements
you<00:03:41.560> can<00:03:41.590> see<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.370> head's<00:03:42.609> part<00:03:43.060> of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
you can see that the head's part of

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.960 
you can see that the head's part of
shaking<00:03:44.169> from<00:03:44.349> side<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.769> side<00:03:44.950> that's<00:03:45.489> mainly

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
shaking from side to side that's mainly

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.670 
shaking from side to side that's mainly
because<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.359> their<00:03:46.599> particular<00:03:46.989> movements

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
because of their particular movements

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.000 
because of their particular movements
and<00:03:48.519> fish<00:03:48.910> slowly<00:03:49.269> regain<00:03:50.139> consciousness<00:03:50.859> and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
and fish slowly regain consciousness and

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:01.790 
and fish slowly regain consciousness and
they<00:03:51.940> take<00:03:52.209> off<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.599> start<00:03:52.989> swimming

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.670 

so<00:04:02.800> for<00:04:03.280> small<00:04:03.490> fish<00:04:03.760> it's<00:04:04.750> okay<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.200> let<00:04:05.470> them

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
so for small fish it's okay to let them

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.890 
so for small fish it's okay to let them
swim<00:04:06.100> like<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:06.550> but<00:04:06.850> damn<00:04:07.090> if<00:04:07.300> you<00:04:07.540> are<00:04:07.690> doing

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
swim like this but damn if you are doing

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.680 
swim like this but damn if you are doing
surgery<00:04:08.530> on<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:08.740> fish<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.400> your<00:04:10.120> client<00:04:10.570> is

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
surgery on a fish and your client is

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.740 
surgery on a fish and your client is
watching<00:04:11.260> at<00:04:12.130> this<00:04:12.280> stage<00:04:12.550> it's<00:04:12.850> advisable<00:04:13.300> to

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
watching at this stage it's advisable to

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.800 
watching at this stage it's advisable to
just<00:04:13.990> keep<00:04:14.530> your<00:04:14.680> hand<00:04:14.920> on<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.310> fish<00:04:15.810> because

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
just keep your hand on the fish because

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.830 
just keep your hand on the fish because
sometimes<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.440> might<00:04:17.560> appear<00:04:18.430> or<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.660> might

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
sometimes it might appear or it might

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
sometimes it might appear or it might
cause<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.650> client<00:04:21.519> some<00:04:21.730> distress<00:04:22.860> when

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
cause the client some distress when

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010 
cause the client some distress when
they're<00:04:24.040> waking<00:04:24.220> up<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.700> they<00:04:25.390> they're

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
they're waking up and they they're

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.240 
they're waking up and they they're
looking<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.470> little<00:04:26.590> bit<00:04:26.770> groggy

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
looking a little bit groggy

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.550 
looking a little bit groggy
so<00:04:27.490> swimming<00:04:28.060> around<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.970> here<00:04:31.270> now<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.780> fish

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
so swimming around so here now the fish

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.980 
so swimming around so here now the fish
are<00:04:32.860> pretty<00:04:33.160> much<00:04:34.140> recovered<00:04:35.140> fully
