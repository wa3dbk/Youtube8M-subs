00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.680
 We are in Central America in the city of 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.690
 panama the largest metropolis in the country 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.690
 It is ancient and modern at the same time 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.349
 here in one of the liveliest streets 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.899
 is the express leader the post 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.540
 of álex food the boss tells us that 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.960
 every day more than 600 people buy their 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.960
 snacks 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.079
 The specialty of the house is the patacón 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.079
 fried plantain 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.309
 rigoberto velázquez corte is the boss no 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.920
 found an engineer job 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.600
 environmental at the end of his studies 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.489
 Then he started selling patacones and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.270
 he could verify that the panama is a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.270
 safe business 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.979
 I like the patacón very much, we eat 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.509
 Pretty patacones I eat enough 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.189
 it matters the wta that breakfast is given 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.680
 lunch or dinner I quite like the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.410
 contact for that 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.880
 Rigoberto prepares about 800 bananas 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.880
 day for 25 years 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.259
 the raw material is one of the secrets 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.600
 I always buy better banana than there is in 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.550
 the market looking for the best quality 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.980
 to have a quality patacón 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.380
 after peeling the bananas and cutting them 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.880
 you have to fry them the oil has to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.880
 be as hot as possible 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 you have to have very good 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.920
 temperatures to get a patacón from 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 that quality and fry it very well in the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.020
 first fried 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.490
 things that when you put it back in 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.780
 oil take less time and make them 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.780
 toast as you wish 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.280
 after frying the bananas for 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:07.549
 first time they get crushed and go back to 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.769
 Fry crisp on the outside and soft 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.930
 inside they are served accompanied by 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.260
 meat and sausage and also girl a 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.420
 very sweet fruit sauce 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.420
 This is how patacones taste best 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.760
 because it really happens with him or that 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.520
 Panamanian like when sometimes we do not have 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.200
 money to spend 345 to a lunch and 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.230
 why we come here sometimes that is 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.480
 a faster meal I bought meat 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.840
 fried 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:46.879
 Same patacón because I like it more than the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:49.580
 rice is a plate each unit costs 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.709
 about 4 cents of balboa 3 cents of 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.890
 euros and the customer decides how many 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.890
 they want 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.250
 rigoberto no longer poses to work 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.410
 as an environmental engineer 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.250
 bananas are too much appreciated among 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.250
 young and adults
