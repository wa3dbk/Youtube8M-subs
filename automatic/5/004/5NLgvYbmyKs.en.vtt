00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.999
 viktoria 2013 beautiful e-bike program 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.769
 then now with bosch medium engine 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:22.869
 different equipment variants the 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.439
 For example, there are wheels for me too 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.810
 Very much liked with a nowinski 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.329
 stepless circuit and I'll show you 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.579
 Now for an example that is there 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.989
 also the prices in the meantime in 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.210
 areas move the right way 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.210
 become interesting 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.429
 in this model here power pack 300 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.620
 beautiful bosch it back 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.019
 luggage rack integrated so just not 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.500
 this version when you pack the battery 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:53.219
 sitting in the frame has a bike 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.129
 aluminum frame but also here 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.260
 reasonably integrated cable pulls and 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.809
 very great equipment from the front to 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.360
 behind, for example, the swallow 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.480
 Energizer tires the extra too 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.130
 designed for e bike in this case 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.470
 then with bosch motor and that is now 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.570
 but that fair special model 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.820
 behind in the series is the bbi break 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.770
 be on it in this case with the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.450
 hydraulic brake maybe we have 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.510
 luck and you will find dealers of things 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 Special model had set up the whole 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.560
 for the price of under 2000 euro namely 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.210
 In 1999 we honestly said that 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.310
 not seen here at the fair 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.280
 especially in the quality in the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.060
 equipment which I really like 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:48.100
 this year is the new bus system 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.350
 at the lcd display is now at the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.540
 motor system a push help 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.790
 integrated that is particularly interesting 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.280
 if you like smaller ram or something 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.810
 starts up and what I really like 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.080
 this is the possibility i have 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.120
 a very comfortable one 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.540
 i can be very ergonomic option 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.640
 to choose the appropriate level with 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.590
 the mg of bosch motor then supported 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.130
 there is an eco version there is one 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.340
 tour version sport version right up to the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.820
 turbo and the whole I can easily 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.710
 via these corresponding vip keys 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.020
 serve here 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.580
 I think the wheel concept as well 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.130
 especially here the equipment at 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.780
 viktoria really succeeded and me 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.980
 I assume he will be for everyone 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.140
 to be there 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.140
 to match and join in
