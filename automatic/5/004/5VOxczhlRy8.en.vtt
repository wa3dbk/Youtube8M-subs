00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
it you know so we did actually use a

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.280 
it you know so we did actually use a
camera<00:03:45.189> car<00:03:45.459> for<00:03:45.669> some<00:03:45.849> of<00:03:45.969> the<00:03:46.060> shots<00:03:46.299> but<00:03:47.139> in

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
camera car for some of the shots but in

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.659 
camera car for some of the shots but in
the<00:03:47.409> end<00:03:47.439> we<00:03:47.680> had<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:48.010> develop<00:03:48.370> our<00:03:48.639> own

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
the end we had to develop our own

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.240 
the end we had to develop our own
lightweight<00:03:49.239> rigging<00:03:49.769> on<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.859> motors<00:03:51.099> and

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
lightweight rigging on the motors and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.069 
lightweight rigging on the motors and
put<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.519> on<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.730> motorcycle<00:03:52.389> and<00:03:52.419> we<00:03:52.810> have<00:03:52.959> to

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
put it on the motorcycle and we have to

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.809 
put it on the motorcycle and we have to
you<00:03:53.290> know<00:03:53.409> all<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.159> shots<00:03:54.340> are<00:03:54.549> pretty<00:03:54.699> much

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
you know all the shots are pretty much

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.119 
you know all the shots are pretty much
bike<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.239> bike<00:03:55.449> that<00:03:56.319> for<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.799> for<00:03:57.099> the

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
bike to bike that for the for the

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.679 
bike to bike that for the for the
on-track<00:03:57.549> shots<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.180> that's<00:03:58.299> what<00:03:58.479> worked

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
on-track shots and that's what worked

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.839 
on-track shots and that's what worked
for<00:03:58.780> us<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.709> all<00:03:59.919> makes<00:04:00.129> the<00:04:00.340> bike<00:04:00.549> more

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
for us this all makes the bike more

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.219 
for us this all makes the bike more
unstable<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.989> runs<00:04:02.169> wide<00:04:02.530> in<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.859> corner

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
unstable and it runs wide in the corner

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.649 
unstable and it runs wide in the corner
so<00:04:05.229> even<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.829> go-kart<00:04:06.250> even<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.699> go-kart<00:04:07.479> rig

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
so even the go-kart even a go-kart rig

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.069 
so even the go-kart even a go-kart rig
just<00:04:08.049> kidding<00:04:08.379> could<00:04:08.650> hang<00:04:08.859> the<00:04:09.129> go-kart<00:04:09.699> rig

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
just kidding could hang the go-kart rig

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.740 
just kidding could hang the go-kart rig
does<00:04:11.079> work<00:04:11.409> in<00:04:11.650> certain<00:04:11.889> situations<00:04:12.750> in

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
does work in certain situations in

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.899 
does work in certain situations in
certain<00:04:14.590> speed<00:04:14.859> turns<00:04:15.129> it<00:04:15.430> can<00:04:15.609> hang<00:04:15.759> with<00:04:15.790> a

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
certain speed turns it can hang with a

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.969 
certain speed turns it can hang with a
motorcycle<00:04:16.599> but<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.169> know<00:04:17.289> we<00:04:17.440> had<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.620> chat

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
fulcrum you know yeah and that must have

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.530 
fulcrum you know yeah and that must have
been<00:04:56.680> somewhat<00:04:57.130> challenging<00:04:57.520> well<00:04:58.060> yeah<00:04:58.420> it

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
been somewhat challenging well yeah it

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.010 
been somewhat challenging well yeah it
was<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.530> way<00:04:59.680> the<00:05:00.370> rigging<00:05:00.940> was<00:05:01.120> we<00:05:01.600> had<00:05:01.780> to

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
was in a way the rigging was we had to

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.350 
was in a way the rigging was we had to
strut<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:03.010> bike<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.490> do<00:05:03.850> all<00:05:04.000> kinds<00:05:04.030> of

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
strut the bike and do all kinds of

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.970 
strut the bike and do all kinds of
things<00:05:04.450> our<00:05:04.750> mechanic<00:05:05.110> will<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.320> can<00:05:05.560> vary<00:05:05.740> with

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
things our mechanic will I can vary with

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
things our mechanic will I can vary with
is<00:05:06.190> a<00:05:06.220> master<00:05:06.990> fabricator<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.790> he<00:05:09.790> was<00:05:09.940> the

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
is a master fabricator and he was the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000 
is a master fabricator and he was the
one<00:05:10.120> who<00:05:10.150> put<00:05:10.480> most<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.230> rigging<00:05:11.680> together

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
one who put most of the rigging together

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.400 
one who put most of the rigging together
and<00:05:12.280> fortunately<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.690> technology<00:05:14.230> had

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
and fortunately the technology had

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.620 
and fortunately the technology had
really<00:05:14.920> pretty<00:05:15.190> much<00:05:15.400> just<00:05:15.640> cracked<00:05:15.970> out<00:05:16.330> onto

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
really pretty much just cracked out onto

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.150 
really pretty much just cracked out onto
the<00:05:16.720> streets<00:05:16.990> of<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.230> ice<00:05:17.350> cube<00:05:17.590> cams<00:05:17.890> the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
the streets of the ice cube cams the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.020 
the streets of the ice cube cams the
3ccd<00:05:18.760> high<00:05:19.180> def<00:05:20.340> camera<00:05:21.340> about<00:05:21.490> that<00:05:21.730> big<00:05:22.000> and

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
3ccd high def camera about that big and

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.550 
3ccd high def camera about that big and
then<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.480> record<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:23.020> problem<00:05:23.350> was<00:05:23.470> the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
then the record the problem was the

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.710 
then the record the problem was the
record<00:05:23.920> decks<00:05:24.160> which<00:05:24.700> a<00:05:24.910> year<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.420> a<00:05:25.450> half<00:05:25.510> ago

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
record decks which a year and a half ago

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.690 
record decks which a year and a half ago
word<00:05:26.020> that<00:05:26.200> big<00:05:26.500> now<00:05:26.770> they're<00:05:26.980> this<00:05:27.100> big<00:05:27.160> right

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
word that big now they're this big right

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.000 
word that big now they're this big right
but<00:05:28.240> but<00:05:28.780> we<00:05:28.960> so<00:05:29.230> we<00:05:29.350> had<00:05:29.470> to<00:05:29.500> deal<00:05:29.710> with<00:05:29.740> that

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
but but we so we had to deal with that

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.830 
but but we so we had to deal with that
weight<00:05:30.220> but<00:05:30.430> it<00:05:30.550> was<00:05:30.670> still<00:05:30.970> way<00:05:31.360> better<00:05:31.570> than

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
weight but it was still way better than

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.140 
weight but it was still way better than
the<00:05:32.020> first<00:05:32.770> twist<00:05:33.280> of<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.430> wrist<00:05:33.520> video<00:05:33.880> shot

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
the first twist of the wrist video shot

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.360 
the first twist of the wrist video shot
back<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:34.480> the<00:05:34.630> in<00:05:34.810> 1985<00:05:35.530> where<00:05:35.740> we<00:05:35.830> had<00:05:36.010> abated

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
back in the in 1985 where we had abated

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.730 
back in the in 1985 where we had abated
deck<00:05:36.730> that<00:05:36.910> was<00:05:37.030> this<00:05:37.300> big<00:05:37.540> you<00:05:38.320> know<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.590> Wade

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
deck that was this big you know and Wade

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.610 
deck that was this big you know and Wade
35<00:05:39.370> or<00:05:39.520> 40<00:05:39.790> pounds<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.330> was<00:05:40.450> it<00:05:40.690> was<00:05:40.870> it<00:05:41.470> was

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
35 or 40 pounds so it was it was it was

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.100 
35 or 40 pounds so it was it was it was
much<00:05:41.830> better<00:05:42.040> but<00:05:42.460> yeah<00:05:43.030> we<00:05:43.600> we<00:05:43.900> had<00:05:44.020> to

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
much better but yeah we we had to

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.230 
much better but yeah we we had to
pioneer<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.560> lot<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:44.920> stuff<00:05:45.160> for<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.580> for<00:05:46.210> the

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
pioneer a lot of stuff for the for the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.660 
pioneer a lot of stuff for the for the
shots<00:05:46.570> and<00:05:46.980> you<00:05:47.980> see<00:05:48.220> some<00:05:48.400> of<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.640> other

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
shots and you see some of the other

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.150 
shots and you see some of the other
shots<00:05:49.060> which<00:05:49.360> are<00:05:49.510> off<00:05:49.690> to<00:05:50.140> this<00:05:50.260> either<00:05:50.770> side

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
shots which are off to this either side

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.850 
shots which are off to this either side
of<00:05:51.190> the<00:05:51.400> bike<00:05:51.780> some<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.140> front<00:05:53.380> shots<00:05:53.620> are

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
of the bike some of the front shots are

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.240 
of the bike some of the front shots are
nice<00:05:54.340> high<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:54.940> down<00:05:55.240> shots<00:05:55.600> as<00:05:55.810> well<00:05:55.840> and<00:05:56.350> I

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
nice high and down shots as well and I

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.980 
nice high and down shots as well and I
don't<00:05:57.850> think<00:05:58.120> those<00:05:58.270> shots<00:05:58.540> have<00:05:58.690> ever<00:05:58.780> been

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
don't think those shots have ever been

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.540 
don't think those shots have ever been
done<00:05:59.140> before<00:05:59.170> but<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.830> was<00:05:59.920> perfect<00:06:00.280> for<00:06:00.370> what

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
done before but it was perfect for what

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.980 
done before but it was perfect for what
we<00:06:00.640> wanted<00:06:00.940> and<00:06:01.000> that's<00:06:01.150> that's<00:06:01.630> all<00:06:01.870> we

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
we wanted and that's that's all we

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.630 
we wanted and that's that's all we
weren't<00:06:02.170> trying<00:06:02.260> to<00:06:02.380> be<00:06:02.470> creative<00:06:02.680> except<00:06:03.430> for

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
weren't trying to be creative except for

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.940 
weren't trying to be creative except for
the<00:06:03.910> fact<00:06:04.090> that<00:06:04.270> we<00:06:04.450> wanted<00:06:04.750> to<00:06:04.780> show<00:06:05.050> what<00:06:05.710> it

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
the fact that we wanted to show what it

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.240 
the fact that we wanted to show what it
was<00:06:06.160> and<00:06:06.910> not<00:06:07.210> just<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:08.080> same<00:06:08.800> old<00:06:08.950> camera

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
was and not just the same old camera

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.590 
was and not just the same old camera
angles<00:06:09.520> don't<00:06:09.700> get<00:06:09.910> it<00:06:10.060> you<00:06:10.240> know<00:06:10.360> you<00:06:10.420> can

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
angles don't get it you know you can

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.210 
angles don't get it you know you can
follow<00:06:10.810> a<00:06:10.960> bike<00:06:11.200> around<00:06:11.380> the<00:06:11.680> track<00:06:11.920> but<00:06:12.100> if

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
follow a bike around the track but if

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.530 
follow a bike around the track but if
it's<00:06:12.340> not<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.610> right<00:06:12.640> angle<00:06:13.120> then<00:06:13.270> you<00:06:13.360> don't

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
it's not the right angle then you don't

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.360 
it's not the right angle then you don't
see<00:06:13.720> what<00:06:13.840> you<00:06:13.930> want<00:06:14.140> to<00:06:14.200> see<00:06:14.440> so<00:06:14.710> that<00:06:15.250> was

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
see what you want to see so that was

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.190 
see what you want to see so that was
that<00:06:15.580> was<00:06:15.790> the<00:06:15.850> that<00:06:16.180> was<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.570> challenge<00:06:16.780> for

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
that was the that was the challenge for

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.760 
that was the that was the challenge for
sure<00:06:17.350> on<00:06:17.530> on<00:06:17.770> all<00:06:17.980> that<00:06:18.130> on<00:06:18.250> bike<00:06:18.460> rigging<00:06:18.820> and

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
sure on on all that on bike rigging and

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.200 
sure on on all that on bike rigging and
but<00:06:20.770> it<00:06:20.830> worked<00:06:21.010> yeah<00:06:21.850> I'm<00:06:22.390> happy<00:06:22.960> with<00:06:23.080> it
