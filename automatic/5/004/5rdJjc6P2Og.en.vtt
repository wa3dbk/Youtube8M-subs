hello<00:00:05.860> my<00:00:06.070> name<00:00:06.190> is<00:00:06.220> Paul<00:00:06.520> coholic<00:00:06.820> and<00:00:07.150> this

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.480 
hello my name is Paul coholic and this

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.360 
hello my name is Paul coholic and this
is<00:00:07.630> the<00:00:07.750> bespoke<00:00:08.050> multi-touch<00:00:08.590> framework<00:00:09.070> Inc

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
is the bespoke multi-touch framework Inc

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.180 
is the bespoke multi-touch framework Inc
demonstration<00:00:10.120> Inc<00:00:10.809> is<00:00:11.139> a<00:00:11.170> degenerate<00:00:11.980> case

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
demonstration Inc is a degenerate case

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.830 
demonstration Inc is a degenerate case
of<00:00:12.370> multi-touch<00:00:12.790> so<00:00:13.030> I've<00:00:13.120> got<00:00:13.300> a<00:00:13.330> multi-touch

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
of multi-touch so I've got a multi-touch

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.150 
of multi-touch so I've got a multi-touch
table<00:00:14.050> here<00:00:14.349> you<00:00:14.470> can<00:00:14.590> see<00:00:14.769> the<00:00:14.800> various

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
table here you can see the various

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.880 
table here you can see the various
points<00:00:15.400> of<00:00:15.550> contact<00:00:16.000> that<00:00:16.090> I've<00:00:16.240> got<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:16.890> I've

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
points of contact that I've got and I've

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.540 
points of contact that I've got and I've
created<00:00:18.279> a<00:00:18.580> a<00:00:18.939> single<00:00:19.779> touch<00:00:20.550> component

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
created a a single touch component

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.120 
created a a single touch component
within<00:00:21.700> that<00:00:22.169> multi-touch<00:00:23.169> framework<00:00:23.590> now

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
within that multi-touch framework now

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.710 
within that multi-touch framework now
you<00:00:24.189> can<00:00:24.430> see<00:00:24.579> I've<00:00:24.700> got<00:00:24.730> several<00:00:25.390> points<00:00:25.570> of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
you can see I've got several points of

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.569 
you can see I've got several points of
contact<00:00:26.200> but<00:00:26.380> if<00:00:26.470> I<00:00:26.560> if<00:00:26.919> I<00:00:27.009> reduce<00:00:27.189> that<00:00:27.520> to

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
contact but if I if I reduce that to

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.190 
contact but if I if I reduce that to
just<00:00:27.880> a<00:00:27.970> single<00:00:28.149> point<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.540> contact<00:00:28.599> i've<00:00:29.050> got

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
just a single point of contact i've got

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.319 
just a single point of contact i've got
a<00:00:29.230> bit<00:00:29.380> of<00:00:29.470> visualization<00:00:30.130> here<00:00:30.340> that<00:00:30.910> shows

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
a bit of visualization here that shows

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.760 
a bit of visualization here that shows
me<00:00:31.599> a<00:00:32.130> stroke<00:00:33.130> information<00:00:33.760> kind<00:00:33.970> of<00:00:34.030> just

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
me a stroke information kind of just

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.350 
me a stroke information kind of just
analogy<00:00:35.770> to<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:35.920> pen<00:00:36.250> where<00:00:36.520> I'm<00:00:36.670> creating<00:00:37.270> a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
analogy to a pen where I'm creating a

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.630 
analogy to a pen where I'm creating a
pen<00:00:37.750> stroke<00:00:38.050> every<00:00:38.740> time<00:00:38.980> I<00:00:39.010> press<00:00:39.340> and<00:00:39.550> then

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
pen stroke every time I press and then

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.310 
pen stroke every time I press and then
release<00:00:39.940> off<00:00:40.150> at<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.390> table<00:00:40.690> this

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
release off at the table this

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.380 
release off at the table this
application<00:00:41.560> then<00:00:42.070> is<00:00:42.370> a<00:00:42.640> training<00:00:43.060> and

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
application then is a training and

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.120 
application then is a training and

right<00:00:47.410> hand<00:00:47.530> corner<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:48.010> can<00:00:48.100> see<00:00:48.160> I've<00:00:48.460> got<00:00:48.490> a

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
right hand corner you can see I've got a

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.270 
right hand corner you can see I've got a
simple<00:00:49.390> UI<00:00:49.600> that<00:00:50.290> shows<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.890> different

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
simple UI that shows the different

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.180 
simple UI that shows the different
symbols<00:00:51.700> that<00:00:52.060> I<00:00:52.180> can<00:00:52.390> train<00:00:52.720> so<00:00:53.380> I've<00:00:53.530> got<00:00:53.740> a<00:00:53.920> B

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
symbols that I can train so I've got a B

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.730 
symbols that I can train so I've got a B
C<00:00:54.490> X<00:00:54.760> Y<00:00:55.060> Z<00:00:55.090> and<00:00:55.600> this<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.810> arbitrary<00:00:56.290> I<00:00:56.380> can<00:00:56.590> have

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
C X Y Z and this is arbitrary I can have

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.060 
C X Y Z and this is arbitrary I can have
any<00:00:56.980> training<00:00:57.880> training<00:00:58.570> symbols<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.200> I've

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
any training training symbols and I've

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.790 
any training training symbols and I've
trained<00:01:00.430> 10<00:01:00.940> samples<00:01:01.540> for<00:01:02.020> a<00:01:02.050> B<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:02.380> C<00:01:02.470> but

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
trained 10 samples for a B and C but

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.999 
trained 10 samples for a B and C but
none<00:01:03.010> for<00:01:03.310> XY<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:03.880> Z<00:01:04.030> so<00:01:04.600> let's<00:01:05.049> let's<00:01:05.680> look<00:01:05.890> at

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
none for XY and Z so let's let's look at

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.719 
none for XY and Z so let's let's look at
how<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:06.280> works<00:01:06.549> if<00:01:06.729> I've<00:01:06.880> got<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.549> try

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
how this works if I've got a and I try

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.029 
how this works if I've got a and I try
to<00:01:09.789> classify<00:01:09.999> that<00:01:10.450> then<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.560> classifies<00:01:12.009> it

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
to classify that then it classifies it

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.569 
to classify that then it classifies it
as<00:01:12.249> a<00:01:12.850> if<00:01:13.719> i<00:01:13.869> type<00:01:14.079> if<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.530> key<00:01:15.069> in<00:01:15.100> be<00:01:16.439> alright

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
as a if i type if I key in be alright

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.080 
as a if i type if I key in be alright
classifies<00:01:18.579> it<00:01:18.609> as<00:01:18.880> B<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:20.369> C<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:21.670> then<00:01:21.969> of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
classifies it as B and C and then of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.969 
classifies it as B and C and then of
course<00:01:22.119> crosswise<00:01:22.899> it<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:23.109> see<00:01:23.289> but<00:01:23.469> I<00:01:23.679> don't

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
course crosswise it to see but I don't

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.709 
course crosswise it to see but I don't
know<00:01:24.130> about<00:01:24.249> Z<00:01:24.759> yet<00:01:24.999> the<00:01:25.179> machine<00:01:25.450> learning

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
know about Z yet the machine learning

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.899 
know about Z yet the machine learning
algorithm<00:01:26.109> hasn't<00:01:26.409> been<00:01:26.499> trained<00:01:26.799> for<00:01:27.039> Z<00:01:27.310> so

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
algorithm hasn't been trained for Z so

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.760 
algorithm hasn't been trained for Z so
if<00:01:27.999> I<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.149> draw<00:01:28.659> something<00:01:29.049> that<00:01:29.079> might<00:01:29.619> look

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
if I to draw something that might look

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.459 
if I to draw something that might look
like<00:01:29.829> a<00:01:30.039> Z<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:31.270> misclassified<00:01:31.929> this<00:01:32.139> is<00:01:32.289> hey<00:01:32.439> I

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
like a Z it misclassified this is hey I

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.709 
like a Z it misclassified this is hey I
don't<00:01:32.859> know<00:01:33.100> what<00:01:33.249> as<00:01:33.340> he<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:33.609> so<00:01:34.149> let's<00:01:34.389> train

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
don't know what as he is so let's train

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.709 
don't know what as he is so let's train
Z<00:01:34.749> real<00:01:35.380> quick<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.880> I'm<00:01:36.969> going<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.179> do<00:01:37.270> Trent

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
Z real quick and I'm going to do Trent

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.010 
Z real quick and I'm going to do Trent
10<00:01:38.170> training<00:01:38.560> samples<00:01:39.009> for<00:01:39.219> Z<00:01:39.429> and<00:01:39.840> I've<00:01:40.840> gotta

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
10 training samples for Z and I've gotta

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.690 
10 training samples for Z and I've gotta
commit<00:01:41.380> sample<00:01:41.920> button<00:01:42.579> down<00:01:42.759> here<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.369> I'm

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
commit sample button down here so I'm

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.190 
commit sample button down here so I'm
just<00:01:45.969> committing<00:01:46.479> these<00:01:46.600> samples<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.170> the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
just committing these samples to the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.670 
just committing these samples to the
machine<00:01:47.560> learning<00:01:47.859> algorithm

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.570 

so<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:53.090> four<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.920> can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.220> number<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
so that's four I can see the number of

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.310 
so that's four I can see the number of
training<00:01:56.790> examples<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.360> I've<00:01:57.480> got<00:01:57.690> up<00:01:57.840> there

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.280 

now<00:02:01.320> Z<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> single<00:02:02.430> stroke<00:02:03.050> but<00:02:04.050> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
now Z is just a single stroke but you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.780 
now Z is just a single stroke but you
can<00:02:04.440> see<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.620> a<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:04.950> B<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.550> previous

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
can see that a and B in the previous

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.970 
can see that a and B in the previous
example<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.360> there<00:02:06.480> a<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:06.870> B<00:02:07.050> or<00:02:07.620> multi

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
example is there a and B or multi

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.999 
example is there a and B or multi
strokes<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.460> there's<00:02:09.380> it's<00:02:10.380> not<00:02:10.560> limited<00:02:10.890> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
strokes and there's it's not limited to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
strokes and there's it's not limited to
just<00:02:11.160> single<00:02:11.520> stroke<00:02:11.760> gestures<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.270> can<00:02:12.390> have

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
just single stroke gestures you can have

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.440 
just single stroke gestures you can have
as<00:02:12.660> many<00:02:13.160> strokes<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.340> you'd<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.390> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
as many strokes as you'd like in a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.940 
as many strokes as you'd like in a
particular<00:02:15.630> training<00:02:15.990> example<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.800> now<00:02:16.920> that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
particular training example so now that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.210 
particular training example so now that
is<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:18.390> ten<00:02:18.630> training<00:02:18.930> samples<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.470> Z<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.920> now

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
is is ten training samples for Z and now

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.160 
is is ten training samples for Z and now
if<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.430> try<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.640> classify<00:02:20.940> Z<00:02:23.930> turn<00:02:24.930> off<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
if I try to classify Z turn off the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.560 
if I try to classify Z turn off the
classified<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.709> correctly<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.190> e<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
classified it correctly is e so this is

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.699 
classified it correctly is e so this is
just<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.870> demonstration<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:29.370> Inc

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
just the demonstration of a Inc

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.570 
just the demonstration of a Inc
component<00:02:31.709> that's<00:02:31.770> built<00:02:32.100> into<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
component that's built into the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.480 
component that's built into the
multi-touch<00:02:33.000> framework
