stream here of course but i want a flat

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.219 
stream here of course but i want a flat
world<00:01:03.659> and<00:01:04.129> heads<00:01:05.129> void<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.570> had<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> put

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
works now don't you guys how to build

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
works now don't you guys how to build
this<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:16.170> start<00:01:16.470> you're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> need<00:01:17.280> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
this to start you're going to need to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
this to start you're going to need to
find<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> nice<00:01:18.000> area<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.570> dig<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.930> three

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
find you a nice area just dig it three

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.350 
find you a nice area just dig it three
by<00:01:19.320> three<00:01:19.560> hole<00:01:20.900> all<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.160> then

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
by three hole all right then

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.230 
by three hole all right then
since<00:01:24.230> wrong<00:01:24.470> flat<00:01:24.800> world<00:01:25.060> we're<00:01:26.060> going<00:01:26.150> to

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
since wrong flat world we're going to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.670 
since wrong flat world we're going to
have<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.510> do<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:26.810> little<00:01:27.020> differently<00:01:27.530> you're

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
here in the middle and throw your fence

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.730 
here in the middle and throw your fence
gates<00:01:58.250> on<00:01:58.520> just<00:01:58.970> for<00:01:59.119> your<00:01:59.240> bridge<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.740> then

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
hop down and put signs directly under

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.889 
hop down and put signs directly under
those<00:02:04.220> gates<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:05.030> like<00:02:05.150> this

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899

perfect now okay though your water into
the<00:02:20.810> ne<00:02:21.260> corner<00:02:21.349> at<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.920> bottom<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.370> doesn't

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
the ne corner at the bottom it doesn't

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.790 
the ne corner at the bottom it doesn't
matter<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.209> just<00:02:23.360> make<00:02:23.510> sure<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.810> dig<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.230> 2<00:02:24.620> by
