00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
was to basically make the end-user part

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.779 
was to basically make the end-user part
manufacturer<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.810> part<00:00:22.350> designer<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:23.550> just

material that I can use I want to get a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
material that I can use I want to get a
bit<00:00:48.870> more<00:00:49.050> involved<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> process<00:00:50.219> of

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
bit more involved in the process of

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.970 
bit more involved in the process of
making<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.239> designing<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> I've<00:00:52.649> given<00:00:52.890> them

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
making and designing so I've given them

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
making and designing so I've given them
sort<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> basic<00:00:53.699> idea<00:00:54.329> basic<00:00:54.989> skeleton

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
sort of a basic idea basic skeleton

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.250 
sort of a basic idea basic skeleton
template<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> they're<00:00:56.850> making<00:00:57.260> essentially

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
template and they're making essentially

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
template and they're making essentially
finished<00:00:58.770> their<00:00:59.010> own<00:00:59.190> product<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.910> whatever

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
finished their own product with whatever

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020 
finished their own product with whatever
leftover<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.949> everyday<00:01:02.280> product<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.850> may

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
leftover and everyday product they may

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.310 
leftover and everyday product they may
have<00:01:08.030> for<00:01:09.030> me<00:01:09.150> what's<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.689> important<00:01:10.229> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
have for me what's really important is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.859 
have for me what's really important is
to<00:01:10.350> create<00:01:10.950> some<00:01:11.760> sort<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> wareness<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
to create some sort of wareness of the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
to create some sort of wareness of the
amount<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.170> stuff<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.650> producing<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
amount of stuff that we producing and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
amount of stuff that we producing and
the<00:01:14.580> amount<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.790> stuff<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.900> need

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the amount of stuff we don't really need

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.620 
the amount of stuff we don't really need
so<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.310> allows<00:01:17.580> people<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.390> may<00:01:18.540> have

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
so just allows people to they may have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.590 
so just allows people to they may have
had<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:18.930> box<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.470> cray<00:01:19.770> lid<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.970> maybe<00:01:21.390> like

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
had some box or cray lid or maybe like

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
had some box or cray lid or maybe like
an<00:01:21.750> old<00:01:21.900> lamp<00:01:22.140> shade<00:01:22.350> from<00:01:22.500> another<00:01:22.830> thing

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
an old lamp shade from another thing

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
an old lamp shade from another thing
they<00:01:23.310> could<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:24.119> easily<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.840> fit

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
they could very easily just just fit

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.960 
they could very easily just just fit
that<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.409> which<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.130> usually<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.490> twisted

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
that on which is usually this twisted

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
that on which is usually this twisted
wire<00:01:27.180> which<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.810> clips<00:01:28.560> onto<00:01:28.829> these<00:01:29.189> rubber

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
wire which just clips onto these rubber

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
wire which just clips onto these rubber
bits<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.540> idea<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.990> not<00:01:31.140> first<00:01:31.380> too

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
bits the idea was not first too

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.840 
bits the idea was not first too
expensive<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> raw

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
expensive because you can see the raw

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
expensive because you can see the raw
materials<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.960> mean<00:01:34.200> that's<00:01:34.380> rebar<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
materials are I mean that's rebar you

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.210 
materials are I mean that's rebar you
can<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.670> local<00:01:36.710> shop<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.950> for

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
can get that at the local shop for for

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.550 
can get that at the local shop for for
next<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> nothing

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
next to nothing

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.010 
next to nothing
yeah<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:41.460> dead<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.899> whole

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
yeah I'm not dead in there the whole

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.889 
yeah I'm not dead in there the whole
idea<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.680> these<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.430> want<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.689> come

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
idea is that these I want to just come

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.350 
idea is that these I want to just come
off<00:01:46.020> easily<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
off easily so that you don't have to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
off easily so that you don't have to
keep<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.259> whole<00:01:49.350> life<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.740> mean

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
nobody wants the same piece for the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.490 
nobody wants the same piece for the
whole<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.570> mean<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:51.990> example<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.439> could

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
whole lot I mean for example I could

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380 
whole lot I mean for example I could
take<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.979> one<00:01:53.189> off<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.369> change<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.030> they

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
take this one off and change it they

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.530 
take this one off and change it they
just<00:01:54.570> come<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> changed<00:01:56.119> they're<00:01:57.119> scraped

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
just come in to changed they're scraped

just come in to changed they're scraped
over<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.189> there<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.460> level<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.969> skill<00:02:00.329> you

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
over here there is a level of skill you

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.700 
over here there is a level of skill you
would<00:02:00.600> need<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.259> need<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.649> able

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
would need because you need to be able

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.819 
would need because you need to be able
to<00:02:01.950> drill<00:02:02.790> holes<00:02:03.540> there's<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:04.409> hole<00:02:04.619> over

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
to drill holes there's one hole over

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.530 
to drill holes there's one hole over
there<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.490> three<00:02:05.820> holes<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.270> these

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
there and in three holes with these

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
there and in three holes with these
bowls<00:02:06.780> go<00:02:06.990> through<00:02:07.320> everything<00:02:07.920> else<00:02:08.099> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
bowls go through everything else is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.210 
bowls go through everything else is
supplied<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.539> guess<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.590> main<00:02:10.709> thing<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
supplied so I guess the main thing is to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.980 
supplied so I guess the main thing is to
just<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:12.090> able<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
just be able to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.200 
just be able to
use<00:02:13.110> your<00:02:13.260> imagination<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.700> does<00:02:14.910> create

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
use your imagination and it does create

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.780 
use your imagination and it does create
awareness<00:02:15.510> about<00:02:15.980> everyday<00:02:16.980> products<00:02:17.640> that

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
awareness about everyday products that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420 
awareness about everyday products that
are<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.060> lying<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.600> street<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.430> perhaps

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
are just lying in the street and perhaps

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.730 
are just lying in the street and perhaps
how<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:21.030> could<00:02:21.210> just<00:02:21.420> maybe<00:02:22.380> give<00:02:22.620> them

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
how we could just maybe give them

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.290 
how we could just maybe give them
another<00:02:22.980> life<00:02:23.250> or<00:02:23.610> we<00:02:23.850> could<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.090> look<00:02:24.150> at

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
another life or we could just look at

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.410 
another life or we could just look at
them<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.540> different<00:02:24.720> way<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.910> really

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
them in a different way I just really

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.840 
them in a different way I just really
like<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.720> idea<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.020> seeing<00:02:31.770> how<00:02:32.310> could<00:02:32.640> we

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
like the idea of seeing how could we

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.670 
like the idea of seeing how could we
take<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.480> strain<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:34.020> centralized

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
take the strain of centralized

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.280 
take the strain of centralized
production<00:02:35.670> which<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.360> basically<00:02:36.720> what<00:02:36.990> what

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
production which is basically what what

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.950 
production which is basically what what
we<00:02:37.410> do<00:02:37.560> all<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.830> time<00:02:37.980> now<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.780> instead<00:02:39.780> of

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
we do all the time now and instead of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.470 
we do all the time now and instead of
shipping<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> more<00:02:41.520> material<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.150> then

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
shipping like a more material to then

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.050 
shipping like a more material to then
user<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.960> can<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.290> part<00:02:43.560> ship<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.580> basics

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
user you can just part ship the basics

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000 
user you can just part ship the basics
and<00:02:45.210> then<00:02:45.330> they<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.720> use<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.500> they<00:02:46.530> prefs

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and then they can use what they prefs

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.010 
and then they can use what they prefs
got<00:02:47.250> lying<00:02:47.520> in<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.760> garage<00:02:47.970> or<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.900> their

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
got lying in a garage or and their

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.390 
got lying in a garage or and their
shared<00:02:49.290> or<00:02:49.500> something

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
shared or something

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.290 
shared or something
I<00:02:51.350> like<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.530> idea<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:53.060> decentralized<00:02:54.060> in

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
I like the idea of decentralized in

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.480 
I like the idea of decentralized in
production<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.110> instead<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.440> having<00:02:56.130> one<00:02:56.310> big

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
production so instead of having one big

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.040 
production so instead of having one big
head<00:02:56.910> office<00:02:57.240> where<00:02:57.390> everything<00:02:57.630> gets<00:02:57.720> made

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
head office where everything gets made

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.620 
head office where everything gets made
or<00:02:58.260> one<00:02:58.380> factory<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.400> made<00:02:59.670> you're<00:03:00.150> kind<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
or one factory it's made you're kind of

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.290 
or one factory it's made you're kind of
providing<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.410> template<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:03.120> end

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
providing a template and then the end

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.170 
providing a template and then the end
users<00:03:03.750> sort<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.620> pitching<00:03:05.550> in<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.880> such<00:03:06.060> an

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
users sort of pitching in to such an

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.630 
users sort of pitching in to such an
extent<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.930> adding<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.890> material<00:03:08.460> and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
extent of of adding the material and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.880 
extent of of adding the material and
perhaps<00:03:09.180> an<00:03:09.330> idea<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.080> then<00:03:10.380> also<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.680> bit<00:03:10.800> of

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
perhaps an idea and then also a bit of

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.070 
perhaps an idea and then also a bit of
labor<00:03:11.100> into<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.760> making<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.480> more<00:03:12.600> there<00:03:15.080> it's

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
labor into it making it more there it's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.290 
labor into it making it more there it's
just<00:03:16.260> really<00:03:16.410> exploring<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.550> possible<00:03:18.000> to

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
just really exploring is it possible to

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.600 
just really exploring is it possible to
put<00:03:18.930> forward<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> customer<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.190> user<00:03:20.370> like

put forward to a customer and user like

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.850 
put forward to a customer and user like
just<00:03:20.880> half<00:03:21.210> a<00:03:21.360> product<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:22.170> saying<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.710> want
