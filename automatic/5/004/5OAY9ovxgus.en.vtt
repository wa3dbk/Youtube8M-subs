clear<00:00:39.469> base<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:41.989> it's<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> come

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
clear base is not it's not what you come

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.440 
clear base is not it's not what you come
to<00:00:43.800> expect<00:00:44.219> from<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.730> lot<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.120> buds<00:00:45.329> now

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
to expect from a lot of your buds now

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.110 
to expect from a lot of your buds now
from<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> lot<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> isolation<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.489> buds<00:00:47.700> anyway

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

from a lot of isolation your buds anyway
like<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.440> seen<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> call<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.100> isolation

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
like I seen you call this isolation

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
like I seen you call this isolation
because<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:51.090> did<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.350> restrict<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
because they did not restrict the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
because they did not restrict the
hearing<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:53.640> most<00:00:53.910> definitely<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.329> not

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
hearing they most definitely are not

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.889 
hearing they most definitely are not
sure<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.850> they're<00:00:57.480> twenty<00:00:57.780> eight<00:00:57.840> dollars

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.110 
sure but they're twenty eight dollars
and<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.440> most<00:00:58.649> def<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:59.010> glitch<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and they most def not glitch but like I

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.390 
and they most def not glitch but like I
said<00:01:00.210> they're<00:01:00.660> twenty<00:01:01.020> eight<00:01:01.170> dollars<00:01:01.609> $31

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
said they're twenty eight dollars $31

I'm<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:05.909> crazy<00:01:06.150> over<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> fact<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.909> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I'm not crazy over the fact that the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.130 
I'm not crazy over the fact that the
microphone<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.450> everything's<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> left

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
microphone and everything's on the left

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
microphone and everything's on the left
side<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.100> good<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.610> thought

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
side but it's not just as good I thought

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
side but it's not just as good I thought
it<00:01:12.150> was<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.510> much<00:01:12.659> larger<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.320> deal

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it was going to be much larger of a deal

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
it was going to be much larger of a deal
it<00:01:13.770> was<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> first<00:01:14.430> husband<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:15.030> like

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it was when I first husband was like

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
it was when I first husband was like
crap<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.530> wrong<00:01:16.650> side<00:01:16.950> but

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
crap it's on a little wrong side but

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.929 
crap it's on a little wrong side but
it's<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.680> used<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939

more isolating which you just have to be

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.020 
more isolating which you just have to be
careful<00:02:19.620> they're<00:02:20.040> not<00:02:20.190> as<00:02:20.340> isolated<00:02:20.490> as<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
shores I have set of SC 5 30 shores that

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.450 
shores I have set of SC 5 30 shores that
our<00:02:26.280> phenomenal<00:02:26.760> sounding<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.800> they're

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
our phenomenal sounding but and they're

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.590 
our phenomenal sounding but and they're
not<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:29.730> isolating<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.420> my<00:02:30.660> image<00:02:31.140> ones<00:02:32.600> but

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
not as isolating is my image ones but

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.830 
not as isolating is my image ones but
they<00:02:34.380> don't<00:02:34.680> sound<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.160> good<00:02:35.570> but<00:02:36.570> there's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
they don't sound as good but there's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.060 
they don't sound as good but there's
nothing<00:02:37.110> wrong<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.260> us<00:02:37.440> how<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.650> sound<00:02:37.920> is

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
nothing wrong with us how the sound is

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.710 
nothing wrong with us how the sound is
it's<00:02:38.700> satisfying<00:02:41.060> I've<00:02:42.060> heard<00:02:42.270> some<00:02:42.450> people

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
it's satisfying I've heard some people

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.450 
it's satisfying I've heard some people
say<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.290> build<00:02:43.530> quality<00:02:43.710> wasn't<00:02:44.220> much

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
say that the build quality wasn't much

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.220 
say that the build quality wasn't much
on<00:02:44.700> them<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> me<00:02:45.150> they<00:02:45.330> seem<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:45.960> they<00:02:46.110> will

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
on them to me they seem like they will

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.070 
on them to me they seem like they will
last<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.590> while<00:02:46.740> as<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:48.120> whether<00:02:48.690> they<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:48.960> or

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
last a while as to whether they do or

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.650 
last a while as to whether they do or
not<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.580> their<00:02:51.240> remains<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.630> seen<00:02:51.900> I

not to their remains to be seen I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.760 
not to their remains to be seen I
would<00:02:54.660> recommend<00:02:54.810> them<00:02:55.640> simply<00:02:56.640> because<00:02:56.670> they

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
would recommend them simply because they

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.160 
would recommend them simply because they
they're<00:02:58.770> definitely<00:02:59.460> better<00:02:59.820> than<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.360> Apple
