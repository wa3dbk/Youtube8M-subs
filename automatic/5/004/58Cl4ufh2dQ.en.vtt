00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
into the burn pot as it feeds and then

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.540 
into the burn pot as it feeds and then
it'll<00:00:51.690> stop<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.379> it'll<00:00:52.620> run<00:00:52.890> itself<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
it'll stop and it'll run itself out and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.720 
it'll stop and it'll run itself out and
shut<00:00:53.760> itself<00:00:54.000> down<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> right<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.340> about

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
shut itself down so right now for about

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.029 
shut itself down so right now for about
$1,500<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.670> window<00:00:59.670> colored<00:01:00.239> stove

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
$1,500 for that window colored stove

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
$1,500 for that window colored stove
that's<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> middle<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.059> tool<00:01:03.600> room

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that's in the middle of my tool room

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.060 
that's in the middle of my tool room
just<00:01:04.250> taking<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.369> space<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:07.070> it'd

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
just taking up space right now so it'd

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.830 
just taking up space right now so it'd
probably<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> nice<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.299> unit<00:01:09.540> for

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
probably be a nice little unit for

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480 
probably be a nice little unit for
something<00:01:10.200> small<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.950> were<00:01:11.159> trying<00:01:11.400> to

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
out and total time it just got really

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.890 
out and total time it just got really
cold<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.830> also<00:02:09.010> have<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.580> one<00:02:09.750> hooked<00:02:10.750> up

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
cold and I also have this one hooked up

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.860 
cold and I also have this one hooked up
to<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> meter<00:02:11.470> where<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.010> can<00:02:12.310> actually<00:02:12.460> see<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
to a meter where I can actually see the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.170 
to a meter where I can actually see the
watt<00:02:14.110> stead<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.470> being<00:02:14.590> used<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.640> it's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
watt stead of being used on that it's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.670 
watt stead of being used on that it's
100<00:02:17.550> 1718<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.570> it'll<00:02:19.810> go<00:02:19.930> up<00:02:19.960> another<00:02:20.320> 30

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
100 1718 and it'll go up another 30

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.200 
100 1718 and it'll go up another 30
every<00:02:20.950> time<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.310> targa<00:02:21.880> feeds<00:02:22.620> one<00:02:23.620> 145<00:02:24.430> so

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
every time the targa feeds one 145 so

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.210 
every time the targa feeds one 145 so
just<00:02:25.600> wanting<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.380> electric<00:02:26.800> about

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
just wanting that on the electric about

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.440 
just wanting that on the electric about
117<00:02:28.000> watts<00:02:28.300> I'm<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.690> 25<00:02:29.110> watts<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.620> run<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.950> so

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
117 watts I'm in 25 watts to run it so

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.720 
117 watts I'm in 25 watts to run it so
that's<00:02:31.450> not<00:02:31.690> bad<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.230> not<00:02:32.410> again<00:02:33.400> she<00:02:33.550> just

gotta shut it down and clean it up to
store<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.500> line<00:02:44.710> keep<00:02:45.280> burning<00:02:45.640> clean<00:02:45.850> but

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
store that line keep burning clean but

store that line keep burning clean but
the<00:02:47.170> window<00:02:47.440> unit<00:02:47.830> sounded<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.850> good<00:02:49.060> idea

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the window unit sounded like a good idea

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.750 
the window unit sounded like a good idea
it<00:02:49.510> seemed<00:02:49.690> like<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> good<00:02:50.110> idea

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
it seemed like a good idea

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.720 
it seemed like a good idea
definitely<00:02:51.760> cost<00:02:52.030> me<00:02:52.210> some<00:02:52.390> money<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.730> it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
definitely cost me some money but it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.790 
definitely cost me some money but it
didn't<00:02:55.180> work<00:02:55.210> out<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.660> me<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:56.020> got<00:02:56.380> too<00:02:56.500> big<00:02:56.680> of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
didn't work out for me I got too big of

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.670 
didn't work out for me I got too big of
an<00:02:56.890> area<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.430> I'm<00:02:58.000> drying<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.390> heat<00:02:58.570> this<00:02:59.470> one

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
an area and I'm drying the heat this one

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.490 
an area and I'm drying the heat this one
here<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.160> actually<00:03:00.520> had<00:03:00.940> come<00:03:01.120> across<00:03:02.880> actually

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
here I actually had come across actually

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.130 
here I actually had come across actually
picked<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.590> up<00:03:05.739> very<00:03:05.950> very<00:03:06.250> cheap<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:07.140> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
picked this up very very cheap and it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.440 
picked this up very very cheap and it
runs<00:03:08.410> like<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.620> gem<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.160> did<00:03:09.790> nothing<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.090> clean

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
runs like a gem I did nothing but clean

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.540 
runs like a gem I did nothing but clean
it<00:03:10.600> out<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.890> I'll<00:03:11.980> make<00:03:12.130> sure<00:03:12.250> everything

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
it out and and I'll make sure everything

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.780 
it out and and I'll make sure everything
was<00:03:12.640> good<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.910> go<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.360> that's<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.550> one

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
was good to go and that's it so this one

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.370 
was good to go and that's it so this one
here<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.030> really<00:03:16.750> really<00:03:17.110> like<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:19.080> why<00:03:20.080> was<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
here I really really like so why was the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.449 
here I really really like so why was the
window<00:03:20.650> unit<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:22.060> $1,500<00:03:23.050> if<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:23.890> had<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.100> real

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
window unit for $1,500 if you had a real

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.449 
window unit for $1,500 if you had a real
small<00:03:24.850> place<00:03:25.260> or<00:03:26.260> maybe<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.650> mobile<00:03:27.040> home<00:03:27.220> or

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
heat one large room maybe that'd be good

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.880 
heat one large room maybe that'd be good
and<00:03:31.360> if<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.630> had<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.870> time<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.230> baby<00:03:32.440> said<00:03:32.769> it

the unit is so small and the burn pot is
so<00:04:51.840> small<00:04:52.110> doesn't<00:04:52.530> have<00:04:52.620> an<00:04:52.740> ash<00:04:52.980> collection

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640

acid to go and they won't run that long
without<00:04:58.770> shutting<00:04:59.220> itself<00:04:59.400> down<00:04:59.520> because<00:05:00.030> of

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
without shutting itself down because of

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.130 
without shutting itself down because of
the<00:05:00.950> defect<00:05:01.950> in<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.310> hop-up<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.630> we<00:05:03.780> put<00:05:04.050> the
