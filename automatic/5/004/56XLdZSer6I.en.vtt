00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.709
 Here we have a Nikon rangefinder one 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.280
 rare piece hard to find very 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:14.980
 quoted highly valued for its quality 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.930
 and I wanted to be the second improved version 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.780
 Nikon s the first nor with 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.310
 rangefinder 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.710
 if we take a look at the part 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.100
 top of the camera we start by the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.900
 loading lever and film advance 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.340
 in which you see a reel counter 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.870
 additional that reaches up to 36 pictures 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.180
 here we see the trigger with lock 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.699
 and the r comes to mean at the time of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.280
 rewind the reel we look for the 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.769
 position was and we can rewind the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 Reel the speed dial as you 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:55.649
 can see has possesses possesses x for flash 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 30 as the lowest speed 60 125 250 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:04.229
 500 thousand coupling shoes for flashes 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.650
 the typical anagram of nikon precious and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.900
 the sensitivity disk is here there is a 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.870
 small symbol 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.180
 ep and there are some who say that he's coming to talk 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.790
 that this version of the camera was 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.550
 for export if we give you the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.850
 back and we see the camera's range finder 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.710
 visual and rangefinder already much bigger 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.560
 that in the previous model the no that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.850
 which we will talk about at another time and 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.530
 here we see one of the jewels of this 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.900
 camera that is 5 centimeters 1.4 nor with 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.970
 original in a cosmetic state and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.670
 spectacular mechanic 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.700
 we remove the leather case that is still 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.440
 retains after 30 or 40 years that 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.170
 this camera must walk in very good 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.780
 state 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 the base of the camera with a sneak to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 know what kind of movie is the one 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.670
 it's set like this is up to 21 100 200 or so 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.390
 to be 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.640
 on the back the lid and the viewfinder 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.640
 of a huge quality and huge size 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.830
 to a shoot as the first day if 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.830
 we open the camera 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.210
 and we remove the back cover and access 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.640
 directly 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.470
 at the time of placing the reel it 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.880
 would place on this side would be wrapped 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.920
 here and here we have the system 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.430
 cloth curtains but huge 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.430
 quality 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.830
 that as can be seen by the sound 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.930
 It is very good condition 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.170
 and logically this piece gives the impression 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.700
 that has been very little used and 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.980
 It is very well preserved 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.550
 we replace the lid with much 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.550
 tranquility 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.939
 we turn 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.939
 and we close 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.390
 and with that 2 with 5 centimeters objectives 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.530
 nikon's metro camera and the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.500
 origin of an odyssey 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.300
 finally I want to record the camera 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.160
 placed next to a nikon d3 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.110
 so you can imagine what is the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.360
 evolution of photography in this case 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.650
 we talk about a telemetro camera with 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.650
 35 mm reel 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.530
 is between 35 and 45 years old depending on the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.390
 Year of manufacture and serial number 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:38.670
 and next to a huge nikon d3 of 12 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.670
 megas with abysmal quality 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.120
 nor sooner or later we all go back to 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.120
 nico
