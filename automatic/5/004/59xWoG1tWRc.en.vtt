00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:12.790
 I Since it has been doing towards the TV that 10 years 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:15.600
 I want to make the film flow like air with the same nuance as TV. 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.600
 I thought 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.240
 Is it stage setting? 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:29.720
 The battle scene seems to be rough and just warm and written 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:34.360
 To Fu say whether trying what Fu to fight in what wind locations and cinematic-looking 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.360
 Be aware that it will be better 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.710
 That was left to do is I'll have the Tteyuu made of this theater 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.610
 that 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:49.030
 That port that was the teacher's door painting and that that consists of Kushinase that that jumps and jumps out bread 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.970
 The book frontispiece 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.770
 I couldn't move that at the time of the television series 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:04.350
 It is the best thing that we moved that 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.350
 I think that I remain in my heart for the time of this theater 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.290
 Maybe I think it's the first and the last 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.090
 In that sense that 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.909
 The character went broke the character that has been cultivated for 10 years 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.469
 I was able to experience that I was able to break 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.469
 Even though I think that was lucky 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.390
 The villains 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:35.850
 I'm thinking of talking with that character because that's a character 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:40.110
 Play pickle in the form that broke the character considerably 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:48.360
 In a word, I changed my voice and did the play pickle 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.380
 Wait for a while, and that day Hyuga will order this character in the voice of Hyuga 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.680
 I did , so the game 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.530
 Noisily and everyone to have imagined 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.950
 Because I did something different from the play 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.630
 A lot of people were on the radio wave, but that's why 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.630
 On the contrary, it was interesting though 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:15.210
 That is largely from the flow of the scenario of that teacher 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:20.220
 The emotions from the first 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:23.510
 I think that it means that you have the emotional change that flowed in the digest 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:29.150
 But also from the market 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:34.000
 If you are looking at it, it is the feeling that it was the best emotion 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.000
 I do hope you know the real'm thinking 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.060
 By all means 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.470
 It is said that Yutaka Date will take this opportunity 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.300
 Remember that you are the director who is doing that TV 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.940
 What 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.360
 I think I'm glad if you can remember 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.480
 road to ninja naruto the movie take a look at the theater 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.480
 Please give me 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.489
 Get your nine tails 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.750
 Shino's together 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.590

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.590
