00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
think ever since Taylor Swift you know

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.610 
think ever since Taylor Swift you know
came<00:04:44.040> out<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.580> pretty<00:04:45.330> much<00:04:45.570> said<00:04:46.350> yeah<00:04:46.560> I'm

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
came out and pretty much said yeah I'm

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.740 
came out and pretty much said yeah I'm
taking<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:47.100> direct<00:04:47.400> approach<00:04:47.700> at<00:04:48.150> pop<00:04:48.479> I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
taking a direct approach at pop I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.480 
taking a direct approach at pop I
definitely<00:04:49.260> think<00:04:49.440> it's<00:04:54.680> any<00:04:55.680> ways<00:04:55.919> like<00:04:56.370> I

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
definitely think it's any ways like I

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.920 
definitely think it's any ways like I
said<00:04:56.700> in<00:04:56.820> beginning<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.240> video<00:04:57.389> this<00:04:57.780> is

said in beginning of the video this is

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.020 
said in beginning of the video this is
definitely<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.680> different<00:04:59.220> approach<00:04:59.460> from<00:04:59.910> the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
definitely a different approach from the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.840 
definitely a different approach from the
last<00:05:00.240> couple<00:05:00.630> reaction<00:05:01.530> videos<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.979> did<00:05:02.040> but<00:05:02.760> if
