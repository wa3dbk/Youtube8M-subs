00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello friends of the fans welcome to dvd 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.589
 review and further trailer check or 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.790
 better said isa check for more than 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.809
 a teaser is not out yet 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.809
 Michael bully herbigs new movie baaria 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.540
 I'm really worried about that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.540
 not only health 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.719
 that had a problem because others call me 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.449
 make bohlen's habitat yesterday 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.059
 tomorrow she's suddenly got one 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.289
 Guardian Angel 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.460
 They think of this decision 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.679
 these are not an appearance he is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.750
 simply he's just always there has 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.039
 unfortunately a real buddy now 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.320
 you can not be guardian 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.879
 choose 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.659
 I have not opened it 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.659
 worse than I thought 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.620
 Honestly I think the teaser is cool 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.510
 he shows a little more than once 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.130
 just a moody consequence 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.960
 like tesa often no he loses a little 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.940
 Little about the story and I like 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.860
 the feeling of michael bully can be herbicidal 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.450
 it is always inspirational 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.100
 man who when he is in front of the camera 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.810
 Often leaves the right feeling and 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.430
 That's why I'm timing for gates 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.930
 curious if his really 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.420
 successful film strategies 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.010
 past time also in the year 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.290
 Introduce in 2013 and I 'll tell you 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.420
 new changed humor standards and 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.400
 speed can adapt but the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.530
 tiger lets hope for that 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.330
 tells the story of eddie one 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.640
 young man does not really like that 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.200
 he really wants it even if he almost wants that 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.570
 A guardian angel was near death 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.130
 just stupid that his guardian buddy that 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.869
 for the first time and not so 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 correctly experienced is thus one is 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.350
 whole lot of turbulent everyday situations 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.030
 I foreseen but I think the look 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.979
 this trailer is here so far 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.150
 not yet so that you can say there 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.680
 looks typical German now that 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.000
 I think so right now in a comedy 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.740
 where I sometimes suspected that too 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 one or the other slightly dramatic 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.700
 tragic moment between the lines 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.259
 will also give good hope and 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.550
 I'm curious what the strip 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.590
 can the online industry by the way 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.500
 expected from the 25th 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.060
 december 2013 in German cinemas 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.680
 it is always very noticeable 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.720
 when watching movies directly to on christmas 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.280
 laid when the people anyway all a little 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.540
 little contemplative traveling and 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.130
 maybe also for Christmas short 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.660
 then the necessary change still in the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.190
 bag have to go as a cinema 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.900
 probably a strategic one here 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.030
 very interesting placement am times 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.080
 curious what in this writes like in 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.640
 the comments 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.410
 otherwise it was the now of me with 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.610
 my little teaser check to buddy 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.140
 if the trailer is out there 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.310
 probably a few more infos 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.989
 which I also raushauen here again 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.220
 can like a thumb as if you 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.510
 let this check make it 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.250
 we do not like to stay over last 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.510
 movie reviews over or with twitter and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.310
 facebook still want a bit over 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.080
 but do not want to write this film 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.120
 or my second channel if you do not have one 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.610
 let videos of and with me miss 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.530
 it will stay if only it decides 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.450
