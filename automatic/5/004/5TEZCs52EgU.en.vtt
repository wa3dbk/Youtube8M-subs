00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
chose that because originally is a very

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.030 
chose that because originally is a very
small<00:03:05.760> group<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:06.709> Christians<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.920> were

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
choosing to do this and the idea being

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.069 
choosing to do this and the idea being
that<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.890> know<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.940> Gideon's<00:03:12.629> case<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.989> was

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
that you know in Gideon's case it was

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.500 
that you know in Gideon's case it was
not<00:03:13.230> by<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.890> strength<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.970> people<00:03:15.359> that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
not by the strength of the people that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.940 
not by the strength of the people that
the<00:03:15.750> victory<00:03:16.049> was<00:03:16.170> accomplishing<00:03:16.620> listen

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
the victory was accomplishing listen

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.520 
the victory was accomplishing listen
through<00:03:17.099> God's<00:03:17.280> power<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.180> they<00:03:18.510> chose<00:03:19.109> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
through God's power so they chose the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.250 
through God's power so they chose the
that<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.340> was<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.579> through<00:03:20.849> our<00:03:21.299> efforts<00:03:22.019> that

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260
