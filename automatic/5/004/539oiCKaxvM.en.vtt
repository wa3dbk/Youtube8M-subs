pannier spurn and the made a very good

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
job of it and of course in the last 30

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.030 
job of it and of course in the last 30
or<00:01:08.180> 40<00:01:08.270> years<00:01:08.600> it's<00:01:09.530> become<00:01:09.619> quite

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
or 40 years it's become quite

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.149 
or 40 years it's become quite
naturalized<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:12.290> background<00:01:12.740> here<00:01:12.920> you

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
naturalized in the background here you

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.420 
naturalized in the background here you
can<00:01:13.310> see<00:01:13.490> one<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.850> big<00:01:14.090> excavators<00:01:15.430> just

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
can see one of the big excavators just

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.160 
can see one of the big excavators just
like<00:01:16.670> cleaning<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.270> overburden<00:01:17.899> so<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:20.170> you

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
like cleaning the overburden so that you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.910 
like cleaning the overburden so that you
can<00:01:21.290> see<00:01:21.409> them<00:01:21.530> any<00:01:21.650> fish<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:21.890> are<00:01:22.159> in<00:01:22.370> this

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
can see them any fish that are in this

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.250 
can see them any fish that are in this
we<00:01:24.920> reckon<00:01:25.190> 500<00:01:26.120> at<00:01:26.240> least<00:01:26.420> 2,000<00:01:26.930> fish<00:01:27.080> in

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
we reckon 500 at least 2,000 fish in

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:40.219 
we reckon 500 at least 2,000 fish in
there<00:01:27.470> mostly<00:01:28.040> salmon<00:01:28.400> fry<00:01:29.320> if<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.470> power<00:01:30.680> on

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.200 

so<00:01:40.829> here's<00:01:41.039> there<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> team

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so here's there is the team

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.389 
so here's there is the team
electrofishing<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:43.979> backwater

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
electrofishing this little backwater

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
electrofishing this little backwater
quite<00:01:44.969> a<00:01:45.000> good<00:01:45.119> place<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.479> trout<00:01:45.630> fry<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
quite a good place for trout fry and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.919 
quite a good place for trout fry and
these<00:01:46.350> little<00:01:46.530> quiet<00:01:46.920> spots<00:01:47.750> funny<00:01:48.750> how<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
these little quiet spots funny how you

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.149 
these little quiet spots funny how you
get<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.500> while<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.740> interesting<00:01:49.890> how

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
get there and while it's interesting how

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.440 
get there and while it's interesting how
you<00:01:50.219> get<00:01:50.429> the<00:01:50.520> different<00:01:50.820> types<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> fish<00:01:51.299> in

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you get the different types of fish in

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.630 
you get the different types of fish in
different<00:01:51.750> locations

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.070 

quite<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.240> lot<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.420> bedrock<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:58.960> this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
quite a lot of bedrock in this

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.380 
quite a lot of bedrock in this
particular<00:01:59.440> section<00:01:59.980> so<00:02:00.370> even<00:02:01.060> despite<00:02:01.360> that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
particular section so even despite that

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.820 
particular section so even despite that
there<00:02:01.750> are<00:02:01.840> still<00:02:02.020> quite<00:02:02.230> a<00:02:02.260> few<00:02:02.290> fish<00:02:02.590> there

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
there are still quite a few fish there

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.130 
there are still quite a few fish there
you<00:02:03.610> see<00:02:03.790> there<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> few<00:02:04.330> tricks<00:02:04.570> right<00:02:04.810> turning

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
you see there a few tricks right turning

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.639 
you see there a few tricks right turning
up<00:02:06.360> when<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.450> electrodes<00:02:07.870> passed<00:02:08.170> over<00:02:08.500> them

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
up when the electrodes passed over them

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.170 
up when the electrodes passed over them
the<00:02:08.770> ten<00:02:08.979> they<00:02:09.220> get<00:02:09.399> stunned<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.880> tend<00:02:10.090> to

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
the ten they get stunned and tend to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.110 
the ten they get stunned and tend to
swim<00:02:10.390> towards<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:11.080> ring<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:12.250> they'll<00:02:12.820> be

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
swim towards the ring and they'll be

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.670 
swim towards the ring and they'll be
immobilized<00:02:13.330> briefly<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.350> can<00:02:14.530> be

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
immobilized briefly and they can be

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.680 
immobilized briefly and they can be
netted<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> water<00:02:15.910> soon<00:02:16.390> as<00:02:16.540> you're

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
netted out the water soon as you're

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.880 
netted out the water soon as you're
taking<00:02:16.960> out<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.500> electrical<00:02:17.830> field

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
taking out of the electrical field

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.890 
taking out of the electrical field
they'll<00:02:18.310> recover

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.660 

to<00:02:25.439> find<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.680> surprising<00:02:26.189> amount<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.519> fish

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
to find a surprising amount of fish

batteries<00:05:24.150> would<00:05:24.330> run<00:05:24.509> out<00:05:24.539> quite<00:05:24.900> quick<00:05:25.110> so

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
batteries would run out quite quick so

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:26.510 
batteries would run out quite quick so
we<00:05:25.409> using<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.620> generator<00:05:26.039> I<00:05:26.099> can<00:05:26.279> give<00:05:26.400> us

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
we using the generator I can give us

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.390 
we using the generator I can give us
continue<00:05:27.029> with<00:05:27.060> I<00:05:27.960> wear<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.979> electrician

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
continue with I wear to the electrician

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:49.020 
continue with I wear to the electrician
equipment

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.280 

I<00:05:49.060> think<00:05:49.540> we're<00:05:49.660> doing<00:05:49.780> a<00:05:49.840> pretty<00:05:50.020> good<00:05:50.110> job

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
I think we're doing a pretty good job

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.440 
I think we're doing a pretty good job
but<00:05:50.710> clearing<00:05:51.070> out<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.460> fish<00:05:51.640> on<00:05:51.940> this<00:05:52.120> bone

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
but clearing out the fish on this bone

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.740 
but clearing out the fish on this bone
we<00:05:53.200> won't<00:05:53.380> get<00:05:53.470> them<00:05:53.620> all<00:05:53.740> but<00:05:54.040> you<00:05:54.750> know

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
we won't get them all but you know

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.450 
we won't get them all but you know
forget<00:05:56.080> in<00:05:56.170> eighty<00:05:56.290> ninety<00:05:56.680> eighty<00:05:56.830> percent

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
forget in eighty ninety eighty percent

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.400 
forget in eighty ninety eighty percent
or<00:05:57.670> so<00:05:57.850> that's<00:05:58.180> a<00:05:58.330> really<00:05:58.480> good<00:05:58.690> reduction<00:05:58.990> and

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
or so that's a really good reduction and

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.590 
or so that's a really good reduction and
these<00:06:00.100> will<00:06:00.250> be<00:06:00.340> put<00:06:00.550> back<00:06:00.730> into<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.300> upper

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
these will be put back into the upper

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600 
these will be put back into the upper
reaches<00:06:01.900> of<00:06:01.930> the<00:06:02.140> burn<00:06:02.320> but<00:06:03.190> hopefully<00:06:03.460> the

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
reaches of the burn but hopefully the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.250 
reaches of the burn but hopefully the
Anjou<00:06:04.000> chorus<00:06:04.300> will<00:06:04.450> migrate<00:06:04.600> down<00:06:04.960> into<00:06:05.200> the

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
Anjou chorus will migrate down into the

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.060 
Anjou chorus will migrate down into the
new<00:06:05.380> channel<00:06:07.170> just<00:06:08.170> pushing<00:06:08.560> up<00:06:08.650> through<00:06:08.680> the

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
new channel just pushing up through the

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.090 
new channel just pushing up through the
tail<00:06:09.460> of<00:06:09.640> this<00:06:09.850> pool<00:06:10.150> at<00:06:10.390> the<00:06:10.480> moment<00:06:10.780> I<00:06:11.100> think

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
tail of this pool at the moment I think

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.650 
tail of this pool at the moment I think
when<00:06:12.340> we<00:06:12.430> get<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:12.700> the<00:06:12.790> top<00:06:12.970> end<00:06:13.180> of<00:06:13.300> this<00:06:13.390> pool

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
when we get to the top end of this pool

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.380 
when we get to the top end of this pool
we'll<00:06:13.960> might<00:06:14.110> find<00:06:14.320> some<00:06:14.470> bigger<00:06:14.650> fish<00:06:15.390> and

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
we'll might find some bigger fish and

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.490 
we'll might find some bigger fish and
trout

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.440 

it's<00:06:21.770> quite<00:06:22.010> a<00:06:22.040> big<00:06:22.250> pool<00:06:22.460> created<00:06:23.000> just<00:06:23.150> below

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
it's quite a big pool created just below

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.400 
it's quite a big pool created just below
this<00:06:24.580> concrete<00:06:25.580> section<00:06:26.210> here<00:06:26.450> so<00:06:26.660> it'll<00:06:27.260> be

this concrete section here so it'll be

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.630 
this concrete section here so it'll be
interesting<00:06:27.560> to<00:06:27.710> find<00:06:27.890> out<00:06:28.130> what<00:06:28.340> we<00:06:28.430> found

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
interesting to find out what we found

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.910 
interesting to find out what we found
upstream<00:06:29.300> of<00:06:29.390> their<00:06:29.540> section<00:06:29.930> we're<00:06:30.710> finding

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
upstream of their section we're finding

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.820 
upstream of their section we're finding
a<00:06:30.980> lot<00:06:31.010> of<00:06:31.130> salmon<00:06:31.550> fry<00:06:31.790> today<00:06:32.180> below<00:06:32.450> it<00:06:32.830> this

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
fish to pass through so tomorrow we'll

be<00:06:38.300> fishing<00:06:38.480> above<00:06:38.810> it<00:06:38.930> and<00:06:39.080> we'll<00:06:39.320> find<00:06:39.620> out

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.950 
be fishing above it and we'll find out
