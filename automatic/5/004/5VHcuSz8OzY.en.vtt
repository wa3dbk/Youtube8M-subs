00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
going on on the right side on the

going on on the right side on the

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
forehead side but you guys can't really

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.839 
forehead side but you guys can't really
see<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.260> right<00:02:39.470> now<00:02:39.500> but<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:39.950> did<00:02:40.220> cover<00:02:40.519> that

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849

well<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.709> really<00:02:42.709> think<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.129> foundation

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
well so I really think this foundation

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.410 
well so I really think this foundation
does<00:02:43.970> have<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.420> medium<00:02:44.930> coverage<00:02:45.379> it<00:02:45.680> might<00:02:46.129> be

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
does have a medium coverage it might be

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.360 
does have a medium coverage it might be
buildable<00:02:47.420> bomb<00:02:47.750> not<00:02:48.049> sure<00:02:48.319> since<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.890> didn't

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
buildable bomb not sure since I didn't

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.400 
buildable bomb not sure since I didn't

my<00:05:58.909> skin<00:05:59.330> tone<00:05:59.539> a<00:05:59.599> bit<00:05:59.779> so<00:06:00.259> I<00:06:00.289> did<00:06:00.620> like<00:06:00.800> that
