00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.200
 in this video I will show you how I 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.660
 I solve the square band which is a method 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.910
 more advanced than the other tutorial that 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.750
 it was for beginners and that is going to 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.869
 allow it to be less than 20 seconds and 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.579
 even less than 15 on average so 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.499
 well let's go with the tutorial I hope that 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.239
 The first thing that I'm going to 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.609
 show are the steps that this has 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.949
 good method unlike with the method 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.140
 beginners here we have to do the 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.929
 two layers at the same time not one and 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.670
 then the other and good first thing 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.000
 what you have to do is obviously return it to 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.200
 the cubic shape that is the first step what 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.200
 I will do quietly 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.200
 and then what we have to do is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.550
 leave all the corners of a single 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.520
 colour 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.230
 depending on the color they have as 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.440
 I have black water the black first 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.359
 above 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.980
 then we have to leave all the 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.670
 edges of a color is to say eat these 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.670
 two for black 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.890
 and then what we have to do is 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.900
 change all the corners permute the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.600
 corners for example here is it would have 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.860
 to go here and here below would have to be 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.070
 here then 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.250
 change is two layers at the same time and 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.230
 then what I would have to do here would be 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.880
 permute all the edges these with 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.880
 this one and this one connects 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.000
 and ready good so this is more 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.280
 complicated because we have to see up 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.110
 and down at the same time at the beginning 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.790
 It costs a lot but after fed up 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.130
 practice one is getting used to looking 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.010
 down and do good well let's 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.260
 start with the tutorial 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.260
 let's start with the orientation of the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.240
 corners is the first case I have two 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.130
 black here and two black here 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.380
 I just have to do this 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.780
 movement and turn 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.020
 the second case is this I have two blacks 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.020
 here two black here I do this 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.289
 this can also touch me like this towards the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.210
 another side then so as not to have to 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.070
 make two movements and that is not that 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.070
 there is simply we make it stand out 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.190
 here in this case we have three blacks and 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.190
 one side only then this 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.020
 but in this case we have only one 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.650
 black and we have three here then together 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.650
 this with this 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.260
 here we have two together here and two 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.260
 crossed here we simply do this 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.210
 now we have two crusaders here and two 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.210
 together here 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.490
 ready we go with the orientation of the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.290
 edges 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.670
 this step is super important especially 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.950
 the algorithms that I am going to teach 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.330
 since these algorithms do not 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.340
 they exchange the corners do not you the 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.400
 allow then if you have all 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.700
 the permuted corners by luck or 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.590
 because it does not exist if you execute this 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.960
 algorithm and it will not exchange them 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.270
 then you can identify the 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.060
 permutation of corners before 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.340
 execute good edge orientation 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.180
 let's go with the river case I have only one 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.180
 arista is on the right and is behind 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.650
 and as I told you all the corners are 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.980
 swaps as they were before we go that the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.579
 next case I have two and two is 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.579
 quite easy 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.640
 and ready, this case should be 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.090
 know it just change these two and 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.260
 these two this algorithm is called m2 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:11.349
 It is very useful for the permutation of 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.349
 edges so remember what is called m2 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.549
 I already have these two and these two 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.170
 I have those two and those two 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.520
 here we have three and three 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.360
 I was the latter and not even 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.210
 necessary to look down and here if 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.270
 I have four here obviously here too 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:05.150
 there are four is simply to make two m 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.150
 I turn to turn down 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.180
 let's start with permutation of 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.610
 edges in this case I have everything solved 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.460
 down and here I have to change this for 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.330
 this now I have these two well but 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.330
 we open the next 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.590
 all the permuted corners were left 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.419
 now the same algorithm but down 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.160
 I have everything up right and down I have 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.889
 these two that you have to change because 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.930
 these two are fine 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.930
 so I have to do the following 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.490
 and ready now I have everything well down and 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.280
 up I do not have anything together I have to 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.790
 interchange diagonally then I do 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.790
 the next 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.300
 now the same case but below I have to 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.780
 swap diagonally so I do what 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.780
 following 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.430
 by ready 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.350
 now let's start with the cases of 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.900
 mutation but up and down to it 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.600
 these really are much more 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.690
 simple since they are shorter good the 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.669
 first is that I have these two well 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.310
 these two well and I will have to exchange 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.880
 that's why and that's why but we open 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.880
 the next 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.789
 and I'm also going to teach you that 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.479
 same case but with the two corners 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:55.129
 well forward this is suddenly going to 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.129
 Serve a lot in resolutions 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:07.740
 already in this case above I have two that 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:11.360
 two do not match and nothing down 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.360
 so I have to do this 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.970
 now the same case but backwards I have 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:26.160
 two good here this is that they did not win and 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.160
 here diagonally then I do this 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:39.160
 and the last case does not coincide here or 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.160
 down I just do this 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:46.819
 well that's permutation of rows
