00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 but try the dead provoked by the 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 rains that fell on the lobito 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.189
 last Thursday night and today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.599
 curiously under a torrid sun 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.450
 still collecting bodies in ditches 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.509
 of drainage 72 hours after the tragedy 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.840
 of the lobito in one of the places 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.240
 more mortal victims were 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.510
 video today three more bodies I have 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.990
 sure that even today the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.670
 we should find more bodies here than 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.859
 about three kilometers between the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 dead is the epicenter of tragedy 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.149
 the reports are of horror a mother five 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.870
 children died dragged by water and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.270
 mud 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.550
 others had painful options there 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.250
 people who have made the family 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.340
 and even to some extent people who 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.829
 lost the house and see of child safara 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.899
 outside the object has to follow the foot also 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.149
 thus losing one of its own 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:02.039
 lives reported the pilot 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:03.000
 she spoke electric household appliances all over 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 House 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 some lost the house they had or 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.700
 everything is ready so I 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.180
 I was the one who stayed in Sumbe, I just arrived. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.049
 Today I arrived today I heard about this. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.030
 attack 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.259
 I found my house does not take advantage of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.180
 nothing or nothing even finished 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.920
 civil society has already mobilized to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.500
 collect donations 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.180
 the provincial government and administration 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.250
 are already studying the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.500
 settlement of the thousands of people who 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.250
 live in this risk zone and three days 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.380
 after 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:48.149
 this is enough to give hope back to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:52.020
 face of these people here I go I think 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.240
 this here is a ditch that changes 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.860
 three days after the tragedy 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 impressive to verify the ability to 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.390
 survival of the Angolan people 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.969
 after the event with more than 30 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.119
 people's lives and that they only think of 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.270
 72 hours later is how the rest will live 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.730
 of your days and improve your situation 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.810
