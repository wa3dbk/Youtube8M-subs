at 99 no need to wear just try getting

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.839 
at 99 no need to wear just try getting
it<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.869> at<00:02:06.990> least<00:02:07.140> 95<00:02:07.860> each<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.640> should

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
it up to at least 95 each and you should

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.760 
it up to at least 95 each and you should
be<00:02:08.879> flying<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.200> moving<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
be flying with that so moving on to the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
be flying with that so moving on to the
defense<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.580> defense<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:12.090> really<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.480> i

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
defense for defense I really don't i

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.300 
defense for defense I really don't i
don't<00:02:13.020> hit<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.379> lot<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.980> more

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
don't hit a lot so I more

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.750 
don't hit a lot so I more
I I<00:02:14.849> poke<00:02:15.630> check<00:02:15.900> more<00:02:16.140> often<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:16.860> i<00:02:17.190> put<00:02:17.640> my

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
I I poke check more often so i put my

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.900 
I I poke check more often so i put my
defense<00:02:18.209> awareness<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.349> about<00:02:19.590> 90<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.400> i

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
defense awareness up to about 90 and i

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.270 
defense awareness up to about 90 and i
really<00:02:21.209> don't<00:02:21.390> mess<00:02:21.569> with<00:02:21.840> any<00:02:22.050> other<00:02:22.290> any<00:02:22.709> of

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
really don't mess with any other any of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.020 
really don't mess with any other any of
the<00:02:23.370> others<00:02:24.380> things<00:02:25.380> until<00:02:26.340> i<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.640> stick

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the others things until i get to stick

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.900 
the others things until i get to stick
checking<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.720> i<00:02:27.840> put<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.620> 99<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
checking and i put that up to 99 and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.500 
checking and i put that up to 99 and
again<00:02:30.569> if<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.780> guys<00:02:30.959> can't<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.440> up<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.709> 99<00:02:32.510> 95

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
again if you guys can't get up to 99 95

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
again if you guys can't get up to 99 95
or<00:02:33.870> 90<00:02:34.380> around<00:02:34.680> there<00:02:34.860> should<00:02:35.069> do<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> trick

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
or 90 around there should do the trick

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.259 
or 90 around there should do the trick
so<00:02:37.530> moving<00:02:37.800> on<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:39.709> athleticism

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
so moving on to the athleticism

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.500 
so moving on to the athleticism
acceleration<00:02:42.269> i<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.019> at<00:02:43.250> 86<00:02:44.510> agility

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
acceleration i have that at 86 agility

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.750 
acceleration i have that at 86 agility
is<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.019> 85<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.700> balance<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.360> at<00:02:48.540> 86

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
is that 85 the balance is at 86

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.309 
is that 85 the balance is at 86
durability<00:02:50.760> well<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.690> didn't<00:02:51.959> really<00:02:52.080> mess

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
durability well I didn't really mess

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.039 
durability well I didn't really mess
with<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.620> boy<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.040> at<00:02:53.130> 61<00:02:53.760> endurance<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.900> at

with that boy it's at 61 endurance is at

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.670 
with that boy it's at 61 endurance is at
85<00:02:55.560> speed<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:57.000> 71<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.930> know<00:02:58.260> what<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.560> guys

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
85 speed is that 71 I know what you guys

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.339 
85 speed is that 71 I know what you guys
are<00:02:58.920> thinking<00:02:59.150> 71<00:03:00.150> how<00:03:00.630> was<00:03:00.780> your<00:03:00.930> guy<00:03:01.110> gonna

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
are thinking 71 how was your guy gonna

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.530 
are thinking 71 how was your guy gonna
move<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.640> asked<00:03:02.910> with<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.120> with<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
move all to be asked with you with the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.930 
move all to be asked with you with the
speed<00:03:03.840> at<00:03:03.959> 71<00:03:04.590> I'm<00:03:04.769> still<00:03:05.130> able<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.519> move<00:03:05.700> at

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
speed at 71 I'm still able to move at

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.210 
speed at 71 I'm still able to move at
the<00:03:06.420> same<00:03:06.599> speed<00:03:06.959> as<00:03:07.049> everyone<00:03:07.380> else<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.799> for

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
the same speed as everyone else and for

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.690 
the same speed as everyone else and for
strength<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.849> had<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.150> 75<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.140> while<00:03:10.980> for<00:03:11.640> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
strength I had that 75 and while for the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.400 
strength I had that 75 and while for the
speed<00:03:12.000> being<00:03:12.209> at<00:03:12.360> 71<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:12.930> was<00:03:13.170> kind<00:03:13.380> of

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
speed being at 71 I was kind of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.990 
speed being at 71 I was kind of
surprised<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.099> was<00:03:14.220> still<00:03:14.489> able<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.760> keep

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
surprised that I was still able to keep

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.390 
surprised that I was still able to keep
up<00:03:15.180> with<00:03:15.239> everyone<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:16.349> fact<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.769> get<00:03:16.920> breakaway

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
up with everyone in fact I get breakaway

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.789 
up with everyone in fact I get breakaway
still<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.000> one<00:03:18.630> reason<00:03:18.959> i<00:03:19.049> like<00:03:19.230> these<00:03:19.470> stats

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
still and one reason i like these stats

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.069 
still and one reason i like these stats
to<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.459> again<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.209> keep<00:03:21.450> up<00:03:21.630> with<00:03:21.660> everyone

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
to is again you keep up with everyone

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.099 
to is again you keep up with everyone
and<00:03:22.410> well<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.609> can't<00:03:23.910> get<00:03:24.090> hit<00:03:24.299> for<00:03:24.570> crap<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
and well you can't get hit for crap and

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.039 
and well you can't get hit for crap and
you<00:03:25.170> can<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.530> kind<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:26.570> your<00:03:27.570> guy<00:03:27.750> has<00:03:28.019> really

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
you can just kind of your guy has really

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.470 
you can just kind of your guy has really
good<00:03:28.500> agility<00:03:28.829> i<00:03:29.100> guess<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.579> say<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:29.819> he

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
good agility i guess you can say so he

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.539 
good agility i guess you can say so he
can<00:03:30.660> spin<00:03:31.079> real<00:03:31.319> fast<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.890> then<00:03:31.950> since<00:03:32.370> this

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
can spin real fast and then since this

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.030 
can spin real fast and then since this
acceleration<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.390> up<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.989> can<00:03:34.260> spin<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.890> just

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
acceleration is up you can spin and just

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.080 
acceleration is up you can spin and just
go<00:03:35.340> around<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:36.000> defenders<00:03:36.569> very<00:03:36.930> easily<00:03:37.170> and

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
go around the defenders very easily and
