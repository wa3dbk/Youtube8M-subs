00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.180 
guys made this is put into it man it's
just<00:00:38.910> horse<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.350> then<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.440> overly<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> didn't

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
just horse and then I overly I didn't

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
just horse and then I overly I didn't
control<00:00:44.399> either<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.020> sounds<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.170> like

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
control either and that sounds just like

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.029 
control either and that sounds just like
the<00:00:46.379> motorway<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.760> guys<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.950> some<00:00:49.950> of

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the motorway as you guys in here some of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.830 
the motorway as you guys in here some of
them<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> bit<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.670> back<00:00:51.120> heavy<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.539> front

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
them are a bit like back heavy or front

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.979 
them are a bit like back heavy or front
heavy<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.390> harder<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> steer<00:00:54.840> them

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
heavy so it's a bit harder to steer them

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.450 
heavy so it's a bit harder to steer them
but<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> wasn't<00:00:57.059> steal<00:00:57.680> from<00:00:58.680> tilt<00:00:59.280> them

well<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.630> take<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.840> vehicles<00:02:27.260> out<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.980> which

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
well I take the vehicles out of it which

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.570 
well I take the vehicles out of it which
is<00:02:28.610> don't<00:02:29.570> wanna<00:02:29.930> die<00:02:30.110> obviously<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.920> guess

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
is don't wanna die obviously I guess

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.880 
is don't wanna die obviously I guess
install<00:02:31.940> point<00:02:32.290> because<00:02:33.290> our<00:02:33.470> it's<00:02:33.650> based

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
install point because our it's based

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.410 
install point because our it's based
around<00:02:34.070> vehicles<00:02:34.790> being<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.120> different

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
around vehicles being the different

around vehicles being the different
elements

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
elements

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.330 
elements
take<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.900> aside<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.470> track<00:02:38.860> itself<00:02:39.190> is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
take that aside the track itself is

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.830 
take that aside the track itself is
actually<00:02:39.459> pretty<00:02:39.879> well<00:02:40.209> thought<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.480> track
