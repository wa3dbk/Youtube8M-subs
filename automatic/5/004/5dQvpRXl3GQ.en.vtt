00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.290
 the 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.290
 That 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.910
 the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.550
 safely transporting your child in the car 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.349
 of vital importance 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.060
 what a collision with for example 50 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.740
 kilometers per hour corresponds to one 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.480
 fall of 10 meters high 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.240
 at least if you don't fix your child 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.770
 clicked and now honestly knew who would do such a thing 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.630
 want to experience 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.640
 one of course is still to 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.010
 understand that still one in two 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.899
 children is clicked incorrectly and worse 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.160
 that one in ten children altogether 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.160
 is not attached 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.110
 when we mistake our children or not 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.840
 can cling it for the children 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.420
 driver and passenger disastrous 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.129
 have consequences if you don't fix your child 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.440
 click then you risk it car 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.970
 is catapulted out with all 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.040
 consequences 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.140
 or hit something in the car then 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.300
 very large speeds very large forces 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.610
 that act on it and then third 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.810
 we can ensure that the forces 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.430
 that are released 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.619
 on the harder structure and the pots 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.090
 are brought into the body and not 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.660
 unnecessary to it would not be easy to 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.660
 can breed 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.630
 is of course very important to take into account 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.909
 gardens clerk at right child lives as 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 a security new the right way 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.659
 happens, it can even be risky 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.820
 therefore we say for children under the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.560
 2 years against the direction of travel 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.560
 as a parent would a still fit 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.259
 then in a chair with a harness 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.759
 completely fixed 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.409
 when you no longer fit in on it 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.850
 a cushion such that the belt on one 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.460
 good way around the body 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.259
 to sit tense around the hips now 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 with the belt that is normally over the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.070
 chest never goes under the educator 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.050
 children are allowed from 1 meter 35 with the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.030
 ordinary belt 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.520
 however, it is advised to children up to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.000
 1 meter 50 on a booster cushion too 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.790
 transport 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.200
 children less than 36 kilograms 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.240
 can still be comfortable on such a pillow 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.660
 sit best for as long as possible 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.660
 use of 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.830
 and very great forces go down 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.899
 come and say if you have impacts 50 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.460
 kilometers per hour have an average 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.210
 child in strength of six seven hundred 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.210
 kilo arrives 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.459
 things no longer with some that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.969
 just click it even if you are pregnant 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.329
 are 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:30.879
 yes yes certainly I think hey that is quite 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.290
 important for the child trudge I do 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.819
 hold it under their belly 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.819
 so under the baby under the baby 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.060
 if we look at the reason why 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.040
 that pregnant women and child earnings 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.359
 of are certainly traffic accidents in van 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.950
 the main reason if not the 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.650
 main reason 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.689
 Now some mothers think the ditch 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.870
 belt could damage their child 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.030
 but what we see is the deaths 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.340
 mainly relate to the severity 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.109
 of the lesions of the farmer of the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.919
 which of course increase when that there 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.700
 no root is borne and that the 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.299
 seat belt 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.799
 itself but in a very exceptional way 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.719
 case 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.349
 possibly damage to the unborn 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.879
 would cause child if you put the belt on 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.849
 right bears 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.730
 that is, a back a lot below 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.840
 the pregnant belly and the slant 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.560
 above the pregnant belly then that is a risk 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.620
 nickname is research 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.829
 showed that when the pregnant one 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.680
 have a traffic accident and no root and 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.739
 that just about 18 holes percent risk 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.599
 on losing the fruit there 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.269
 keeper when they do have their belt 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.470
 wear there had been reduced to 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.470
 3.5 people 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.310
 also your four-legged friend can only 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.360
 transport in a safe way 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.250
 otherwise I can't just be a danger 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.560
 forms for themselves but also for the 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.800
 other occupants of the car 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.800
 patrick 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.740
 yes certainly no problems can we 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.750
 always applied from childhood and 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.760
 now she even finds percent to go 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.050
 so what to wait at the door 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.220
 so then they know that would just be stupid 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.840
 must put on, and that they then be 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.700
 clicked is he has none at all 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.740
 issues 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.480
 clicked correctly, your child knocks three 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.430
 times less risk of being killed or 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.620
 to be seriously injured in an accident 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.700
 if you know what you hold in 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.320
 for God's sake 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.360
 to keep your eyeballs always on the right 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.170
 way to fasten and even for one 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.550
 short drive 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.070
 times moreover there are the good ones 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.420
 example and always wear the belt too 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.010
 if you are pregnant 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.410
 because in a collision the belt is too 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.800
 par excellence for mother and baby 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.010
 baby 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.230
 so go for zero in traffic 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.570
 Of course you can order this broadcast 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.290
 watch on the DVDs website and 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.290
 from the federal police
