00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.110
 television audience 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.489
 firstly it was nice that so big 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.930
 a project that we first go to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.930
 Russia somehow invited me 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.170
 and me as an artist relatively young 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.140
 generations are very interesting to try on 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.840
 different roles will feel like 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.840
 inside the pier whose character should 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.430
 Not everyone can show, and I do not 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.220
 sure that any of us with this 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.960
 Cope for me is not so important 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.350
 visual factors that can be made 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.690
 with the help of make-up for me as a singer and 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.880
 as for the viewer 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.150
 very high point 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.360
 plausibility is still a skill so 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.060

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.880

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.590

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.730
 Particularly I wanted to see not just 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.760
 antics so the man closed his eyes and 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.090
