00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello in this video I'll explain 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.380
 how to solve the problem that the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:17.609
 nexus 4 of google with wifi connection 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:21.180
 on the routers amper a sl 26 555 of 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.490
 movistar in agreement already you will know that it is not 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.650
 can connect and that if they connect the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.019
 connection is of very poor quality and it 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.960
 cut continuously I'll explain 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.809
 how to solve that problem 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.790
 first of all tekle hais this 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.820
 address 2.8 thousand voucher and when you enter 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.309
 it will ask you on behalf of user and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.890
 the password and I'm movistar clients 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.350
 well 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.600
 between 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.800
 the login will be one of the 34 and the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.770
 password will also be 1234 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.149
 Once I said on this screen 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.329
 you're seeing now is the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.600
 main screen you have to go to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.210
 this eyelash here advanced 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.080
 and here in wilde the setup have to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.520
 select the and performance 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:20.140
 here you have to put a 10 in signal 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.940
 interval have to be placed 10 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.440
 defect in the router that I said 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.620
 before it comes if I do not remember more 1000 and 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.510
 comes 1100 I do not remember here says that 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.070
 the range is between one and a thousand and the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.650
 standard 100 I think it came to 100 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.140
 Well, you have to put 10 as 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.920
 I have put here once there is 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.530
 exposed you give here and the router is 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.930
 will restart in about 5 or 6 seconds and in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.010
 principle has to go well and the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.370
 I also recommend that the 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.020
 type of encryption that you put 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.010
 this 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.640
 vp to hit bar and here in figures in 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:07.720
 the type of encryption put volts that woods 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.270
 you already know that being in the ip and the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.030
 then you leave this bot that means 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.560
 the two of you agree then 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.930
 I recommend that you put this type of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.940
 security according to this kind of 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:25.930
 security and in wireless performance that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.460
 place in the signal interval 110 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.680
 agreeing to do that 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.250
 yours in sub 4 will connect 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.470
 perfectly to the wifi network to the maximum 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.590
 speed and you will not have problems 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.580
 this is all leave some comment on 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.790

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.790
