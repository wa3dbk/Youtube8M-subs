00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
possible and that's where we're going to

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.610

place it at an angle so that when the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.119 
place it at an angle so that when the
foot<00:03:06.659> is<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.319> shoe<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.739> we<00:03:07.920> wrap<00:03:08.099> it

around<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.580> ankle

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
around the ankle

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.020 
around the ankle
there's<00:03:09.599> no<00:03:09.840> gaping<00:03:10.430> because<00:03:11.430> if<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.670> saw<00:03:11.879> it

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
there's no gaping because if you saw it

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.759 
there's no gaping because if you saw it
straight<00:03:12.450> up<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.750> down<00:03:12.810> you're<00:03:13.349> going<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.590> get

straight up and down you're going to get

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.470 
straight up and down you're going to get
a<00:03:13.799> gap<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.250> need<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.459> follow<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.849> natural<00:03:15.030> line

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
a gap we need to follow the natural line

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.229 
a gap we need to follow the natural line
of<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.750> ankle<00:03:16.519> which<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.700> about<00:03:17.940> thirty

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
of the ankle which is about thirty

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.020 
of the ankle which is about thirty
degrees<00:03:18.450> pointing<00:03:19.409> towards<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.489> toe<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:21.000> the

degrees pointing towards the toe of the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.449 
degrees pointing towards the toe of the
shoe<00:03:21.500> now<00:03:22.500> you'll<00:03:22.680> notice<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:22.980> Toni's

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
shoe now you'll notice that Toni's

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.449 
shoe now you'll notice that Toni's
folded<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.090> little<00:03:24.299> bit<00:03:24.420> underneath<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:28.459> what

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
folded a little bit underneath and what

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.250 
folded a little bit underneath and what
that<00:03:29.670> does<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:30.150> just<00:03:30.569> make<00:03:30.720> sure<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.140> it

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
that does is just make sure that it

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.630 
that does is just make sure that it
doesn't<00:03:31.440> fray<00:03:31.769> at<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:31.980> end<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.310> can<00:03:32.459> fold

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
doesn't fray at the end so you can fold

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.339 
doesn't fray at the end so you can fold
it<00:03:32.760> over<00:03:32.909> once<00:03:33.269> or<00:03:33.450> twice<00:03:33.660> depending<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.260> your

preference<00:03:34.769> place<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.940> at<00:03:36.030> an<00:03:36.150> angle<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:38.480> hold

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
preference place it at an angle and hold

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.059 
preference place it at an angle and hold
it<00:03:39.629> in<00:03:39.750> place<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:40.260> your<00:03:40.290> thumb<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.739> finger

before you start to sew now we're going
to<00:03:48.090> do<00:03:48.239> some<00:03:48.450> stitches<00:03:48.870> around<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.230> edge<00:03:49.409> you

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
to do some stitches around the edge you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.610 
to do some stitches around the edge you
might<00:03:49.799> find<00:03:50.129> a<00:03:50.310> small<00:03:50.640> finer<00:03:51.299> needle<00:03:51.900> will<00:03:52.500> be

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
might find a small finer needle will be

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.949 
might find a small finer needle will be
more<00:03:52.799> appropriate<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.730> work<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.540> you

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
more appropriate for this work and you

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.390 
more appropriate for this work and you
want<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.170> make<00:03:55.290> sure<00:03:55.319> your<00:03:55.650> needles<00:03:55.920> nice<00:03:56.129> and

want to make sure your needles nice and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.520 
want to make sure your needles nice and
new<00:03:56.670> not<00:03:57.060> blunt<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.840> true<00:03:58.019> how<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.230> push

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
new not blunt so it's true how to push

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.210 
new not blunt so it's true how to push
through<00:04:00.079> now<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.349> ballet<00:04:01.560> shoe<00:04:01.680> there's

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
through now in a ballet shoe there's

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.440 
through now in a ballet shoe there's
actually<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:04.340> lining<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.819> we<00:04:05.970> have<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> leather

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
actually a lining so we have a leather

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.879 
actually a lining so we have a leather
ballet<00:04:06.870> shoe<00:04:07.250> with<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.790> cotton<00:04:09.510> lining<00:04:09.870> when<00:04:10.769> we

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
ballet shoe with a cotton lining when we

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.620 
ballet shoe with a cotton lining when we
do<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.130> threading<00:04:11.579> we<00:04:11.970> want<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.269> make<00:04:12.419> sure

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
do the threading we want to make sure

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.839 
do the threading we want to make sure
we're<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.200> going<00:04:13.560> through<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.459> inner

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
we're just going through the inner

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.180 
we're just going through the inner
lining<00:04:15.120> of<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.540> shoe<00:04:15.840> certainly<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:16.859> through

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
lining of the shoe certainly not through

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.650 
lining of the shoe certainly not through
the<00:04:17.340> leather<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:17.849> can<00:04:18.060> be<00:04:18.180> seen<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.539> the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
the leather so it can be seen on the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.800 
the leather so it can be seen on the
other<00:04:18.690> side<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.030> just<00:04:21.180> need<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.389> do<00:04:21.599> some

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
other side so you just need to do some

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.850 
other side so you just need to do some
neat<00:04:21.989> little<00:04:22.019> stitches<00:04:23.030> evenly<00:04:24.030> placed

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
neat little stitches evenly placed

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.230 
neat little stitches evenly placed
around<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.400> side<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:29.340> then<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.669> bottom<00:04:30.060> and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
around the side and then the bottom and

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.670 
around the side and then the bottom and
then<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.449> other<00:04:30.630> side<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.770> ribbon<00:04:32.039> and

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.870 

then<00:04:37.680> we'll<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:37.949> continue<00:04:38.099> now<00:04:38.550> across<00:04:38.789> the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
then we'll just continue now across the

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:47.050 
then we'll just continue now across the
bottom

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.330 

and<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.350> course<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.650> want<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.800> make<00:04:48.950> sure<00:04:48.980> when

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
and of course you want to make sure when

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.920 
and of course you want to make sure when
you<00:04:49.430> thread<00:04:49.700> your<00:04:49.730> needle<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.690> have<00:04:50.900> a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
you thread your needle that you have a

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.480 
you thread your needle that you have a
lot<00:04:51.170> of<00:04:51.200> thread<00:04:51.500> on<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:51.920> you<00:04:51.980> don't<00:04:52.100> have<00:04:52.310> to

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
lot of thread on it so you don't have to

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:12.389 
lot of thread on it so you don't have to
stop<00:04:52.730> start<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.360> rethread<00:04:54.020> your<00:04:54.050> needle

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:12.399 

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:14.950 

now<00:05:13.399> we're<00:05:13.699> coming<00:05:13.969> close<00:05:14.119> to<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.479> casing

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
now we're coming close to the casing

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.649 
now we're coming close to the casing
here<00:05:15.490> which<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.699> the<00:05:16.849> casing<00:05:17.059> that<00:05:17.330> holds<00:05:17.569> the

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
here which is the casing that holds the

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.279 
here which is the casing that holds the
elastic<00:05:18.169> it's<00:05:19.129> really<00:05:19.639> important<00:05:20.270> not<00:05:20.779> to<00:05:20.809> sew

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
elastic it's really important not to sew

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.249 
elastic it's really important not to sew
over<00:05:22.189> the<00:05:22.309> casing<00:05:22.819> the<00:05:23.449> elastic<00:05:23.869> needs<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.169> be

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
over the casing the elastic needs to be

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.899 
over the casing the elastic needs to be
able<00:05:24.379> to<00:05:24.529> move<00:05:24.649> freely<00:05:24.979> through<00:05:25.369> the<00:05:25.399> casing

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
able to move freely through the casing

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.450 
able to move freely through the casing
so<00:05:26.719> we<00:05:26.869> just<00:05:27.050> go<00:05:27.199> as<00:05:27.349> close<00:05:27.589> as<00:05:27.770> we<00:05:27.889> can<00:05:28.069> to<00:05:28.249> the

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
so we just go as close as we can to the

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.899 
so we just go as close as we can to the
casing<00:05:28.879> and<00:05:29.059> then<00:05:29.930> we<00:05:30.110> stitch<00:05:30.529> across<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:31.699> top

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
casing and then we stitch across the top

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:54.670 
casing and then we stitch across the top
of<00:05:31.939> the<00:05:32.300> ribbon<00:05:32.569> as<00:05:32.779> well

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.570 

once<00:05:55.430> we've<00:05:55.639> finished<00:05:55.820> we<00:05:56.210> loop<00:05:56.860> knot<00:05:57.860> and<00:05:58.250> cut

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
once we've finished we loop knot and cut

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.960 
once we've finished we loop knot and cut
the<00:05:58.760> thread<00:05:59.889> we<00:06:00.889> do<00:06:01.010> a<00:06:01.040> couple<00:06:01.280> of<00:06:01.400> stitches<00:06:01.610> to

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
the thread we do a couple of stitches to

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.400 
the thread we do a couple of stitches to
make<00:06:02.000> sure<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.600> it<00:06:02.750> doesn't<00:06:02.870> come<00:06:03.110> undone

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
make sure that it doesn't come undone

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.060 
make sure that it doesn't come undone
and<00:06:04.720> then<00:06:05.720> we'll<00:06:05.900> give<00:06:06.020> you<00:06:06.139> a<00:06:06.199> close-up<00:06:06.500> so

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
and then we'll give you a close-up so

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.379 
and then we'll give you a close-up so
you<00:06:07.130> can<00:06:07.310> have<00:06:07.460> a<00:06:07.490> look<00:06:07.729> at<00:06:07.820> how<00:06:07.970> that

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
you can have a look at how that

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:16.540 
you can have a look at how that
stitching<00:06:08.690> has<00:06:08.930> come<00:06:14.800> as<00:06:15.800> you<00:06:15.979> can<00:06:16.130> see<00:06:16.340> we've

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
stitching has come as you can see we've

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.780 
stitching has come as you can see we've
gone<00:06:16.699> around<00:06:17.030> the<00:06:17.180> side<00:06:18.190> around<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:19.520> bottom

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
gone around the side around the bottom

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.730 
gone around the side around the bottom
around<00:06:20.510> the<00:06:20.750> other<00:06:20.900> side<00:06:21.139> and<00:06:21.290> across<00:06:21.500> the

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
around the other side and across the

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.310 
around the other side and across the
front<00:06:21.919> but<00:06:22.790> it<00:06:22.880> hasn't<00:06:23.030> gone<00:06:23.330> into<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:23.870> casing

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
front but it hasn't gone into the casing

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.760 
front but it hasn't gone into the casing
it's<00:06:25.100> on<00:06:25.160> a<00:06:25.190> nice<00:06:25.400> slight<00:06:25.820> angle<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.770> the

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
it's on a nice slight angle and the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.120 
it's on a nice slight angle and the
inside<00:06:28.160> bits<00:06:28.430> tucked<00:06:28.729> underneath<00:06:29.260> so<00:06:30.260> it's

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
inside bits tucked underneath so it's

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.529 
inside bits tucked underneath so it's
folded<00:06:31.490> over<00:06:31.580> we're<00:06:31.850> not<00:06:31.970> going<00:06:32.150> to<00:06:32.270> get<00:06:32.389> any

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
folded over we're not going to get any

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.890 
folded over we're not going to get any
frame<00:06:32.840> on<00:06:33.169> the<00:06:33.350> bottom<00:06:34.330> so<00:06:35.330> all<00:06:35.510> you<00:06:35.660> need<00:06:35.810> to

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
frame on the bottom so all you need to

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.230 
frame on the bottom so all you need to
do<00:06:36.080> is<00:06:36.320> repeat<00:06:36.830> that<00:06:37.070> on<00:06:37.310> the<00:06:37.400> other<00:06:37.910> side

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
do is repeat that on the other side

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.060 
do is repeat that on the other side
we're<00:06:38.690> not<00:06:38.810> going<00:06:39.020> to<00:06:39.080> do<00:06:39.229> that<00:06:39.380> today<00:06:39.680> you<00:06:39.740> can

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
we're not going to do that today you can

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.000 
we're not going to do that today you can
do<00:06:40.190> that<00:06:40.340> at<00:06:40.460> home<00:06:40.990> but<00:06:41.990> what<00:06:42.139> we<00:06:42.289> will<00:06:42.500> do<00:06:42.740> and

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
do that at home but what we will do and

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.170 
do that at home but what we will do and
is<00:06:43.699> just<00:06:43.970> look<00:06:44.180> at<00:06:44.380> using<00:06:45.380> a<00:06:45.560> lighter<00:06:45.860> on<00:06:46.310> the

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
is just look at using a lighter on the

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.320 
is just look at using a lighter on the
end<00:06:47.360> of<00:06:47.479> ribbon<00:06:47.750> so<00:06:47.930> once<00:06:48.139> you<00:06:48.289> place<00:06:48.560> the<00:06:49.370> foot

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
end of ribbon so once you place the foot

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.760 
end of ribbon so once you place the foot
into<00:06:51.169> the<00:06:51.260> shoe<00:06:51.289> and<00:06:51.800> put<00:06:52.760> the<00:06:52.850> ribbons<00:06:53.150> on<00:06:53.360> and

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
into the shoe and put the ribbons on and

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.590 
into the shoe and put the ribbons on and
we'll<00:06:54.770> show<00:06:54.979> you<00:06:55.010> how<00:06:55.190> to<00:06:55.430> actually<00:06:55.850> cut<00:06:56.330> and

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
we'll show you how to actually cut and

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.920 
we'll show you how to actually cut and
then<00:06:56.900> fray<00:06:57.789> so<00:06:58.789> perhaps<00:06:58.940> we'll<00:06:59.180> do<00:06:59.360> that<00:06:59.510> once

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
then fray so perhaps we'll do that once

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.290 
then fray so perhaps we'll do that once
we<00:07:00.050> show<00:07:00.380> you<00:07:00.440> our<00:07:00.770> tutorial<00:07:01.400> on<00:07:01.520> how<00:07:01.940> to<00:07:01.970> tie

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
we show you our tutorial on how to tie

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:12.320 
we show you our tutorial on how to tie
ribbons

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.389
