tall and he's gonna be dangerous from

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.399 
tall and he's gonna be dangerous from
corners<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> decent<00:01:48.360> player<00:01:48.600> hopefully<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
corners and a decent player hopefully in

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
with him this year for in the Chelsea

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.860 
with him this year for in the Chelsea
best<00:03:07.520> possible<00:03:07.760> Chelsea<00:03:08.060> team<00:03:08.210> he<00:03:08.600> was<00:03:08.750> good

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
best possible Chelsea team he was good

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.960 
best possible Chelsea team he was good
at<00:03:08.900> passing<00:03:09.170> decent<00:03:09.950> finishing<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.760> only

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
at passing decent finishing the only

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.820 
at passing decent finishing the only
thing<00:03:11.180> which<00:03:11.330> did<00:03:11.600> lack<00:03:11.960> on<00:03:12.140> him<00:03:12.260> was<00:03:12.410> his<00:03:12.500> piss

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
thing which did lack on him was his piss

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.580 
thing which did lack on him was his piss
and<00:03:13.100> hopefully<00:03:13.490> here<00:03:13.940> don't<00:03:14.390> like<00:03:15.020> ramming

and hopefully here don't like ramming

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.110 
and hopefully here don't like ramming
right<00:03:15.860> down<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.340> ruin<00:03:16.550> his<00:03:16.670> peers<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.060> I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
right down and ruin his peers but I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.520 
right down and ruin his peers but I
reckon<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.450> could<00:03:17.480> be<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.660> lot<00:03:17.840> like<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.050> Chevy

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
reckon it could be a lot like a Chevy

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
limited in what i could do last year

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.180 
limited in what i could do last year
with<00:04:43.910> him<00:04:44.810> being<00:04:45.020> stuck<00:04:45.260> at<00:04:45.380> Galatasaray<00:04:46.040> and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
with him being stuck at Galatasaray and

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.580 
with him being stuck at Galatasaray and
Galatasaray<00:04:47.090> I've<00:04:47.150> been<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.600> only<00:04:47.630> Turkish

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
Galatasaray I've been the only Turkish

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.770 
Galatasaray I've been the only Turkish
team<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.250> game<00:04:49.370> but<00:04:49.610> obviously<00:04:49.670> EA<00:04:50.450> have

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
team in the game but obviously EA have

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.840 
team in the game but obviously EA have
got<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.110> Turkish<00:04:51.530> league<00:04:51.860> right<00:04:52.400> now<00:04:52.430> but

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
got the Turkish league right now but

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.490 
got the Turkish league right now but
he's<00:04:52.970> come<00:04:53.180> back<00:04:53.210> Roberts<00:04:53.660> Chelsea<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.230> I

he's come back Roberts Chelsea and I

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.740 
he's come back Roberts Chelsea and I
