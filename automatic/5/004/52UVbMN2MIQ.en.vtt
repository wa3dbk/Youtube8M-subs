00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.010
 for who does not know the name of this fruit is 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.440
 jatobá and it is with this fruit that the artist 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.480
 Handy Plastic Severino develops 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.250
 his artistic work transforming the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.070
 jatobá fruit and decoration pieces 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.080
 such as those developed by him and by 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.779
 your students how the idea came about 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.519
 to transform the fruit of the jatobá into 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.029
 beautiful arts like the one you are 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.480
 holding 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.400
 after watching them dry already on the ground right? 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.770
 he was observing that with that format 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.350
 progress will lead to animal and 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.600
 does and brought the idea is that with the workshop 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.730
 in the house of culture and together with the students 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.370
 Let's perfect your idea by adding 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.379
 values ​​and transforming this is this 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.710
 jatobá on some object is how long 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.609
 more or less it takes to transform the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 fruit jatobá art show of 30 minutes 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.710
 the probable cause of the format will be a 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.109
 an hour and a half with the drought could 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.040
 wonderful but the materials used 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:09.110
 the jatobá itself the mass in the proper and 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.479
 with the importance of this work already 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.970
 I think it is important because you 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.549
 sees the fruit is thrown in the wild you do not 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.830
 give it no value to you you go over 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.299
 you think he 's there for nothing and the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.970
 from the moment you transform 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.270
 it another object object of decoration by 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.250
 example you give a new formation of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.170
 life of that object because you see and 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.420
 You get the teacher's book and 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.520

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.840
