00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the labels off of jars and then how to

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.560 
the labels off of jars and then how to
get<00:00:08.189> sticky<00:00:08.610> stuff<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.120> doesn't<00:00:09.330> come

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.660 
get sticky stuff that that doesn't come
off<00:00:10.700> so<00:00:11.700> what<00:00:11.790> you're<00:00:11.880> gonna<00:00:11.969> do<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.620> for

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
off so what you're gonna do first for

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.000 
off so what you're gonna do first for
paper<00:00:14.670> labels<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.630> best<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.080> soak<00:00:16.800> them

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
paper labels it's best to just soak them

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.790 
paper labels it's best to just soak them
off<00:00:17.359> for<00:00:18.359> plastic<00:00:18.779> labels<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.590> just

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
off for plastic labels you have to just

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.320 
off for plastic labels you have to just
peel<00:00:20.070> them<00:00:20.279> off<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.730> then<00:00:20.970> deal<00:00:21.180> with<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
peel them off and then deal with the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.439 
peel them off and then deal with the
sticky<00:00:21.570> stuff<00:00:21.660> later<00:00:22.609> but<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> paper<00:00:23.939> label

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
sticky stuff later but for a paper label

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.500 
sticky stuff later but for a paper label
I<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.500> score<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.949> first<00:00:26.330> just<00:00:27.330> take<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
I like to score it first just take a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.240 
I like to score it first just take a
knife<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.289> very<00:00:28.439> careful<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.890> doesn't

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
knife and be very careful that doesn't

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.020 
knife and be very careful that doesn't
slip<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.779> make<00:00:31.080> diagonal<00:00:32.009> marks<00:00:32.790> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
slip but just make diagonal marks you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.229 
slip but just make diagonal marks you
can<00:00:33.149> cross<00:00:33.390> hatch<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.290> just

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
can cross hatch it if you want but just

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
can cross hatch it if you want but just
cut<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:38.450> that<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:40.230> you'll<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.710> bunch

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
cut it and that then you'll have a bunch

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.200 
cut it and that then you'll have a bunch
of<00:00:40.980> cuts<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:41.730> around<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
of cuts that go all the way around and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
of cuts that go all the way around and
that<00:00:42.390> will<00:00:42.629> make<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> water<00:00:43.710> can

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that will make it so that the water can

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740 
that will make it so that the water can
penetrate<00:00:44.460> better<00:00:44.730> otherwise<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> takes<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
penetrate better otherwise it takes a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.459 
penetrate better otherwise it takes a
long<00:00:46.050> time<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.500> soak<00:00:46.829> them<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.730> then<00:00:48.440> take<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
long time to soak them and then take a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.920 
long time to soak them and then take a
bowl<00:00:50.250> full<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.719> warm<00:00:51.719> soapy<00:00:52.199> water<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.890> just

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
bowl full of warm soapy water and just

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.200 
bowl full of warm soapy water and just
submerge<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> let<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.770> sit<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
submerge it in that and let it sit for a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.540 
submerge it in that and let it sit for a
bad<00:00:57.629> day<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.480> yeah<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:02.070> shouldn't<00:01:02.309> take<00:01:02.399> very

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
bad day and yeah it shouldn't take very

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.429 
bad day and yeah it shouldn't take very
long<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.600> say<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.549> yeah<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
long like say this yeah this one the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.750 
long like say this yeah this one the
labels<00:01:07.710> already<00:01:07.950> coming<00:01:08.100> off<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> just

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
labels already coming off and I just

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.910 
labels already coming off and I just
washed<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.170> doesn't<00:01:10.229> take<00:01:10.560> too<00:01:10.770> long

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
washed it so it doesn't take too long

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.359 
washed it so it doesn't take too long
and<00:01:11.630> it'll<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.689> peel<00:01:13.049> off<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.470> sections<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and it'll just peel off in sections and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.510 
and it'll just peel off in sections and
if<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.390> solve<00:01:15.630> any<00:01:15.780> sticky<00:01:16.259> stuff<00:01:16.520> what

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
if you solve any sticky stuff what

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.800 
if you solve any sticky stuff what
you're<00:01:17.640> gonna<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> take

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you're gonna do is you're going to take

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.630 
you're gonna do is you're going to take
your<00:01:18.840> jar<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.009> has<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.400> sticky

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
your jar this one just has the sticky

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.990 
your jar this one just has the sticky
stuff<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.119> now<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.490> best<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.729> I've

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
stuff on it now and the best way I've

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.200 
stuff on it now and the best way I've
found<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.390> use<00:01:24.600> an<00:01:24.720> SOS<00:01:25.140> pad<00:01:25.520> they're<00:01:26.520> like

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
found is to use an SOS pad they're like

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.850 
found is to use an SOS pad they're like
pre-loaded<00:01:28.170> scrubbing<00:01:28.979> pads<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:31.200> don't

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
pre-loaded scrubbing pads and I don't

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.840 
pre-loaded scrubbing pads and I don't
know<00:01:31.920> what's<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.220> dumb<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.520> they're<00:01:32.670> great

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
know what's in dumb but they're great

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
know what's in dumb but they're great
you<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.259> them<00:01:34.380> wet<00:01:35.479> this<00:01:36.479> requires<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you just get them wet this requires a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.580 
you just get them wet this requires a
little<00:01:37.530> bit<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.770> elbow<00:01:38.040> grease<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:39.350> for<00:01:40.350> some

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
little bit of elbow grease and for some

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.670 
little bit of elbow grease and for some
jars<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.729> might<00:01:42.000> scratch<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.049> glass<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.530> can

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
jars it might scratch the glass they can

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.520 
jars it might scratch the glass they can
look<00:01:43.770> frosted<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:46.079> only<00:01:46.110> way<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
look frosted but this is the only way I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.800 
look frosted but this is the only way I
found<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.820> far<00:01:49.939> if<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
found to do it so far if I can think of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.780 
found to do it so far if I can think of
anything<00:01:52.049> else<00:01:53.509> I'll<00:01:54.509> put<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> sidebar

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
anything else I'll put it in the sidebar

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.300 
anything else I'll put it in the sidebar
over<00:01:56.790> there<00:01:56.939> and<00:02:00.680> then<00:02:01.680> you'll<00:02:01.829> also<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.280> able

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
over there and then you'll also be able

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.170 
over there and then you'll also be able
to<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.790> but

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
to do that but

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.310 
to do that but
this<00:02:04.870> actually<00:02:05.290> takes<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.620> while<00:02:06.900> because<00:02:07.900> the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
this actually takes a while because the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.930 
this actually takes a while because the
sticky<00:02:08.619> stuff<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.950> swear<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:09.580> just

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
sticky stuff I swear it's just

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.250 
sticky stuff I swear it's just
absolutely<00:02:10.630> relentless<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.630> SOS<00:02:14.020> pad

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
absolutely relentless but the SOS pad

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.520 
absolutely relentless but the SOS pad
seemed<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.100> job

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:32.070 

see<00:02:23.530> how<00:02:23.710> much<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.280> coming<00:02:24.610> off<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
see how much of that is coming off and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.920 
see how much of that is coming off and
yeah<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.500> after<00:02:32.680> all<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.660> one

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
yeah so after all of that is this one

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.840 
yeah so after all of that is this one
little<00:02:35.170> circle<00:02:35.650> right<00:02:35.680> here<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.400> has<00:02:36.580> no

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
little circle right here that has no

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.140 
little circle right here that has no
sticky<00:02:37.210> stuff<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.460> really<00:02:39.610> does<00:02:39.850> take<00:02:39.880> a

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
sticky stuff so it really does take a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.990 
sticky stuff so it really does take a
while<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.020> have<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.260> work<00:02:41.410> at<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:42.600> because

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
while and you have to work at it because

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.580 
while and you have to work at it because
well<00:02:46.000> if<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.270> want<00:02:46.450> clean<00:02:46.690> jars<00:02:46.960> that's<00:02:47.290> just

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
well if you want clean jars that's just

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.770 
well if you want clean jars that's just
what<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:47.800> gotta<00:02:48.040> do<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.510> where<00:02:49.690> if

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
what you gotta do this is where if

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.240 
what you gotta do this is where if
you're<00:02:49.900> reusing<00:02:50.290> old<00:02:50.740> food<00:02:51.160> jars<00:02:53.250> it's

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you're reusing old food jars it's

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.370 
you're reusing old food jars it's
usually<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.240> lot<00:02:55.390> easier<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.750> get<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.080> sticky

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
usually a lot easier to get the sticky

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.250 
usually a lot easier to get the sticky
stuff<00:02:56.440> off<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:58.180> ones<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.390> paper<00:02:58.780> labels

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
stuff off of the ones that paper labels

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.320 
stuff off of the ones that paper labels
then<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.520> ones<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.850> have<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.120> plastic

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
then the ones that have the plastic

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.979 
then the ones that have the plastic
labels<00:03:01.989> because<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.910> lot<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.570> times<00:03:04.810> when

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
labels because a lot of the times when

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.320 
labels because a lot of the times when
you<00:03:05.080> soak<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.890> paper<00:03:06.100> labels<00:03:06.610> off<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.150> will

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
you soak the paper labels off it will

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.360 
you soak the paper labels off it will
take<00:03:07.600> off<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:08.050> lot<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.470> sticky<00:03:08.800> stuff<00:03:08.860> but
