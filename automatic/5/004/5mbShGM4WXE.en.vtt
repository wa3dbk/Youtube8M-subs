quite<00:02:45.300> sharp<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.110> then<00:02:46.650> I'm<00:02:46.770> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.400> line

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
quite sharp and then I'm going to line

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.030 
quite sharp and then I'm going to line
my<00:02:48.000> eyes<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> little<00:02:49.320> bit<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.800> wing

but<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.910> takes<00:02:51.030> forever<00:02:51.240> doing<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:51.960> camera

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
but it takes forever doing it on camera

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.520 
but it takes forever doing it on camera
so<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:53.010> decided<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:54.570> do<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.050> off<00:02:55.260> camera

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
so I just decided to do it off camera

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.280

two<00:03:59.040> layers<00:03:59.310> but<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.700> just<00:03:59.970> didn't<00:04:00.239> feel<00:04:00.269> like

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
two layers but I just didn't feel like

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.040 
two layers but I just didn't feel like
doing<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.989> for<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.410> look<00:04:01.860> I'm<00:04:02.450> then<00:04:03.450> going<00:04:03.750> to

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
doing it for this look I'm then going to

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.070 
doing it for this look I'm then going to
take<00:04:04.290> my<00:04:04.590> trusty<00:04:04.890> mac<00:04:05.430> prolongwear<00:04:05.730> concealer

in<00:04:07.080> NW<00:04:07.860> 15<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.730> used<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.239> be<00:04:09.390> nw20<00:04:10.019> but<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.709> decided

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
in NW 15 I used to be nw20 but I decided

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.150

to<00:04:11.400> go<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.580> little<00:04:11.790> bit<00:04:12.000> lighter<00:04:12.209> because<00:04:12.540> I

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
to go a little bit lighter because I

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.250 
to go a little bit lighter because I
wanted<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.910> have<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.239> more<00:04:15.510> highlighted

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
wanted it to have a more highlighted

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.800 
wanted it to have a more highlighted
effect<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.370> I'm<00:04:17.489> just<00:04:17.669> going<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.000> take<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.570> on
