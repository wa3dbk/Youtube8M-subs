00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
been trying to put mix it up game mode

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.650 
been trying to put mix it up game mode
wise<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.980> I<00:01:24.220> don't<00:01:25.030> know<00:01:25.090> there's<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.480> lot<00:01:25.630> of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
wise and I don't know there's a lot of

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.690 
wise and I don't know there's a lot of
kill<00:01:25.930> hoary<00:01:26.200> people<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.920> get<00:01:27.250> certain<00:01:27.550> game

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
kill hoary people and get certain game

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700 
kill hoary people and get certain game
modes<00:01:27.910> like<00:01:28.000> how<00:01:28.420> our<00:01:28.690> hard<00:01:29.050> points<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.530> stuff

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
modes like how our hard points and stuff

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.980 
modes like how our hard points and stuff
so<00:01:29.920> probably<00:01:30.220> get<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.580> bit<00:01:30.760> higher

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so probably get that a bit higher

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.320 
so probably get that a bit higher
win-loss<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.140> 2.19<00:01:32.940> been<00:01:33.940> playing<00:01:34.180> with

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
had two lone wolf it a bit so 2.1 at

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.580 
had two lone wolf it a bit so 2.1 at
2.19<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.570> probably<00:01:40.870> where<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.260> should<00:01:41.470> be

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
2.19 is probably where it should be

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.270 
2.19 is probably where it should be

a bit romantic the ak-47 from previous
color<00:01:59.710> duties<00:02:00.130> we've<00:02:00.909> got<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.150> vector<00:02:01.659> which

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
color duties we've got the vector which

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.660 
color duties we've got the vector which
I've<00:02:02.050> been<00:02:02.200> using<00:02:02.470> with<00:02:02.830> flak<00:02:03.280> jacket<00:02:03.580> and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
I've been using with flak jacket and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.060 
I've been using with flak jacket and
awareness<00:02:04.120> long<00:02:04.960> barrel<00:02:05.229> really<00:02:05.770> works<00:02:05.950> well

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
awareness long barrel really works well

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.710 
awareness long barrel really works well
on<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.400> vector<00:02:06.729> increases<00:02:07.240> its<00:02:07.420> range

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
on the vector increases its range

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.740 
on the vector increases its range
massively<00:02:08.560> anyone<00:02:09.549> who's<00:02:09.700> used<00:02:09.789> SMGs<00:02:10.479> or<00:02:10.629> no

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
massively anyone who's used SMGs or no

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.140 
massively anyone who's used SMGs or no
lot<00:02:10.899> on<00:02:10.959> black<00:02:11.140> ops<00:02:11.319> 2<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.769> range<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.580> smgs<00:02:13.030> is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
lot on black ops 2 the range on smgs is

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.050 
lot on black ops 2 the range on smgs is
a<00:02:13.180> bit<00:02:13.420> below<00:02:13.750> par<00:02:14.019> so<00:02:14.349> long<00:02:14.860> barrel<00:02:15.819> really

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
a bit below par so long barrel really

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.479 
a bit below par so long barrel really
