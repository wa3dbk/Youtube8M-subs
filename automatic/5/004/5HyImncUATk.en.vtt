though
so<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.670> how<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.240> or<00:02:12.480> if

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
so if you know how to make one or if

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.360 
so if you know how to make one or if
there's<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:12.960> online<00:02:13.260> at<00:02:13.680> Universal<00:02:14.310> or

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
there's one online at Universal or

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.360 
there's one online at Universal or
something<00:02:15.350> let<00:02:16.350> me<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:18.810> also<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> break

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
something let me know I also get a break

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.430 
something let me know I also get a break
system<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:22.940> normally<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.870> breaks<00:02:25.140> would<00:02:25.320> be

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
system so normally the breaks would be

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.020 
system so normally the breaks would be
on<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.370> when<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.550> push<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.820> brake

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
on that and when you push that brake

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.600 
on that and when you push that brake
lever<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.630> brakes<00:02:27.990> would<00:02:28.110> go<00:02:28.320> but<00:02:28.770> not

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
lever in the brakes would go but not

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.760 
lever in the brakes would go but not
hooked<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.940> I'm<00:02:30.150> thinking<00:02:30.210> about<00:02:30.450> putting

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
hooked up I'm thinking about putting

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.490 
hooked up I'm thinking about putting
disc<00:02:31.770> brake<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.520> let's<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.320> get

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
disc brake on it let's when I get

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.930 
disc brake on it let's when I get
smaller<00:02:34.740> tires<00:02:34.980> they'll<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.310> smaller<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.880> I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
smaller tires they'll be smaller and I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.930 
smaller tires they'll be smaller and I
clip<00:02:36.180> discs<00:02:36.570> between<00:02:36.930> ER<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.370> that's<00:02:38.760> how

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
clip discs between ER so that's how

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.800 
clip discs between ER so that's how
probably<00:02:39.240> going<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.420> do<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:41.420> normally<00:02:42.420> back

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
probably going to do it normally back

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.200 
probably going to do it normally back
here<00:02:43.080> you'd<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.310> same<00:02:44.520> height<00:02:44.760> all<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
here you'd have the same height all the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.020 
here you'd have the same height all the
way<00:02:45.300> back<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.900> then<00:02:45.990> down<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.580> will

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
way back and then down but then it will

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.990 
way back and then down but then it will
be<00:02:48.120> higher<00:02:48.300> up<00:02:49.190> since<00:02:50.190> I'm<00:02:50.400> making<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.850> race

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
be higher up since I'm making it a race

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.050 
be higher up since I'm making it a race
lawnmower<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:52.290> want<00:02:52.470> most<00:02:52.650> gravity<00:02:53.250> Lord<00:02:53.910> as

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
lawnmower you want most gravity Lord as

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.640 
lawnmower you want most gravity Lord as
a<00:02:54.090> ground<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.660> one<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:55.530> more

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
a ground you can one think it's more

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.920 
a ground you can one think it's more
tires<00:02:55.890> you'll<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.430> lower<00:02:56.610> then<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.970> seat<00:02:57.750> we

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
tires you'll be lower then the seat we

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.750 
tires you'll be lower then the seat we
lower<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.410> you'll<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.710> more<00:02:58.950> Lord<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
lower so you'll have more Lord to the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.190 
lower so you'll have more Lord to the

right<00:03:32.130> here<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.700> ignition<00:03:33.320> it's<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.500> push

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
right here is the ignition it's a push

right here is the ignition it's a push
so<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:38.190> batteries<00:03:38.610> right<00:03:39.570> there<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.230> it

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
so the batteries right there but it

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.229 
so the batteries right there but it
tests<00:03:40.739> dead<00:03:40.950> cells<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.510> get<00:03:42.840> into<00:03:42.959> them<00:03:43.140> so

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
tests dead cells so you get into them so

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.920 
tests dead cells so you get into them so

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
bolt in one I'm thinking about upgrading

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.900 
bolt in one I'm thinking about upgrading
it<00:03:52.290> into<00:03:52.890> something<00:03:53.130> different<00:03:53.610> maybe

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
it into something different maybe

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.060 
it into something different maybe

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
literally only took this big section

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.840 
literally only took this big section
piece<00:04:14.250> off<00:04:14.400> which<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.820> right<00:04:15.030> there<00:04:15.060> and

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
piece off which is right there and

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.460 
piece off which is right there and
chopped<00:04:17.850> it<00:04:18.090> because<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.480> was<00:04:18.660> one<00:04:18.989> whole<00:04:19.229> big

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
chopped it because it was one whole big

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.920 
chopped it because it was one whole big
piece<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:20.100> just<00:04:20.669> chopped<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.210> where<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.690> felt

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
piece I just chopped in where I felt

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.730 
piece I just chopped in where I felt
like<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.289> needed<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.620> be

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
like I needed to be

like I needed to be
and<00:04:23.889> I<00:04:24.960> bolted<00:04:25.960> in<00:04:26.199> I'm<00:04:26.889> gonna<00:04:27.069> put<00:04:27.250> this

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
and I bolted in I'm gonna put this

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.900 
and I bolted in I'm gonna put this
little<00:04:27.699> piece<00:04:27.970> right<00:04:28.930> here<00:04:30.630> on<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.910> so

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
little piece right here on to it like so

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.320 
little piece right here on to it like so
just<00:04:34.479> so<00:04:34.599> you<00:04:34.690> can't<00:04:34.900> receive<00:04:35.199> as<00:04:35.380> many<00:04:35.800> wires

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
just so you can't receive as many wires

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.490 
just so you can't receive as many wires
it's<00:04:37.330> choking<00:04:37.479> me<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.690> little<00:04:37.840> gap<00:04:38.080> but<00:04:38.319> that's

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
it's choking me a little gap but that's

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.480 
it's choking me a little gap but that's
animal<00:04:38.830> nothing<00:04:39.460> bad<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.940> don't<00:04:40.030> have<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.240> big

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
animal nothing bad I don't have a big

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.909 
animal nothing bad I don't have a big
long<00:04:42.490> enough<00:04:42.699> for<00:04:42.849> me<00:04:43.440> without<00:04:44.440> having<00:04:44.740> to

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
long enough for me without having to

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.020 
long enough for me without having to
make<00:04:45.099> one<00:04:45.280> right<00:04:45.370> offhand

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.480 

so<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.449> is<00:04:49.599> a<00:04:50.009> project<00:04:51.009> I<00:04:51.460> guess<00:04:52.050> part<00:04:53.050> one

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
so this is a project I guess part one

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.060 
so this is a project I guess part one
