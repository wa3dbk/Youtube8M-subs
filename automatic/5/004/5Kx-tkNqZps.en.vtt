00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.640
 now I can not use the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.870
 same or that use the biggest 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.659
 to see how it's going now, you always have 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.850
 that try to give it stronger so that 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.090
 I can 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.950
 computer to see and it destroys that and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.409
 making the video 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.829
 we have to go playing trying everything 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.689
 until we can destroy everything and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.689
 well this has been 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.890
 video and now I bring you another game that 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 look what 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.990
 sorry to look at this this is from a 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.920
 caveman and you have to go 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.099
 killing these 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.060
 trying to destroy because his to his 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:19.180
 beloved darling is surrounded by monsters 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.310
 we have to try and kill everyone 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.520
 the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.030
 give us 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.010
 This game is very funny and I tell you 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:40.840
 that I what you can prove it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.430
 and that is very good and so passing levels 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.430
 anyway, it's worth 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.370
 and so we can go through 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.140
 let's move on to another section that is 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.140
 'sponge Bob' 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.610
 ok we have to go putting a 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.390
 kind of egg to make it from our 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.220
 color I am how you see 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.510
 I am gomis nun 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.830
 the one on top of the whole 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.720
 and I'm laying eggs to egg 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.850
 and that everything be my color like yellow 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.320
 in agreement 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.540
 look you see I leave it there and if I leave this to 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.780
 side of something can be exploited 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.010
 Behold 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.010
 and left another one 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.690
 and you see how it has been exploited 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.660
 and we have to try to catch everything from 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.660
 our same color 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.540
 I know it's a little slow I'm sorry 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.480
 a lot but it's because I'm recording but 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.480
 it would actually go very fast 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.770
 ok we have to go like this and follow 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:15.440
 winning by force is worth it until everything 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.440
 be in our color according 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:25.380
 Ok now I show you another other top that 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.400
 is this motorcycle 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.919
 look what 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.360
 that started here and I have to try 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:38.630
 kill the other player and I first to 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.590
 that does not reach me and I can play and I can 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.139
 win as you see here I have killed myself and 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.639
 I hope to have 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.639
 to see if I do not kill myself again 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.300
 I'm sorry but now I can not 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.830
 be fine why 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.699
 I need a lot of career now you see and it's 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.250
 well and look at what I do and open 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.250
 all wait I have to take one of those 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.580
 boxes that you have seen before the boxes 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.220
 Now you are going to see these and I take them 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.200
 look what it gives me 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:27.080
 I can take one I can take a grenade 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.080
 and throw it away and that's where it's over 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.630
 and so 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.969
 this is another 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.520
 and look now this is another 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:43.729
 what do i tell you 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:48.529
 you know this is the character of 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:50.569
 of the television that I take it has been 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:53.289
 OK 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.289
 we have to take 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.150
 Now I can not do it because it does not let me 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.129
 I have to go when pushing 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.129
 until you get there 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.080
 I apologize for this 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.620
 and now I jump and I have to go catching 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:26.070
 those cheeses the ones that there are up 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.850
 and look through the cube that metallic 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.850
 can do it 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.040
 nothing now I can not 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:44.199
 or try to do this 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.199
 to see if I can 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:57.600
 and so continue living and well has given me 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.270

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.210
 of cold though I go a little bit to me 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:09.050
 because I'm recording in agreement and 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:09.050
 look here I can catch and throw him 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.650
 to an alien 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.320
 in this power to catch it 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:31.180
 and throw him look 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.180
 I'll throw it to this 

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.309
 and so 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:39.909
 I take it and throw it 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:50.339
