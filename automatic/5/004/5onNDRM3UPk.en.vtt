00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:18.539
 It was the beauty that was so far from 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.220
 come back here with this series of games and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.779
 consultant and missed messi 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.300
 different 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.849
 so the superman I'm with a bug in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.560
 head would not be anyway is the following me 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.710
 was here today for our process was a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.690
 It's a lot of what I did here and I'm going 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.180
 Unless you play I did here today not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.920
 It was Mount Olympus. 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.879
 Olympus pretty much it lot Olympus 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.370
 chic 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.520
 so I did it here in the minecraft 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 staff kept me Puhlmann give the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 guys send me enough to make me 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.480
 this olimpo mount quite even then 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 I decided to do it here in minecraft I do not know 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.100
 if I'm going to take a walk here 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 different to be a look here you 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.340
 You can see what I did to the ground here. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.699
 to hear mainly the terrain has more 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.210
 quality and earth and Mount Olympus is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.250
 there 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.650
 So let me have a little swing here. 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.380
 let's go down here guys look at this 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.510
 it takes some work to do these 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.409
 great need to have these 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.549
 mountains took so it is two hours 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.130
 one of a eu - in one hour and 30 minutes 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.490
 Do not remember or two hours but enjoy 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.540
 all counting everything up to the hill 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 Olympus and tals 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 but anyway it's full of bugs in this article 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.259
 it was because it was done with vox 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.579
 suit and yen I get a goal for that 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.090
 Kind of you work to tidy up. 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.850
 then it is ethical because when you 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 take a straight water so you take it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.729
 a little bit a part she'll join me 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.369
 I do not know how to explain very well but who knows? 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.230
 You know and understand if I had it all. 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.800
 here are the boots to kyoto ok 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.960
 and let him sign spinning it's you 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.000
 Put a block here in the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.130
 I kind of put together everything I do not know 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.570
 explain it right but who knows 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.480
 what I mean 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.210
 but finally lets show that here now 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.710
 this part of the Olympus I think 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.410
 the scheme is that the investor 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.270
 he has a strength that is to do the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.360
 olÃ­mpi tal that gave type 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.880
 he helped me do is copy but part 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.950
 You love yourself but at last 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.540
 here is a lot Olympus here does not leave 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.750
 I know that this sweet little love 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.640
 here was this globe that of goals 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.910
 Tony, because it was a photo I took. 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.310
 there was nothing personal on twitter 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.650
 I had this globe in the middle, so I decided 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.990
 do just to give a touch even 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.210
 show that you will stay at night and 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.720
 I used it here to do a lot. 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.850
 olimpo the volks in epe and the word type he 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.910
 We have done everything by hand here where this is mpe 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.410
 there is everything here before he has 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.990
 closed with you cards 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.530
 the underside saw them i made fox 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.650
 at the time also love finally here we see 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.959
 here part of the top now for you is no 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.720
 There's nothing too much trouble, even that's normal. 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.200
 here is the same hemisphere here in 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.370
 above and here normally continues type 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.140
 as if it were a roof and given round 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.000
 as a coliseum 16 in Coliseum 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.680
 Roman a Roman baggage in the same name 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.500
 that he strangles the lines and does not 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.260
 I forgot the name but anyway, it's the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.660
 Greek methodology here is now to be 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.870
 tired then was to decide if very clean 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.120
