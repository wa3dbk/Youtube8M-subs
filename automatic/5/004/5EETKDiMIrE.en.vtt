00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:11.360
 well we will try to do so we will 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.480
 try to do as you asked us 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.130
 what asked is worth man guys asked 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.080
 that still sometimes there when not very 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 good qualities add on minimap 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.650
 niki just now two days ago 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.230
 the entrance of the first round will make our update 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 fashion after all he is a little bit not very 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.070
 compatible with the mod that appeared in 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.289
 the game is all up to work up to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.180
 once again I think surely 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.440
 surely I, too, just for that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.630
 here is the name to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.489
 nikov was on the minimap and more precisely 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.379
 tanks and indeed we have here some 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.760
 alternate mode here in the game we can 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.770
 also put the name here so to speak 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.890
 it will be more convenient to look at the name of the tank 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.450
 they are on no one in principle why not 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 so at me and at us are planned look 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.379
 tank rubilova and just a team 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.270
 hordes we were going to listen so this 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.309
 give me your screen more you miserable 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.859
 he is the one we speak connect gone 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.340
 I put the pluses guys and let's 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.060
 listen 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:09.330
 dragons good luck we don't shoot on the go 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:17.840
 no virgins give me take away 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.840
 priests can this button can run 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.300
 the rabbit started working began on us 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.370
 work 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.550
 here now it should be put soon 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.560
 there will be a set of soul commands not select 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:37.030
 from behind civilization here here is this in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.640
 the dog will live for this house here 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.850
 with you here 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.680
 works can infected stay on over 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.840
 and not all here we go to 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.510
 west roll raise a dog for 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.860
 the edge of the dog behind the extremely high 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.860
 rolls coasting weave 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:11.750
 I can not see anything 100 on the side of a hundred 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:19.430
 let's build right from right to morning 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:24.620
 century site just had to not retreat 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:28.549
 on the contrary it's programs and not a pancake 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:34.030
 especially deals with you affairs 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.030
 charged us fast to science 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.940
 generally tough idea to friends and for 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.470
 head just come from but how are you 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.480
 it seemed that nothing new was possible 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.360
 come up with an order showed that you can 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.540
 come up with a new well as there performance 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.100
 absorbed from 90 and those who could not with 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.590
 work 100 start teams notice 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.650
 I worked it all start perfectly 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.080
 it was 90 took the position they catches strands 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 full positions are simply unrealistic 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.520
 what happened next is of course phil 90 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.250
 when he is there with the guard shoots falls 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.230
 in the building three on the virginity of the yard 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.690
 Peter I play cleaned what can 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.880
 Say at all idea was extremely 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.860
 fantastic i never 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.960
 saw two nineties fly by 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.170
 central road seizure becomes 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.930
 generally around the corner but put on a grab 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.980
 my ren and wait a hundred in the center to 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.110
 soup if you wrap up and press to be 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.730
 principle, so maybe it was not necessary 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.050
 that not so it was really cool but 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.830
 Now 90 the two of them simply will file 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.290
 his fight 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.750
 they forgot the main battle which 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.830
 would allow them to continue further 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.050
 this offensive 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.450
 I did not understand just then when 90 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.060
 take a position why they didn't shoot 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.890
 why they did not come out with strands to the center 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.810
 if tyazh would leave in the center and on 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.030
 the sister of this would have taken the tank behind the fountain 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.800
 because the tank behind the fountain can't 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.900
 damage six tanks at the same time there and 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.180
 period nothing at all just an idea 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.920
 rd rush thank you you can not be 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.870
 a new favorite team will appear in this 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.750
 season if they are like that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.280
 keep up those very very very clearly 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.990
 let's see the statistics here 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.150
 of course, the overwhelming figures for 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.970
 team lookin 'for sponsor armageddon 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.760
 magnificent again 1679 damage annihilator 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.980
 in second place but with three frags and 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.780
 almost the same damage also review about 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.000
 played magnificently one and a half thousand one 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.460
 minus in principle this trinity did very 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.920
 good job for all your team a 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.870
 Now the dragons here on devyanostikom 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.530
 You know, not so bad, they seem to be 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.950
 he turned out to be 310 and 900 so they 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.300
 played aggression they became together 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.910
 creating hid and waiting and into this 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.070
 time for some reason 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.850
 heavy tanks start to play passively 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.590
 that's why they share their strength so I 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.320
 not barney first now there 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.730
 disassemble after the game who was wrong 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.780
 because really really 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.700
 very tough 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.900
 such a cool idea on the idea of ​​all 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.910
 should have turned out 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.830
 lfs probably would have been shocked to have started 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.800
 but it turned out they took positions gave 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.290
 damage everything seemed i thought it was 10 and 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.810
 all really succeeded here on in ruinberge 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:19.000
 the end we got here such here in the end 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.000
 on himmedsdorf i will have to go all in
