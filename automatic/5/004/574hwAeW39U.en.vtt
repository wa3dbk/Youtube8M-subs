00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
exactly did that but first time I seen

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.189 
exactly did that but first time I seen
them<00:00:22.230> might<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.769> been<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> while<00:00:23.100> ago<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:25.080> the

in<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> couple<00:00:33.030> seconds<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:36.180> should

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
in like a couple seconds you should

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.729 
in like a couple seconds you should
spawn<00:00:36.870> somewhere<00:00:37.640> around<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.000> area<00:00:39.469> as<00:00:40.469> you

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
spawn somewhere around this area as you

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.310 
spawn somewhere around this area as you
can<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> decent<00:00:42.090> sized<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.899> piece

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
can see you got a decent sized and piece

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
can see you got a decent sized and piece
they're<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.710> NPC<00:00:44.100> village<00:00:44.160> survival<00:00:44.520> island

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
they're not NPC village survival island

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.950 
they're not NPC village survival island
it<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.670> really<00:00:47.670> cool<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.210> my<00:00:48.239> opinion<00:00:48.360> because

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it is really cool in my opinion because

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.950 
it is really cool in my opinion because
when<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.039> uh<00:00:50.219> where<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.390> building<00:00:51.660> on

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
when I do uh where I like building on

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.250 
when I do uh where I like building on
ions<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.469> plan<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.770> survival<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.570> like<00:00:54.570> having

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
ions and plan on survival I like having

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.520 
ions and plan on survival I like having
hills<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.570> mainly<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.289> always

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
hills like this mainly because I always

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.290 
hills like this mainly because I always
assume<00:00:58.920> lowlands<00:00:59.430> flood<00:00:59.670> easily<00:01:00.090> especially

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
assume lowlands flood easily especially

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.209 
assume lowlands flood easily especially
in<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> middle<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> oceans<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.680> stuff<00:01:01.949> so

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
in the middle of oceans and stuff so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.929 
in the middle of oceans and stuff so
that's<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> main<00:01:03.149> reason<00:01:03.300> why<00:01:04.760> I've<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that's the main reason why I've got a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359 
that's the main reason why I've got a
decent<00:01:06.150> surrounding<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.110> guess<00:01:07.439> before<00:01:07.830> this

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
decent surrounding I guess before this

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.679 
decent surrounding I guess before this
should<00:01:08.850> work<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.710> 1.7.10<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.010> 1.8<00:01:11.689> snapshots

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
should work on 1.7.10 and 1.8 snapshots

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
should work on 1.7.10 and 1.8 snapshots
I'm<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.140> sure<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> full<00:01:13.740> 1.8<00:01:14.310> version

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
I'm not sure if the full 1.8 version

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.410 
I'm not sure if the full 1.8 version
will<00:01:15.290> or<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> final<00:01:16.710> 1.8<00:01:17.369> version<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.210> be

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
will or the final 1.8 version will be

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
will or the final 1.8 version will be
able<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.549> currently<00:01:20.700> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
able to use this but as it currently is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.570 
able to use this but as it currently is
it<00:01:21.299> does<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.619> you're

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.780 
not sure what the official name for it
is<00:02:06.619> as<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.130> doesn't<00:02:08.310> seem<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> be

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790
