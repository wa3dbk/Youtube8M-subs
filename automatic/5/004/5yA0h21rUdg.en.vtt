00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 my name is frank bissinger I 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.690
 sabine i do my man the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.089
 Oil paintings at the Havel 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.160
 We have been doing this for about a year 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.710
 We live on the edge of Berlin in Kladow 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.430
 our data comes from the region of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.910
 local build all this regional 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.830
 Local was personal to me personally 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.430
 important i want the face behind it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.260
 stand by what I eat and at 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 I have a tour of the oil mill 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.050
 seen how much chemistry in this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.890
 process is present 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.190
 I decided to do that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 just try it yourself and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.340
 I started in the region for data 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.340
 to look for natural bio pages 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.180
 We have farmers looking for us in 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.260
 brandenburg thuringia and the surrounding area 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.330
 and related to these data 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.689
 or derive from this data we 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.740
 then to eat so trade center-line 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.740
 oil oil there 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.080
 The quality of the seed is from 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.200
 crucial importance to one 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.490
 to produce high quality oil we have 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.590
 very small, I have mine 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 Man sent to seasonal oil mill 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.780
 then we buy some bags 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.630
 brought by farmers in lucka ban 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.080
 mountain and years have then just times 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.300
 Los pressed the first thing I pressed 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.830
 has sunflowers that was on 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.380
 then black has something 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.420
 let settle but the taste was 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.430
 that of pure sunflower seeds and 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.390
 I had never seen anything like that before 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.610
 is or tasted and was surprised 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.940
 the result and this 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.440
 Tasting explosion and quality and that 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.280
 of course very encouraged me has 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.380
 of course all my friends 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.830
 combined with my parents gave you 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.200
 everybody thought it was good then we got cold 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.270
 pressed natural vegan cave in 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.979
 craft manufacturing we have 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.590
 nothing filtered we leave the oils 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.430
 nature cloudy leave you two days 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.370
 drop 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.480
 This is the creamy taste as you 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.480
 otherwise not true 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.050
 and then I discovered leindotter 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.600
 This has nothing to do with linen 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.390
 but this is a separate 4000 years 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.790
 old celtic culture square and there is 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.920
 an oil that tastes like asparagus 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.320
 which is very much omega 3 and in the end itself 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.150
 i have all summer for me 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.160
 Only ortho sala carries this oil 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.160
 lived second very special 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.400
 we have the task to share with you 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.930
 press the oils is 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.390
 I am more responsible for the farmers 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.110
 search the data maybe find too 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.920
 find recipes for similar seasoning oils and 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.070
 also a bit nervous 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.260
 organizational for accounting i 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.840
 would like to have the oils always fresh and 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.490
 I would like to order after you order 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.250
 only then will it be with her upbeat 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.770
 pressed and there is nothing stored there 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.150
 nothing is done big industry 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.830
 but that of craftsmanship 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.340
 be manufacture so that everyone just 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.959
 we have experienced this natural 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.489
 now started or marketed the whole 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.260
 wanted to bring under the people 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.300
 look like the reaction to the oils 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.890
 overall and gain experience 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.380
 we are doing it in different single 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.670
 hand shops to give it to the delicatessen 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.670
 must with lpg 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.880
 These small presscakes are the ones you can taste 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.620
 really delicious so in mÃ¼li and are 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:55.660
 include normal flaxseed is for me 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.850
 The ideal has everything as a hobby 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.860
 started and for me the healthy 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.500
 nutrition yes now the question is how 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.090
 it continues under the next goal would be 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.860
 but actually the production too 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.260
 to expand a nice production too 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.540
 looking where you can find the appropriate 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.400
 can produce quantities and above all 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.140
 We would like to do something in berlin 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.200
 Clarify any kind in the city 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.370
 build oil mill where people really 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.350
 then you can go as it made 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.230
 will and then pick it up from us 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.480
 of course my goal would be something 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.790
 at least it will become bigger 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.600
 regional needs are reasonably satisfied 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.820
 can be 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.640
 maybe have a load in berlin where 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.740
 also a confirmation with a kanne 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.940
 we can do that ourselves 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.940
 would be such a distant 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.350
 And of course, that's fun as well
