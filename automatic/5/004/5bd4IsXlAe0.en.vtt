00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.279 

it<00:05:17.149> doesn't<00:05:17.449> take<00:05:17.599> much<00:05:17.779> if<00:05:18.019> they're<00:05:18.169> out

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
it doesn't take much if they're out

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.619 
it doesn't take much if they're out
there<00:05:18.529> for<00:05:18.799> a<00:05:18.979> half<00:05:19.249> the<00:05:19.399> left<00:05:19.639> that<00:05:20.209> creep<00:05:20.479> in
