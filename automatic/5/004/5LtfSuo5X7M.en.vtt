reads<00:01:35.959> it<00:01:36.110> out<00:01:36.200> perfectly<00:01:36.649> so<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:36.950> think<00:01:37.190> again

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
reads it out perfectly so I think again

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.160

it can be a bit faulty in speech but I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.719 
it can be a bit faulty in speech but I

think if this app really works on that

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.389 
think if this app really works on that
this<00:01:41.239> can<00:01:41.420> be<00:01:41.539> an<00:01:41.630> amazing<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.399> revolutionary
