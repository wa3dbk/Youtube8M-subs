the<00:00:07.259> Bowflex<00:00:07.849> I've<00:00:08.849> been<00:00:09.059> using<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.530> system

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
the Bowflex I've been using this system

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.930 
the Bowflex I've been using this system
for<00:00:10.740> two<00:00:11.040> years<00:00:11.250> I've<00:00:11.400> been<00:00:11.429> working<00:00:11.550> out<00:00:11.880> for

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
for two years I've been working out for

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.060 
for two years I've been working out for
over<00:00:12.269> twenty<00:00:12.540> seven<00:00:12.750> years<00:00:12.929> now<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.469> free

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
over twenty seven years now on free

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.180 
over twenty seven years now on free
weights<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:15.139> I'm<00:00:16.139> really<00:00:16.500> happy<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:17.039> this

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
weights and I'm really happy with this

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.439 
weights and I'm really happy with this
this<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> lot<00:00:17.760> different<00:00:17.910> than<00:00:18.150> free

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
this is a lot different than free

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.779 
this is a lot different than free
weights<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.869> Bowflex<00:00:19.320> more<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.310> toning<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
weights the Bowflex more for toning and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.540 
weights the Bowflex more for toning and
defining<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:22.050> these<00:00:22.590> Bo's<00:00:22.920> never<00:00:23.250> really

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
defining so these Bo's never really

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.939 
defining so these Bo's never really
equal<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> free<00:00:24.300> weight<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.320> actual<00:00:25.710> weight

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
equal the free weight the actual weight

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.000 
equal the free weight the actual weight
although<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.349> one<00:00:28.349> hundred<00:00:28.470> pounds<00:00:28.949> of

although I do have one hundred pounds of
Bo's<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.240> then<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.420> hundred<00:00:30.630> pounds<00:00:30.869> on

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
okay I'll show you how this app cruncher

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.840 
okay I'll show you how this app cruncher
works<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.080> special<00:02:44.440> attachment<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:45.670> an

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
works this is a special attachment is an

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.820 
works this is a special attachment is an
option<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.450> little<00:02:46.780> bit<00:02:46.960> extra<00:02:47.200> for<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.560> one

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.310 

shoot<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:51.010> camera<00:02:51.400> over<00:02:51.580> towards<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.320> AB

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
shoot this camera over towards the AB

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.230 
shoot this camera over towards the AB
cruncher<00:02:54.130> right<00:02:54.700> there

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
cruncher right there

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.210 
cruncher right there
and<00:02:55.900> I'll<00:02:55.990> do<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.170> few<00:02:56.470> crunches<00:02:57.370> here<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:59.220> little

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
and I'll do a few crunches here a little

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.580 
and I'll do a few crunches here a little
bit<00:03:00.310> more<00:03:00.460> weight<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.700> here<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:05.260> there's<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
bit more weight on here so there's a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:33.240 
bit more weight on here so there's a
about<00:03:07.140> 220<00:03:08.140> pounds<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.710> there<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.980> there<00:03:33.130> you

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
about 220 pounds on there so there you

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.960 
about 220 pounds on there so there you
have<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.490> folks

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
have it folks

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.740 
have it folks
that<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.810> Bowflex<00:03:35.230> ultimate<00:03:35.710> -<00:03:36.540> there<00:03:37.540> is

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
that is the Bowflex ultimate - there is

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.350 
that is the Bowflex ultimate - there is
a<00:03:38.050> sort<00:03:38.800> of<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.920> regular<00:03:39.280> Bowflex<00:03:39.730> as<00:03:39.880> one<00:03:40.060> step

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
a sort of a regular Bowflex as one step

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.180 
a sort of a regular Bowflex as one step
down<00:03:40.540> from<00:03:40.840> this<00:03:40.960> one<00:03:41.040> probably<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.100> lot

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
down from this one probably a lot

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.760 
down from this one probably a lot
cheaper<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.550> buy<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.320> if<00:03:44.320> you're<00:03:44.500> just<00:03:44.530> getting

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
cheaper to buy so if you're just getting

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.700 
cheaper to buy so if you're just getting
into<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.340> just<00:03:45.640> starting<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.030> work<00:03:46.180> out<00:03:46.680> then<00:03:47.680> I

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
into it just starting to work out then I

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.930 
into it just starting to work out then I
recommend<00:03:48.070> maybe<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.430> get<00:03:48.610> down<00:03:48.760> when<00:03:48.910> I

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
recommend maybe you get down when I

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.800 
recommend maybe you get down when I
