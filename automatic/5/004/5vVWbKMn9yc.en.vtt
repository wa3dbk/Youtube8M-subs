00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.040
 throwing yourself into the void in free fall is a 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.929
 unique feeling that can only be 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.950
 experiment through sports 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.720
 extremes 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.250
 juancho and some of the time team 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.250
 real the bridge was asked 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.400
 and you are as cowardly as I am 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.460
 he dreams that he does not stay on a little step 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.230
 to a smaller one and they're ready 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.480
 to leave a therapy because today time 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.439
 real is going to throw at 24 meters in height 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.439
 with the boys of aragua tap 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.720
 which juancho is a little chicken 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.360
 so we wanted to accompany him to 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.180
 leave it alone in this relay 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.640
 nervous the biggest real-time 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.810
 I hope that the security measures 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.250
 hold on for the ropes because this 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.449
 type is very heavy 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.129
 conchi styles cayese ps you have 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.649
 jorge hernÃ¡ndez and I am one of the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.449
 owners of the club so that it is already 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.739
 where are we going to go now we are going to go to 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.629
 20 of the eagles of an apple 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.710
 vending activity and because it is a 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.140
 auspicious place for this activity 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.420
 extreme because there are very few bridges 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.130
 with the specifications of that which are 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.570
 have anchor after they are in 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.250
 a metal bridge where they are put towards 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.810
 the anchors for safety jump 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.950
 and some instructions before or not 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.950
 we see right now we did it there 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.740
 Hello 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.790
 very interesting 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.340
 let's see how and how high is the 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.340
 bridge 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.920
 now we are riding to say the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.229
 platform or the floor so that 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.479
 that you want to shoot then you have to 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.570
 run around here to launch many with 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.610
 impulse if one that the rope does not hang 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.000
 then you have to have a good 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.110
 impulse so that you will not fall 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.110
 runs his positivity 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.620
 I feel horrible but when you see 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.109
 to throw yourself correctable the feeling of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.409
 bed is recordable zero fear the 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.409
 adrenalin 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 plus 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.050
 great perfect what is the moment more 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.910
 when one is falling but we are already 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.080
 alejandra and nelson warming up you think 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.240
 that youtube is going to scare them last 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.740
 time because hopefully not because 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.450
 everyone has jumped without being scared 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.240
 I think that at least he hopes to give them 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.640
 come back I have a scare 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.310
 I feel for the team 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.050
 in real time but not all for making a 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.459
 good program for them to see the 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.350
 different patches that have the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.230
 young people to go out to the city 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.110
 inside laugh play and you have true 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.230
 hip movement even if they try 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.769
 find the way 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.769
 ay ay 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.140
 32 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.950
 you're ready and you 're ready to 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.950
 discuss with me 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.640
 you come when mom 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.050
 And if I die, my niece loves you all 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.050
 life pretty 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.160
 not happening no no if it's like that I want 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.870
 to be like this not running I do not want 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.470
 imply if it does not give me something much 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.389
 luck 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.290
 thank you I hope alive I hope to have you in the 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.290
 team a lot more time 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.159
 why it is important to warm up 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.539
 previously the salt because because if 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.039
 that they do not jump well as to see a 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.900
 milestone that the body is a little 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.449
 hot and a little stretched so that 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.300
 they will not have any lumbar pain or 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.940
 hip movement even if they try 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.080
 I find a way that does not affect me 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.830
 see how it moves 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.830
 is going to have 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.930
 You run out and come and grab her 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.020
 good but keep your head this 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.020
 fact 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.430
 but together we can 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.090
 when the tea world invests in giving the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.380
 return is only good and we finished the 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.880
 day of bungee jumping with the boys of 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.890
 aragua is thank you very much for everything 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.510
 boys and the experience relationship 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.950
 Only sand line recommended the patch 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.570
 Yes very good 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.190
 from very good patch there are many things 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.170
 to see here and the activity is super 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.460
 good is worth it was a chronicle for 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.460
 real time really
