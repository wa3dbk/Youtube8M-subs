 q 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.349
 thanks to this recipe to discover that we can also use wasabi in 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:12.219
 complement 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.109
 I start by peeling the shallots I order them and I know it 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.300
 finely 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.009
 gps the potatoes 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.150
 I fight potatoes in four 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.279
 do not kill in very thin slats 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.279
 I tres effect that his country freeze the part of a large volume of cold water 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.589
 in a saucepan melt the butter 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.480
 I add that shallots 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.510
 a pinch of salt and I assume it in this case shallots are well insured 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.160
 I add not even noted arnaud labbé and a pinch of salt 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.400
 so 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.400
 I bring to a boil and I can tell you 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 in a big plate 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.140
 never 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.320

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.880

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.140
 I love you so much this marinade in a plate 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.220

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.270

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.380
 thick 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.380
 I will love slices of salmon to marinate 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.150
 after five years cooking soup 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.280
 I add fish 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 and I think cooking five minutes 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.460
 when the vegetable garden cooks I do not want to qualify 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.360
 I'm wearing again and ammo 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.730

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.030
 the more you will leave the marinated fish 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.940
