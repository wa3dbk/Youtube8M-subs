00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.640 

show<00:00:57.060> you<00:00:57.120> example<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.990> the<00:00:58.140> difference<00:00:58.470> this

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
show you example of the difference this

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.790 
show you example of the difference this
makes<00:01:00.140> this<00:01:01.140> shows<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.620> light<00:01:01.800> set<00:01:02.310> at<00:01:02.520> 5500<00:01:03.360> K

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
makes this shows the light set at 5500 K

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.200 
makes this shows the light set at 5500 K
now<00:01:04.800> I'll<00:01:04.920> dial<00:01:05.160> it<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:07.590> 3200<00:01:08.340> K<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
now I'll dial it down to 3200 K and you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.640 
now I'll dial it down to 3200 K and you
can<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.660> a<00:01:09.690> difference<00:01:10.050> that<00:01:10.110> makes<00:01:10.229> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
can see what a difference that makes in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
can see what a difference that makes in
this<00:01:11.280> particular<00:01:11.790> case<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.630> light<00:01:12.870> in<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
this particular case my light in the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.350 
this particular case my light in the
room<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.560> balanced<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.130> towards<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.550> 3200<00:01:15.210> K

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
room is balanced more towards the 3200 K

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.310 
room is balanced more towards the 3200 K
so<00:01:15.840> I'm<00:01:15.900> getting<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.290> better<00:01:16.440> look<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:22.140> light

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
so I'm getting a better look the light

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.420 
so I'm getting a better look the light
also<00:01:22.680> comes<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> battery<00:01:23.340> test<00:01:23.790> indicator

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
also comes with a battery test indicator

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.400 
also comes with a battery test indicator
