the<00:01:55.649> West<00:01:55.829> working<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.729> us<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.240> Western

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the West working with us as Western

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
the West working with us as Western
developers<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:59.000> understand<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
developers is that we understand the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.789 
developers is that we understand the
Western<00:02:00.360> market<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.259> will<00:02:01.439> make<00:02:01.590> the

Western market and that will make the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
Western market and that will make the
games<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> way<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.369> always<00:02:02.640> made<00:02:02.790> them<00:02:03.030> but

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
games the way we always made them but

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.670 
games the way we always made them but
with<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:03.930> great<00:02:04.020> influences<00:02:04.619> that

with some really great influences that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.470 
with some really great influences that
we<00:02:04.829> think<00:02:05.009> really

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
we think really

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.810 
we think really
lamat<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:06.470> not<00:02:06.650> like<00:02:06.950> we're<00:02:07.190> saying

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
lamat it so it's not like we're saying

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.790 
lamat it so it's not like we're saying
let's<00:02:08.090> become<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.360> Japanese<00:02:08.810> developer<00:02:09.320> as<00:02:09.740> a

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
let's become a Japanese developer as a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.080 
let's become a Japanese developer as a
result<00:02:10.040> so<00:02:10.310> there's<00:02:10.460> a<00:02:10.490> little<00:02:10.610> bit<00:02:10.730> of<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.940> hair

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
result so there's a little bit of a hair

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.060 
result so there's a little bit of a hair
to<00:02:11.270> split<00:02:11.510> there<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:12.050> salty<00:02:12.410> but<00:02:12.620> we're

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
there they've done a lot more work and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.920 
there they've done a lot more work and
research<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.680> unit<00:02:39.950> looks<00:02:40.270> we<00:02:41.270> know<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.660> lot

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
research on the unit looks we know a lot

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.090 
research on the unit looks we know a lot
more<00:02:41.960> about<00:02:42.350> what<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.590> takes<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.920> make<00:02:42.950> a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
more about what it takes to make a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.980 
more about what it takes to make a
really<00:02:43.430> good<00:02:43.460> RTS<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.180> reads<00:02:44.480> really<00:02:44.870> well

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
really good RTS that reads really well

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.360 
really good RTS that reads really well
from<00:02:45.170> distance<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.830> when<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.010> zoom<00:02:46.160> that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
from distance so that when you zoom that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.920 
from distance so that when you zoom that
camera<00:02:46.670> out<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.910> can<00:02:47.060> still<00:02:47.270> understand

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
camera out you can still understand

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.160 
camera out you can still understand
what's<00:02:48.050> going<00:02:48.110> on<00:02:48.320> in<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.530> world<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.520> we<00:02:50.210> work

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
what's going on in the world and we work

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.070 
what's going on in the world and we work
harder<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:51.770> not<00:02:52.400> only<00:02:52.550> create<00:02:52.840> profiles<00:02:53.840> of

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
harder to not only create profiles of

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080 
harder to not only create profiles of
the<00:02:54.140> units<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.740> see<00:02:54.950> but<00:02:55.520> pushing

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the units that you can see but pushing

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.390 
the units that you can see but pushing
them<00:02:56.360> into<00:02:56.420> their<00:02:56.630> own<00:02:56.750> spaces<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.040> they

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
them into their own spaces so that they

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.520 
them into their own spaces so that they
don't<00:02:58.640> mush<00:02:59.060> together<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.750> look<00:03:00.140> very

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
don't mush together and look very

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.860 
don't mush together and look very
similar<00:03:00.770> so<00:03:00.920> we've<00:03:01.700> it's<00:03:02.180> been<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.420> real<00:03:02.630> effort

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
similar so we've it's been a real effort

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.040 
similar so we've it's been a real effort
to<00:03:03.200> create<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:04.040> look<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.550> you<00:03:05.050> identified

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
to create that look that you identified

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.220 
to create that look that you identified
I<00:03:06.080> like<00:03:06.350> doing<00:03:06.470> this<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.740> a<00:03:06.770> warmth<00:03:07.570> but<00:03:08.570> really

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
I like doing this is a warmth but really

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.770 
I like doing this is a warmth but really
it's<00:03:09.590> character<00:03:10.100> style<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.030> it's<00:03:11.150> spending

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
it's character style and it's spending

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.380 
it's character style and it's spending
the<00:03:11.900> time<00:03:12.050> agonizing<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.740> those<00:03:12.890> aesthetics

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
the time agonizing on those aesthetics

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.550 
the time agonizing on those aesthetics
let's<00:03:14.390> talk<00:03:14.600> about<00:03:14.750> some<00:03:15.050> of<00:03:15.140> those<00:03:15.230> those

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
let's talk about some of those those

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.530 
let's talk about some of those those
aesthetics<00:03:16.180> some<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.330> things<00:03:17.480> that

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
aesthetics some of the things that

in<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.650> months<00:04:03.830> ahead<00:04:03.950> now<00:04:04.640> obviously<00:04:05.270> still

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
in the months ahead now obviously still

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.449 
in the months ahead now obviously still
a<00:04:05.780> big<00:04:05.959> focus<00:04:06.140> on<00:04:06.380> kind<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.830> large

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
a big focus on kind of the the large

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.040 
a big focus on kind of the the large
scale<00:04:07.790> as<00:04:08.060> with<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:08.390> first<00:04:08.600> group<00:04:08.780> commander

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
scale as with the first group commander

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.560 
scale as with the first group commander
but<00:04:09.320> has<00:04:09.739> that<00:04:10.040> changed<00:04:10.070> in<00:04:10.730> focus<00:04:11.270> like<00:04:11.420> has

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
but has that changed in focus like has

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.360 
but has that changed in focus like has
it<00:04:11.690> gotten<00:04:11.840> any<00:04:12.020> bigger<00:04:12.350> has<00:04:12.680> gotten<00:04:12.950> any<00:04:13.070> any

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
it gotten any bigger has gotten any any

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.710 
it gotten any bigger has gotten any any
smaller<00:04:13.760> have<00:04:14.209> there<00:04:14.329> been<00:04:14.359> any<00:04:14.480> kind<00:04:14.690> of

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
smaller have there been any kind of

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.300 
smaller have there been any kind of
adjustments<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.410> well<00:04:16.100> there<00:04:16.220> is

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
adjustments to that well there is

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.779 
adjustments to that well there is
definitely<00:04:16.640> a<00:04:16.700> focus<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.180> way<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.390> game

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
definitely a focus in the way the game

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.129 
definitely a focus in the way the game
we<00:04:18.789> have<00:04:18.910> fewer<00:04:19.180> units<00:04:19.389> but<00:04:19.720> we've<00:04:19.870> added<00:04:20.019> the

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
we have fewer units but we've added the

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.140 
we have fewer units but we've added the
entire<00:04:20.440> tech<00:04:20.799> tree<00:04:21.069> that<00:04:21.459> allows<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.789> to<00:04:21.910> make

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
entire tech tree that allows you to make

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.580 
entire tech tree that allows you to make
all<00:04:22.330> these<00:04:22.509> combinations<00:04:22.840> with<00:04:23.259> the<00:04:23.319> units

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
all these combinations with the units

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.080 
all these combinations with the units
which<00:04:23.710> creates<00:04:24.009> a<00:04:24.069> lot<00:04:24.220> of<00:04:24.310> replayability<00:04:24.699> and

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
which creates a lot of replayability and

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.610 
which creates a lot of replayability and
stuff<00:04:25.270> like<00:04:25.389> that<00:04:25.449> we<00:04:25.930> drop<00:04:26.169> some<00:04:26.410> of<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
stuff like that we drop some of the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.050 
stuff like that we drop some of the
little<00:04:26.830> fiddly<00:04:27.160> little<00:04:27.310> things<00:04:27.729> we<00:04:27.849> drop

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
little fiddly little things we drop

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.809 
little fiddly little things we drop
coordinated<00:04:28.630> attack<00:04:28.930> nobody<00:04:29.319> used<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.819> we

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
coordinated attack nobody used it we

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.969 
coordinated attack nobody used it we
have<00:04:31.120> some<00:04:31.330> changes<00:04:32.139> to<00:04:32.229> our<00:04:32.259> economy<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.889> we

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
have some changes to our economy that we

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.890 
have some changes to our economy that we
think<00:04:33.130> are<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.400> better<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:33.849> we<00:04:33.970> we've

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
think are for the better so we we've

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.920 
think are for the better so we we've
made<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.199> economy<00:04:35.650> more<00:04:36.190> easily<00:04:36.580> learn<00:04:37.479> tap

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
made the economy more easily learn tap

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.629 
made the economy more easily learn tap
you<00:04:38.110> know<00:04:38.229> people<00:04:38.500> can<00:04:38.620> learn<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:38.949> faster<00:04:39.370> but

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
you know people can learn it faster but

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.129 
you know people can learn it faster but
really<00:04:39.970> just<00:04:40.000> have<00:04:40.240> more<00:04:40.419> fun<00:04:40.569> and<00:04:40.810> it's<00:04:40.930> less

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
really just have more fun and it's less

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.219 
really just have more fun and it's less
tricky<00:04:41.789> but<00:04:42.789> all<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.120> all<00:04:43.360> in<00:04:43.509> a<00:04:43.569> good<00:04:43.750> way<00:04:43.870> so

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
tricky but all in all in a good way so

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.659 
tricky but all in all in a good way so
improvement<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.860> we<00:04:44.979> think<00:04:45.160> people<00:04:45.400> really

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
improvement that we think people really

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.909 
improvement that we think people really
embrace<00:04:45.990> excellent<00:04:46.990> now<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.289> is<00:04:47.440> coming<00:04:47.770> to
