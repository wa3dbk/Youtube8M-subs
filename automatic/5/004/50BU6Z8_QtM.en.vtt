well<00:00:23.519> windy<00:00:24.390> world<00:00:28.460> well<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:29.669> I<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:30.149> it<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
well windy world well as I see it it

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.780 
well windy world well as I see it it
must<00:00:31.140> mean<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.469> the<00:00:31.649> new<00:00:31.890> wages<00:00:32.430> will<00:00:32.640> be

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
must mean that the new wages will be

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.470 
must mean that the new wages will be
independent<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:33.750> windfalls<00:00:34.550> hmm<00:00:35.550> hmm

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.090 

well<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> course<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:40.199> earned<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.589> lot<00:00:40.769> last

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
well of course they earned a lot last

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.399 
well of course they earned a lot last
time<00:00:41.519> we<00:00:41.760> had<00:00:41.909> a<00:00:41.970> hurricane<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.229> long

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
time we had a hurricane but in the long

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:50.110 
time we had a hurricane but in the long
run<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.949> guess<00:00:44.699> it's<00:00:44.909> better<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.449> way<00:00:45.510> oh

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.179 

that's<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:52.350> always<00:00:52.530> been<00:00:52.710> impossible

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:53.189 
that's good it's always been impossible

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:55.520 
that's good it's always been impossible
to<00:00:53.580> get<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.729> reliable<00:00:54.089> weather<00:00:54.600> forecast<00:00:55.199> for

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to get a reliable weather forecast for

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.670 
to get a reliable weather forecast for
the<00:00:55.619> advance<00:00:55.920> tax<00:00:56.280> payment<00:00:56.790> so<00:00:57.540> I<00:00:57.930> think<00:00:58.409> it's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the advance tax payment so I think it's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.020 
the advance tax payment so I think it's
a<00:00:58.739> good<00:00:58.890> idea<00:01:03.409> well<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.009> only<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.640> read

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
a good idea well the only way I can read

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.390 
a good idea well the only way I can read
this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.140> no<00:01:07.290> longer<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.860> Beaufort

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this is that we no longer have Beaufort

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
this is that we no longer have Beaufort
scale<00:01:08.579> as<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> parameter<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.840> our<00:01:09.990> weight

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
scale as the parameter in our weight

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.020 
scale as the parameter in our weight
sheets<00:01:10.590> oh<00:01:14.869> good<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.020> could<00:01:16.170> come<00:01:16.409> our
