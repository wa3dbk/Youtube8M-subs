00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.070 
cool
on<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.960> back<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:09.390> copyright

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
on the back we have some just copyright

on the back we have some just copyright
for<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.799> barcode<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.729> stuff<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:13.250> yep

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
for the barcode and stuff like that yep

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.929 
for the barcode and stuff like that yep
so<00:01:14.520> let's<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.790> these<00:01:14.909> pods<00:01:15.180> open<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> seeing

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
so let's get these pods open so seeing

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.480 
so let's get these pods open so seeing
snaps<00:01:18.780> open

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.330 

step<00:01:26.520> initialism<00:01:27.359> discards<00:01:28.079> out<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:29.039> this

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
step initialism discards out like this

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.669 
step initialism discards out like this
okay

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
okay

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.010 

so<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.460> cars<00:01:32.700> are<00:01:32.969> really<00:01:33.240> cool<00:01:33.689> looking

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
so the cars are really cool looking

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
so the cars are really cool looking
after<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> back<00:01:34.799> looks<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.460> course

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
after the back looks like it's course

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.410 
after the back looks like it's course
clear<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.899> can't<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:38.549> what's<00:01:39.090> on

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
clear but you can't see see what's on

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.510 
clear but you can't see see what's on
the<00:01:39.869> other<00:01:39.899> side<00:01:40.109> of<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.530> card<00:01:40.770> really

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.539 

so<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.909> app<00:01:45.270> basically<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.219> a<00:01:47.340> they

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so that's app basically and it's a they

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
so that's app basically and it's a they
look<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.880> cool<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.600> should<00:01:49.289> turn<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> around

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
look really cool I should turn it around

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
look really cool I should turn it around
like<00:01:50.069> that<00:01:50.630> she's<00:01:51.630> stayed<00:01:52.289> really<00:01:53.280> cool<00:01:54.229> it's

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
like that she's stayed really cool it's

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.839 
like that she's stayed really cool it's
been<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.590> awesome<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.280> basically<00:01:56.610> that's

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
been really awesome so basically that's

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:01.039 
been really awesome so basically that's
that<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:58.759> just<00:01:59.759> these<00:02:00.000> cards<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.569> look<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:00.959> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
that and just these cards so look at the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.370 
that and just these cards so look at the
size<00:02:01.349> looks<00:02:01.709> like<00:02:01.920> they're<00:02:02.099> almost<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.640> black

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
size looks like they're almost a black

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.069 
size looks like they're almost a black
but<00:02:05.149> they<00:02:06.149> are<00:02:06.390> grey

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
but they are grey

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.430 
but they are grey
they're<00:02:07.649> definitely<00:02:07.860> great<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.170> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
they're definitely great so like that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.710 
they're definitely great so like that
looks<00:02:10.799> people<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.239> step<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:13.010> very

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
looks people so this step is very

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.780 
looks people so this step is very
bendable<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:16.680> I'm<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.040> doing<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.459> we're

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
bendable like I'm just doing this we're

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.130 
bendable like I'm just doing this we're
not<00:02:18.030> not<00:02:18.450> even<00:02:18.480> really<00:02:18.900> trying<00:02:20.959> so<00:02:21.959> this

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
not not even really trying so this

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.309 
not not even really trying so this
spring<00:02:23.150> tremendously<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.390> course<00:02:24.750> since<00:02:25.049> if<00:02:25.170> I

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
spring tremendously of course since if I

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.710 
spring tremendously of course since if I
scored<00:02:25.799> I<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.129> did<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.209> deck<00:02:27.420> goes

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
scored I just did that and the deck goes

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.309 
scored I just did that and the deck goes
evenly<00:02:28.440> again<00:02:28.799> back<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.310> its<00:02:29.489> normal<00:02:29.700> place<00:02:30.319> so

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
evenly again back to its normal place so

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.229 
evenly again back to its normal place so
some<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:31.950> cool<00:02:32.370> cards<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:32.970> get<00:02:33.120> with

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
some of the cool cards that you get with

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.090 
some of the cool cards that you get with
this<00:02:33.359> these<00:02:33.660> are<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> aces<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:36.950> thief<00:02:37.950> of
