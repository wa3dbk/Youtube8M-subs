-<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:13.380> using<00:02:13.590> products<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.280> has<00:02:14.400> some

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
- you're using products that has some

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.400 
- you're using products that has some
type<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.880> silicones<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:15.600> polymers<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.290> a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
type of silicones or polymers and it's a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.890 
type of silicones or polymers and it's a
blackout<00:02:16.920> moisture<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.270> last<00:02:18.600> tip

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
blackout moisture and then my last tip

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140 
blackout moisture and then my last tip
is<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.590> probably<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> good<00:02:20.340> idea<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.880> you

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
is that it's probably a good idea if you

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.900 
is that it's probably a good idea if you
opt<00:02:21.600> for<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> straight<00:02:22.590> type<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:23.040> weave<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.820> you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
opt for a straight type of weave so you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.390 
opt for a straight type of weave so you
can<00:02:24.150> do<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.450> by<00:02:24.690> doing<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:25.380> partial<00:02:25.950> sewin

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
can do this by doing a partial sewin

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.030 
can do this by doing a partial sewin
or<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.330> create<00:02:27.600> your<00:02:27.690> own<00:02:27.780> u-part<00:02:28.560> wig<00:02:28.590> so

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
or you can create your own u-part wig so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
or you can create your own u-part wig so
that<00:02:29.190> way<00:02:29.370> you're<00:02:29.580> only<00:02:29.940> straightening<00:02:30.480> a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
that way you're only straightening a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.720 
that way you're only straightening a
small<00:02:31.020> amount<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.440> leave<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.400> smaller

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
small amount of leave out the smaller

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.430 
small amount of leave out the smaller
amount<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.210> leave<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.080> control

when<00:02:34.650> straightening<00:02:35.040> your<00:02:35.130> hair<00:02:35.190> will<00:02:35.790> also
