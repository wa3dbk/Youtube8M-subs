00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 an avalanche swept away this morning a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.250
 livigno three hikers on the mountain 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.719
 of the snow towards the area the idea 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.330
 fortunately everyone is safe and none 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.370
 serious consequence for those involved 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.340
 we interviewed luca silvestri 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.180
 eyewitness to what happened 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.039
 around half past eleven this morning 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.090
 i was i was at home i quiet 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.960
 heard of the verses above on the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.899
 boat of the place and saw three 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.140
 skiers who were all coming down and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.989
 three together we say that it is not really 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.360
 right and the avalanche that was there has come off 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.640
 has swept them overwhelmed all 32 ho 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.100
 since they immediately managed to get out 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.770
 one instead was overwhelmed by the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629
 Avalanche 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.710
 everything was born well then I saw that I am 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.180
 dropped 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.649
 I called the help arrived 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.710
 the helicopter tries meanwhile have them 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.100
 also seen getting off who managed to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.890
 go out alone in autonomy and hyper 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.890
 reached and you talked to us after I got them 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.470
 seen because I wanted curiosity I wanted 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 understand who they were and how they were equipped 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.570
 I saw they had shovel and probe 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.479
 they were probably equipped 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.979
 they just got it all wrong 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.650
 together when you should 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 go down one at a time while staying in one 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.619
 safe zone 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.640
 looking at the companions while they are not descending 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.670
 they knew the area not because they were here 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.290
 I'm skiing for the day and then tonight 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.560
 probably back home or foreigners 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.979
 they were translated Swiss visas 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.290
 German we asked instead to the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.880
 matteo galli helicopter rescue technician 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.979
 what are the conditions of the mantle 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 snowy of Livigno and also some 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.020
 tips for those wishing to practice 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.229
 off-piste in the coming days and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.500
 conditions and level of danger though 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.270
 they are rather quite high 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.730
 dangerous enough to wait 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.200
 some days that the snow settles and 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.930
 in fact we have seen around 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
 several avalanches also spontaneous of 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.980
 consequently we must perhaps be patient 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.590
 little bit and and remain extremely 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.849
 prudent in these days also posting 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.069
 which was even late 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.800
 morning for three Swiss hikers 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.620
 fortunately they remained involved 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.090
 without consequences silipo there are some 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.510
 direct testimonials they have 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.090
 witnessed the scene and here is perhaps a 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.099
 mistake that is good not to do is what 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.530
 when one senses that one moves on one 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.290
 land that presents dangers 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.849
 take the necessary precautions in the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.010
 specific case would have been 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.019
 simply to move into 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.910
 security one by one from one point 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.280
 sure to another safe point while 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.810
 these were skiing 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.580
 simultaneously on the same slope e 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.690
 consequently it becomes easy to trigger 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.640
 the avalanches 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.540
 the advice the advice is to 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.610
 realize that when the conditions 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.070
 they are as dangerous as these days 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.890
 one must have patience to move 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.630
 clearly and equipped with all 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.830
 taking all the procedures of 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.200
 necessary security 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.090
 but to get in his head that you can't 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.530
 always go wherever there are 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.540
 days where you can only go up 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.300
 slopes less steep a little simpler and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.800
 however safer and on the bulletin le 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.800
 directions are there
