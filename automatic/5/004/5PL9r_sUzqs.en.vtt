allow<00:02:45.110> us<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.290> pick<00:02:45.590> up<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.799> back<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.129> the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
allow us to pick up the back of the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.869 
allow us to pick up the back of the
control<00:02:47.390> panel<00:02:48.040> lift<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.190> up<00:02:49.280> out<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.640> door

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
control panel lift it up out of the door

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.300 
control panel lift it up out of the door
and<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:51.319> will<00:02:51.470> give<00:02:51.590> us<00:02:51.620> access<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.129> the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
and this will give us access to the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.920 
and this will give us access to the
connectors<00:02:52.849> these<00:02:53.060> connectors<00:02:53.569> all<00:02:53.720> have

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
connectors these connectors all have

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.539 
connectors these connectors all have
triggers<00:02:54.349> on<00:02:54.530> them<00:02:54.680> at<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.890> front<00:02:55.129> does<00:02:55.370> this

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
triggers on them at the front does this

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.589 
triggers on them at the front does this
little<00:02:55.849> trigger<00:02:56.060> I'm<00:02:56.209> going<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.390> push<00:02:56.569> down

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
little trigger I'm going to push down

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.809 
little trigger I'm going to push down
and<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.950> releases<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.549> lock<00:02:58.700> on<00:02:59.000> it<00:03:00.489> same<00:03:01.489> for

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
and it releases the lock on it same for

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.949 
and it releases the lock on it same for
this<00:03:02.109> front<00:03:03.109> connector<00:03:03.709> as<00:03:03.859> well

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
this front connector as well

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.949 
this front connector as well
this<00:03:05.959> one<00:03:06.109> has<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:07.000> trigger<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.359> side<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.660> it

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
this one has a trigger on the side of it

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.080 
this one has a trigger on the side of it
that<00:03:09.109> we're<00:03:09.200> going<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.380> push<00:03:09.620> in<00:03:09.829> and<00:03:10.090> wiggle

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that we're going to push in and wiggle

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.290 
that we're going to push in and wiggle
this<00:03:11.180> connector<00:03:11.720> loose

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:52.860 

and<00:03:17.630> this<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.960> little<00:03:18.230> bit<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.500> tough<00:03:18.740> one

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.060 

here<00:03:53.870> we<00:03:54.020> go<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:56.780> connector<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.410> sleeve<00:03:57.800> on

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
here we go the connector is a sleeve on

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.860 
here we go the connector is a sleeve on
and<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.340> gets<00:03:58.550> pushed<00:03:58.850> into<00:03:59.090> spot<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.780> then

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
and it gets pushed into spot and then

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.690 
and it gets pushed into spot and then
the<00:03:59.990> sleeve<00:04:00.290> around<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.830> will<00:04:00.980> push<00:04:01.190> back<00:04:01.400> in

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
the sleeve around it will push back in

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.110 
the sleeve around it will push back in
and<00:04:01.910> mock<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.270> connector<00:04:02.720> into<00:04:02.930> place<00:04:04.120> pushes

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
and mock the connector into place pushes

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.730 
and mock the connector into place pushes
back<00:04:05.330> into<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.750> door<00:04:05.960> so<00:04:06.170> they're<00:04:06.320> not<00:04:06.440> in<00:04:06.620> her

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
back into the door so they're not in her

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.520 
back into the door so they're not in her
way<00:04:07.600> now<00:04:08.600> with<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.810> control<00:04:09.200> panel<00:04:09.560> removed

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
way now with the control panel removed

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.780 
way now with the control panel removed
this<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:12.860> get<00:04:12.980> access<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.370> one<00:04:13.580> more

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
this is going to get access to one more

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.780 
this is going to get access to one more
screw<00:04:14.090> back<00:04:14.330> here<00:04:15.519> that<00:04:16.519> would<00:04:16.670> better

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
screw back here that would better

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.069 
screw back here that would better
include<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.329> is<00:04:17.510> probably<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.930> largest

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
include this is probably the largest

00:04:18.079 --> 00:05:12.450 
include this is probably the largest
