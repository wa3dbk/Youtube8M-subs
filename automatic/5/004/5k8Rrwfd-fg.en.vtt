00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.390
 only in the north welcome her getting up Robert m 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.410
 lately i have called to ask her questions 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.800
 about poker what we would like to know 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.129
 but also get some trends 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.769
 Unabashed admonished boss for the reason though the shirt ranking 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.259
 »More Texas Holdem Poker» 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.979
 this video only refers to kaká final round poker when ranking 

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:30.619
 other variants and jan-hendrik links we can then on occasion 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.030
 Miami 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.330
 Let's start ahead 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.399
 Stoner and that he who had order 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.950
 the RKH sounds 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.180
 catches 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.350
 at the Zwoten 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.670
 goes elsewhere 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Deubel Ladies King 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.870
 it is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.610
 the cheapest card 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.690
 but also can 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 be the smallest squad 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.980
 in the case of a road wants to come to when I go swimming 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 the colors play in the ranking 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.510
 It does not matter if that's what's going on, Cairo 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.190
 It's quite important to play greuls or hearts on other cards 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.610
 at Texas Holdem Poker, "this is embarrassing 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.260
 Well then we are already ranking 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.220
 the hands 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.740
 So at Texas Holdem Poker it is 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.460
 that you get 2 cards on hand then there is still community skating 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.710
 and Neuhaus in the community garden our own two cards 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.070
 you form the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.070
 best appointed by Scart 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.289
 and the best hand 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.289
 wins in the pot 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.659
 then we go to the banking as I said 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.100
 let's start if no one has something 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.400
 c the highest card 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.620
 Emstek had 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.450
 ideally that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.370
 Because every other card beats out because of Dr's value here 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.670
 lower is clear 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.170
 you're lucky and get a few on hand 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.780
 then you hit with a cash register 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.860
 every other couple 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.589
 Euro with other couples they then turn 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.589
 different from, for example, one has a few days on hand the lawyer of the bank 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:13.590
 austria 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.260
 had the effects on the day and so on and so on in the beginning 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
 compliance with the value of the cards 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.319
 a few worth struck from the left lead 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.280
 that is the post here in the picture example we have the couple two and one 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.769
 the few bows 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.549
 a 6 here 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:32.699
 should 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.859
 in one case coincidental 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.409
 the enemy 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.529
 but a few two numbers have bent abroad as 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.270
 fifth card 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.089
 for example, a king 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:46.220
 he wins the pot because he has the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.059
 while keycard 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.539
 the same parts are also available 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:54.299
 and then decides then the leftover card in this case I have 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.560
 have the 6th here 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.369
 beaten by everything above it 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.549
 as far as Klaus k 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.749
 next in the Handling King is to have Dr the rain here in the picture example 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:06.869
 we three ladies 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.139
 with 2 6 and 8 of the choice 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.169
 Euro three ladies are beaten only by three kings 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.599
 or the first 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.079
 everything under it like for example three boys and so on 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.739
 you then defeated with 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.829
 next in hand order in Henschel Ranking 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.069
 then is the street 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.010
 here in the picture example we have a street from 6 to 10 every six 7 8 19 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.340
 Roads are always formed with five tickets in 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.190
 The colors of the cards play an order here as in the picture 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.970
 example 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.919
 no matter 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.719
 that in turn is beaten forward 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.019
 a meat 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.750
 here we have kick today 12 with a 7 of a lady of a 3 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.839
 RN TI and one 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.799
 Of course, it would be ideal if one acts as an example instead of now 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.579
 Buchholz had and then you always have 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.149
 the highest fell 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:06.629
 because that can happen that two people love the same bottle 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.029
 Groitzsch plays as mentioned here 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.639
 but another has to give, for example 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.639
 also 5 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.269
 Grunz card with the passport 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.269
 then win 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.520
 next episode is then that full off 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.840
 that wrote again 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.120
 sued for example 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.530
 The example shows the older and 1000 inhabitants 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.779
 a passive country 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.800
 should someone else have a full house with, for example, a queen? 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.279
 and Jackson 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.560
 wins this 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.360
 the hand 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.759
 because the three of a kind 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.889
 is really 1 par 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.889
 And in any case, who decides who gets higher 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.930
 the whole turn as a foul is beaten off by 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:57.469
 a LAN 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.039
 Characters do not nonsense from a par 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.740
 but of a quad 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.740
 In this picture example we have a lot in bed rings 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.879
 should someone 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.520
 coincidentally have four boys 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.139
 One has lost the hand of Strutz to one though one 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.629
 a vacation stay that 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.819
 pity but sometimes happens something happens rarely but it happens 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.490
 that is a so-called 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.110
 arouses 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.330
 Vocabulary So Tempo Gelatinous Income Go The Mermaids Some Videos Go There 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.780
 We speak English all the time through a lot of English and also 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.419
 the whole terminology comes from there you have to operate safely 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.270
 want 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.639
 Euro we had beaten the four rings in turn with one of them 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.159
 Great bottle 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.419
 Euro 2x 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.680
 highest bottle you can have it ends up having example 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.160
 to learn to play the so-called mediaset process 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.180
 because he goes from Torres over 32 4 to 5 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.919
 just this Strate meat has recently been posted on Twitter 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.090
 I won a victory Euro who kneeled in a Chinese knee and shake hands 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.169
 then also won Bern Euro 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.490
 12 Porsche is already 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.020
 unbeatable 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.509
 is not just beaten by a single hand that is 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.279
 The so-called Green is that he is now up to 8 of the courier Flattach 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.030
 goes from 10 over Jack 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.029
 thanks to "King Pelé" and gas 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.779
 That's the thing that has to do 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.689
 "Texas Holdem Poker has been 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:37.389
 I hope so that Gardena worried if so, but also manoeuvrable 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.590
 do not get out of sight 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.719
 and hope that he will Nixon - what comes because she wanted to know 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.110
 if Walsum percent gives it what you want to know write in one 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.110
 Comment on the channel or under this video 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.460
 until then and not 9 for the cost
