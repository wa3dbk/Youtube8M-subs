software you want to do and click paste

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.370 
software you want to do and click paste
and<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.909> if<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.259> know

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and there it is if you want to you know

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
and there it is if you want to you know
do<00:01:16.530> different<00:01:16.680> software<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.729> GIMP<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
do different software I have GIMP and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.289 
do different software I have GIMP and
the<00:01:19.259> same<00:01:19.500> thing<00:01:19.890> applies<00:01:21.770> edit<00:01:22.939> paste<00:01:23.939> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the same thing applies edit paste and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.249 
the same thing applies edit paste and
there<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.960> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
there it is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.340 
there it is
so<00:01:25.830> mostly<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.460> button<00:01:27.080> what<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> does

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so mostly all that button what it does

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
so mostly all that button what it does
is<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:30.060> takes<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> snapshot<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:31.020> your

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
is it it takes a snapshot of your

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
is it it takes a snapshot of your
computer<00:01:31.650> screen<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.340> almost<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
computer screen but it's almost like it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.109 
computer screen but it's almost like it
copies<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> paste<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.220> so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
copies it and you have to paste it so

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.520 
copies it and you have to paste it so
that's<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.420> easier<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.079> about<00:01:37.290> it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that's a easier way to think about it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.039 
that's a easier way to think about it
and<00:01:37.700> if<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.909> does<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.299> work<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.780> just

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and if that does not work for you just

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.330 
and if that does not work for you just
clicking<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.790> insert<00:01:41.790> print<00:01:42.540> screen<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.130> can

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
clicking the insert print screen you can

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.260 
clicking the insert print screen you can
click<00:01:45.259> ctrl<00:01:46.259> F<00:01:46.560> N<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> insert<00:01:47.970> print

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
click ctrl F N and then the insert print

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.450 
click ctrl F N and then the insert print
screen<00:01:48.600> or<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.350> FN<00:01:50.250> insert<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.950> insert

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
screen or just FN insert or just insert

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.510 
screen or just FN insert or just insert
by<00:01:53.670> itself<00:01:54.170> there's<00:01:55.170> those<00:01:55.500> three<00:01:55.860> ways<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> do

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
by itself there's those three ways to do

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
by itself there's those three ways to do
it<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.850> should<00:01:57.180> try<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.600> three<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.770> of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it you should try all three and one of

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
it you should try all three and one of
them<00:01:58.950> should<00:01:59.159> work<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.450> doesn't

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
them should work for you if it doesn't

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.469 
them should work for you if it doesn't
then<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.140> computer<00:02:01.619> probably<00:02:01.920> can't<00:02:02.450> take<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
then your computer probably can't take a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.560 
then your computer probably can't take a
snapshot<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.049> your<00:02:04.170> screen<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.759> they're<00:02:06.390> most

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
snapshot of your screen but they're most

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.889 
snapshot of your screen but they're most
likely<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> different<00:02:07.320> way<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.899> yeah

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
likely it's a different way so yeah

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930 
likely it's a different way so yeah
that's<00:02:10.229> pretty<00:02:10.440> simple<00:02:10.920> how<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.730> if

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that's pretty simple how to do that if

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.850 
that's pretty simple how to do that if
you<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.420> any<00:02:12.599> questions

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you have any questions

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.340
