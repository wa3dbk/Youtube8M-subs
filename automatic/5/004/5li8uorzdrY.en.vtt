00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.800 
a group right here of day lilies these
are<00:00:23.619> Stella<00:00:24.010> Doros<00:00:24.490> they've<00:00:25.150> all<00:00:25.359> finished

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.810 
are Stella Doros they've all finished
blooming<00:00:26.260> but<00:00:26.740> they<00:00:26.859> should<00:00:27.189> continue<00:00:27.460> to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
blooming but they should continue to

bloom<00:00:28.150> right<00:00:28.689> now<00:00:28.750> what<00:00:29.080> they're<00:00:29.199> doing<00:00:29.470> is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
bloom right now what they're doing is

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.929 
bloom right now what they're doing is
they're<00:00:29.710> spending<00:00:29.980> all<00:00:30.160> their<00:00:30.369> energy<00:00:30.730> making

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
they're spending all their energy making

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.460 
they're spending all their energy making
seeds<00:00:31.420> and<00:00:31.689> we<00:00:31.750> don't<00:00:31.900> want<00:00:32.019> them<00:00:32.169> to<00:00:32.290> do<00:00:32.439> that

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
seeds and we don't want them to do that

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.100 
seeds and we don't want them to do that
so<00:00:33.160> if<00:00:33.220> you<00:00:33.340> look<00:00:33.519> down<00:00:33.550> here<00:00:33.940> close<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.930> can

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
so if you look down here close you can

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.340 
so if you look down here close you can
see<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.559> seed<00:00:35.800> pod<00:00:36.100> they're<00:00:36.850> big<00:00:37.329> hard<00:00:37.960> sort

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
see the seed pod they're big hard sort

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.549 
see the seed pod they're big hard sort
of<00:00:38.440> chartreuse<00:00:38.950> green<00:00:39.010> pods<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:41.140> what's

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
of chartreuse green pods and what's

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.440 
of chartreuse green pods and what's
going<00:00:41.770> to<00:00:41.860> happen<00:00:42.309> is<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.579> they<00:00:43.120> are

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
going to happen is that they are

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.720 
going to happen is that they are
beginning<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.500> ripen<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.250> can<00:00:45.399> see<00:00:45.550> this

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
beginning to ripen and you can see this

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.660 
beginning to ripen and you can see this
one<00:00:45.969> has<00:00:46.090> popped<00:00:46.450> and<00:00:46.899> if<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.649> peel<00:00:47.980> this<00:00:48.160> open

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
one has popped and if I peel this open

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.119 
one has popped and if I peel this open
you<00:00:49.329> can<00:00:49.480> see<00:00:49.690> black<00:00:49.989> seeds<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.800> these<00:00:50.920> are

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
you can see black seeds and these are

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.639 
you can see black seeds and these are
the<00:00:51.250> seeds<00:00:51.489> that<00:00:51.789> the<00:00:52.239> plant<00:00:52.480> has<00:00:52.570> produced<00:00:53.050> we

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
the seeds that the plant has produced we

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.930 
the seeds that the plant has produced we
don't<00:00:53.829> want<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.070> to<00:00:54.160> do<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.489> we<00:00:54.640> don't<00:00:54.730> want

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
don't want it to do that we don't want

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.760 
don't want it to do that we don't want
it<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.120> spend<00:00:55.360> its<00:00:55.510> energy<00:00:55.870> doing<00:00:56.020> that<00:00:56.260> we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
it to spend its energy doing that we

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.170 
it to spend its energy doing that we
want<00:00:56.890> it<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.129> spend<00:00:57.370> its<00:00:57.520> energy<00:00:57.850> making

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
want it to spend its energy making

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.660 
want it to spend its energy making
flowers<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.289> what<00:00:59.680> I'm<00:00:59.829> going<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.160> do<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.520> can

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
flowers so what I'm going to do you can

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.340 
flowers so what I'm going to do you can
use<00:01:00.699> a<00:01:00.820> pair<00:01:01.120> of<00:01:01.149> pruning<00:01:01.449> shears<00:01:01.809> or<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.109> pair

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
use a pair of pruning shears or a pair

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.979 
use a pair of pruning shears or a pair
of<00:01:02.379> perennial<00:01:02.859> scissors<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.780> pruning

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
of perennial scissors I like the pruning

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.200 
of perennial scissors I like the pruning
shears<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.860> we're<00:01:06.070> going<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.340> take<00:01:06.549> this<00:01:06.729> seed

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
shears and we're going to take this seed

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.990 
shears and we're going to take this seed
pod<00:01:07.540> stock<00:01:08.049> and<00:01:08.439> we're<00:01:09.040> going<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.400> follow<00:01:09.729> it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
pod stock and we're going to follow it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.920 
pod stock and we're going to follow it
down<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.920> base<00:01:12.189> of<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.520> plant<00:01:12.930> right

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
down into the base of the plant right

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.080 
down into the base of the plant right
down<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.409> here<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:15.070> we're<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.610> clip<00:01:15.970> it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
down in here and we're going to clip it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.870 
down in here and we're going to clip it
off<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.659> so<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.290> what<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.500> have<00:01:17.650> is<00:01:18.130> an<00:01:18.640> old

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
off and so that what you have is an old

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.149 
off and so that what you have is an old
flower<00:01:19.210> stem<00:01:19.689> with<00:01:19.900> seed<00:01:20.140> pods<00:01:20.409> on<00:01:20.680> top<00:01:20.950> and

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
flower stem with seed pods on top and

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.530 
flower stem with seed pods on top and
this<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.369> what<00:01:21.670> you're<00:01:21.850> going<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.090> throw<00:01:22.450> away

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
this is what you're going to throw away

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.539 
this is what you're going to throw away
the<00:01:23.229> other<00:01:23.380> piece<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.890> you're<00:01:24.070> going<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.430> do

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
the other piece that you're going to do

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.399 
the other piece that you're going to do
is<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.790> will<00:01:24.909> notice<00:01:25.150> that<00:01:25.780> in<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:25.990> base<00:01:26.200> of

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
is you will notice that in the base of

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.560 
is you will notice that in the base of
the<00:01:26.470> plant<00:01:26.770> there<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.400> lot<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.700> old<00:01:28.150> brown

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
the plant there is a lot of old brown

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.480 
the plant there is a lot of old brown
foliage<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.710> we're<00:01:29.830> going<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:29.979> clean<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.430> up

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
foliage and we're going to clean that up

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.340 
foliage and we're going to clean that up
too<00:01:30.880> then<00:01:31.299> we're<00:01:31.540> all<00:01:31.630> done<00:01:31.900> this<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.079> going<00:01:32.290> to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
too then we're all done this is going to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.539 
too then we're all done this is going to
look<00:01:32.439> a<00:01:32.530> whole<00:01:32.710> lot<00:01:32.890> better<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.280> I'm<00:01:33.369> going<00:01:33.490> to

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
look a whole lot better so I'm going to

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.340 
look a whole lot better so I'm going to
do<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.790> first<00:01:34.090> plant<00:01:34.420> here<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:34.900> show<00:01:35.290> you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
do this first plant here and show you

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.080 
do this first plant here and show you
what<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.650> looks<00:01:35.829> like<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.220> compare

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.420 

so<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.300> can<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.659> I've<00:01:42.930> done<00:01:43.260> these<00:01:44.070> two

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
so now you can see I've done these two

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
so now you can see I've done these two
of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.270> group<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.659> three<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.290> see

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
of the group of three and you can see

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
of the group of three and you can see
the<00:01:46.680> difference<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> seed<00:01:48.270> pods<00:01:48.540> are

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the difference so all the seed pods are

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.860 
the difference so all the seed pods are
gone<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.260> all<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.160> brown<00:01:50.490> yucky<00:01:51.060> foliage<00:01:51.600> is
