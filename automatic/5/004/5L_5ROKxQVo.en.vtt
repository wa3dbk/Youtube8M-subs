for more five more excuse me finding out

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.859 
for more five more excuse me finding out
that<00:00:29.460> classic<00:00:30.150> pilot<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.449> going<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.779> there

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
that classic pilot is going up but there

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.900 
that classic pilot is going up but there
is<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> backup<00:00:31.470> piling<00:00:31.769> behind<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.279> yeah<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.790> we

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
is a backup piling behind it yeah so we

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.400 
is a backup piling behind it yeah so we
will<00:00:33.059> see<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.329> form<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.079> gate<00:00:34.230> pressure

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
will see some form of for gate pressure

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.069 
will see some form of for gate pressure
here<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> believe<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.719> that

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
here I believe and with the that's that

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.139 
here I believe and with the that's that
this<00:00:37.800> most<00:00:38.100> forward<00:00:38.489> pile<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.820> i<00:00:38.850> think<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
this most forward pile on i think is

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
this most forward pile on i think is
going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.360> allowed<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.780> complete<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
going to be allowed to complete and that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
going to be allowed to complete and that
is<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.340> dangerous<00:00:41.670> by<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.450> 7<00:00:42.870> roaches

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is a very dangerous by little 7 roaches

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
is a very dangerous by little 7 roaches
but<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.829> accidental<00:00:44.460> mavin<00:00:44.969> dark<00:00:45.239> shine<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
but not accidental mavin dark shine is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.000 
but not accidental mavin dark shine is
