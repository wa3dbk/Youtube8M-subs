00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello how about very good guys 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.250
 Welcome to this new gameplay of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.080
 game lego pirates of the caribbean and we are 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.049
 with a new chapter of the guide 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.910
 red lego hats worth guys for 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.130
 this unlocking we have to come by 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.150
 here and down the zip line this one 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.090
 and to see where we're going, well, let's go 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.730
 come here 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.740
 exactly where the blocks are 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.040
 and of course these who are buried 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.720
 between the sand exactly there we go to 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.000
 get our red hat eco 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:44.100
 but these are attacking us too 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.100
 so let's get rid of some 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.800
 I will do very well we will change 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.800
 to go up here 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.020
 and very well 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.760
 jump from a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.760
 push button to another 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.670
 and in that way it would not look like the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.140
 red ego hat but you have to 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.620
 do it without falling exactly like that 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 there is very good there is perfect very 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.860
 all right 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.930
 okay guys here is our hat 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.300
 of lego red that is the treasure x2 for 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.260
 guys so we bought it for 500 thousand 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.640
 coins or pieces of lego 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:40.400
 it very well and we will let activate 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.160
 to the extras menu and activate the treasure x2 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.500
 we already have the treasure x 6 and the treasure x2 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.200
 activated and what it does then is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.660
 multiply our treasure by 2 and to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.170
 have activated the treasure x 6 well what 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.260
 multiply by 6 also then 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.850
 we would have a total of 1 x 12 or 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.490
 all the coins we get is 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.560
 they will multiply by 12 for boys 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.450
