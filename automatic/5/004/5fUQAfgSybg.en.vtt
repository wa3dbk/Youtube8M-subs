offline<00:00:47.370> maps<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:49.350> difference<00:00:49.649> between<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
offline maps the difference between the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.010 
offline maps the difference between the
offline<00:00:50.280> maps<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:51.500> Nokia's<00:00:52.500> version<00:00:52.890> ear

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.420 
offline maps on Nokia's version ear
mapping<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.039> download<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
mapping is that you can download the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
mapping is that you can download the
whole<00:00:56.610> country<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.270> available<00:00:57.360> offline

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
whole country and it's available offline

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.170 
whole country and it's available offline
so<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> works<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:58.680> much<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.160> tomtom<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.059> any

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so it works pretty much as tomtom or any

you<00:03:33.600> basically<00:03:33.959> use<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.470> arrow<00:03:34.709> at<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.920> top

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
you basically use this arrow at the top

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.820 
you basically use this arrow at the top
you<00:03:36.330> can<00:03:36.480> pick<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.840> same<00:03:37.020> as<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.440> do<00:03:37.680> on

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
you can pick the same as you can do on

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.229 
you can pick the same as you can do on
the<00:03:37.920> Nokia<00:03:38.250> Maps<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.550> you've<00:03:38.670> got<00:03:38.700> driving

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the Nokia Maps so you've got driving

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.229 
the Nokia Maps so you've got driving
public<00:03:39.450> transport<00:03:39.989> walking<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.670> go<00:03:42.000> down

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
public transport walking you can go down

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.330 
public transport walking you can go down
recent<00:03:42.810> history<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.950> can<00:03:44.070> look<00:03:44.160> for

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
recent history so you can look for

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.430 
recent history so you can look for
locations<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.970> same<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.330> there<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.350> can

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
locations the same on there so we can

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.800 
locations the same on there so we can
pick<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.650> destination<00:03:46.860> on<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.640> recent<00:03:48.300> history

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
pick a destination on the recent history

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.830 
pick a destination on the recent history
so<00:03:49.080> we<00:03:49.170> can<00:03:49.260> go<00:03:49.350> on<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.769> one<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.690> can

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
so we can go on to that one and you can

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.390 
so we can go on to that one and you can
see<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:52.519> find<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:54.170> Nokia<00:03:55.170> Maps<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.709> little<00:03:56.280> bit

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
see I find the Nokia Maps a little bit

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.240 
see I find the Nokia Maps a little bit
quicker<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:57.120> get<00:03:57.630> things<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:58.230> they<00:03:58.920> both<00:03:59.100> do

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
quicker to get things going they both do

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.040 
quicker to get things going they both do
the<00:03:59.280> same<00:03:59.400> thing<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.910> do<00:03:59.970> like<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.510> interface

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
the same thing I do like the interface

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.990 
the same thing I do like the interface
on<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.320> Nokia<00:04:01.890> Maps<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.190> must<00:04:02.370> admit<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:02.670> it's

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
on the Nokia Maps I must admit that it's

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.259 
on the Nokia Maps I must admit that it's
a<00:04:03.060> lot<00:04:03.239> cleaner<00:04:03.420> crisper<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:08.910> can<00:04:09.090> see

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
a lot cleaner crisper so you can see

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.050 
a lot cleaner crisper so you can see
that<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.989> interface<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.190> still<00:04:11.640> simple<00:04:11.970> on

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
that the interface is still simple on

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.819 
that the interface is still simple on
google<00:04:12.360> maps<00:04:12.570> what<00:04:13.050> I<00:04:13.080> like<00:04:13.320> about<00:04:13.350> Google

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
google maps what I like about Google

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.500 
google maps what I like about Google
Maps<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.160> it's<00:04:14.340> more<00:04:14.549> integrated<00:04:15.209> into<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
Maps is it's more integrated into the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.689 
Maps is it's more integrated into the
system

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
so when you're actually in google maps

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.390 
so when you're actually in google maps
or<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.109> get<00:04:19.230> google<00:04:19.380> now<00:04:19.680> or<00:04:19.889> someone<00:04:20.160> sends

and<00:05:16.590> cons<00:05:16.770> like<00:05:16.949> it<00:05:17.130> said<00:05:17.400> if<00:05:17.610> you're<00:05:18.270> going<00:05:18.419> to

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
and cons like it said if you're going to

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.260 
and cons like it said if you're going to
go<00:05:18.600> into<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.960> Samsung<00:05:19.440> store<00:05:20.270> basically

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
go into the Samsung store basically

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.409 
go into the Samsung store basically
going<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:21.660> galaxy<00:05:22.110> apps<00:05:22.550> I<00:05:23.550> believe<00:05:24.150> it's<00:05:24.300> not

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
going to galaxy apps I believe it's not

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.450 
going to galaxy apps I believe it's not
available<00:05:24.870> for<00:05:25.139> all<00:05:25.260> applications<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:26.400> you

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
available for all applications so you

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.790 
available for all applications so you
need<00:05:26.700> to<00:05:26.789> basically<00:05:27.389> go<00:05:27.840> into<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.139> search<00:05:28.470> mode

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
need to basically go into a search mode

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.590 
need to basically go into a search mode
and<00:05:29.160> you<00:05:29.580> can<00:05:29.729> see<00:05:29.850> at<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.000> top<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.330> searched

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
and you can see at the top I searched

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.050 
and you can see at the top I searched
for<00:05:30.630> here<00:05:30.990> beta<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.669> can<00:05:32.820> see<00:05:32.970> it's

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
clear concise mapping well worth giving

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.969 
clear concise mapping well worth giving
