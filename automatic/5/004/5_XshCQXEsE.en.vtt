00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:22.236
 On sunny Sunday in May 2010, 

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:25.241
 I was running in the forest next to my house, 

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.659
 Where the sun shone its rays on green foliage 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.736
 It is painted on the ground. 

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:35.759
 Bali was busy with plans, I was happy and excited. 

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:40.778
 I had decided to realize my dreams and quit my job 

00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:43.246
 To become independent. 

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:45.066
 I was passionate about work, 

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:49.258
 But I wanted more time for my other interests, including jogging. 

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:53.249
 I participated in the two races of the enemy race and I was training for the Berlin race for the enemy. 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.244
 Later this year. 

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:57.053
 I love running. 

00:00:57.053 --> 00:01:01.735
 When I run I feel that my body is doing what it is designed to do. 

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:07.088
 The physical, emotional and mental aspects are homogeneous. 

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:09.500
 When I am stressed, I feel better. 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.767
 When I face a problem or seek inspiration and inspiration 

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.260
 I find solutions. 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.038
 Jogging always gives me energy and strength. 

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:27.249
 The last day of that month was to be the last day of my past life, 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.040
 It was, for some curious coincidence, 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.241
 The day I was told I had cancer. 

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:40.243
 I was shocked, it was not logical, 

00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:43.260
 The only comfort I found was jogging, 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.501
 Then I feel for a few minutes calm and control my thoughts. 

00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:51.270
 I did not imagine how I would order the coming months from this, 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.220
 So I decided to run whatever the circumstances. 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.767
 Chemotherapy was hell, a bit like sugar, 

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:04.514
 Which does not go without end. 

00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:09.494
 I woke up every morning with a bad feeling I really wish I did not own it. 

00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:11.765
 I feel nausea, bad taste in my mouth, 

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:16.247
 The food was very disgusting I forced myself to eat it. 

00:02:16.247 --> 00:02:21.240
 Burning, constipation, infections, pain and fatigue, 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.756
 Forgetfulness and confusion 

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:28.251
 I was putting my way home when I was discharged from the hospital despite my many visits, 

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:29.771
 But I kept running, 

00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:34.749
 I forced myself to get up from the knees and not get out of the house. 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:39.013
 The first steps were always gruesome, everything hurts me, I barely breathed 

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.995
 But the Androfen takes effect, and it has always been, and for the better! 

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:46.773
 My body was doing what it was designed to do, 

00:02:46.773 --> 00:02:50.511
 I was moving, I feel life! 

00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:53.500
 For days before birth, I finished treatment 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.500
 I got news that cancer is still. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.902
 This was to be wonderful, right? Of course, 

00:02:59.902 --> 00:03:03.255
 But I was physically and psychologically devastated. 

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:05.766
 But I have realized the power that jogging gives me 

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.927
 So I decided to run 

00:03:07.927 --> 00:03:10.088
 In the Berlin race for the enemy in the next few months. 

00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:12.250
 Full madness. 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.505
 And I was betting that I would hesitate in my decision for a million times in the coming months, 

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:19.505
 But I was training myself again. 

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:21.515
 It was a torment at the beginning 

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:24.744
 But I was able to run quickly for long distances gradually 

00:03:24.744 --> 00:03:29.232
 As my legs were increasing Guo began the magic of jogging. 

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:31.744
 I began to trust in myself again, 

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:37.024
 I saw myself as a powerful person and not as a cancer patient. 

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:39.761
 After nine months of cancer treatment, 

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.748
 You have crossed the final line of the Berlin race to the enemy. 

00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:48.056
 After a year of restoring my life, I live my dream, 

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:51.033
 I believe I'm still running. 

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:53.263
 While cancer does not respond to treatment 

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:56.887
 I could not restore my entire strength yet. 

00:03:56.887 --> 00:03:58.703
 My message is not about cancer 

00:03:58.703 --> 00:04:01.239
 It is not specifically about jogging too. 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.057
 No matter how we move our bodies, the important thing is to move them. 

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:07.859
 Not only for our physical fitness 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.502
 But to keep our minds and emotions strong and healthy as well. 

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.960
 What I learned is that whatever you measure life, 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.762
 No matter how complex it is for you, 

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:24.226
 Physical fitness is absolutely indispensable for public health. 

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:28.535
 As Winston Churchill once said, "If you're going through hell, 

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.251
 And this is what you did, as well as you can do. (Laughter) 

00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:32.249
 Thanks. 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:38.249
 (clap)
