00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
kind of profound thought or an ideal a

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.270 
kind of profound thought or an ideal a
lot<00:06:34.730> of<00:06:34.880> times<00:06:35.090> I<00:06:35.270> look<00:06:35.480> at<00:06:35.600> the<00:06:35.720> clock<00:06:35.990> and<00:06:36.320> if

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
lot of times I look at the clock and if

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.490 
lot of times I look at the clock and if
the<00:06:37.670> ideal<00:06:38.570> is<00:06:38.870> like<00:06:39.320> say<00:06:39.980> it<00:06:40.190> some<00:06:41.230> say<00:06:42.230> like<00:06:42.470> a

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
the ideal is like say it some say like a

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.950 
the ideal is like say it some say like a
new<00:06:42.740> ritual<00:06:43.250> say<00:06:43.700> young<00:06:43.910> spirit<00:06:44.420> reveals<00:06:44.780> to

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
me a new ritual and I look at the clock

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.630 
me a new ritual and I look at the clock
and<00:06:47.210> it<00:06:47.360> may<00:06:47.510> say<00:06:47.920> 911<00:06:48.920> on<00:06:49.010> the<00:06:49.130> clock

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
and it may say 911 on the clock

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.000 
and it may say 911 on the clock
well<00:06:50.150> based<00:06:50.480> on<00:06:50.660> the<00:06:50.810> download<00:06:51.320> and<00:06:51.530> a<00:06:51.620> feeling

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
well based on the download and a feeling

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.710 
well based on the download and a feeling
like<00:06:52.130> God<00:06:52.370> then<00:06:52.670> I<00:06:52.760> look<00:06:52.940> at<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.180> clock<00:06:53.420> in

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
like God then I look at the clock in

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.560 
like God then I look at the clock in
that<00:06:54.080> number<00:06:54.380> confirms<00:06:55.100> that<00:06:55.730> yes<00:06:56.060> that<00:06:56.360> was

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
that number confirms that yes that was

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.480 
that number confirms that yes that was
in<00:06:56.810> download<00:06:57.260> and<00:06:57.560> yes<00:06:57.770> this<00:06:58.100> is<00:06:58.280> something

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
in download and yes this is something

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.510 
in download and yes this is something
that<00:06:58.700> you<00:06:58.970> may<00:06:59.150> want<00:06:59.390> to<00:06:59.420> pursue<00:06:59.740> so<00:07:00.740> this<00:07:01.190> is<00:07:01.460> a

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
that you may want to pursue so this is a

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.090 
that you may want to pursue so this is a
result<00:07:02.150> from<00:07:02.420> working<00:07:02.930> with<00:07:02.960> the<00:07:03.200> numbers<00:07:03.620> /

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
result from working with the numbers /

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.920 
result from working with the numbers /
standing<00:07:04.520> in<00:07:04.670> numbers<00:07:05.060> and<00:07:05.240> like<00:07:05.360> I<00:07:05.480> said<00:07:05.540> in<00:07:05.870> a

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
standing in numbers and like I said in a

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.020 
standing in numbers and like I said in a
previous<00:07:06.170> video<00:07:06.650> at<00:07:07.130> first<00:07:07.760> I<00:07:07.970> started

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
previous video at first I started

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.880 
previous video at first I started
studying<00:07:08.570> the<00:07:08.930> numbers<00:07:09.380> and<00:07:09.590> then<00:07:09.800> the

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
studying the numbers and then the

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.280 
studying the numbers and then the
numbers<00:07:10.310> started<00:07:10.670> studying<00:07:10.910> me<00:07:11.390> and<00:07:11.810> I<00:07:12.200> know

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
numbers started studying me and I know

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.620 
numbers started studying me and I know
this<00:07:12.680> during<00:07:12.950> my<00:07:13.100> path<00:07:13.400> a<00:07:13.700> lot<00:07:13.940> of<00:07:14.090> ideals

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
this during my path a lot of ideals

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.810 
this during my path a lot of ideals
usually<00:07:15.230> have<00:07:15.410> some<00:07:15.680> kind<00:07:15.890> of<00:07:15.950> synchronistic

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
usually have some kind of synchronistic

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570 
application of seeing repeating numbers

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.690 
application of seeing repeating numbers
I'm<00:07:29.690> not<00:07:29.840> sure<00:07:30.080> but<00:07:30.800> I<00:07:31.010> want<00:07:31.250> to<00:07:31.310> put<00:07:31.520> that<00:07:31.640> out

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:31.700 
I'm not sure but I want to put that out

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.520 
I'm not sure but I want to put that out
there<00:07:31.850> in<00:07:32.120> case<00:07:32.240> somebody<00:07:32.720> is<00:07:32.960> finding<00:07:33.380> this

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530 
there in case somebody is finding this

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.020 
there in case somebody is finding this
video<00:07:33.860> that's<00:07:34.130> already<00:07:34.490> working<00:07:34.760> with

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.030 
video that's already working with

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.030 
video that's already working with
numbers<00:07:35.480> so<00:07:35.930> you<00:07:35.990> have<00:07:36.200> something<00:07:36.650> else<00:07:36.890> to

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.040 
numbers so you have something else to

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.120 
numbers so you have something else to
play<00:07:37.340> with<00:07:37.700> and<00:07:38.240> once<00:07:38.570> again<00:07:38.750> have<00:07:39.470> fun<00:07:39.830> with

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.130 
play with and once again have fun with

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.190 
play with and once again have fun with
it<00:07:40.280> we<00:07:40.730> can<00:07:40.910> go<00:07:41.090> on<00:07:41.360> and<00:07:41.660> on<00:07:41.750> about<00:07:41.960> the

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.200 
it we can go on and on about the

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.020 
it we can go on and on about the
different<00:07:42.620> techniques<00:07:43.040> and<00:07:43.310> stuff<00:07:43.460> like<00:07:43.730> that

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.030 
different techniques and stuff like that

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.120 
different techniques and stuff like that
but<00:07:44.480> until<00:07:44.840> you<00:07:45.020> really<00:07:45.050> start<00:07:45.710> to<00:07:45.770> study

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.130 
but until you really start to study

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.040 
but until you really start to study
yourself<00:07:46.340> and<00:07:47.210> seeing<00:07:47.570> how<00:07:47.750> you're

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 
walking this path you can have this

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.950 
walking this path you can have this
reality<00:07:55.340> conforming<00:07:56.270> to<00:07:56.300> your<00:07:56.450> thoughts
