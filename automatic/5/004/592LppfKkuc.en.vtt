 course in the ground can be sinus and busy 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.190
 actually on an x ​​or and I know a lot 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.539
 what 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.510
 Your keyboard was of course on the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.980
 computer then you can see all east asia cabbage 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.370
 then you see all 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.750
 which is my blood that all and is called 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.229
 maybe already a garden mentors that all 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.600
 cooling tower you can see all poor gate 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:49.050

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.070
 by this these are earwax in requests 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.600
 this errors there all these things so if that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 its that is x-ray 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.299
 but this is kind of inter think now 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.710
 not right of yes x-ray sorry I am you 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.250
 perhaps made you very happy 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.630
 make you kind of sorry what you do 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.400
 for that you have to do miss it 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.260
 spy a next couple of friends 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.500
 your friend that seven and step here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.500
 to make 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.140
 well guys this is team like that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 this is team he is building something 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.780
 but he says that I am no longer allowed 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.820
 look 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.750
 well then I say then I have to so I have to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.670
 away 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.410
 I don't care because I do 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.750
 just go into the ground and I stand 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.520
 I take a hand 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.350
 and now the intention says you two 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.460
 blocks of sand in your place 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.900
 you may have this yourself sometime 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.060
 done sooner than you see you in one 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.370
 block but we have to do something for you 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.580
 can look through that block 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.210
 so then I have to fly out and get it 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.979
 Take those two sand blocks away for a moment and then 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.090
 now have a low consumption it now 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.100
 can you actually get through the ground 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.350
 take a look directly at the block 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.790
 thunderstorm we are on fire 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.720
 then you do this again twice 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.290
 lava one would sand twice you become one 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.390
 2 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.700
 and you can look anywhere on the sides 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.489
 look through it and look now we see now 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.100
 after the left screen we see steve 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.260
 And Steve thinks that you are just she 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.090
 take a look at the ground and then you can 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.530
 to continue building 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.540
 and then I'll come down immediately 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.980
 but no you just sneak a peek 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.290
 how fat is that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.910
 imagine you deserve something cool about the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.230
 sit on the ground away from grasping 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.300
 to write to may not yet 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.150
 look go green against ok I go 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.890
 underground that and then can just come along 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.310
 look well when it goes out him me 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.709
 just move again and again the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.120
 second sand blocks 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.280
 and then you can just continue 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 look at your friend and that something and then 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.269
 make one once but didn't get there 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.959
 should not actually look at it and 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.019
 where steve steve steve what the fuck you 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.970
 she's not flipping ada's name is closer 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.709
 and this is actually possible secretly watching 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.260
 worry nothing john bit harder 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.140
 to see because he must have been we anyway 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.280
 suits and it does not work and survivor 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.720
 work one more than the ten 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.430
 seconds away 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.500
 and it's a bit harder to search 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.739
 but still everything can be fine 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.360
 I follow everything fine and yes it is 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.180
 that this is actually the kind of ixware 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.739
 mouth you can look over the other and and 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.450
 then it's someone's x-ray anyway 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.970
 computer is x-ray that can see your ears 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.530
 but that is not possible in this case 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.120
