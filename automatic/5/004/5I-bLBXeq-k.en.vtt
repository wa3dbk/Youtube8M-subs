00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.410
 European legislation 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.570
 reduction of co2 emissions 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.250
 from an environmental point of view ethanol is being used 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.289
 the machine added and it is 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.690
 percentage of sulfur drastically reduced 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.340
 this is good for the environment but the beer 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.080
 component in ethanol 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.359
 provides more moisture in the gasoline 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.460
 it also has low waffles percentages 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.529
 less lubrication and cleaning 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.849
 engines are becoming more complex with more 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.470
 precision parts 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.849
 electronics filters and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.500
 control equipment 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.650
 which increases the chance of a malfunction 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.969
 due to condensation, moisture forms 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.200
 in the gasoline 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.719
 this causes a reduction 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.760
 combustion the field we stopped injector 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.829
 and the inlet valves so that the misting 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.680
 does not run smoothly with the result 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.719
 blockage increased fuel consumption 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.190
 and possible engine problems 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.840
 this is the fix with the gasoline 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.920
 bardahl cleaners 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.269
 on the back of the can is the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.269
 mixing ratio clearly indicated 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.340
 remove the seal 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.270
 screw in the time 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.740
 and add it audibly to the gasoline 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.360
 the injector becomes the injector 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.460
 cleaned the dirt and water 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.759
 taken along with the incineration after which the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.229
 injector works properly again 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.780
 the gasoline cleaners from bardahl 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.610
 protect the complete injection system 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.960
 reduce moisture and improve the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.460
 performance 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.530
 all this results in a reduction 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.000
 fuel consumption and improving 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.490
 of engine performance 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.470
 and reduces harmful exhaust gases 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.420
 Bardahl gasoline cleaners are already through 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.570
 Many customers used with excellent 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.570
 Results 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.509
