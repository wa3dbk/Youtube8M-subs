00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
does come into into this update my

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.179 
does come into into this update my

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
theory is that it will come into this

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.060 
theory is that it will come into this
update<00:01:20.580> before<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> ps4<00:01:22.350> version<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
update before the ps4 version and the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.399 
update before the ps4 version and the
ps3<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.880> xbox<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.360> version<00:01:24.869> comes<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.229> so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
ps3 and xbox one version comes up so

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.620 
ps3 and xbox one version comes up so
when<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.680> come<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.820> people

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
have more incentive to buy it just

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.010 
have more incentive to buy it just
because<00:01:29.310> there'll<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.090> horses<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
because there'll be horses on it and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.899 
because there'll be horses on it and
stuff<00:01:31.229> there'll<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> brand-new<00:01:32.640> fresh
