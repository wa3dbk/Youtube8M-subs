shot that Karen usage has played and you

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.050 
shot that Karen usage has played and you
can<00:01:51.259> see<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.590> vast<00:01:51.860> majority<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.520> them<00:01:52.910> have

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
can see the vast majority of them have

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.690 
can see the vast majority of them have
been<00:01:53.450> hit<00:01:53.720> behind<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.800> baseline<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.310> good<00:01:55.520> two

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
been hit behind the baseline a good two

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.730

or<00:01:55.729> three<00:01:56.060> meters<00:01:56.479> or<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.410> course<00:01:57.590> it's

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
or three meters or so and of course it's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.770 
or three meters or so and of course it's
very<00:01:57.950> very<00:01:58.190> difficult<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:59.060> implement<00:01:59.390> any

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
very very difficult to implement any

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.210 
very very difficult to implement any
kind<00:02:00.110> of<00:02:00.259> game<00:02:00.410> plan<00:02:00.619> at<00:02:00.710> all<00:02:00.830> from<00:02:01.039> that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
kind of game plan at all from that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.469 
kind of game plan at all from that
position<00:02:01.429> in<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.789> court<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.060> can't<00:02:02.240> simply

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
position in the court you can't simply

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.419 
position in the court you can't simply
bunt<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.899> ball<00:02:02.929> back<00:02:03.289> in<00:02:03.470> play<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.890> hope<00:02:04.399> for

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
bunt the ball back in play and hope for

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.999 
bunt the ball back in play and hope for
errors<00:02:04.970> from<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.390> likes<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.810> Djokovic<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.920> of

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
errors from the likes of Djokovic and of

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.550 
errors from the likes of Djokovic and of
course<00:02:07.270> his<00:02:08.270> game<00:02:08.569> plan<00:02:08.600> has<00:02:08.840> been<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.050> lot<00:02:09.350> more

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
course his game plan has been a lot more

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.399 
course his game plan has been a lot more
aggressive<00:02:10.039> he's
