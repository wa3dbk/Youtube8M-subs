 whirlwind of information techniques 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.940

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.900
 who are colleagues from different countries 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.930
 that we all speak the same language with 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.550
 different customs with words from 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.740
 words of different ingredients 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.010
 then that becomes a salad 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.810
 quite nice the kitchen for me is 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.120
 the possibility of giving and giving love and 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.600
 give attention and give affection to those who 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.600
 they receive it
