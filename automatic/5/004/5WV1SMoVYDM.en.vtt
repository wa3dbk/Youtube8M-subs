we randomly shoot a small object say a
marble<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.130> screen<00:00:23.840> we<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> pattern<00:00:25.590> on

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
marble at the screen we see a pattern on

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859 
marble at the screen we see a pattern on
the<00:00:26.039> back<00:00:26.220> wall<00:00:26.519> where<00:00:27.150> they<00:00:27.359> went<00:00:27.570> through

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the back wall where they went through

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.820 
the back wall where they went through
the<00:00:28.080> slit<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.740> hit<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.510> now<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.560> add<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the slit and hit it now if we add a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.940 
the slit and hit it now if we add a
second<00:00:32.550> slit<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.960> expect<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.500> a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
second slit we would expect to see a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.840 
second slit we would expect to see a
second<00:00:35.550> band<00:00:36.050> duplicated<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> right<00:00:39.739> now

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
second band duplicated to the right now

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.380 
second band duplicated to the right now
let's<00:00:41.850> look<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.270> waves<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> waves<00:00:44.579> hit<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
let's look at waves the waves hit the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.860 
let's look at waves the waves hit the
slit<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.039> radiate<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.510> striking<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> back

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
slit and radiate out striking the back

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.639 
slit and radiate out striking the back
wall<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> most<00:00:50.480> intensity<00:00:51.480> directly<00:00:52.379> in

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
wall with the most intensity directly in

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.819 
wall with the most intensity directly in
line<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.879> slit<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> line<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
line with the slit the line of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.670 
line with the slit the line of
brightness<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:57.120> screen<00:00:57.539> shows<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
brightness on the back screen shows that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.819 
brightness on the back screen shows that
intensity<00:00:59.390> this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.660> similar<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.590> line

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
intensity this is similar to the line

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.500 
intensity this is similar to the line
the<00:01:02.340> marbles<00:01:02.760> make<00:01:03.049> but<00:01:04.369> when<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.670> add<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the marbles make but when we add the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.300 
the marbles make but when we add the
second<00:01:07.080> slit<00:01:08.299> something<00:01:09.299> different<00:01:09.869> happens

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
second slit something different happens

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
second slit something different happens
if<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.549> top<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.360> wave<00:01:12.689> meets<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.619> bottom

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
if the top of one wave meets the bottom

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.330 
if the top of one wave meets the bottom
of<00:01:14.340> another<00:01:15.030> way<00:01:15.500> they<00:01:16.500> cancel<00:01:17.040> each<00:01:17.130> other

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
of another way they cancel each other

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.050 
of another way they cancel each other
out<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> now<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.460> an<00:01:20.700> interference

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
out so now there is an interference

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.649 
out so now there is an interference
pattern<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.380> back<00:01:22.590> wall<00:01:23.299> places<00:01:24.299> where

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
pattern on the back wall places where

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
pattern on the back wall places where
the<00:01:24.840> two<00:01:24.869> tops<00:01:25.470> meet<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> highest

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the two tops meet are the highest

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.929 
the two tops meet are the highest
intensity<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.290> bright<00:01:28.590> lines<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.340> where

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
intensity the bright lines and where

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.679 
intensity the bright lines and where
they<00:01:30.119> cancel<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.470> nothing<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:33.509> we

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
they cancel there is nothing so when we

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.700 
they cancel there is nothing so when we
throw<00:01:34.049> things<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.850> matter<00:01:36.390> through<00:01:37.320> two

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
throw things that is matter through two

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.940 
throw things that is matter through two
slits<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.500> two

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
slits we get this two

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.660 
slits we get this two
of<00:01:41.310> hits<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.170> with<00:01:43.170> waves<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.549> an

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
of hits and with waves we get an

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
of hits and with waves we get an
interference<00:01:45.420> pattern<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:46.170> many<00:01:46.680> bands<00:01:48.020> good

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
interference pattern of many bands good

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.669 
interference pattern of many bands good
so<00:01:49.469> far<00:01:49.770> now<00:01:50.869> let's<00:01:51.869> go

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
so far now let's go

00:01:52.679 --> 00:02:01.850 
so far now let's go
quantum<00:01:57.560> an<00:01:58.560> electron<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.610> a<00:02:00.030> tiny<00:02:00.689> tiny<00:02:01.350> bit

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
quantum an electron is a tiny tiny bit

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.590 
quantum an electron is a tiny tiny bit
of<00:02:02.039> matter<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:04.020> tiny<00:02:04.409> marble<00:02:05.299> let's<00:02:06.299> fire

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
of matter like a tiny marble let's fire

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.219 
of matter like a tiny marble let's fire
a<00:02:06.630> stream<00:02:07.079> through<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.740> slit<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:09.750> behaves

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
a stream through one slit it behaves

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.350 
a stream through one slit it behaves
just<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.220> marble<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.819> single<00:02:12.569> band<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:14.670> if

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
just like the marble a single band so if

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.960 
just like the marble a single band so if
we<00:02:15.599> shoot<00:02:15.930> these<00:02:16.170> tiny<00:02:16.650> bits<00:02:17.040> through<00:02:17.610> two

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
we shoot these tiny bits through two

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.530 
we shoot these tiny bits through two
slits<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:19.019> should<00:02:19.349> get<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.640> marbles<00:02:21.060> two

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
slits we should get like the marbles two

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.830 
slits we should get like the marbles two
bands<00:02:23.209> what<00:02:24.209> an<00:02:25.250> interference<00:02:26.250> pattern<00:02:26.840> we

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
bands what an interference pattern we

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.370 
bands what an interference pattern we
fired

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
fired

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.569 
fired
electrons<00:02:29.150> tiny<00:02:30.150> bits<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.660> matter<00:02:30.870> through

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
electrons tiny bits of matter through

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.240 
electrons tiny bits of matter through
but<00:02:32.579> we<00:02:32.700> get<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.880> pattern<00:02:33.299> like<00:02:33.450> waves<00:02:34.010> not<00:02:35.010> like

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
but we get a pattern like waves not like

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.740 
but we get a pattern like waves not like
little<00:02:35.549> marbles<00:02:36.230> how<00:02:37.940> how<00:02:38.940> could<00:02:39.150> pieces<00:02:39.599> of

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
little marbles how how could pieces of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.110 
little marbles how how could pieces of
matter<00:02:40.019> create<00:02:40.950> an<00:02:41.160> interference<00:02:41.849> pattern

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
matter create an interference pattern

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.110 
matter create an interference pattern
like<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> wave<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:44.310> doesn't<00:02:45.060> make<00:02:45.359> sense<00:02:45.709> lot

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
like a wave it doesn't make sense lot

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.569 
like a wave it doesn't make sense lot
physicists<00:02:48.120> are<00:02:48.209> clever<00:02:48.510> they<00:02:48.810> thought<00:02:49.680> maybe

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
physicists are clever they thought maybe

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.759 
physicists are clever they thought maybe
those<00:02:51.150> little<00:02:51.540> balls<00:02:51.720> are<00:02:52.079> bouncing<00:02:52.560> off<00:02:52.709> each

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
those little balls are bouncing off each

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.930 
those little balls are bouncing off each
other<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.430> creating<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.569> pattern<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> they

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
other and creating that pattern so they

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.840
