00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.150
 good afternoon sometimes I walk on the sandy 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 shores of lakes and rivers 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:17.240
 if you look closely at the sand then 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:20.990
 can find such mysterious stones 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.119
 smooth oblong shape 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.430
 tapering at one end having 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.740
 hole from another similar to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.939
 human finger 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.690
 common people call such stones 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:40.129
 damn fingers what is sometimes 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.410
 but some places of these stones are bloody 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.140
 fingers very much we are just 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.969
 in one of these places and try now 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.539
 find some damn finger 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.969
 right here 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.540
 spear a little deeper and it is possible that 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.540
 you know 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.510
 let's 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.060
 can of course and more efficiently 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:50.500
 use a sieve but at the moment 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.500
 we do not have a sieve so we will search 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 So 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:06.850
 such a splinter was beaten to me 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.910
 belemnites are completely extinct squad 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.950
 inside the shells of cephalopods 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.410
 outwardly they looked like squid but in 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.600
 difference from squid family and internal 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.440
 belemnites reached a sink in length 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.020
 15 20 centimeters but there were species 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.320
 reach a size of up to three meters 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.330
 they beat me here with 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.530
 Carboniferous is approximately 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.640
 360 million years ago to the Cretaceous 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 period is approximately 70 million years 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 backwards 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.550
 belemnites were active predators 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.160
 judging by the number of shells in sediments 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.860
 Jurassic period they mainly led 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.519
 a way of life similar to life 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.030
 modern 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.190
 and squid swam in huge flocks 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.970
 consisting of individuals of the same size and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.970
 age 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.460
 popular names beat without giving it damn 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.110
 finger 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.150
 thunder and arrow or arrow and rose with 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.910
 long time belemnites used as 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.530
 charms and charms 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.540
 they attributed magical healing 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.760
 properties 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.100
 still in the bronze age ornament on the dishes 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.130
 made of clay using billing 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.520
 such dishes were considered sacred 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.280
 about healing purposes a sink beat me tov 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.110
 used and present 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.390
 it is believed that the powder beat me something 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.720
 has an antiseptic effect and 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:51.410
 can heal wounds and such 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.410
 wonderful Komi
