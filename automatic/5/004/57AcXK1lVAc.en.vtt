00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
got 1 and 1000 here that's the four

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.190 
got 1 and 1000 here that's the four
digits<00:00:28.450> I'm<00:00:28.509> going<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.689> be<00:00:28.750> entering<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.110> I'm

reentering<00:00:29.770> in<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.130> digits<00:00:30.520> 1<00:00:30.970> 2<00:00:31.570> 7<00:00:32.169> 9<00:00:32.940> so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
reentering in the digits 1 2 7 9 so

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.049 
reentering in the digits 1 2 7 9 so
first<00:00:34.239> digit<00:00:34.570> 1<00:00:35.290> is<00:00:35.470> fine<00:00:35.710> but<00:00:36.460> if<00:00:36.550> I<00:00:36.670> had<00:00:36.850> note

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
first digit 1 is fine but if I had note

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.189 
first digit 1 is fine but if I had note
if<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:37.510> got<00:00:38.050> three<00:00:38.440> or<00:00:38.710> four<00:00:39.030> digits<00:00:40.199> radio

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
if I got three or four digits radio

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.369 
if I got three or four digits radio
codes<00:00:41.470> if<00:00:42.070> I<00:00:42.190> were<00:00:42.340> under<00:00:42.780> let's<00:00:43.780> pause<00:00:44.080> for<00:00:44.350> a

codes if I were under let's pause for a

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.960 
codes if I were under let's pause for a
moment<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.769> look<00:00:45.250> at<00:00:45.370> what<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:45.610> difference

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
moment and look at what the difference

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.820 
moment and look at what the difference
is<00:00:46.120> between<00:00:46.239> entering<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:46.930> three<00:00:47.260> or<00:00:47.470> four

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
is between entering a three or four

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.350 
is between entering a three or four

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.500 
video uses a four digit radio code the
first<00:00:56.829> digit<00:00:57.190> will<00:00:57.399> always<00:00:58.090> be<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.390> number

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
first digit will always be the number

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.540 
first digit will always be the number
one<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.110> that's<00:00:59.379> automatically<00:00:59.980> displayed

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
one and that's automatically displayed

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.209 
one and that's automatically displayed
when<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.420> begin<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.809> enter<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.260> radio<00:01:02.949> code

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
when you begin to enter the radio code

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.050 
when you begin to enter the radio code
in<00:01:04.259> the<00:01:05.259> case<00:01:05.440> that<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.770> had<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:05.979> vehicle<00:01:06.759> with

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
in the case that you had a vehicle with

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
a three digit radio code you would turn

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.609 
a three digit radio code you would turn
on<00:01:09.789> and<00:01:09.850> off<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.270> first<00:01:10.479> digit<00:01:10.899> by<00:01:11.229> pressing

on and off the first digit by pressing

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.060 
on and off the first digit by pressing
the<00:01:11.710> number<00:01:11.830> one<00:01:12.190> once<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:13.300> turn<00:01:13.479> it<00:01:13.630> off<00:01:13.780> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the number one once to turn it off and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.490 
the number one once to turn it off and
once<00:01:15.070> again<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.580> turn<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.789> on<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.990> your<00:01:20.200> radio

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
once again to turn it on if your radio

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.350 
once again to turn it on if your radio
does<00:01:20.770> require<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.190> three<00:01:21.610> digit<00:01:21.759> radio<00:01:22.119> code

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
does require a three digit radio code

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.020 
does require a three digit radio code
once<00:01:23.080> you've<00:01:23.319> disabled<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.280> first<00:01:24.490> digit<00:01:24.880> by

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
once you've disabled the first digit by

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.290 
once you've disabled the first digit by
turning<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.539> off<00:01:25.660> pressing<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.500> number<00:01:26.740> one

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
turning it off pressing the number one

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.460 
turning it off pressing the number one
you<00:01:28.300> would<00:01:28.420> then<00:01:28.599> continue<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.229> enter<00:01:29.440> the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
you would then continue to enter the

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.580 
you would then continue to enter the
code<00:01:29.740> as<00:01:29.979> shown<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.209> video<00:01:31.330> using<00:01:32.050> the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
code as shown in the video using the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.080 
code as shown in the video using the
remaining<00:01:32.979> digits<00:01:33.280> on<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.819> radio

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
remaining digits on the radio

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.960 
remaining digits on the radio
so<00:01:37.090> first<00:01:37.360> digit<00:01:37.720> one<00:01:38.409> is<00:01:38.590> fine<00:01:38.860> but<00:01:39.549> if<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.820> had

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
so first digit one is fine but if I had

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.310 
so first digit one is fine but if I had
note<00:01:40.180> if<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.630> got<00:01:41.170> three<00:01:41.590> or<00:01:41.619> four<00:01:42.149> digits<00:01:43.320> radio

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
note if I got three or four digits radio

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.080
