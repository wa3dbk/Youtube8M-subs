00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
study I think it's the the most

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.519

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the same place at the same time and I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.209 
the same place at the same time and I
had<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> luck<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.969> get<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.359> them

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
had the luck to you to get to know them

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.530 
had the luck to you to get to know them
it's<00:01:02.219> such<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> short<00:01:03.059> period<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.570> time<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:06.420> be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it's such a short period of time to be

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
it's such a short period of time to be
new<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> cities<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> was<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.920> adapting

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
new in the cities I was about adapting

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.289 
new in the cities I was about adapting
yourself<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> case<00:01:11.909> not

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
yourself and I think it's the case not

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
yourself and I think it's the case not
in<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:13.020> only<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.350> Cologne<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.070> everywhere

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
in not only in Cologne but everywhere

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
in not only in Cologne but everywhere
but<00:01:15.090> maybe<00:01:15.299> cologne<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> nice<00:01:16.110> City<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.590> like

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
but maybe cologne is a nice City to like

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.450 
but maybe cologne is a nice City to like
it's<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.299> hard<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> adapt<00:01:19.080> since<00:01:19.460> it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it's not that hard to adapt since it's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.280 
it's not that hard to adapt since it's
like<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.090> people<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.479> really<00:01:21.509> open<00:01:21.750> and
