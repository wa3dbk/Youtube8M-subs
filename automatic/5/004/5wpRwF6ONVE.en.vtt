00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.659 
out submission they be Issac tab and
then<00:04:39.720> let's<00:04:39.900> undo<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.560> two<00:04:40.740> screws<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:41.580> I'll

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
then let's undo the two screws so I'll

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.570 
then let's undo the two screws so I'll
just<00:04:41.880> do<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.210> now<00:04:42.419> okay<00:04:43.160> once<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.310> screws

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
just do that now okay once the screws

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.490 
just do that now okay once the screws
are<00:04:44.610> removed<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:45.540> top<00:04:45.780> just<00:04:46.140> screw<00:04:46.350> is

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
are removed the top just screw is

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.159 
are removed the top just screw is
slightly<00:04:47.070> difficult<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.820> get<00:04:47.970> out<00:04:48.150> however<00:04:49.050> it

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
slightly difficult to get out however it

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.040 
slightly difficult to get out however it
can<00:04:49.320> wait<00:04:49.500> no<00:04:50.310> brother<00:04:50.580> bother<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.660> that's

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
can wait no brother bother and that's

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.360 
can wait no brother bother and that's
the<00:04:52.340> that's<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.520> pack<00:04:55.190> okay<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:58.100> that's<00:04:59.100> the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
the that's the pack okay so that's the

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.220 
the that's the pack okay so that's the
that's<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.970> old<00:05:00.240> one<00:05:00.450> which<00:05:00.720> I'll<00:05:00.930> put

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
that's the old one which I'll put

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.100 
that's the old one which I'll put
outside<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.010> car<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:03.530> here's<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:06.110> here's

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
outside the car and here's the here's

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.690 
outside the car and here's the here's
the<00:05:07.200> new<00:05:07.410> one<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.770> I'll<00:05:08.190> just<00:05:08.370> stick<00:05:08.669> that

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
the new one and I'll just stick that

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.330 
the new one and I'll just stick that
back<00:05:09.060> in<00:05:11.300> now<00:05:12.300> they<00:05:12.450> do<00:05:12.600> see<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:13.050> it's<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:13.919> a

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
back in now they do see that it's just a

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.540 
back in now they do see that it's just a
reversal<00:05:14.880> of<00:05:15.030> them<00:05:15.360> what<00:05:15.810> you've<00:05:15.930> just<00:05:15.960> done

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
reversal of them what you've just done

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.159 
reversal of them what you've just done
it's<00:05:17.550> not<00:05:17.700> always<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:18.030> smooth<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.570> silky<00:05:18.750> side

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
it's not always a smooth and silky side

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.140 
it's not always a smooth and silky side
so<00:05:19.620> what<00:05:19.770> I'll<00:05:19.890> do<00:05:20.040> is<00:05:20.070> I'll<00:05:20.490> put<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.850> all<00:05:20.970> back

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
so what I'll do is I'll put it all back

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.400 
so what I'll do is I'll put it all back
together<00:05:21.330> if<00:05:21.660> there's<00:05:21.900> something<00:05:22.229> that<00:05:22.260> I

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
together if there's something that I

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.200 
together if there's something that I
find<00:05:22.620> is<00:05:22.890> particularly<00:05:23.460> difficult<00:05:23.760> they'll

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
find is particularly difficult they'll

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.380 
find is particularly difficult they'll
stop<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:25.020> undo<00:05:25.620> it<00:05:25.650> and<00:05:25.950> then<00:05:26.220> show<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.669> how<00:05:27.360> I

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
stop and undo it and then show you how I

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.620 
stop and undo it and then show you how I
resolved<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.669> okay<00:05:29.669> so<00:05:29.729> just<00:05:30.150> before<00:05:30.270> putting

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
resolved it okay so just before putting

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.870 
resolved it okay so just before putting
the<00:05:30.720> glove<00:05:30.900> box<00:05:31.500> back<00:05:31.860> in<00:05:31.890> place<00:05:32.340> just<00:05:32.729> make

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.100 

single-speed<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:38.789> working

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
single-speed and working

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.480 
single-speed and working
the<00:05:41.889> bus<00:05:42.220> would<00:05:42.430> go<00:05:42.669> we<00:05:43.169> get<00:05:44.169> here<00:05:44.409> that<00:05:44.490> second

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
the bus would go we get here that second

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:56.610 
the bus would go we get here that second
speed<00:05:45.729> spoken
