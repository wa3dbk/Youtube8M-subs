00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.440
 before starting we present some 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.750
 data relating to the anatomy of the institution 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.270
 tooth is important for chewing e 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.240
 digestion, however, also plays a role 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.850
 the tooth is relevant in aesthetics 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.700
 covered with an outer layer 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.480
 called hard white enamel 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:49.280
 and resistant that allows us to bite 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:52.550
 tear and chop food under it 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.460
 enamel we find the dentine of color 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.269
 yellow less hard and that constitutes the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.360
 most of the tooth in the center of the 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:06.460
 the tooth under the dentin is the pulp one 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.460
 nerve also containing blood vessels 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.780
 caries is a disease of origin 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.220
 bacterial that attacks the tissues of the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.440
 tooth and demineralized them without a 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.600
 adequate treatment of caries and 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.000
 gain ground towards the center of the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.250
 tooth producing the sadly famous 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.350
 toothache 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.149
 will then be that his dentist 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.610
 devitalization of the tooth will proceed 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.640
 this operation consists in removing 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.829
 the whole of the pulp and replace it 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.189
 with a paste for root canal filling 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.840
 the devitalized tooth is no longer 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.210
 fed by the blood vessels of the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.670
 pulp and can no longer defend itself in this way 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.829
 effective as a healthy tooth would do 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.950
 facing the forces of chewing 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.299
 therefore it is absolutely appropriate 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.509
 protect it with the application of a 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.509
 crown 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.710
 after giving the tooth the shape 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.869
 adequate for implanting the crown on 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.420
 dentist will proceed to carry out the 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.330
 impression taking and sending it 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.340
 dental technician once made 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.650
 the crown the dentist will make one 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.450
 proof that will verify that 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.819
 actually he will be able to 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.660
 return form and aspect function 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.850
 initial of the healthy tooth the crown will come 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.050
 then fixed with a cement or a cement 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.660
 glue the tooth with his new crown 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.980
 will be protected and will not be subject to the risk of 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.930
 fracture depending on the material 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.280
 employed we can distinguish two types 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.550
 of crowns primarily the alloy crown 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.920
 metallic it has the advantage of 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.170
 give the tooth its shape and function 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.580
 but does not adapt to the need of 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.120
 aesthetic because it presents an appearance 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.580
 metallic 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.300
 therefore it is especially intended for teeth 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.300
 rear 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.650
 the most appropriate solution will be 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.019
 the use of a ceramic crown which 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.420
 it will not only restore the function 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.850
 shape but also the aesthetic aspect of the 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.040
 giving healthy 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.140
 obviously it is irreplaceable in the 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.209
 anterior region of the mouth but is 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.670
 also recommendable in the region 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.570
 rear to improve the harmony of 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.570
 all the smile 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.239
 here are some strict rules to follow 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.340
 after inserting a crown 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.019
 you must remember not to chew 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.090
 on the side where the 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.849
 crown during the hours following his 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.190
 fixing may appear disturbances 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.290
 it is normal to feel the sensation of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.569
 have a foreign body in closing the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.569
 mouth so you don't have to worry 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.110
 it is convenient that you always brush your teeth 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.819
 from the gum towards the end of the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.920
 crown actually brush the teeth in 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.380
 inadequate manner may originate one 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.750
 retraction of the gingiva and appearance 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.370
 of a little aesthetic edge between the crown 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:16.500
 and the gum during its life can 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.260
 a crown detachment occurs 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.329
 must be sealed as soon as possible 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.150
 in order to avoid displacement of the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.250
 neighboring teeth this process would render 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.250
 crown replacement not possible 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.570
 finally it is imperative to remember that each 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.240
 whenever we are in front of a 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.289
 devitalized tooth should be applied 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.289
 dental crown 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.870
 we thank you for your attention
