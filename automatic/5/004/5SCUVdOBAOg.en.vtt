satisfied<00:00:42.019> I'll<00:00:42.789> make<00:00:43.789> a<00:00:43.820> mole<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.239> make<00:00:44.390> a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
satisfied I'll make a mole to make a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.920 
satisfied I'll make a mole to make a
matter<00:00:44.629> of<00:00:44.690> resin<00:00:44.989> I<00:00:45.890> was<00:00:46.850> planning<00:00:47.300> on<00:00:47.420> doing

you<00:00:50.930> know<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.789> two-part<00:00:52.789> mold<00:00:53.409> but<00:00:54.409> I<00:00:54.440> decided

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
you know a two-part mold but I decided

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.319 
you know a two-part mold but I decided
not<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.250> I<00:00:55.399> mean<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:55.699> know<00:00:55.760> I<00:00:55.879> couldn't<00:00:56.149> save

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.980 
that guy and we'll make those guys out
of<00:02:10.910> resin<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.910> hear<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.209> mold<00:02:20.450> let's

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
of resin and if you hear the mold let's

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.550 
of resin and if you hear the mold let's
fill<00:02:21.440> them<00:02:21.560> up<00:02:21.650> here's<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.540> clay<00:02:23.540> ones<00:02:23.810> okay

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
fill them up here's the clay ones okay

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:34.210 
fill them up here's the clay ones okay
so<00:02:24.620> that's<00:02:24.920> history

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.310

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
all right so right now I have no idea no

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.800 
all right so right now I have no idea no
I'm<00:02:37.410> gonna<00:02:37.560> stand<00:02:37.890> them<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:39.420> thinking

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
I'm gonna stand them I was thinking

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.990 
I'm gonna stand them I was thinking
something<00:02:40.020> right<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:40.770> then<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.790> seems

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
something right here but then it seems

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.970 
something right here but then it seems
like<00:02:42.060> he'll<00:02:42.300> be<00:02:42.420> way<00:02:42.720> too<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.170> front<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:43.860> I'm

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
like he'll be way too in front so I'm

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.720 
like he'll be way too in front so I'm
gonna<00:02:44.190> start<00:02:44.940> here<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.920> we'll<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:47.580> what

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
gonna start here and we'll see what

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.020 
gonna start here and we'll see what
happens<00:02:48.060> once<00:02:48.300> he's<00:02:48.780> complete<00:02:52.430> then<00:02:53.430> after<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
happens once he's complete then after a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.280 
happens once he's complete then after a
flying<00:02:54.870> primer<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.100> boots<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:57.290> painted

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
flying primer on the boots I painted

sculpt human anatomy which I can't but
when<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:30.950> have<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.280> form<00:04:31.550> already<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.150> kind

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
when you have the form already it kind

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.330 
when you have the form already it kind
of<00:04:32.419> makes<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.690> easier<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.830> I'll<00:04:33.889> be<00:04:33.980> doing<00:04:34.100> that

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
of makes it easier so I'll be doing that

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.230 
of makes it easier so I'll be doing that
and<00:04:36.010> getting<00:04:37.010> some<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.460> this<00:04:37.640> other<00:04:37.940> clay

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
and getting some of this other clay

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.100 
and getting some of this other clay
which<00:04:38.450> were<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:39.730> old<00:04:40.730> boots<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.780> came<00:04:41.990> in

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
which were the old boots that came in

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.730 
which were the old boots that came in
handy<00:04:42.320> once<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:42.950> we<00:04:43.190> melted<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.669> clay<00:04:44.740> and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
handy once you we melted the clay and

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.500 
handy once you we melted the clay and
that<00:04:46.130> will<00:04:46.400> be<00:04:46.640> eventually<00:04:46.940> just<00:04:49.180> adding<00:04:50.180> clay

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
that will be eventually just adding clay

00:04:50.510 --> 00:05:00.310 
that will be eventually just adding clay
to<00:04:50.570> it

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.910 

as<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:01.700> can<00:05:01.850> see<00:05:02.180> this<00:05:02.750> has<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.050> muscle<00:05:03.620> here

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
as you can see this has the muscle here

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.100 
as you can see this has the muscle here
and<00:05:04.460> this<00:05:04.670> one<00:05:04.850> is<00:05:04.880> too<00:05:05.210> flat<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:05.540> we'll<00:05:06.020> be

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
and this one is too flat so we'll be

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.070 
and this one is too flat so we'll be
working<00:05:06.380> on<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:07.780> after<00:05:08.780> so<00:05:08.930> much

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
working on that and after so much

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.520 
working on that and after so much
movement<00:05:09.350> and<00:05:09.940> laying<00:05:10.940> flat<00:05:11.390> he<00:05:11.600> has<00:05:11.840> no<00:05:12.320> ass

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
movement and laying flat he has no ass

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.670 
movement and laying flat he has no ass
so<00:05:12.890> I'll<00:05:13.040> be<00:05:13.190> working<00:05:13.520> on<00:05:13.580> that<00:05:14.590> even<00:05:15.590> though

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
so I'll be working on that even though

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.080 
so I'll be working on that even though
it's<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:15.950> know<00:05:15.980> may<00:05:16.220> might<00:05:16.400> not<00:05:16.550> be<00:05:16.700> necessary

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
it's you know may might not be necessary

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.550 
it's you know may might not be necessary
because<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.630> Cape<00:05:17.810> will<00:05:17.960> be<00:05:18.080> covering<00:05:18.380> that

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
because the Cape will be covering that

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.410 
because the Cape will be covering that
but<00:05:18.830> still<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.220> need<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:19.550> go<00:05:19.670> Matty<00:05:19.880> something

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
but still you need to go Matty something

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.270 
but still you need to go Matty something

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.590 
the boots a bit but that's okay because
