00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:09.389
 Please tell me the representative a little 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.769
 This is sg model is basic though 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:18.010
 It is how to make semi-follow, but in that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.180
 I I I I So I light it fairly are gouge 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.390
 It is a little different from that semi acoustic guitar, though 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.420
 That back is the board of one by one 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.869
 It's been time to get this + reason 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:38.000
 The sledge and the model and that with all the movement 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:39.800
 The feeling of depth and how to become totally different this way 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.420
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.250
 This is the most normal 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.460
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.530
 Come in part 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.480
 4 r 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.690
 It's like this, but this is all in the 40s of Yamaha's effect board 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.390
 It sounds like the live sound is complete 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.899
 a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.980
 This is when using a distorted sound called distortion 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.980
 46th 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.680
 ni 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.250
 You because no heavy looks like this 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 I mean that I'd away on? Let Ahiite 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:24.320
 I feel a very light and cute hair I still from now on 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.220
 I think I would use a lot I became a fretless 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.470
 This pick does not use this story to a fretless 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.980
 When 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.100
 I am doing in this two good 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.100
 Hm 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:02:04.550
 Day basically this buber 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.450
 I have a cold 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:18.070
 I have a line drawn here 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:22.670
 I think I'll become a higher pitch when the finger comes on top of this line 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:26.390
 So just beyond the battle 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:34.620
 I think it's just right here 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:42.239
 a Basically when you practice fretless where there is no fretless 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:44.650
 If there is this side of the bracket of this fret as much as possible 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.770
 This head is 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:54.230
 I'm going to practice metal fittings Osar 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:56.680
 It seems to be able to play without seeing it after 20 years because it seems so after a little more hey 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.680
 I think 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.810
 Because it says Shiseido in-spirits 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:14.300
 Considering the new development 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:17.750
 I Tteyuu want to do at that stage all that Well that went so far 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.380
 That kind of desire is called out desire 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:28.800
 It is a live of the form that I arrived at 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:33.220
 Various exchanges 3 among members even when you think the song order Toka Toka ne structure of the song concert 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:39.420
 I made it while thinking about things, but 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.420
 It's not like that at the end of the song 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.730
 What I can say is something vague 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.730
 There is an image of a pan and there are no lyrics. 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:56.180
 Try to replace it with that title 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:58.040
 Trying to make it a voice and pick it up as a melody, or try it for a lifetime 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.400
 Hard that 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.799
 It's a task of making it in the form of the original reality 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:11.060
 In the position that the instrument player that everyone stood on the same line 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.140
 First of like a joy of communication is that it 's such a want transmitted to the audience 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.030
 I got it 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.709
 In part say so thought that or not to live the feeling that I thought that Well split 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.690
 But 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:31.000
 In the case of Jimbo, I already knew it from long ago and the god of rhythm 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:36.490
 There is a place where all the things go around firmly when you are firm 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.140
 In Well live is a place to say Rutte be able to have that kind of a certain degree of leeway after his case 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.580
 I can still feel relieved 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:46.610
 Well that's right 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.419
 Drummer is there first to say I wonder if what people do not Yajima Mr. and Do will not only him 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.960
 In Tan 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:58.729
 Futako Bae by say selfishly trying to do in the drinking I was I'm interesting phlegm together in Tamagawa play 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.600
 Also, before that, ask me something like that demonstration tape. 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:06.169
 If you were this guy 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.580
 Because he told me his his personality because there was the crisp it means that can be in pretty almighty 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.920
 Really kind of is 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.849
 Possible 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:20.849
 Have carried out in the I Nde was a feeling that can seem a long time together beneath 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:22.860
 Well Kedomo'm certain that those two people to be a very talented player Which I also 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:28.050
 In the case of a forest area 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:32.280
 It is said that a lot of written things will be neatly organized in that oneself 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:38.960
 I think I have a very kind of outstanding ability 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:44.419
 It is a goal among the synthesizers that use sampling 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.620
 Can be that there is original only not organize clean and refreshing Toka that properly you assign 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.770
 Why not 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.620
 I think that is thankful 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:57.110
 I wonder ne shadow effort like a of 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:59.210
 He thinks he is alive to live so hard and, in contrast, that mystery and Khun he also 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:04.340
 It is a multi-key body strike but 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:11.750
 He it is I still is not Yu say leaving yo because when drawn with Buwa' 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:15.020
 Go alone and I keyboardist two people that do it Kedomo each flavor has lived most 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:19.440
 It feels like you are getting it 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:22.600
 tech It seems like there is a head that looks like this kind of person 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.620
 It's not like that 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:31.110
 That of kana spike Tteyuu big idiot place 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.110
 I think it would be nice if you enjoyed it
