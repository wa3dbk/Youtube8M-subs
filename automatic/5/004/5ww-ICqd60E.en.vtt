00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.599
 Hello guys 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.160
 good in today's video I showed how I 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:28.240
 I made my door 11 lusa effect far 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.489
 and I saw this recipe in the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.200
 channel of the world manual I'll leave the 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.600
 link from here below for you to see 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.800
 and an original recipe from him that 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.010
 to invent 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 so that's all I used to grout 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.940
 turn off what was one of the three and 80 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 snake in the garden at home and black dye 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.600
 which cost 12 90 also then - $ 10 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.530
 one of the tips he speaks there is for 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.860
 put more cheese glue than god law 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.440
 because when you won with the pay is with the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.060
 choose the grout to leave a cloth and so 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.030
 if you put the school, it's all 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.790
 Calm down and I gave it to the school. 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.400
 All right, I deleted it several times and did not 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.190
 no trace left and little boy 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.150
 black then it's still intact 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.040
 and the other tip is to pay with a cloth 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.560
 because if you stop with the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.380
 eraser will get a little stained so 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.170
 erase it with a damp cloth and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.500
 cool, no pieces left 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.899
 mine a week ago to test well and 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.899
 yet nothing came out're so perfect 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.420
 Good, I chose to do it at my door. 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.180
 but you can do whatever you want in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.170
 wall or in pieces of wood and make 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.649
 this with the board who works too 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:08.240
 so this is it if you want to see how I 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.240
 I just keep watching the video. 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.800
 to start I take back everything I have 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.500
 Nothing at the door, I'll start this 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.390
 raw wood and it is the wait for 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.250
 I need to leave this door more 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.310
 nobody normal you can skip this 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.310
 part 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.400
 to start I'm going to put some 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.400
 paste 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.740
 and a spoonful of laws 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.120
 I mix well 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.079
 and add one more spoon jo 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.299
 Actually, I do not have the right measure. 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.560
 so you're going to have to be on the olhometer 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:08.379
 same but remember it 's important to put 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.970
 school that brings this together I added 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.970
 a little more snake 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.070
 now I added a little dye 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.900
 black 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.540
 If you want to do color you can 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.940
 put red or so pink 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.990
 But remember, it will not be too urgent. 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.210
 good if you want to use colorless 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.160
 best ensures black 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.680
 I'm going to get a dish sponge 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.960
 and use as a brush can not be a 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.960
 layer nor very thin in much Brazil 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.550
 one thing I had to do 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.110
 before it was to cover the sides of the door 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.110
 with durex not to stain 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.880
 and also remove the handle 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:33.950
 It is important to dry well and then 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.950
 is ready 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.670
 good staff then was this I hope 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.130
 did you like 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.140
 remembering that this recipe is from the manual 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.660
 I'm going to put their link on the world. 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.790
 here below, take a look at the 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.430
 channel that is one of the best channels 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.090
 from youtube a kiss and until the 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.090
