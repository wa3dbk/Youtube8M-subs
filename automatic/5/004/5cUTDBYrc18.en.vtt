00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 very good kids that you are here 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.509
 good street flow today come with signs a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.370
 gta online video in which I get 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.750
 inside the train cabin and I'm going to 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.250
 explain how I do the first thing 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.929
 we have to do is come to us 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.389
 any store 24/7 or liquor store 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.490
 any store that you can steal from 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.460
 these little ones is what we have to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.260
 to do is buy the tails the copy of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.970
 the cheap copy cocacola 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.279
 the more you buy and obviously more 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.470
 opportunity you will have to achieve it but not 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.210
 has no difficulty the trick is worth 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.340
 once we have them we have to mark 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.410
 a few routes of the map a few days of the train in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.600
 map forgiveness no matter what are the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
 I teach just in case they do not know what 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.440
 they are the train track no, it would be 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.629
 written from here and we have to go towards 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760
 there and wait for a train to come and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.110
 get on any car I left 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.590
 this piece because here you do not have to upload 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.030
 the car is very very very very easy 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.100
 really good before everything is has 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.449
 have 109 for those who do not know 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.300
 increase is not clogged nor clichÃ© ado 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.070
 good so you do not know how to get on the car is 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 very very simple we have to put 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.560
 a payment of these flat and only 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.350
 give the square 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.240
 to 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.590
 and we have to go right to the other one to the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.890
 part forward just to this part of 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.700
 here and join the party to the window 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.860
 which is the part on the left 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 as we look at it in the face we can not 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.540
 doing so much of the sel is choosing to drink cola 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 unfairly give the pause and wait 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.740
 a few seconds wait like 45 minutes 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.080
 of the fire as you see above 6 12 613 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.610
 wait 1 minute of the game first of all 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.980
 so that the unfair coca cola ends 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.070
 when we give him 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.360
 we entered inside the cabin as 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.340
 there's not much to do inside the truth 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.590
 but it's pretty cool advertising and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.960
 I say I'll be on the channel to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.480
 share it with people and how can you 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.490
 see is it's one thing that I'm not nobody has 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.870
 entered and let's say the map of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.700
 done is not what I always say 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.710
 because you do the map and then you leave it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.510
 enter here as you see that applies a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.790
 door to one of the sides then you 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.260
 it's like that part of there is created 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.140
 if you go to the back one gets 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.610
 you only leave the train 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.190
 As you can see here I will repeat again 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.780
 so you can see that it's not difficult if 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.280
 I, like myself, tell you if you come to this 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.500
 window on the right you will not be able to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.160
 go up so look for the one on the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.980
 left and in the same steps 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.769
 in the select 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.580
 inventory select action drink que cola 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.230
 to the pause and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.989
 some minutillos that are missing a lot two 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.489
 terms 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.739
 we give the button to return as 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.900
 we appear inside the truth is that it is 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.069
 a pretty cool curiosity is not 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.140
 moment of adam and departure or nothing 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.579
 at the moment it is not patched so 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.560
 well I wanted to share it with you 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.790
