00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.220
 good 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.220
 ah 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.530
 very good people that I bring 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.740
 welcome to another more modern video 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.450
 warfare 3 and good as I told you 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.990
 previously the video that was located in 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.790
 the l 118 pulling out a fashion I told you 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.430
 that I just wanted to upload some more just 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:38.220
 with the sniper based on weeks 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 moving so little and so I 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.050
 only my goal was to get love 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.880
 with only the deaths with the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.790
 sniper even though I get 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.910
 get out of high school more than anything I do a 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.430
 I think so good we are here in bad faith 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.800
 by teams on the map of desi town and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.110
 what you just did with one with the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.530
 sniper okay do not do it do not do it 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.839
 do because 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.490
 it's for me it's playing dirty and playing very 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.920
 novice I obviously respect that the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.140
 people play how exactly the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.710
 you win nothing happens but for me 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.700
 opinion this with a sniper is 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.280
 play the novice not obviously with the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.850
 rejection with the dragon or will you need 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.649
 two shots and with that obviously it does not 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.880
 lack is not to play the honor not 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.860
 obviously a sniper that 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.690
 you need two shots unless you give him 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.280
 obviously in the head because with those 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.440
 two snipers I do not see it 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.360
 Act 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.970
 of rookie you will not see here a moment 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.650
 a second a break it's worth I'm that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.510
 they are calling by phone so 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.160
 obviously I'm not going to move and now 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.400
 a little bit later if I go to 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.190
 get moving again and to continue 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.480
 seeing enemies based on weeks and good 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.090
 I'm with the 50 gauge barret carrying 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.950
 you see the second as flash no no 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.900
 had unlocked more because in this 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.320
 prestige had not used it for 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.670
 nothing and I take the kickback competition 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.840
 had not yet managed to unlock 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.740
 the impact that is what you just put to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.450
 this this sniper and good at 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.100
 theme of the advantages I never get 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.720
 specialist in this case if I get 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.830
 specialist with the sniper voucher 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.880
 I always play with the marches 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.430
 assault 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.920
 whenever I usually carry snipers 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.870
 and well, it took the three advantages 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.290
 initials prestidigitaciÃ³n desenfundado 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.290
 Quick 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.269
 Wait, I'm not going to leave now 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.209
 I know if he was a shooter 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.500
 I have been a shooter, sorry, I was going 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.750
 to say stable aim because before I 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.020
 put stable aim 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.630
 in the snipers 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.280
 and the advantages that I carry and what more 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.780
 like to take with a sniper 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.980
 carrying specialist is leading 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.750
 deadly silence so they do not hear me 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.120
 also bearing stable aim that to 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.250
 the best does not 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.060
 not long ago but maybe for the no 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.060
 spit 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.750
 and maybe I do not know if for the clicks of 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.700
 help I do not think no but maybe 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.470
 stable aim what helps you is 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.600
 When an enemy passes, you know that the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.160
 peephole what it does is look a little 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.230
 towards the passing side of the enemy already 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.040
 the best that helps you do 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.680
 some quick not totally safe is worth and 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.200
 the third advantage that I have is line 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.030
 it lasts to get that with one more low 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.790
 Obviously get all the advantages 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.730
 of the specialist and good as you are 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.920
 watching you are going to see the movement 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.650
 constant and not constant I will do 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.200
 Sniper work not to be 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.330
 tranquilito somewhere moving 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.799
 little and then you will see that I'm going to 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.120
 move a little more to sack looking for 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:58.060
 the enemies doing the quick and good 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.580
 later now you are going to see one thing 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.840
 I'm going to say an advice that is that I 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.580
 I see many champions in the sniper 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.190
 carrying blind eye murderer and what is 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.940
 they shoot all the time pointing and you go to 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.640
 see a clear example of what 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.770
 if I had stayed pointing everything 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.049
 I would not have known for a while that a 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.000
 enemy would have come by the other side 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.170
 without realizing because obviously already 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.740
 you know when you point with the look 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.500
 written most of the vision 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.110
 of the field is worth and obviously can 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.140
 appear an enemy on either side and 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.610
 you can hump them and load them in everything 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.380
 that wags not good you're going to see here 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.330
 also that this is starting to be a 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.570
 little nervous because I know I was wearing 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.240
 a long streak and maybe it could be 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.550
 get it and what I wanted here in 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.960
 this moment was to play a little more 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.760
 quiet when I saw that I could not see 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.550
 no enemy because I was beginning to 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.520
 put a little more nervous and decide 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.260
 go a little more to good sack will get 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.760
 the moment in which I already tell you that I 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.350
 I think an enemy dies and if I take 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.870
 that now pointing you are going to see how this 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.150
 from the left if yes I would not have 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.920
 realized it's worth it if I had not done 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.360
 that gesture of removing the peephole 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.890
 I would have killed even if there was a 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.030
 my partner behind because obviously 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.420
 many times as I say you can not 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.110
 trust your team and what 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.740
 can do directly is that 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.770
 when you see that one of your team passes 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.940
 by pass by the side of an enemy 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.730
 many times what I have found is 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.320
 that does not kill you and obviously because you 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.190
 Fuck a lot, that's why I say many times 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.230
 for the best advice no no no 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.880
 you never want your team and good 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.190
 here was just one that I 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.560
 they remove and it is now yes it was 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.840
 nervous and good I see suddenly here 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.200
 later the name orange and good 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.240
 I get love and I was already very much 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.699
 calmer I was 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.169
 much happier because I imagined 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.030
 that without taking the competence of 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.440
 speed with this weapon and without chargers 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.950
 great then 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.300
 it's going to be quite impossible for me 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.810
 being sincere is going to be pretty 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:10.530
 impossible to get it so 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.610
 Well , I was much more relaxed and 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.710
 is the truth is that I was pretty 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.440
 happy I do not do virginies with 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.060
 knife ni ni 360 finished when 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.340
 I'm happy taking a hand but that 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.139
 I feel much more relaxed 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.560
 and I understand people very well when 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.500
 they say that 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.050
 that morphine has been taken out on 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.160
 relaxation that you get afterwards if you follow 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.169
 I understand it I have lived the experience 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.940
 a few times not but the truth 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:45.060
 is that I'm really happy 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.270
 with what I'm getting here in 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:52.620
 youtube not as I go up more 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.360
 the gameplays plus more and more tips and 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.490
 I'm really glad that many of you are 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.140
 writing in comments that really 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:02.880
 these tips help you and good for 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.070
 thanks for that and that's why

 always and good also to say already by 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.330
 last to be here with a person 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.770

 and nothing will I leave it with the end of 

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:18.899
 gameplay because I pulled the fashions that 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:21.569
 I say ostia ticos are going to finish the 

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:24.179
 deaths and I'm not so stupid that I the 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.909
 I'm saving so do not forget 

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:28.739
