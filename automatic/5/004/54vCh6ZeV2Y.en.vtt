00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 third video software we throw a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.139
 eye to therapy rod so I charged of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.700
 file top of my life tec is so we go 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.240
 look a little bit at what we can 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.990
 make the album 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.900
 so first we have our exhibition 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:24.630
 little too bullish not lose details 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.519
 in the whites you see right away 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.980
 one of the worries with rot therapy is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.730
 that when we zoom, for example, it puts a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.300
 some time to display the image that that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.430
 can be frustrating 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.899
 so here have increased a little bit 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.239
 the exhibition then for the high 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.530
 lights for the elections flash it's 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.840
 so here its high lights the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 compression of other lights threshold of 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.370
 Highlight compression is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.960
 not very nice very quickly not very 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.010
 obvious then black honda will not have 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.320
 white following the reconstruction of the high 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.100
 lights we take off light light to be 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.920
 that I do that I lose the named detail 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.900
 great light and I do that 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.299
 okay little bit I can darken the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.030
 shadows and I can clear them up but by 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.220
 against we can not treat them 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 we can talk very far with the golden donkey 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.460
 then you see every ray 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.680
 against local h in full full 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.930
 details 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.909
 so this is a software that I have little 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 explored so it's normal that I 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.380
 stammering a little bit that I do not know 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.820
 not exactly where to go each time what 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.150
 which has a lot of details it's not 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.900
 always always very clear something 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.240
 which is good that here we have a 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.329
 historical on the left we can come back 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.829
 at previous tests to say 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.119
 every every new step that you 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.530
 do is recorded and so you 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.229
 can go back one step back two 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.680
 steps 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.399
 it's not bad then we did 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.689
 exposure shadows and clear 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.300
 now we will go see 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.690
 so before going saturation 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.520
 I think she's here mix 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.420
 brightness contrast saturation if 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.420
 I increase to saturation 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.190
 we can increase the saturation in 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.610
 tears and how am I going to show you 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.170
 something other than in this software and who 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.100
 I was interested is that on 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:41.230
 grandfather and elsewhere we lived the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.510
 saturation and for for stories of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.150
 colors there is another parameter that 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.790
 is called the vibrating which is very 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.980
 interesting especially because she 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.270
 allows to touch up the colors of a 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.390
 a little different way 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.470
 saleh boost but it tends to the 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.930
 booster a little more 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.770
 balanced as a rule and therefore by 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.690
 example this red flower here on 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.710
 adjusting the vibrating will not become too much 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.540
 flash to see with saturation and so 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.400
 it will allow us to win in 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.130
 tunes and in jails without necessarily 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.370
 lose in loss of quality of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.570
 detail of our red flowers 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.270
 it can be interesting I think too 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.900
 for portraits in general when we have 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.070
 a a portrait a face often the 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.739
 colors in the background be a little 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.390
 bland compared to the face and when one 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.430
 was playing there on saturation only 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.810
 we will succeed in giving back punch to 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.890
 colors behind may at sion has face 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.890
 it becomes somewhat little touched 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.930
 saturation on the face and therefore suddenly 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.530
 we can not fortiori touched behind 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.900
 also there live is the good thing 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:55.630
 to do that then we do not have one 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.010
 has no option here to adjust on 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.870
 the sky or networks in particular 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.520
 it's a bit of a pity 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.440
 cvc to the limit what is missing at this 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.730
 software in addition to shooting and clarity 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.709
 yes the card is also the card and it's 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.220
 to others another option that is 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.169
 only present in lightroom 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.330
 in the media that I tested the 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.459
 next video and that's also missing at 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.680
 this one but anyway not present 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:35.319
 so to finish our little tour of alan 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:38.039
 has also been improved to the radius we see 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.090
 although it increases to note quantity 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.699
 was also but it also increases the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.910
 noise so very interesting option here 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.110
 the luminance noise can be removed 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.150
 it is precisely this noise that happens 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.410
 when you increase the sharpness that's 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.009
 really great because suddenly 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.500
 can enhance the sharpness all the time 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.720
 while avoiding having duped here soon 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.440
 made for seven software we will go from 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.440
 following the iphone
