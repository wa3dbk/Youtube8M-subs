00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
basic job as a tank is to do our normal

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.840 
basic job as a tank is to do our normal
stuff<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> dodge<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.770> bolts<00:00:59.039> when<00:00:59.550> they<00:00:59.640> come

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
stuff and dodge the bolts when they come

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.650 
stuff and dodge the bolts when they come
out<00:01:00.000> however<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.770> close<00:01:02.280> riffs<00:01:02.660> by

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
out however you can close riffs by

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.810 
out however you can close riffs by
stepping<00:01:04.019> onto<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> step<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
stepping onto them when you step on a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
stepping onto them when you step on a
rift<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.780> take<00:01:06.930> some<00:01:07.110> damage<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
rift you will take some damage and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.039 
rift you will take some damage and
you'll<00:01:08.189> gain<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> 60-second<00:01:09.090> debuff<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
you'll gain a 60-second debuff that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
you'll gain a 60-second debuff that
prevents<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.439> from<00:01:10.500> closing<00:01:10.920> future<00:01:11.400> rifts

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
prevents you from closing future rifts

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.510 
prevents you from closing future rifts
for<00:01:12.060> those<00:01:12.240> 60<00:01:12.630> seconds<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.830> forces<00:01:14.280> your

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
for those 60 seconds so it forces your

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.760 
for those 60 seconds so it forces your
entire<00:01:14.790> raid<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.240> basically<00:01:15.509> help<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
entire raid to basically help get the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.580 
entire raid to basically help get the
ribs<00:01:17.330> as<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> tank<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.530> using

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
ribs as a tank you're going to be using

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
ribs as a tank you're going to be using
two<00:01:19.890> tanks<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.369> fight<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
two tanks in this fight because of the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.170 
two tanks in this fight because of the
tank<00:01:21.990> swap<00:01:22.229> debuff<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.400> when<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.000> not

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
tank swap debuff so when you are not

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
tank swap debuff so when you are not
taking<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> boss<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:25.650> sure<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.040> run<00:01:26.280> around

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
taking the boss make sure you run around

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
taking the boss make sure you run around
to<00:01:26.820> pick<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.180> rift<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
to pick up a rift if you don't have a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100 
to pick up a rift if you don't have a
debuff<00:01:29.220> active<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.880> therefore<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.960> pick

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
debuff active and therefore you can pick

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.390 
debuff active and therefore you can pick
one<00:01:31.290> up

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.280 

another<00:01:35.400> big<00:01:35.640> consideration<00:01:35.940> for<00:01:36.540> tanks<00:01:37.050> is<00:01:37.230> a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
another big consideration for tanks is a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.950 
another big consideration for tanks is a
mechanic<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.100> exists<00:01:38.550> on<00:01:38.610> normal<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.930> as

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
mechanic that exists on normal but as

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.690 
mechanic that exists on normal but as
important<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.830> heroic<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.550> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
important on heroic which is the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.570 
important on heroic which is the
reflection<00:01:42.180> ads<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.890> course<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.250> spawn

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
reflection ads so of course these spawn

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.700 
reflection ads so of course these spawn
when<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.300> boss<00:01:45.450> uses<00:01:45.720> self<00:01:46.050> reflection<00:01:46.440> on

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
when the boss uses self reflection on

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.090 
when the boss uses self reflection on
the<00:01:46.800> raid<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:47.330> depending<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.570> raids

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the raid and depending on your raids

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.460 
the raid and depending on your raids
general<00:01:50.100> positions<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.880> decision<00:01:51.630> will

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
general positions and decision will

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.080 
general positions and decision will
dictate<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.950> course<00:01:53.130> where<00:01:53.370> they<00:01:53.520> spawn<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
dictate of course where they spawn and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.150 
dictate of course where they spawn and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
all that stuff as a tank you will not

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.520 
all that stuff as a tank you will not
often<00:02:42.269> need<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> tank<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.959> directly<00:02:43.320> because

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
often need to tank it directly because

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.370 
often need to tank it directly because
it<00:02:43.739> does<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:43.980> melee<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.000> speak<00:02:45.239> if<00:02:46.200> you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
it does not melee so to speak if you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.259 
it does not melee so to speak if you
silence<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.190> will<00:02:47.519> move<00:02:47.880> out<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.120> position

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
silence it it will move out of position

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.990 
silence it it will move out of position
so<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:49.140> drag<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:50.250> normal<00:02:50.790> tank

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
so you can drag it to the normal tank

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.210 
so you can drag it to the normal tank
position<00:02:51.420> if<00:02:51.600> needed<00:02:51.989> but<00:02:52.220> generally

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
position if needed but generally

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.000 
position if needed but generally
speaking<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.630> better<00:02:54.900> idea<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.560> your<00:02:55.620> DPS

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
speaking it's a better idea for your DPS

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.670 
speaking it's a better idea for your DPS
to<00:02:56.160> just<00:02:56.340> burn<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.640> down<00:02:56.670> quickly<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:58.049> as<00:02:58.500> long

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
to just burn it down quickly so as long

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.440 
to just burn it down quickly so as long

as your array does not require it you

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.479
