00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740 
tiny but that's like it's just so like
smooth<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.610> creamy<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
smooth and creamy that it just like

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.399 
smooth and creamy that it just like
glides<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:50.240> covers<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.810> well<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
glides and just covers like so well so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
glides and just covers like so well so
why<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:53.490> covers<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.450> i<00:01:54.479> mean

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
why not covers but you know what i mean

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.219 
why not covers but you know what i mean
and<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.070> eliminating<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.270> pretty

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and the eliminating one is pretty

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.929 
and the eliminating one is pretty
illuminating<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.460> isn't<00:01:59.700> really<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
illuminating but there isn't really a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.550 
illuminating but there isn't really a
difference<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.719> i'd<00:02:00.960> say<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
difference so i'd say get the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.709 
difference so i'd say get the
eliminating<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:03.270> they're<00:02:03.509> like

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
eliminating one because they're like

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539 
eliminating one because they're like
really<00:02:03.869> similar<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.560> i<00:02:04.619> love<00:02:04.920> illuminating

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
