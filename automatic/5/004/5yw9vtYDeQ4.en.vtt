00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.730
 released only on wii in 2008 the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.740
 first two blocks was a nice 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.320
 surprise that was coming out of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 beaten paths in front of this originality 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.430
 and some steam success 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.349
 thq the publisher decided to launch the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.789
 production of a suite that pays the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.350
 luxury to land also on 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.460
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.500
 this arrival on the hd consoles 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.300
 market does not change much except 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 maybe the graphics necessarily more 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.010
 end and so prettier the concept of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 this suite is therefore faithful to the first 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.140
 episode to know how to recolor a city that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.399
 lost his colors 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.800
 it was already the case in the first 2 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.149
 blob and the scenario a bit light we 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 ask to fight again the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.989
 black commander is quite determined to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.829
 take revenge after being made 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.629
 poorly treated in the first part it goes 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.979
 so you have to start exploring again 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.899
 to color the different buildings 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.179
 of the city without being 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.899
 stop by the forces of m kr the 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:12.690
 local police 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.310
 in addition to giving life back to all these 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.070
 actions also influences the music 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.509
 rather jazzy game his compositions 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.979
 musical becomes more and more 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.720
 rich with new notes that are 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.810
 added according to two strokes of 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810
 brush 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.869
 if we can let ourselves go and animate 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.280
 the game also requires to fill 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.380
 missions to advance the story 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.479
 when to paint a certain color or 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.069
 eliminate specific enemies before 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.009
 to focus on the related objectives 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.869
 that can boost the score there 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.250
 also has the 2d sequences that 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.170
 recalls the platform games of yesteryear 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.090
 of the 80s they are not 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.259
 necessarily very original but they have 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.289
 at least the merit of varying the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289
 pleasure 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.190
 a pleasure incidentally a little spoiled by 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.240
 the repetitiveness of the actions and the fact 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.860
 that this suite fits more 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.320
 as an update than a 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.320
 true after trying it nevertheless 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.840
