00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
you learned about hard and soft water in

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.410 
you learned about hard and soft water in
the<00:00:03.090> linked<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:03.799> environment<00:00:04.799> 22<00:00:05.400> now<00:00:06.359> you

the linked video environment 22 now you
will<00:00:06.839> see<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.529> two<00:00:07.770> principal<00:00:08.429> ways<00:00:08.460> to

will see the two principal ways to

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.509 
will see the two principal ways to
soften<00:00:09.240> hard<00:00:09.660> water<00:00:09.960> let's<00:00:10.740> start<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
soften hard water let's start with a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.410 
soften hard water let's start with a
soap<00:00:11.820> molecule<00:00:12.389> sodium<00:00:13.170> stearate

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.900 

difficult<00:00:19.750> to<00:00:19.900> use<00:00:20.080> soap<00:00:20.610> sodium<00:00:21.610> stearate

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
difficult to use soap sodium stearate

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.630 
difficult to use soap sodium stearate
with<00:00:22.840> hard<00:00:23.170> water<00:00:23.500> instead<00:00:24.369> you<00:00:24.700> get<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:24.910> scum

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
with hard water instead you get a scum

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.460 
with hard water instead you get a scum
if<00:00:27.640> you<00:00:27.790> keep<00:00:28.060> using<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.720> soap<00:00:28.990> the<00:00:29.230> water

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
if you keep using the soap the water

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.620 
if you keep using the soap the water
will<00:00:29.770> eventually<00:00:30.010> soften<00:00:30.820> as<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.420> soap

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
will eventually soften as the soap

the<00:02:27.700> calcium<00:02:28.180> ion<00:02:28.390> sort<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.750> stick<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.770> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the calcium ion sort of stick to the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.700 
the calcium ion sort of stick to the
clay<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.910> sodium<00:02:31.300> ions<00:02:31.690> come<00:02:32.230> out<00:02:32.380> into

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
clay and the sodium ions come out into

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.280 
clay and the sodium ions come out into
the<00:02:32.950> water<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:34.240> this<00:02:34.360> way<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.780> water<00:02:34.960> is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
the water and in this way the water is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.350 
the water and in this way the water is
softened<00:02:35.710> because<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.610> calcium<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.210> no

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
softened because the calcium is no

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.580 
softened because the calcium is no
longer<00:02:37.570> there<00:02:39.360> obviously<00:02:40.360> after<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.900> time<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
longer there obviously after a time the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.610 
longer there obviously after a time the
resin<00:02:41.980> gets<00:02:42.430> full<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.270> calcium<00:02:44.080> ions<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.560> you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
resin gets full of calcium ions and you

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.890 
resin gets full of calcium ions and you
have<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.950> reactivate<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.240> do<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.660> you

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
have to reactivate it and to do this you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.590 
have to reactivate it and to do this you
pour<00:02:47.430> concentrated<00:02:48.430> salt<00:02:48.760> solution<00:02:49.450> that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
pour concentrated salt solution that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.560 
pour concentrated salt solution that
sodium<00:02:50.190> chloride<00:02:51.190> solution<00:02:51.820> very<00:02:52.360> high

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
sodium chloride solution very high

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.990 
sodium chloride solution very high
concentration<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.100> it's<00:02:54.400> high<00:02:54.700> enough

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
concentration so that it's high enough

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.390 
concentration so that it's high enough
to<00:02:55.330> reverse<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.960> reaction<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:57.160> calcium

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
to reverse the reaction and the calcium

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.480 
to reverse the reaction and the calcium
chloride<00:02:57.850> comes<00:02:58.540> out<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:59.080> solution<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.860> the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
chloride comes out in solution and the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.540 
chloride comes out in solution and the
column<00:03:00.880> is<00:03:01.450> again<00:03:02.050> full<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.530> sodium<00:03:02.950> ions<00:03:03.310> and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
column is again full of sodium ions and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.800 
column is again full of sodium ions and
ready<00:03:03.880> for<00:03:04.000> use<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:06.030> compare<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.180> hardness<00:03:07.600> of
