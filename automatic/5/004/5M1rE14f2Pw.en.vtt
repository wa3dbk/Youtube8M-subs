 recommendation to be very close to the drivers this time, employment 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.270
 It's going to be, well, I think it's going to interest a lot of moms 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.380
 to all women especially who have children between 2 and 12 years old 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.720
 because hand surely when they put them to draw when they see that they make little house 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.170
 of the 1500 flowers you propose you love everything your children can be however 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.970
 maybe they have not thought that they totally reflect that they are a faithful reflection 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.730
 d in the mind of the child is therefore with others this time Carlos Aliaga 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.150
 enter irak 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.210
 we are not artists 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.309
 that's why this wonderful book that the drawings of 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.850
 These children have more luck because I stepped on your children or their children 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.310
 book lives 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.900
 of a French author or the very simple 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.820
 msc of fabric but as they recognized in france 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.510
 and throughout her and her years as a children's opera troupe she aido 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.390
 command collection we look at percent some drawings of their patients 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.700
 and compiled them in this admission that their measurement kneaded all color 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.960
 that puts us percent in each of these drawings 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.900
 explaining good we mentioned the name and the age of the child we explained a little the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 environment 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.120
 the clergy already of danger that then oriented to the parents bond 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.119
 even the same most glasses obviously also has teachers 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.240
 that even therapists 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.060
 that can take this as one as a base unnim an analysis in the primary 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.160
 that you can give them an idea of ​​seriousness itself, advisable to approach a 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.630
 therapist is not in any way and that is very important to comment is not 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.900
 in no time a step-by-step manual to turn us into therapy 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.190
 the interpreters of the drawings will last, but it may be that 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.340
 some drawing in mind in the similarity 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.380
 is what happens to your child already has what is required 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.659
 of a special help in this case hand I have here some who call me 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.690
 much attention for example we have alfonso of four and a half years here what 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.449
 we have 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.659
 and well it turns out that alfonso four and a half years 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.260
 he refuses to limit himself, someone asks him to ask him to draw and he 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.459
 presents a series of dotted lines 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.909
 and those lines are going 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.099
 and they are covering precisely these points and what happens with it is something very 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.909
 powerful efe belongs to the muslim Muslim religion but lives in a 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.169
 The country where you are choosing is not the one 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:40.819
 ee what in the summer is the largest moon and how is a shape is not recognized 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.330
 your mom has just returned home 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.520
 and then he 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.400
 do not do residents there he is presenting this problem is not found 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.330
 identifies us and can not be drawn from sortu and mud and three previous ones 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.780
 children well evidently the youngest are wolves at minute two years 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.539
 but even with boston near the months etc the eggs etc min 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.939
 it is very difficult for them to express soto from the word min then for them 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.539
 the form of expression more or of coves colt is the drawing other side the 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.159
 game 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.589
 precisely the 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.899
 min the book is oriented to one of these two deep forms of expression that 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.269
 With the drawing through the drawing the child will be able to take 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.089
 the all that your subconscious is carrying 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.439
 ntx the closest referent we have laps 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.150
 precisely at the time we believed 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.269
 these tests that are done to know if people are as they are 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.730
 lying but when you're going to have a job between the exams that you 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.450
 perform they infer also 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.049
 what in limoges 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.909
 I was maybe find when we are adults we forget these colors 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.480
 we forget these ways 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.359
 and we forget 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.829
 they have something a lot since when you're a good image of the way you 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:46.839
 extract the DNA 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:50.819
 a child still knowing what is what in what i draw in this way 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.349
 also their deficiencies for example there is having tea alexis for four years and 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.399
 medium too 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.530
 i hand alexis that your child here we have the one who came in then tied 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.750
 with obama unmarried then when the mom draws her family 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.470
 alexis and what he does is find his own family how many more because he is 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.780
 because the famous dads 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.790
 there it is because this is the love of the papa far away 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.199
 the one with the highest 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.989
 and there are all the ghosts all that is in the mind of a child 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.409
 son what can be shown i here 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.120
 today there is no halimi seños but the reality is that if it is interesting to be 

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:28.440
 near this book because we can also see 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.600
 the way you can identify with your sex there are children who do not know I was 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.919
 child I was little girl strawberry lovebirds 11 soles of the grandfather of child 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.930
 then you can verify 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.000
 including the understanding of issues such as divorce or death 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.310
 good book will act divided into chapters each of its chapters 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.590
 speaking precisely of each of these situations 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.040
 i and the truth is that the subjects you selected the drawings that you injured 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.710
 to the author are as the most complicated though to one of his rare cases after him 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.139
 It is a book that does not stay because it does not go up 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.900
 one puts us cases sometimes very critical one 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.360
 drawings some 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.500
 which is that they can even scare nothing and that is that 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.840
 many issues is this adultery 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.560
 is this identification this percent and the way of reproduction by 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.670
 example, the secrets parents have for him, so he's parents if 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.979
 you know I did in a way in which a child then draw 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.590
 totally gray for equines that reach 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.360
 to see totally gray a tree and this is because on Monday in Bogota to have 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.229
 secrets this very interesting I believe and in the recommendation for all of you 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.509
 by the way is that if they have small children but in this book because 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.530
 surely pass a reference more than of course I wanted to say no no 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.669
 I will not try to replace a surprise control to the allegations of the 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.530
 defenses to know as well as other accounts 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.340
 we do not have a full house to pay external debt 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.380
 pear of human tultepec we make fun of every tom boere actor to date but 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.879
 also the very magical will aggravate because it goes again 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.550
 for the debate between the camera and this week we will have a very bad time
