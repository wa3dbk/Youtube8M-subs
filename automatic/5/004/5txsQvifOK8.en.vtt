my<00:01:52.420> pot<00:01:52.630> here<00:01:52.899> I'm<00:01:53.049> warming<00:01:53.380> up<00:01:53.499> two<00:01:53.829> and

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
my pot here I'm warming up two and

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
creamer the toffee almond that I'm using

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.190 
creamer the toffee almond that I'm using
today<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.639> hope<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.329> makes<00:02:01.479> sense<00:02:01.600> it's<00:02:02.020> just

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
today I hope that makes sense it's just

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.989 
today I hope that makes sense it's just
a<00:02:02.289> sugar<00:02:02.529> substitution<00:02:03.249> and<00:02:03.429> just<00:02:03.579> keeping

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
a sugar substitution and just keeping

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.179 
a sugar substitution and just keeping
that<00:02:04.149> liquid<00:02:04.569> amount<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.929> same<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.920> now<00:02:06.039> my

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
that liquid amount the same so now my

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.620 
that liquid amount the same so now my
gelatin<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.700> bloom<00:02:06.939> this<00:02:07.149> usually<00:02:07.420> takes

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
gelatin is bloom this usually takes

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.999 
gelatin is bloom this usually takes
about<00:02:07.749> a<00:02:07.869> minute<00:02:08.110> or<00:02:08.319> two<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.800> will<00:02:08.890> make

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
about a minute or two you just will make

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.469 
about a minute or two you just will make
sure<00:02:09.099> that<00:02:09.250> there's<00:02:09.429> no<00:02:09.520> powdery<00:02:09.940> substance

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
sure that there's no powdery substance

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.140 
sure that there's no powdery substance
in<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:10.630> all<00:02:11.170> i've<00:02:11.470> done<00:02:11.500> here<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:12.069> warmed<00:02:12.819> my

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
in it all i've done here is warmed my

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.370 
in it all i've done here is warmed my
liquid<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.690> don't<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:13.990> bring<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.349> a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
liquid you don't have to bring it to a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.690 
liquid you don't have to bring it to a
boil<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.890> don't<00:02:15.070> have<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.280> test<00:02:15.520> for

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
boil you don't have to test for

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.640 
boil you don't have to test for
temperature<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.450> just<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.870> easy<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.620> just

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
temperature it's just that easy you just

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.050 
temperature it's just that easy you just
warm<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.550> I'm<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.730> going<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.940> go<00:02:19.000> ahead

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
warm it so I'm just going to go ahead

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.790 
warm it so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:02:19.240> shut<00:02:19.450> that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
and shut that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.680 
and shut that
eat<00:02:19.890> off<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.490> just<00:02:20.670> go<00:02:20.820> ahead<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.060> dump<00:02:21.480> all

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
eat off and just go ahead and dump all

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.800 
eat off and just go ahead and dump all
of<00:02:21.750> my<00:02:22.080> gelatin<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.160> stir<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.610> that's<00:02:24.240> it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
of my gelatin in and stir it that's it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.230 
of my gelatin in and stir it that's it
so<00:02:25.440> there's<00:02:25.980> nothing<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.550> get<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.060> know

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
so there's nothing to get to know

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.790 
so there's nothing to get to know
temperature<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.960> test<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.410> no

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
temperature you have to test for no

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.020 
temperature you have to test for no
sugar<00:02:29.100> added<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> matter<00:02:29.940> of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
sugar added it's just a matter of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.300 
sugar added it's just a matter of
stirring<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.540> gelatin<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.950> now<00:02:32.100> let's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
stirring that gelatin in so now let's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.740 
stirring that gelatin in so now let's
talk<00:02:32.460> about<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.820> vessel<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.630> to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
talk about the vessel that is going to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.820 
talk about the vessel that is going to
go<00:02:33.840> into<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.140> needs<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.500> chill<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
go into it needs to chill in the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
there about three quarters of the way

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.140 
there about three quarters of the way
full<00:03:01.370> from<00:03:02.370> here<00:03:02.550> it's<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.910> go<00:03:02.970> right

full from here it's going to go right
into<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.480> refrigerator<00:03:03.830> about<00:03:04.830> four<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.220> six

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250

hours<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.850> set<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.330> you're<00:03:06.450> going<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.630> get<00:03:06.720> a

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
hours to set and you're going to get a

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.960 
hours to set and you're going to get a
nice<00:03:07.020> firm<00:03:07.410> texture<00:03:07.860> now<00:03:08.430> what<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.700> would<00:03:08.820> do

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
nice firm texture now what you would do

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.030 
nice firm texture now what you would do
is<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.480> run<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.810> knife<00:03:10.050> around<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.530> edge<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
is just run a knife around the edge and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.340 
is just run a knife around the edge and
then<00:03:11.280> dump<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.730> out<00:03:11.910> onto<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> really<00:03:13.020> pretty

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
then dump it out onto a really pretty

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.220 
then dump it out onto a really pretty
plate<00:03:13.680> garnish<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.700> with<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.850> sauce<00:03:15.230> typically

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
plate garnish it with a sauce typically

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.630 
plate garnish it with a sauce typically
you<00:03:16.380> might<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:16.710> a<00:03:16.740> caramel<00:03:17.190> sauce<00:03:17.400> or

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
you might see a caramel sauce or

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.800 
you might see a caramel sauce or
strawberry<00:03:18.030> sauce<00:03:18.240> something<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.660> that

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
strawberry sauce something like that

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.750 
strawberry sauce something like that
here<00:03:19.320> because<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.680> have<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> toffee<00:03:20.430> almond

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
here because I have the toffee almond

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.220 
here because I have the toffee almond
flavor<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.180> there<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.660> dusted<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.170> with

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
flavor in there I just dusted it with

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.480 
flavor in there I just dusted it with
some<00:03:22.440> toasted<00:03:22.590> almonds<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.220> think<00:03:23.370> that's

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
some toasted almonds and I think that's

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.220 
some toasted almonds and I think that's
going<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:23.910> really<00:03:24.030> delicious<00:03:24.330> you

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.949 
going to be really really delicious you
can<00:03:25.380> also<00:03:25.590> use<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:26.430> dish<00:03:27.209> that's<00:03:27.239> shaped<00:03:27.840> like

can also use a dish that's shaped like
this<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.650> kind<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.310> same<00:03:29.489> kind<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.940> a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
this it's kind of the same kind of a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.180 
this it's kind of the same kind of a
vessel<00:03:30.330> as<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> custard<00:03:31.050> dish<00:03:31.290> also<00:03:31.739> really

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
vessel as a custard dish also really

vessel as a custard dish also really
pretty<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.550> something<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:32.940> martini<00:03:33.209> glass

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
pretty is something like a martini glass

pretty is something like a martini glass
this<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> really<00:03:34.500> great<00:03:34.590> look<00:03:34.830> as<00:03:34.980> well<00:03:35.160> with

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
this is a really great look as well with

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.340 
this is a really great look as well with
these<00:03:35.880> two<00:03:36.209> because<00:03:36.660> you're<00:03:36.780> not<00:03:36.870> turning<00:03:37.110> it

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
these two because you're not turning it

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.650 
these two because you're not turning it
out<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.800> type<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.220> vessel<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:39.030> doesn't

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
out of this type of vessel it doesn't

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.020 
out of this type of vessel it doesn't
take<00:03:39.840> as<00:03:39.959> long<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.200> set<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.770> could<00:03:40.920> maybe<00:03:41.280> do

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
take as long to set you could maybe do

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.190 
take as long to set you could maybe do
it<00:03:42.060> at<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.300> start<00:03:42.510> when<00:03:42.810> you're<00:03:42.930> making

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.170 
it at the start when you're making
dinner<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.590> two<00:03:43.920> hours<00:03:44.220> later<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:44.790> ready<00:03:45.060> to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
dinner and two hours later it's ready to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.120 
dinner and two hours later it's ready to
eat<00:03:45.209> right<00:03:45.570> out<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.900> vessel<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.920> that's

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
eat right out of this vessel so that's

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.040
