00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.990
 hello how are we the bus bessoni and 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.780
 this is the fcc 700 camera 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.440
 practically the most sought after in everything in 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.290
 the whole show this camera like you 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.660
 you know and we mentioned it in the in the post 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.170
 is the successor of the fcc 100 is a 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 camera that has a sensor 4 of 4 here 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.699
 in the near future you can record in 4k a 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.610
 through an external recorder in a 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.230
 sensor very similar but very similar in 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.920
 how much in terms of size is a sensor 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.519
 super 35 millimeters but coming soon 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.500
 you can record at 4k and also have output 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.200
 in red with a recorder that sony 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.810
 will soon be launching to the market 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.060
 the differences of this camera against the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.590
 fcc 100 is obviously the sensor is a 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.920
 new serious sensor in the same format 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.860
 in abc hd it has sd output and in the part 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.229
 in the part of here back 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.580
 as you can see unlike 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.260
 class 100 this one has hd sdi output 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.790
 it has a good handle in this case 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.030
 has has a 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.910
 special but brings a support handle 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.550
 much more robust has nd integrated 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.590
 has three levels of dn of the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.810
 construction is a bit more robust and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.710
 it will surely be one of the most 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.890
 popular in this year for those who want 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.470
 produce in a high segment and that 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.510
 obviously he wants to protect his 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.300
 investment since being prepared for 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.890
 filming in 4k will not give you many 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.310
 advantages in the sense that in the future 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.560
 when they require 4k the camera is going to 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.920
 will be able to deliver tell us more or 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.280
 less time for availability 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.070
 it's about June July more or less 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.430
 then in practically we are 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.920
 talking about a couple of months before 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.420
 the camera goes to the market we were already 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.270
 playing with them producing some 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.120
 some tests and the truth is that yes 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.390
 it's pretty tempting and it's a 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.730
 excellent camera then that's the fce 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.730
 700 of sony
