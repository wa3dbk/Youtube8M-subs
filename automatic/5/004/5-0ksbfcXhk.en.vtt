they can be more specifically the
problem<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.230> human<00:00:52.649> embryonic<00:00:52.920> stem

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
problem is is that human embryonic stem

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.479 
problem is is that human embryonic stem
cell<00:00:53.460> research<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.930> three<00:00:54.930> problems<00:00:55.340> one<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
cell research has three problems one of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
cell research has three problems one of
them<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> research<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.629> unethical<00:00:57.930> it's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
them is the research is unethical it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.340 
them is the research is unethical it's
unethical<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.660> embryos<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.930> living

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
unethical because embryos are living

human<00:01:01.980> beings<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> research<00:01:03.420> knowingly

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
human beings in this research knowingly

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.460 
human beings in this research knowingly
leads<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.040> their<00:01:05.250> injury<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.820> their<00:01:05.970> death

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
leads to their injury and their death

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
leads to their injury and their death
the<00:01:07.470> second<00:01:07.799> reason<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.220> because<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the second reason is because the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.469 
the second reason is because the
research<00:01:10.110> has<00:01:10.350> proposes<00:01:11.340> illegal<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
research has proposes illegal we have a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
research has proposes illegal we have a
law<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.200> country<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.770> says<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.340> type

law in this country that says this type
of<00:01:14.580> research<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.750> leads<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.229> such<00:01:16.409> injuries

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
of research which leads to such injuries

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
of research which leads to such injuries
to<00:01:17.040> human<00:01:17.400> research<00:01:17.880> subjects<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> illegal

and the third thing is that the public

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990 
and the third thing is that the public
needs<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> understand<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.490> absence

pursuing it so this is not a ban or an
ending<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:28.110> basically<00:02:28.650> saying<00:02:28.920> we're<00:02:29.100> going

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
ending it's basically saying we're going

to buy any cures that develop from
overseas<00:02:31.650> most<00:02:32.340> importantly<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.660> compromise

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
overseas most importantly the compromise

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.230 
overseas most importantly the compromise
we<00:02:34.560> reached<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.190> country<00:02:35.640> was<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.850> use

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
we reached in this country was to use

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.720 
we reached in this country was to use
embryo<00:02:36.810> stored<00:02:37.380> at<00:02:37.590> infertility<00:02:38.160> clinics

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
embryo stored at infertility clinics

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.610 
embryo stored at infertility clinics
that<00:02:38.880> were<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.630> be<00:02:39.810> destroyed<00:02:40.410> anyway

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
that were going to be destroyed anyway

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860 
that were going to be destroyed anyway
so<00:02:41.430> we're<00:02:41.610> not<00:02:41.760> encouraging<00:02:42.300> embryo

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
so we're not encouraging embryo

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.960 
so we're not encouraging embryo
destruction<00:02:43.530> we're<00:02:43.980> taking<00:02:44.489> advantage<00:02:44.580> of

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
destruction we're taking advantage of

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.400 
destruction we're taking advantage of
the<00:02:45.060> fact<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.630> have<00:02:45.840> hundreds<00:02:46.320> of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the fact that we have hundreds of

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.710 
the fact that we have hundreds of
thousands<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.040> embryos<00:02:47.459> fated<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.480> be

thousands of embryos fated to be

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.960 
thousands of embryos fated to be

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.970 
destroyed some of which would be donated

for research that seems to me to be the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.250

sound public policy doctor shortly if

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.780 
sound public policy doctor shortly if
that's<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.620> case<00:02:55.800> these<00:02:56.100> embryos<00:02:56.400> were<00:02:56.640> going

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that's the case these embryos were going

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.000 
that's the case these embryos were going
to<00:02:56.850> be<00:02:57.300> discarded<00:02:57.750> anyway<00:02:58.170> would<00:02:58.620> would<00:02:58.980> that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
to be discarded anyway would would that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.120 
to be discarded anyway would would that
be<00:02:59.250> okay<00:02:59.459> with<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.590> isn't<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.650> case<00:03:01.860> and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
be okay with you that isn't the case and

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.590 
be okay with you that isn't the case and
I<00:03:02.190> think<00:03:02.400> what<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.610> public<00:03:02.730> needs<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.090> hear<00:03:03.450> is

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
I think what the public needs to hear is

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.780 
I think what the public needs to hear is
that<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.870> statement<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.550> that

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
that this statement and this one that

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.580 
that this statement and this one that
people<00:03:05.940> resonate<00:03:06.570> with<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:07.050> they<00:03:07.200> hear

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
people resonate with because they hear

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.660 
people resonate with because they hear
well<00:03:07.920> they're<00:03:08.100> going<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.400> thrown<00:03:08.640> away

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
well they're going to be thrown away

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.790 
well they're going to be thrown away
anyway<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.290> didn't<00:03:10.500> throw<00:03:10.620> them<00:03:10.680> away

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
anyway and if we didn't throw them away

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.680 
anyway and if we didn't throw them away
we<00:03:11.010> get<00:03:11.160> these<00:03:11.310> great<00:03:11.550> cures<00:03:11.940> from<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.269> that's

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
we get these great cures from a that's

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.350 
we get these great cures from a that's
the<00:03:12.900> big<00:03:13.170> misconception<00:03:13.980> they're<00:03:14.850> been

no<00:03:32.519> one<00:03:32.730> said<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.090> even<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.630> 11,000<00:03:34.470> are

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
no one said that even that 11,000 are

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.199 
no one said that even that 11,000 are
going<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.890> available<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.579> I<00:03:35.610> think<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:36.120> a

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
going to be available so I think it's a

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.240 
going to be available so I think it's a
myth<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.870> there's<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.440> many<00:03:37.590> available<00:03:37.860> and

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
myth that there's so many available and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.280 
myth that there's so many available and
I<00:03:38.340> would<00:03:38.489> also<00:03:38.640> put<00:03:39.000> four<00:03:39.239> since<00:03:39.870> they<00:03:40.049> are

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
I would also put four since they are

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.699 
I would also put four since they are
