look at how this double move creates a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.610 
look at how this double move creates a
touchdown<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> that's<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.200> happens

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
touchdown and that's really what happens

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.080 
touchdown and that's really what happens
in<00:00:37.739> real<00:00:37.920> life<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.610> talk<00:00:38.790> about<00:00:38.820> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
my route so he gets turned around we'll

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.870 
my route so he gets turned around we'll
play<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.799> from<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> other<00:01:35.250> side

mirrors the wide receivers route and
this<00:02:09.479> game<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:09.899> does<00:02:10.229> give<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.769> feel

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
route on the fly just not simply

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.539 
route on the fly just not simply
mirroring<00:02:15.540> what<00:02:15.569> I'm<00:02:15.870> doing<00:02:16.260> out<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.280> box

mirroring what I'm doing out of the box
program<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.780> way<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.500> final<00:02:19.739> thing<00:02:19.950> is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
program that way and one final thing is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.360 
program that way and one final thing is
the<00:02:21.090> adjustment<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.500> wide<00:02:22.980> receiver

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
the adjustment that the wide receiver

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.160 
the adjustment that the wide receiver
makes<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:24.030> bowl<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.569> Madden<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> lot<00:02:25.049> of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
makes on this bowl and Madden a lot of

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.710 
makes on this bowl and Madden a lot of
times<00:02:25.380> you'd<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.860> speed<00:02:26.280> burst<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:27.120> or

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
times you'd see a speed burst or or

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.539 
times you'd see a speed burst or or
something<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.230> effect<00:02:28.680> or<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.860> ball<00:02:29.130> shift

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
something to that effect or a ball shift

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.100 
something to that effect or a ball shift
for<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.239> ball<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.569> be<00:02:30.690> caught<00:02:30.930> it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
for this ball to be caught it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.870 
for this ball to be caught it
essentially<00:02:31.650> what<00:02:31.769> should<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.280> be<00:02:32.489> an<00:02:32.610> easy

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
essentially what should just be an easy

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.270 
essentially what should just be an easy
catch<00:02:33.209> really<00:02:33.690> isn't<00:02:34.110> because<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.010> ball<00:02:35.250> is

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
catch really isn't because the ball is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.970 
catch really isn't because the ball is
thrown<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> little<00:02:36.180> bit<00:02:36.420> behind<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.799> can

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
thrown a little bit behind and you can

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.100 
thrown a little bit behind and you can
see<00:02:38.160> here<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.030> body<00:02:39.299> adjustment<00:02:40.019> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
see here the body adjustment the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.259 
see here the body adjustment the
position<00:02:40.620> adjustment<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.670> chad<00:02:41.910> has<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
position adjustment that chad has to

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.199 
position adjustment that chad has to
make<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.569> slowest<00:02:43.079> body<00:02:43.349> down<00:02:43.970> reach<00:02:44.970> his

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
make the slowest body down reach his

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.300 
make the slowest body down reach his
hands<00:02:45.510> out<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.019> kind<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.319> stumble<00:02:46.859> almost

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
hands out and kind of stumble almost

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.400 
hands out and kind of stumble almost
into<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> end<00:02:48.390> zone<00:02:48.480> we'll<00:02:48.930> play<00:02:49.049> this<00:02:49.230> from

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
into the end zone we'll play this from

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.500 
into the end zone we'll play this from
the<00:02:49.530> other<00:02:49.650> side<00:02:49.920> get<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.819> better<00:02:50.970> look<00:02:51.060> at<00:02:51.359> it

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the other side get a better look at it

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.319 
the other side get a better look at it
and<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.440> me<00:02:52.590> really<00:02:52.890> does<00:02:53.250> show<00:02:53.670> at<00:02:54.060> least

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
and this to me really does show at least

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.880 
and this to me really does show at least
from<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.630> quarterback<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.350> wide<00:02:55.410> receiver

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
from a quarterback and wide receiver

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.920 
from a quarterback and wide receiver
perspective<00:02:56.549> how<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.180> game<00:02:57.329> emulates

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
perspective how this game emulates

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.830 
perspective how this game emulates
football<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.769> whole<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.579> regards<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.720> these

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
football as a whole in regards to these

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.559 
football as a whole in regards to these
two<00:03:01.079> positions<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.739> lot<00:03:01.920> better<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.569> smoother

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
two positions a lot better and smoother

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.199 
two positions a lot better and smoother
and<00:03:03.720> again<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.139> don't<00:03:04.319> see<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:05.100> defensive<00:03:06.030> back

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
and again you don't see a defensive back

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.170 
and again you don't see a defensive back
