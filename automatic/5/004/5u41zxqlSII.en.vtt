00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
up a piece of it well that got me to

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.349 
up a piece of it well that got me to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
thinking what would what would it take

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.620

to<00:00:24.660> build<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.170> conventional<00:00:25.430> firework<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:27.180> get

to build a conventional firework to get

to build a conventional firework to get
it<00:00:27.779> into<00:00:27.930> space<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.500> even<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:29.250> orbit<00:00:29.789> well<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
it into space or even to orbit well it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.990 
it into space or even to orbit well it
turns<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.170> most<00:00:31.619> rockets<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.460> are<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
turns out that most rockets that are you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
turns out that most rockets that are you
buy<00:00:33.180> from<00:00:33.510> stores<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.230> whatever<00:00:34.500> were<00:00:35.219> are

rocket<00:00:45.149> comes<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:46.200> about<00:00:46.500> 80<00:00:47.039> seconds<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
rocket comes to about 80 seconds and you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.779 
rocket comes to about 80 seconds and you
have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> compare<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.500> against<00:00:50.010> many<00:00:50.550> other

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
have to compare that against many other

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.670 
have to compare that against many other
rocket<00:00:51.210> engines<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.379> around

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
rocket engines are that are up around

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.840 
rocket engines are that are up around
you<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:53.059> 280<00:00:54.199> 300<00:00:55.199> 400<00:00:56.010> even<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> high

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
you know 280 300 400 even at the high

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
you know 280 300 400 even at the high
end<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.600> these<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.930> hugely<00:00:58.559> inefficient

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
end so these are hugely inefficient

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
end so these are hugely inefficient
rockets<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.719> there's<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:00.989> enough<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> know

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
rockets but there's not enough to know

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.799 
rockets but there's not enough to know
just<00:01:02.250> about<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.670> efficiency<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> fuel

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
just about the efficiency of the fuel

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.240 
just about the efficiency of the fuel
you<00:01:03.960> need<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.199> think<00:01:04.409> about<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> construction

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you need to think about the construction

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.880 
you need to think about the construction
the<00:01:05.549> paper<00:01:05.790> casing<00:01:06.299> what<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> adds<00:01:06.869> now<00:01:07.590> most

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the paper casing what it adds now most

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
the paper casing what it adds now most
rockets<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.700> would<00:01:08.850> buy<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.090> fireworks

orbital velocities so if you take the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.999 
orbital velocities so if you take the

largest model rocket motor that you can

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.730

grams so you plug those numbers in and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.440 
grams so you plug those numbers in and
you<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> specific<00:01:49.860> impulse<00:01:50.520> bordering<00:01:51.270> on

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
the physics goes a little strange and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.500 
the physics goes a little strange and
quite<00:02:54.810> spectacularly<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.370> got<00:02:56.640> my<00:02:56.820> own<00:02:57.000> form

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
to me it feels as if as the part number

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.310 
to me it feels as if as the part number
grows<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.510> physics<00:03:15.900> gets<00:03:16.140> more

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
grows and the physics gets more

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.440 
grows and the physics gets more
complicated<00:03:16.740> at<00:03:17.190> some<00:03:17.400> point<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.880> time<00:03:18.120> step

complicated at some point the time step

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.480 
complicated at some point the time step
gets<00:03:18.750> too<00:03:19.050> big<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.890> whole<00:03:20.040> thing<00:03:20.280> just

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
gets too big and the whole thing just

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.300 
gets too big and the whole thing just
gives<00:03:20.880> up<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.690> get<00:03:21.810> instability<00:03:22.560> anyway

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
gives up and you get instability anyway

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.490 
gives up and you get instability anyway
this<00:03:23.400> was<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> second<00:03:24.180> one<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.390> attempted<00:03:25.020> or

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
this was a second one I attempted or

this was another one I attempted you see

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.250 
this was another one I attempted you see

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.280 
to try and make it it just it is it is
incredibly<00:03:37.320> bizarre<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.280> funny<00:03:38.550> also

incredibly bizarre and funny also

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.140 
incredibly bizarre and funny also
interesting<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.320> note<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.580> part

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
interesting to note is that the part

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.420 
interesting to note is that the part
values<00:03:42.780> or<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.140> thrust<00:03:43.440> values<00:03:43.920> for<00:03:44.220> set

so the initial version of SEPA Tron's

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.420 
so the initial version of SEPA Tron's
had<00:03:48.720> higher<00:03:49.020> thrust<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.740> they<00:03:49.860> burned<00:03:50.130> for

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
had higher thrust and they burned for

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.070 
had higher thrust and they burned for
longer<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.000> their<00:03:51.210> dry<00:03:51.540> mass<00:03:51.840> their

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
longer but their dry mass their

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.160 
longer but their dry mass their
emptiness<00:03:52.500> was<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.280> lot<00:03:53.640> me<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:54.060> higher<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:55.050> they

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
emptiness was a lot me a higher so they

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.680 
emptiness was a lot me a higher so they
were<00:03:55.260> less<00:03:55.500> efficient<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:57.090> yeah<00:03:57.270> many

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
were less efficient so yeah many

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.220 
were less efficient so yeah many

anyway<00:04:04.230> this<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.710> what<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.220> came<00:04:05.580> up<00:04:05.790> with<00:04:05.820> you

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
anyway this is what I came up with you

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.320 
anyway this is what I came up with you
see<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.690> using<00:04:07.350> its<00:04:08.310> using<00:04:08.610> these<00:04:08.730> futile<00:04:09.210> eyes

you<00:04:09.690> know<00:04:09.840> width<00:04:10.110> adaptor<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:10.950> can<00:04:11.160> build

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
you know width adaptor so I can build

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.300 
you know width adaptor so I can build

SEPA Tron's

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.890 
SEPA Tron's
also<00:04:16.380> I'm<00:04:16.590> using<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.520> tweakable<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.690> make

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
also I'm using the tweakable to make

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.870 
also I'm using the tweakable to make
these<00:04:19.140> things<00:04:19.440> burn<00:04:19.799> at<00:04:20.040> different<00:04:20.400> rates<00:04:20.669> so

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
these things burn at different rates so

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.790 
these things burn at different rates so
that<00:04:21.060> I'm<00:04:21.150> trying<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.510> keep<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:22.109> thrust<00:04:22.440> early

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
that I'm trying to keep the thrust early

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.310 
that I'm trying to keep the thrust early
on<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:22.950> have<00:04:23.280> like<00:04:23.490> four<00:04:24.150> G's<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.600> thrust<00:04:24.960> but

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
on I have like four G's of thrust but

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.500 
on I have like four G's of thrust but
then<00:04:25.440> after<00:04:25.890> I<00:04:25.920> get<00:04:26.010> up<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.460> about<00:04:26.550> 120<00:04:27.420> meters

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
then after I get up to about 120 meters

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.110 
then after I get up to about 120 meters
per<00:04:27.810> second<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.680> thrust<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.220> dropping<00:04:29.640> off<00:04:29.820> in

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
per second the thrust is dropping off in

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.460 
per second the thrust is dropping off in
each<00:04:30.540> stage<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.260> about<00:04:31.610> 2g<00:04:32.720> because<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.990> really

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
each stage to about 2g because I really

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.950 
each stage to about 2g because I really
want<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.830> avoid<00:04:34.970> aerodynamic<00:04:35.970> losses<00:04:36.480> so<00:04:36.720> I'm

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
want to avoid aerodynamic losses so I'm

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.960 
want to avoid aerodynamic losses so I'm
being<00:04:37.170> very<00:04:37.380> careful<00:04:37.680> here<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.310> see<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.820> is

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
being very careful here you see this is

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.910 
being very careful here you see this is
the<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.420> bottom<00:04:39.810> stage<00:04:40.110> there<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:40.410> gonna<00:04:40.620> burn

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
the the bottom stage there is gonna burn

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.860 
the the bottom stage there is gonna burn
out<00:04:41.070> sooner<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.700> will<00:04:41.910> bring<00:04:42.240> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
out sooner and that will bring the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.260 
out sooner and that will bring the
thrust<00:04:43.290> down<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.100> therefore<00:04:44.790> stop<00:04:45.060> me

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
thrust down and therefore stop me

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.540 
thrust down and therefore stop me
wasting<00:04:45.750> tons<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.350> energy<00:04:46.710> fighting<00:04:46.980> against

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
wasting tons of energy fighting against

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.480 
wasting tons of energy fighting against
aerodynamic<00:04:48.300> drag<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.410> also<00:04:49.890> had<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.160> bunch

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
aerodynamic drag the I also had a bunch

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.180 
aerodynamic drag the I also had a bunch
of<00:04:50.790> stuff<00:04:51.090> earlier<00:04:51.600> that<00:04:52.080> was<00:04:52.230> entirely<00:04:52.680> there

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
of stuff earlier that was entirely there

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.820 
of stuff earlier that was entirely there
to<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> get<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.660> thing<00:04:54.840> up<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.380> about<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.650> hundred

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
to a get the thing up to about a hundred

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.280 
to a get the thing up to about a hundred
meters<00:04:56.130> per<00:04:56.460> second<00:04:56.820> as<00:04:57.000> quickly<00:04:57.270> as<00:04:57.540> possible

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
meters per second as quickly as possible

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.770 
meters per second as quickly as possible
so<00:04:58.890> this<00:04:59.040> actually<00:04:59.190> has<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.640> surprisingly<00:05:00.390> few

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
so this actually has a surprisingly few

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.600 
so this actually has a surprisingly few
number<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.230> stages<00:05:01.530> simply<00:05:01.950> because<00:05:02.400> we're

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
number of stages simply because we're

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.450 
number of stages simply because we're
using<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.380> we're<00:05:04.380> using<00:05:04.530> tweakable<00:05:05.070> z--<00:05:05.220> to

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
using the we're using tweakable z-- to

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.660 
using the we're using tweakable z-- to
reduce<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.090> thrust<00:05:06.420> no<00:05:07.410> specific<00:05:08.010> impulse<00:05:08.430> on

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
reduce the thrust no specific impulse on

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.570 
reduce the thrust no specific impulse on
SEPA<00:05:09.270> Tron's<00:05:09.630> is<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:10.260> about<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.740> hundred<00:05:11.190> seconds

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
SEPA Tron's is a about a hundred seconds

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.790 
SEPA Tron's is a about a hundred seconds
which<00:05:11.760> makes<00:05:11.970> them<00:05:12.210> really<00:05:12.600> really<00:05:13.020> terrible

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
which makes them really really terrible

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.360 
which makes them really really terrible
for<00:05:14.280> any<00:05:14.640> Kerbal<00:05:15.330> rocket<00:05:15.780> but<00:05:16.440> actually<00:05:17.190> it

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
for any Kerbal rocket but actually it

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.480 
for any Kerbal rocket but actually it
makes<00:05:17.640> them<00:05:17.940> better<00:05:18.240> than<00:05:18.750> your<00:05:19.380> small<00:05:20.040> mortal

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
makes them better than your small mortal

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.770 
makes them better than your small mortal
rockets<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.000> was<00:05:21.120> talking<00:05:21.450> about<00:05:21.480> earlier

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
rockets I was talking about earlier

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.650 
rockets I was talking about earlier
however<00:05:22.620> they're<00:05:23.280> not<00:05:23.550> actually<00:05:24.150> as<00:05:24.270> good<00:05:24.510> as

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
however they're not actually as good as

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.350 
however they're not actually as good as
the<00:05:24.930> nearest<00:05:25.260> real-world<00:05:25.740> equivalent<00:05:26.360> the

the nearest real-world equivalent the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.030 
the nearest real-world equivalent the
nearest<00:05:27.660> real-world<00:05:28.380> equivalent<00:05:28.680> yeah

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
nearest real-world equivalent yeah

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.670 
nearest real-world equivalent yeah
remember<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.610> mentioned<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:30.320> model<00:05:31.320> rocket

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
remember I mentioned that model rocket

weird<00:05:49.350> physics<00:05:49.740> going<00:05:49.920> on<00:05:50.160> in<00:05:50.310> this<00:05:50.430> stage

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
weird physics going on in this stage

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.110 
weird physics going on in this stage
incidentally<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:53.250> these<00:05:53.400> would<00:05:53.700> actually<00:05:54.000> be

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
incidentally so these would actually be

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.070 
incidentally so these would actually be
classified<00:05:54.690> as<00:05:54.960> class<00:05:55.590> P<00:05:56.130> which<00:05:56.520> I've<00:05:56.760> seen

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
classified as class P which I've seen

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.290 
classified as class P which I've seen
mentions<00:05:58.080> off<00:05:58.290> in<00:05:58.530> a<00:05:58.650> few<00:05:58.830> cases<00:05:59.300> somebody

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
mentions off in a few cases somebody

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.360 
mentions off in a few cases somebody
built<00:06:00.600> a<00:06:00.780> model<00:06:01.080> Saturn<00:06:01.680> 5<00:06:01.950> which<00:06:02.220> is

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
built a model Saturn 5 which is

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.610 
built a model Saturn 5 which is
supposedly<00:06:02.760> the<00:06:03.180> biggest<00:06:03.600> model<00:06:04.140> rocket<00:06:04.500> ever

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
supposedly the biggest model rocket ever

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.430 
supposedly the biggest model rocket ever
and<00:06:04.860> it<00:06:04.920> included<00:06:05.310> a<00:06:05.400> single<00:06:05.670> class<00:06:06.570> P<00:06:07.020> plus

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
and it included a single class P plus

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.120 
and it included a single class P plus
like<00:06:08.130> eight<00:06:08.370> other<00:06:08.580> class<00:06:09.030> all<00:06:09.330> rockets<00:06:10.130> so

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
like eight other class all rockets so

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.810 
like eight other class all rockets so
yeah<00:06:11.370> we're<00:06:11.580> getting<00:06:11.850> small<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.780> light<00:06:12.990> now

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
yeah we're getting small and light now

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.620 
yeah we're getting small and light now
interesting<00:06:14.820> thing<00:06:15.060> I<00:06:15.210> also<00:06:15.360> should<00:06:15.570> point

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
interesting thing I also should point

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.620 
interesting thing I also should point
out<00:06:15.990> this<00:06:16.530> is<00:06:16.590> all<00:06:16.890> recorded<00:06:17.580> using<00:06:18.210> cheat

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
out this is all recorded using cheat

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.280 
out this is all recorded using cheat
engine<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:19.290> slow<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:20.400> tick<00:06:21.060> down<00:06:21.510> by<00:06:21.780> a<00:06:21.810> factor

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
engine to slow the tick down by a factor

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.860 
engine to slow the tick down by a factor
of<00:06:22.380> four<00:06:22.770> and<00:06:23.010> then<00:06:23.490> I've<00:06:23.640> time<00:06:24.120> accelerated

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
of four and then I've time accelerated

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.480 
of four and then I've time accelerated
in<00:06:25.080> post-production<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:26.010> reason<00:06:26.280> is<00:06:26.430> that

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
in post-production the reason is that

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.710 
in post-production the reason is that
with<00:06:27.320> 1200<00:06:28.320> 1300<00:06:28.830> parts<00:06:29.640> the<00:06:29.820> physics<00:06:30.240> was

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
with 1200 1300 parts the physics was

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.150 
with 1200 1300 parts the physics was
running<00:06:31.200> at<00:06:31.440> one<00:06:31.800> frame<00:06:32.100> per<00:06:32.340> second<00:06:32.790> even<00:06:33.270> at

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
running at one frame per second even at

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.430 
running at one frame per second even at
four<00:06:35.160> times<00:06:35.490> slow<00:06:35.970> down<00:06:36.240> to<00:06:36.600> to<00:06:36.930> let<00:06:37.080> it<00:06:37.230> catch

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
four times slow down to to let it catch

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.730 
four times slow down to to let it catch
up<00:06:37.740> so

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
up so

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.670 
up so
yeah<00:06:39.250> I<00:06:39.699> think<00:06:40.060> some<00:06:40.569> of<00:06:40.599> the<00:06:40.750> part<00:06:41.020> rigidity

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
yeah I think some of the part rigidity

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.010 
yeah I think some of the part rigidity
stuff<00:06:41.979> that<00:06:42.160> was<00:06:42.280> added<00:06:42.699> in<00:06:42.940> the<00:06:43.479> most<00:06:43.660> recent

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
stuff that was added in the most recent

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.830 
stuff that was added in the most recent
version<00:06:44.220> perhaps<00:06:45.220> had<00:06:45.460> a<00:06:45.490> negative<00:06:45.940> effect<00:06:46.630> on

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
version perhaps had a negative effect on

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.200 
version perhaps had a negative effect on
the<00:06:46.990> stability<00:06:47.590> of<00:06:47.620> these<00:06:47.949> rockets<00:06:48.520> but<00:06:49.000> look

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
the stability of these rockets but look

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.059 
the stability of these rockets but look
we're<00:06:49.360> getting<00:06:49.479> up<00:06:49.720> to<00:06:49.900> about<00:06:50.080> Apple<00:06:50.560> apps<00:06:50.740> and

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069 
we're getting up to about Apple apps and

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:52.589 
we're getting up to about Apple apps and
we<00:06:51.370> just<00:06:51.580> need<00:06:51.759> to<00:06:51.849> keep<00:06:52.000> burning<00:06:52.449> these

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
we just need to keep burning these

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.330 
we just need to keep burning these
engines<00:06:53.080> until<00:06:53.259> we<00:06:53.500> get<00:06:53.620> up<00:06:53.800> to<00:06:53.919> orbital

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
engines until we get up to orbital

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.670 
engines until we get up to orbital
velocity<00:06:54.910> you<00:06:55.690> see<00:06:55.930> there's<00:06:56.139> eight<00:06:56.410> of<00:06:56.440> these

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
velocity you see there's eight of these

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.469 
velocity you see there's eight of these
and<00:06:56.979> they're<00:06:57.069> set<00:06:57.280> up<00:06:57.310> in<00:06:57.580> pairs<00:06:58.000> so<00:06:58.180> that<00:06:58.360> I

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
and they're set up in pairs so that I

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.680 
and they're set up in pairs so that I
can<00:06:58.690> fire<00:06:59.020> them<00:06:59.319> and<00:06:59.620> trim<00:07:00.340> my<00:07:00.520> orbit<00:07:00.910> but<00:07:01.539> then

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
can fire them and trim my orbit but then

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.350 
can fire them and trim my orbit but then
I<00:07:01.810> get<00:07:01.990> to<00:07:02.110> this<00:07:02.229> last<00:07:02.500> one<00:07:02.860> and<00:07:03.160> we<00:07:03.940> just<00:07:04.180> go

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
I get to this last one and we just go

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.249 
I get to this last one and we just go
into<00:07:04.750> a<00:07:04.930> ridiculous<00:07:06.210> elliptical<00:07:07.210> orbit<00:07:07.660> Sol
