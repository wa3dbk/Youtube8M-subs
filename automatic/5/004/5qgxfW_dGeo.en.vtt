hi<00:00:08.900> this<00:00:09.170> is<00:00:09.200> Bob<00:00:09.440> Hilke

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.140 
hi this is Bob Hilke

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.450 
hi this is Bob Hilke
calm<00:00:11.410> and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.810 

mileage<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.240> Volt<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> 2011<00:00:17.490> model

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
mileage on the Volt this is a 2011 model

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
mileage on the Volt this is a 2011 model
we<00:00:18.180> bought<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.570> after<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.560> had<00:00:19.680> been<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.860> demo<00:00:20.160> at

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
we bought it after it had been a demo at

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.760 
we bought it after it had been a demo at
the<00:00:20.550> car<00:00:20.730> dealer<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.450> I<00:00:21.480> had<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:21.990> 600<00:00:22.380> miles

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
the car dealer so I had about 600 miles

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.470 
the car dealer so I had about 600 miles
on<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.970> car<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.930> bought<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.439> car<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.480> at

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
on the car when we bought the car and at

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.960 
on the car when we bought the car and at
that<00:00:27.570> time<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.740> life<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> cart<00:00:29.820> was

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that time the life of the cart was

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.690 
that time the life of the cart was
averaging<00:00:30.480> about<00:00:30.720> 70<00:00:31.349> miles<00:00:32.220> per<00:00:32.489> gallon

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
averaging about 70 miles per gallon

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.580 
averaging about 70 miles per gallon
because<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.510> didn't<00:00:33.750> always<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
because they didn't always have the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
because they didn't always have the
battery<00:00:34.770> charged<00:00:35.220> up<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> knowing<00:00:35.760> people<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
battery charged up and knowing people to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.870 
battery charged up and knowing people to
come<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.540> try<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.100> they<00:00:38.489> also<00:00:38.579> wanted

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
come and try it out and they also wanted

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.150 
come and try it out and they also wanted
to<00:00:38.970> show<00:00:39.060> people<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.380> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
to show people what it was like when the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.590 
to show people what it was like when the
generator<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.820> running<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.360> they<00:00:42.480> would

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
generator was running so they would

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.960 
generator was running so they would
leave<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.050> fully<00:00:43.320> charged<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.760> could

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
leave it not fully charged so they could

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.200 
leave it not fully charged so they could
see<00:00:45.329> both<00:00:45.510> ways<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.609> so<00:00:47.609> since<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.969> bought<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
see both ways and so since we bought the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.340 
see both ways and so since we bought the
Volt<00:00:49.429> the<00:00:50.429> mileage<00:00:50.730> has<00:00:50.910> improved<00:00:51.449> because

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Volt the mileage has improved because

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.590 
Volt the mileage has improved because
we've<00:00:52.559> had<00:00:52.859> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.129> miles<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.390> our

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
we've had a lot of miles that our

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.040 
we've had a lot of miles that our
battery<00:00:55.019> only<00:00:55.379> trips<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.750> life

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
battery only trips and so now the life

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.360 
battery only trips and so now the life
of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.559> vehicle<00:00:59.219> is<00:01:00.350> 169<00:01:01.350> miles<00:01:01.829> per<00:01:02.160> gallon

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
of the vehicle is 169 miles per gallon

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.660 
of the vehicle is 169 miles per gallon
on<00:01:02.640> average<00:01:03.480> since<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.500> vehicle<00:01:05.070> was<00:01:05.460> built

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
on average since the vehicle was built

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
on average since the vehicle was built
in<00:01:06.300> 2011<00:01:07.230> and<00:01:08.510> as<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.840> right<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.350> since<00:01:10.770> we

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
in 2011 and as of right now since we

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.350 
in 2011 and as of right now since we
owned<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.580> vehicle<00:01:12.380> we<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:14.360> two

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
owned the vehicle we have put two

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
owned the vehicle we have put two
thousand<00:01:16.020> four<00:01:16.320> hundred<00:01:16.350> thirty<00:01:16.770> nine<00:01:16.980> point

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
thousand four hundred thirty nine point

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
thousand four hundred thirty nine point
nine<00:01:17.550> miles<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> we've<00:01:18.659> used<00:01:19.110> seven<00:01:19.740> point

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
nine miles on and we've used seven point

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.749 
nine miles on and we've used seven point
three<00:01:20.070> gallons<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.939> gas<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.579> we'll<00:01:23.700> just

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
three gallons of gas and so we'll just

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.980 
three gallons of gas and so we'll just
do<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.649> math<00:01:25.649> click<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:27.299> what

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
do the math click on that and see what

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.459 
do the math click on that and see what
it<00:01:28.320> comes<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.640> 24<00:01:31.490> 39.9<00:01:32.490> miles

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
it comes out to so it's 24 39.9 miles

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.850 
it comes out to so it's 24 39.9 miles
divided<00:01:34.469> by<00:01:34.560> seven<00:01:35.009> point<00:01:35.340> three<00:01:35.450> gallons<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
divided by seven point three gallons and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.660 
divided by seven point three gallons and
so<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.360> 334<00:01:39.360> miles<00:01:39.689> per<00:01:40.110> gallon<00:01:40.670> since

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
so that's 334 miles per gallon since

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.950 
so that's 334 miles per gallon since
we've<00:01:41.880> owned<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.390> vehicle<00:01:43.009> now<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.780> last

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
we've owned the vehicle now the last

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.670 
we've owned the vehicle now the last
couple<00:01:46.439> thousand<00:01:47.009> miles<00:01:47.219> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.939> vehicle

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
couple thousand miles of the vehicle

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.249 
couple thousand miles of the vehicle
we've<00:01:49.680> driven<00:01:49.950> after<00:01:50.789> we've<00:01:51.149> installed<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
we've driven after we've installed the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.520 
we've driven after we've installed the
240<00:01:53.159> volt<00:01:53.850> charging<00:01:54.719> station<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.320> makes

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
240 volt charging station and that makes

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.289 
240 volt charging station and that makes
a<00:01:55.619> difference<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.280> when<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.090> home

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
a difference because when you get home

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.870 
a difference because when you get home
from<00:01:57.359> work<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:58.740> battery<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.609> close

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
from work the battery is you know close

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.209 
from work the battery is you know close
to<00:01:59.909> empty<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:01.590> might<00:02:01.740> need<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.979> run<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
to empty and we might need to run to the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.670 
to empty and we might need to run to the
drugstore<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.090> grocery<00:02:03.509> store<00:02:03.780> or<00:02:04.109> take<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
drugstore the grocery store or take the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.210 
drugstore the grocery store or take the
kids<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> concert<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:05.609> something<00:02:05.789> and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
kids to a concert or something and

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.410 
kids to a concert or something and
before<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:08.910> were<00:02:09.000> plugged<00:02:09.240> into

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
before we have that we were plugged into

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.280 
before we have that we were plugged into
the<00:02:09.570> 120<00:02:10.229> volt<00:02:11.150> power<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.900> takes<00:02:13.140> about

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the 120 volt power and that takes about

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.800 
the 120 volt power and that takes about
10<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.980> 11<00:02:14.250> hours<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.880> fully<00:02:15.390> charge<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
10 to 11 hours to fully charge the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.370 
10 to 11 hours to fully charge the
battery<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.000> 240-volt<00:02:18.000> charging<00:02:18.900> station

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
battery with a 240-volt charging station

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.770 
battery with a 240-volt charging station
it<00:02:19.920> only<00:02:20.040> takes<00:02:20.340> three<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> half<00:02:21.030> hours

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
it only takes three and a half hours

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.220 
it only takes three and a half hours
usually<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:23.160> fully<00:02:23.340> charge<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.730> battery<00:02:24.240> so

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
usually to fully charge the battery so

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.430 
usually to fully charge the battery so
we<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.070> come<00:02:26.400> home<00:02:26.660> battery<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.750> almost<00:02:27.930> empty

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
we can come home battery is almost empty

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.220 
we can come home battery is almost empty
i<00:02:28.520> charged<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.700> within<00:02:29.970> an<00:02:30.210> hour<00:02:30.330> we'd<00:02:30.870> have

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
i charged it within an hour we'd have

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.040 
i charged it within an hour we'd have
another<00:02:31.560> 10<00:02:32.160> miles<00:02:32.760> available<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.480> use<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:33.930> we

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
another 10 miles available to use so we

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.780 
another 10 miles available to use so we
can<00:02:34.200> go<00:02:34.350> run<00:02:34.860> our<00:02:34.980> errands<00:02:35.310> at<00:02:35.430> night<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
can go run our errands at night and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.440 
can go run our errands at night and
never<00:02:35.970> use<00:02:36.570> gasoline<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.410> now<00:02:38.210> since<00:02:39.210> we

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
never use gasoline so now since we

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
never use gasoline so now since we
installed<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:40.140> we've<00:02:40.350> gone<00:02:40.620> two<00:02:40.860> thousand

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
installed that we've gone two thousand

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.090 
installed that we've gone two thousand
thirty<00:02:41.550> six<00:02:41.820> miles<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.560> we'll<00:02:43.680> just<00:02:43.710> do<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
thirty six miles so we'll just do the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.230 
thirty six miles so we'll just do the
math<00:02:44.250> on<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:46.520> 2003<00:02:48.230> 6.7<00:02:49.250> miles<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.820> we've

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
math on that so 2003 6.7 miles and we've

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.980 
math on that so 2003 6.7 miles and we've
only<00:02:52.070> burned<00:02:53.070> three<00:02:53.580> point<00:02:54.120> two<00:02:54.330> gallons<00:02:54.840> of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
only burned three point two gallons of

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.220 
only burned three point two gallons of
gasoline<00:02:55.640> since<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.790> installed<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
gasoline since we installed that the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.390 
gasoline since we installed that the
charger<00:02:59.190> station<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:00.120> we're<00:03:00.510> averaging<00:03:00.690> 600

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
charger station and we're averaging 600

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.300 
charger station and we're averaging 600
36<00:03:02.400> miles<00:03:02.700> per<00:03:03.060> gallon<00:03:03.300> in<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:04.680> last<00:03:04.890> two

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
36 miles per gallon in the last two

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.510 
36 miles per gallon in the last two
thousand<00:03:05.910> thirty<00:03:06.330> six<00:03:06.690> miles<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.220> that's<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
thousand thirty six miles so that's the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.180 
thousand thirty six miles so that's the
mileage<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:08.940> we're<00:03:09.330> getting<00:03:09.860> most<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:11.040> my

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
mileage that we're getting most of my

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.090 
mileage that we're getting most of my
trips<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.420> car<00:03:12.630> are<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.200> work<00:03:13.410> dropping

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
trips in the car are to work dropping

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.640 
trips in the car are to work dropping
kids<00:03:14.280> off<00:03:14.490> at<00:03:14.730> school<00:03:14.760> picking<00:03:15.510> kids<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:15.990> from

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
kids off at school picking kids up from

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.540 
kids off at school picking kids up from
school<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.100> way<00:03:17.280> home<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:19.020> typically

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
school on the way home and so typically

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.550 
school on the way home and so typically
less<00:03:20.550> than<00:03:20.850> 40<00:03:21.180> miles<00:03:21.390> per<00:03:21.870> day<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> little

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
less than 40 miles per day a little

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.060 
less than 40 miles per day a little
under<00:03:22.890> 40<00:03:23.250> sometimes<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.210> little<00:03:24.360> over<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.070> so

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
under 40 sometimes a little over and so

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.740 
under 40 sometimes a little over and so
you<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:27.090> know<00:03:27.210> we're<00:03:27.660> getting

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
you can see you know we're getting

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.750 
you can see you know we're getting
pretty<00:03:28.470> good<00:03:28.770> mileage<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.220> pretty<00:03:29.430> happy

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
pretty good mileage and pretty happy

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.820 
pretty good mileage and pretty happy
about<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.150> because<00:03:30.960> before<00:03:31.410> we<00:03:31.530> got<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
about that because before we got the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.000 
about that because before we got the
bolt<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.250> was<00:03:32.400> putting<00:03:33.270> probably<00:03:34.110> sixty<00:03:34.980> or

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
bolt I was putting probably sixty or

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.570 
bolt I was putting probably sixty or
seventy<00:03:35.280> dollars<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:36.030> gasoline<00:03:36.600> on<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:38.520> know

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
seventy dollars of gasoline on you know

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.390 
seventy dollars of gasoline on you know
every<00:03:38.730> time<00:03:38.910> I'd<00:03:39.060> fill<00:03:39.270> up<00:03:39.420> our<00:03:39.540> car<00:03:40.370> into<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
every time I'd fill up our car into the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.610 
every time I'd fill up our car into the
car<00:03:41.810> almost<00:03:42.810> every<00:03:43.260> week<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:44.209> now<00:03:45.620> since

and<00:03:50.250> won't<00:03:50.910> need<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.090> probably<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> long

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
and won't need to probably for a long

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.350 
and won't need to probably for a long
time<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:53.130> we're<00:03:53.280> pretty<00:03:53.640> pleased<00:03:53.940> with<00:03:54.060> this

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.500 
time so we're pretty pleased with this
with<00:03:54.720> mileage<00:03:55.080> for<00:03:55.230> getting
