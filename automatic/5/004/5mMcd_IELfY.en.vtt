not<00:02:02.109> giving<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.439> exact<00:02:02.859> measurements

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
not giving you exact measurements

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.529 
not giving you exact measurements
that's<00:02:04.749> because<00:02:05.609> cut<00:02:06.609> it<00:02:06.700> longer<00:02:06.999> first<00:02:07.240> and

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
that's because cut it longer first and

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.529 
that's because cut it longer first and
then<00:02:08.069> later<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.190> can<00:02:09.429> trim<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:09.940> find<00:02:10.360> out

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
then later you can trim it and find out

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.480 
then later you can trim it and find out
what<00:02:10.899> measurement<00:02:11.650> works<00:02:11.800> best<00:02:12.069> for<00:02:12.220> your

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
what measurement works best for your

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.850 
what measurement works best for your
size<00:02:12.819> design<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.990> let's<00:02:14.110> start<00:02:14.350> off<00:02:14.470> by<00:02:14.650> taking

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
size design so let's start off by taking

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.590 
size design so let's start off by taking
the<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.220> plate<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.910> combustion<00:02:16.210> chamber

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
the in plate to the combustion chamber

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.930 
the in plate to the combustion chamber
that<00:02:16.630> we<00:02:16.780> made<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.140> first<00:02:17.290> video<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.940> also

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
that we made in the first video and also

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.789 
that we made in the first video and also
take<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.390> 4<00:02:19.630> inch<00:02:19.810> circle<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.620> cut

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
take the 4 inch circle that you just cut

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.250 
take the 4 inch circle that you just cut
either<00:02:21.069> one<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.430> doesn't<00:02:21.730> matter<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:22.260> you're

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
either one it doesn't matter and you're

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.500 
either one it doesn't matter and you're
going<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.440> want<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.769> drill<00:02:24.010> 6<00:02:24.400> some<00:02:25.030> more<00:02:25.209> holes

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
going to want to drill 6 some more holes

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.280 
going to want to drill 6 some more holes
and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.679 
and
them<00:02:26.500> because<00:02:26.709> they're<00:02:26.860> gonna<00:02:26.980> bolt<00:02:27.280> together

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
them because they're gonna bolt together

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.209

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
some of your welds and you can start to

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.399 
some of your welds and you can start to
bolt<00:05:07.970> things<00:05:08.240> together<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.110> is<00:05:09.169> what

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
bolt things together and this is what

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.749 
bolt things together and this is what
your<00:05:09.560> heat<00:05:09.680> exchanger<00:05:10.099> is<00:05:10.159> going<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.400> start<00:05:10.639> to

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
your heat exchanger is going to start to

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.909 
your heat exchanger is going to start to
look<00:05:10.879> like<00:05:11.139> next<00:05:12.139> we're<00:05:12.409> going<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.590> make<00:05:12.770> the

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
look like next we're going to make the

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.010 
look like next we're going to make the
flame<00:05:13.159> tube<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.669> this<00:05:14.180> helps<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.539> separate

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
flame tube and this helps to separate

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.899 
flame tube and this helps to separate
the<00:05:15.229> fuel<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.830> incoming<00:05:16.190> air<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:16.789> it

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
the fuel and the incoming air so that it

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:19.570 
the fuel and the incoming air so that it
mixes<00:05:17.270> properly<00:05:17.780> now<00:05:18.620> what<00:05:19.069> I'm<00:05:19.190> using<00:05:19.430> here

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
mixes properly now what I'm using here

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.469 
mixes properly now what I'm using here
is<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.030> piece<00:05:20.360> of<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:21.139> dryer<00:05:22.099> exhaust<00:05:22.669> vent<00:05:23.030> hose

is a piece of a dryer exhaust vent hose
it's<00:05:24.080> very<00:05:24.470> thin<00:05:24.830> metal<00:05:25.039> very<00:05:25.400> light<00:05:25.759> which<00:05:26.180> I

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
it's very thin metal very light which I

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.200 
it's very thin metal very light which I
like<00:05:26.690> but<00:05:27.440> hopefully<00:05:28.099> this<00:05:28.340> doesn't<00:05:28.610> melt<00:05:28.970> in

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
like but hopefully this doesn't melt in

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.760 
like but hopefully this doesn't melt in
the<00:05:29.330> middle<00:05:29.569> of<00:05:29.659> the<00:05:29.750> combustion<00:05:30.050> chamber<00:05:30.530> but

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
the middle of the combustion chamber but

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.140 
the middle of the combustion chamber but
we'll<00:05:31.099> find<00:05:31.340> out<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.639> I'll<00:05:31.819> let<00:05:32.000> you<00:05:32.120> know

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
we'll find out and I'll let you know

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.100 
we'll find out and I'll let you know
when<00:05:32.419> I<00:05:32.449> get<00:05:32.599> there

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
when I get there

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.159 
when I get there
you're<00:05:34.099> gonna<00:05:34.190> want<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.550> bolt<00:05:35.419> this<00:05:35.599> on<00:05:35.810> to<00:05:36.020> the

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
you're gonna want to bolt this on to the

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.010 
you're gonna want to bolt this on to the
three<00:05:36.409> bolts<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.949> you<00:05:37.069> put<00:05:37.340> onto<00:05:37.490> your

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
three bolts that you put onto your

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.600 
three bolts that you put onto your
4-inch<00:05:39.020> tube<00:05:39.379> and<00:05:39.620> then<00:05:40.400> also<00:05:40.759> cut<00:05:41.120> an<00:05:41.360> opening

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
4-inch tube and then also cut an opening

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.120 
4-inch tube and then also cut an opening
where<00:05:43.610> you<00:05:43.849> cut<00:05:44.090> your<00:05:44.210> rectangle<00:05:44.719> earlier

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
where you cut your rectangle earlier

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.860 
where you cut your rectangle earlier
after<00:05:46.130> you<00:05:46.460> put<00:05:46.669> these<00:05:46.789> pieces<00:05:47.030> together<00:05:47.360> you

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
after you put these pieces together you

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.300 
after you put these pieces together you
may<00:05:48.050> find<00:05:48.289> that<00:05:48.409> it's<00:05:48.650> a<00:05:48.740> little<00:05:48.979> longer<00:05:49.159> than

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
may find that it's a little longer than

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.050 
may find that it's a little longer than
you<00:05:49.460> need<00:05:49.580> so<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.539> may<00:05:50.780> have<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.139> trim<00:05:51.380> it<00:05:51.409> up

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
you need so you may have to trim it up

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.339 
you need so you may have to trim it up
next<00:05:53.060> when<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.330> drill<00:05:53.659> some<00:05:53.840> holes<00:05:53.870> in<00:05:54.259> the

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
next when you drill some holes in the

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.439 
next when you drill some holes in the
flame<00:05:54.590> tube<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:55.039> use<00:05:55.400> around<00:05:55.639> a<00:05:55.909> hundred<00:05:56.060> holes

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
flame tube I use around a hundred holes

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.689 
flame tube I use around a hundred holes
if<00:05:57.229> you're<00:05:57.500> making<00:05:57.860> a<00:05:57.919> smaller<00:05:58.190> engine<00:05:58.520> gonna

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
if you're making a smaller engine gonna

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.159 
if you're making a smaller engine gonna
need<00:05:58.849> less<00:05:59.029> a<00:05:59.060> bigger<00:05:59.509> engine<00:05:59.840> you're<00:06:00.020> gonna

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
need less a bigger engine you're gonna

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.189 
need less a bigger engine you're gonna
need<00:06:00.349> more<00:06:00.969> but<00:06:01.969> the<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.539> holes<00:06:02.750> will<00:06:02.960> start

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
need more but the the holes will start

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.529 
need more but the the holes will start
off<00:06:03.319> small<00:06:03.560> near<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:04.729> bottom<00:06:04.880> of<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.180> flame

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
off small near the bottom of the flame

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.350 
off small near the bottom of the flame
tube<00:06:05.840> and<00:06:06.080> get<00:06:06.380> bigger<00:06:06.590> as<00:06:06.830> they<00:06:07.039> go<00:06:07.219> up<00:06:07.360> mine

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
tube and get bigger as they go up mine

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.200 
tube and get bigger as they go up mine
or<00:06:08.509> about<00:06:08.719> a<00:06:08.750> quarter<00:06:09.259> inch<00:06:09.440> in<00:06:09.620> diameter

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
or about a quarter inch in diameter

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.519 
or about a quarter inch in diameter
here's<00:06:11.210> a<00:06:11.300> little<00:06:11.539> trick<00:06:11.779> I<00:06:11.900> wanted<00:06:12.139> to<00:06:12.259> try

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
here's a little trick I wanted to try

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.589 
here's a little trick I wanted to try
this<00:06:13.130> is<00:06:13.340> how<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:13.520> flame<00:06:13.849> tubes<00:06:14.150> are<00:06:14.360> in

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
this is how the flame tubes are in

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.580 
this is how the flame tubes are in
actual<00:06:15.110> plane<00:06:15.380> engines<00:06:17.080> first<00:06:18.080> what<00:06:18.349> you<00:06:18.440> want

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
actual plane engines first what you want

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.749 
actual plane engines first what you want
to<00:06:18.650> do<00:06:18.710> is<00:06:18.830> take<00:06:19.069> the<00:06:19.310> drill<00:06:19.520> bit<00:06:19.669> that's

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
to do is take the drill bit that's

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.909 
to do is take the drill bit that's
drilled<00:06:20.029> the<00:06:20.150> holes<00:06:20.360> with<00:06:20.599> use<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.229> solid<00:06:21.710> end

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
drilled the holes with use the solid end

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.309 
drilled the holes with use the solid end
and<00:06:22.130> stick<00:06:22.849> it<00:06:23.000> into<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.840> hole<00:06:24.020> that<00:06:24.050> you

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
and stick it into the hole that you

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.879 
and stick it into the hole that you
drilled<00:06:24.590> and<00:06:24.830> then<00:06:25.639> then<00:06:26.029> the<00:06:26.300> drill<00:06:26.569> bit

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
drilled and then then the drill bit

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:29.409 
drilled and then then the drill bit
straight<00:06:27.889> down<00:06:28.250> towards<00:06:28.880> the<00:06:28.969> bottom<00:06:29.090> of<00:06:29.270> the

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
straight down towards the bottom of the

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.589 
straight down towards the bottom of the
flame<00:06:29.630> tube<00:06:29.930> so<00:06:30.680> that<00:06:30.710> it<00:06:31.009> makes<00:06:31.250> sort<00:06:32.210> of<00:06:32.330> a

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
flame tube so that it makes sort of a

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.080 
flame tube so that it makes sort of a
cheesegrater<00:06:33.289> effect<00:06:34.099> this<00:06:34.550> way<00:06:34.759> when<00:06:34.969> the

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
cheesegrater effect this way when the

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.930 
cheesegrater effect this way when the
air<00:06:35.210> is<00:06:35.240> passing<00:06:35.630> by<00:06:35.930> the<00:06:35.990> tube<00:06:36.409> it<00:06:37.069> will<00:06:37.279> catch

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
air is passing by the tube it will catch

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
air is passing by the tube it will catch
and<00:06:38.240> pull<00:06:38.930> it<00:06:39.080> into<00:06:39.500> the<00:06:39.620> tube<00:06:39.830> better<00:06:40.960> all

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
and pull it into the tube better all

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.950 
and pull it into the tube better all
right<00:06:42.169> so<00:06:42.409> here's<00:06:42.650> our<00:06:42.889> finished<00:06:43.490> product

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
going to go in and mix with the fuel and

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.470 
going to go in and mix with the fuel and
pressurize<00:06:59.450> it<00:06:59.630> all<00:06:59.750> the<00:06:59.840> way<00:06:59.930> up<00:07:00.080> this<00:07:00.260> -<00:07:00.530> I'm

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
pressurize it all the way up this - I'm

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.050 
pressurize it all the way up this - I'm
kind<00:07:02.480> of<00:07:02.660> atomized<00:07:03.170> it<00:07:03.410> and<00:07:03.640> then<00:07:04.640> it'll<00:07:04.880> come

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
kind of atomized it and then it'll come

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.590 
kind of atomized it and then it'll come
out<00:07:05.120> where<00:07:05.840> it's<00:07:06.020> ignited<00:07:07.300> so<00:07:08.300> I<00:07:08.330> hope<00:07:08.540> that

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 
out where it's ignited so I hope that
