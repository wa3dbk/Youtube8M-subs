we've<00:00:02.850> been<00:00:03.000> working<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:03.389> spring<00:00:03.600> blade<00:00:03.899> for

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
we've been working on spring blade for

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.349 
we've been working on spring blade for
over<00:00:04.290> six<00:00:04.529> years<00:00:04.620> now<00:00:04.830> we<00:00:05.609> were<00:00:05.790> initially

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
over six years now we were initially

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.770 
over six years now we were initially
inspired<00:00:07.020> by<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.980> concept<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.580> levitation<00:00:09.480> of

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
inspired by the concept of levitation of

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.110 
inspired by the concept of levitation of
just<00:00:09.990> being<00:00:10.170> kind<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.559> floating<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.670> really

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
just being kind of floating it's really

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.720 
just being kind of floating it's really
simple<00:00:12.450> it's<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.780> same<00:00:13.380> way<00:00:13.559> pole<00:00:14.280> vaults

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
simple it's like same way pole vaults

motorcycle<00:00:16.830> suspensions<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.640> any<00:00:18.420> kind<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
motorcycle suspensions so any kind of

motorcycle suspensions so any kind of
mechanical<00:00:19.350> solution<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.939> travel

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
mechanical solution that like you travel

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.420 
mechanical solution that like you travel
down<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.050> then<00:00:22.260> propel<00:00:22.619> forward<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.310> know

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
down and then propel forward you know

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.420 
down and then propel forward you know
energy<00:00:24.150> forward<00:00:24.510> that's<00:00:25.080> really<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.279> it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
energy forward that's really how it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.509 
energy forward that's really how it
works<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.939> then<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.359> sixteen

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
works and then you have sixteen

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.189 
works and then you have sixteen
individually<00:00:29.519> tuned<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> blades<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
individually tuned the blades so the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.569 
individually tuned the blades so the
thickness<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> one<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.070> backs<00:00:32.279> not

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
thickness of the one in the backs not

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.979 
thickness of the one in the backs not
the<00:00:32.730> same<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> front<00:00:33.719> because

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the same as the one in the front because

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.889 
the same as the one in the front because
you<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.230> different<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:35.010> forces<00:00:35.899> but

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you have different you know forces but

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
you have different you know forces but
every<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> them<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.010> under<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> same

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
every one of them is under the same

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
every one of them is under the same
principle<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.450> energy<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.590> know<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> your

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
principle of energy you know you your

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.200 
principle of energy you know you your
energy<00:00:42.020> added<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> blade<00:00:44.670> down

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
energy added to the to the blade down

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
energy added to the to the blade down
and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.930> propels<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.379> forward<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and then it propels you forward the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.020 
and then it propels you forward the
upper<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> brand-new<00:00:49.879> called<00:00:50.879> tech

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
upper is a is a brand-new called tech

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
upper is a is a brand-new called tech
fit<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.809> where<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.559> upper

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
fit but it's where we make the upper

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
fit but it's where we make the upper
it's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.489> four-way<00:00:54.030> stretch<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> stretches

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it's a four-way stretch so it stretches

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.229 
it's a four-way stretch so it stretches
in<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.260> directions<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.910> actually

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
in all directions and it's it's actually

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
in all directions and it's it's actually
smaller<00:00:57.690> when<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.500> make<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.010> smaller

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
smaller when we make it it's smaller

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
smaller when we make it it's smaller
than<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> bottom<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:01.050> when<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> put

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
than the bottom and then when you put

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.160 
than the bottom and then when you put
the<00:01:01.739> last<00:01:01.949> inside<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.969> stretches<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.780> shoe

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the last inside it stretches the shoe

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.649 
the last inside it stretches the shoe
two<00:01:04.979> back<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> same<00:01:05.640> size<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> bottom

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
two back to the same size as the bottom

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
two back to the same size as the bottom
and<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.470> take<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> last<00:01:08.670> out

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and then when you take the last out

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.170 
and then when you take the last out
extremes<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.260> down<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.220> smaller<00:01:11.760> size

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
extremes back down to that smaller size

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.550 
extremes back down to that smaller size
so<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:12.810> you're<00:01:13.020> able<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.409> away

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so that's how you're able to get away

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
so that's how you're able to get away
with<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.310> don't<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.610> wrinkles<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
with you don't have wrinkles and you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.679 
with you don't have wrinkles and you
really<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> second<00:01:17.400> skin

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
really do have more of a second skin

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.179 
really do have more of a second skin
wrapping<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> foot<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.860> an<00:01:19.979> everyday

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
wrapping the foot this is an everyday

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
wrapping the foot this is an everyday
training<00:01:20.729> shoe<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.210> could<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.479> used<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
training shoe it could be used for a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.830 
training shoe it could be used for a
marathon<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.799> could<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.009> used<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.400> 10k<00:01:23.850> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
marathon it could be used for a 10k I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.039 
marathon it could be used for a 10k I
think<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:26.150> heel<00:01:27.150> striker<00:01:27.479> will<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
think that a heel striker will get the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.660 
think that a heel striker will get the
most<00:01:28.229> enjoyment<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:29.490> you'll

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
most enjoyment out of it because you'll

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.160 
most enjoyment out of it because you'll
experience<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> full<00:01:30.450> ride<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.020> it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
experience the full ride but it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.319 
experience the full ride but it's
perfectly<00:01:32.159> suitable<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> mid-foot<00:01:33.180> or

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
perfectly suitable for a mid-foot or

themselves<00:01:48.660> you're<00:01:48.810> basically<00:01:49.290> riding<00:01:49.530> right

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
themselves you're basically riding right

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.820 
themselves you're basically riding right
on<00:01:50.100> top<00:01:50.370> of<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.610> blades<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.300> can<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.830> kind

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
on top of the blades as you can see kind

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.440 
on top of the blades as you can see kind
of<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.040> through<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.550> you're<00:01:53.790> right<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.240> top

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
of see through here you're right on top

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.260 
of see through here you're right on top
of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.660> blades<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.190> really<00:01:56.580> that's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
of the blades so it's really that's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.890 
of the blades so it's really that's
what's<00:01:57.510> doing<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> job<00:01:58.050> for<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:59.900> seven

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
what's doing the job for you it's seven

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.690 
what's doing the job for you it's seven
times<00:02:01.080> more<00:02:01.440> temperature<00:02:01.890> resistant<00:02:02.520> than

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
times more temperature resistant than

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.820 
times more temperature resistant than
typical<00:02:03.390> midsole<00:02:03.930> materials<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
typical midsole materials so what that

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.480 
typical midsole materials so what that
means<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.780> when<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.870> gets<00:02:06.960> very<00:02:07.080> cold

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
means is when it gets very cold

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.820 
means is when it gets very cold
EBA<00:02:09.030> gets<00:02:09.390> very<00:02:09.540> stiff<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.229> when<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.470> gets<00:02:10.530> too

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
EBA gets very stiff and when it gets too

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.820 
EBA gets very stiff and when it gets too
hot<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.430> gets<00:02:11.670> very<00:02:11.880> soft<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.540> squishy<00:02:12.830> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
hot it gets very soft and squishy the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.880 
hot it gets very soft and squishy the
spring<00:02:14.360> stiffness<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.870> product<00:02:16.680> stays

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
spring stiffness of this product stays

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.410 
spring stiffness of this product stays
virtually<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.459> same<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> wide<00:02:18.209> temperature

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
virtually the same to a wide temperature

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.410 
virtually the same to a wide temperature
range<00:02:18.739> it's<00:02:19.739> also<00:02:19.890> extremely<00:02:20.310> durable<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
range it's also extremely durable and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.650 
range it's also extremely durable and
again<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.500> know<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.970> highest<00:02:24.300> energy

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
again you know of the highest energy

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.440 
again you know of the highest energy
return<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.350> industry<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:26.010> great<00:02:26.610> story<00:02:27.300> is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
return in the industry a great story is

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.020 
return in the industry a great story is
that<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> guy<00:02:27.959> named<00:02:28.140> tank<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:29.030> in

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
that we have a guy named tank and in

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.850 
that we have a guy named tank and in
Germany<00:02:30.510> where<00:02:30.780> we've<00:02:31.170> done<00:02:31.200> quite<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.590> bit<00:02:31.650> of

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
Germany where we've done quite a bit of

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.030 
Germany where we've done quite a bit of
this<00:02:31.980> testing<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:34.020> know<00:02:34.140> his<00:02:34.530> goal<00:02:34.770> is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
this testing and you know his goal is

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.110 
this testing and you know his goal is
like<00:02:35.160> go<00:02:35.520> kill<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.090> shoe<00:02:36.300> go<00:02:37.230> go<00:02:37.620> go<00:02:38.280> put<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
like go kill the shoe go go go put it to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.960 
like go kill the shoe go go go put it to
the<00:02:39.239> absolute<00:02:39.720> extreme<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.549> your<00:02:41.790> run

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
the absolute extreme and on your run

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.210 
the absolute extreme and on your run
don't<00:02:42.330> look<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> clear<00:02:43.019> path<00:02:43.230> but<00:02:43.920> look

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
don't look for the clear path but look

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880 
don't look for the clear path but look
for<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.940> know<00:02:44.970> roots<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.900> rocks<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.709> look

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
for you know roots and rocks and look

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.220 
for you know roots and rocks and look
for<00:02:47.040> everything<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.640> he<00:02:48.239> wasn't<00:02:48.480> he<00:02:48.989> came

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
for everything and he wasn't he came

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.710 
for everything and he wasn't he came
back<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> shoe<00:02:50.700> exactly<00:02:51.269> as<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.600> was

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
back in with the shoe exactly as it was

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.530 
back in with the shoe exactly as it was
and<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.620> our<00:02:53.220> engineers<00:02:53.430> tend<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.360> not

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
and so our engineers tend to not

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.449 
and so our engineers tend to not
exaggerate<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:55.799> they<00:02:55.920> want<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> speak

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
exaggerate you know they want to speak

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.980 
exaggerate you know they want to speak
fact<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.060> when<00:02:57.299> one<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.510> them<00:02:57.780> said

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
fact and when one of them said

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.860 
fact and when one of them said
yeah<00:02:59.290> he<00:02:59.860> story<00:03:00.430> was<00:03:00.610> like<00:03:00.730> it's<00:03:01.000> unbreakable

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
yeah he story was like it's unbreakable

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.110 
yeah he story was like it's unbreakable
yeah<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.190> that's<00:03:03.400> some<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:03.880> gives<00:03:04.060> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
yeah so that that's some just gives you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.790 
yeah so that that's some just gives you
a<00:03:04.150> little<00:03:04.240> insight<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.960> film<00:03:05.620> through

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
a little insight that we film through

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.440 
a little insight that we film through
quite<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.100> bit<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.340> testing<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.150> achieves

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
quite a bit of testing and it achieves

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.580 
quite a bit of testing and it achieves
the<00:03:07.630> goals<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.900> we<00:03:08.050> have<00:03:08.080> forward<00:03:08.410> of

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
the goals that we have forward of

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.880 
the goals that we have forward of

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.090 
in running adidas is is main goal is to
make<00:03:16.270> athletes<00:03:16.660> perform<00:03:17.080> better<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.890> think

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
make athletes perform better and I think

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.830 
make athletes perform better and I think
this<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.430> spring<00:03:19.150> blade<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.540> another

this is spring blade is another

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.770 
this is spring blade is another
expression<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.650> how<00:03:21.190> we<00:03:21.250> go<00:03:21.490> about<00:03:21.520> doing<00:03:22.000> that

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
expression of how we go about doing that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.560
