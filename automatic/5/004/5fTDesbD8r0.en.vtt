00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello everyone, Ilyukha and in this video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.240
 I will tell you a lesson how to properly and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.019
 correctly play for such a character as 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.420
 pujas and so here you peep puja analyze 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.089
 initial purchase in most cases 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.660
 if you go to mid then your initial 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.050
 the purchase will be tango and 3 twigs either tango 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.350
 2 branches and clarity or tango flap 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.750
 color well and a couple of branches then you should 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.000
 choose whether you go to mid or line 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.460
 if you have no team other mid-heroes 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.170
 then you go there but if mid is already taken 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.399
 then the pooj can perfectly stand on 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 lane even in solo 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.930
 he shows himself well in conjunction with 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 by many characters 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 who have a camp or slowdown 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.129
 now we will understand the role in the team in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.920
 early game especially if you stand on 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.989
 midu your first and main task is not 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.730
 give the enemy minder a farm and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.399
 level so try 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.109
 Denying creeps as perfect as possible 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.629
 option will be if you pick up 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.449
 enemy midi at least one two times 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.619
 get an ulta and go gank the lines 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.720
 up to 10 minutes and 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.450
 while the enemy mieder will catch up 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520
 lost farm and left now your 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.390
 the main task is to give time to farm 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.939
 your kay 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.700
 so allow them to moderately lay and 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.950
 protect them if that do not forget that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.799
 the hook can declare the death of the allies 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.110
 run on the map kill enemy keri 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.060
 while your will quietly farm on 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.159
 lines do not feel discomfort 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.340
 while you swing by killing 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.560
 talk about choosing items at the beginning 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.689
 games are best collected battle as 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.670
 you will need him for a rune and just a3 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.490
 go now about choosing shoes 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.220
 Basically, a puja fits any shoe 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.860
 very often we see pursing with lasso 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.960
 from tranquillo me this is a good choice so 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.440
 as arcanna gives extra mana and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.050
 you can replenish manus 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.390
 my ally and tranquillo give good 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.030
 regin speed and a little armor 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.510
 then cook force staff or blink dagger 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.310
 on the situation then amanim and tarask then 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.830
 you can sell the battle in two slots 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.960
 buy situations like bkb and 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.869
 survival breastplate 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.460
 first of all you must understand that a lot 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.010
 depends on how you pull 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.110
 the opponent and how quickly you apply on 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.810
 not giving it to ult 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.880
 nothing to do there are two main tactics 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.250
 attacks on pooja the first of them 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.470
 involves an attack on the breach 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.540
 that is, you start to stink and then 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.500
 the very end to finish off the enemy you 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.170
 his idi hook 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.450
 and the second tactic is that 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.060
 you attract the enemy causing him 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.220
 initial damage and then stink or 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.530
 use it on ulta if it is and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.690
 thereby scoring it now we 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.760
 consider how to huk for puja 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.400
 there are a few rules in this first 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.310
 rule you need to learn 105 hook and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.080
 improve first your reaction 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.420
 second rule if you go to gang then 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.030
 do not burn in front of opponents buy 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.610
 wards or ask them to put your 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.530
 Supports wards will give you an extra 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.380
 vision that will be useful for the hook 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.510
 try to catch the enemy on what 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.610
 he certainly cannot be avoided for example you 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.830
 see what any kerry farm 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.530
 creeps on the moon and here you see what 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.260
 now he will lash out creeps in this 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.400
 moment and you have to throw the hook and then you are 95 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.190
 percent will get 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.410
 You also can not forget about the features of 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.600
 dota texture related if you 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.630
 see that your opponent is running away from you and 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.120
 Now he will run to the bridge or on x g 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.860
 or in the forest then boldly hook ayti because 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.260
 bridge in the forest at xg 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.209
 he will be confused on the road and will not 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.400
 so quickly turn around and run away from 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.980
 of your hook so you'll enjoy 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.720
 advantage in this regard now 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.640
 talk about the skill of the hooks on 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.950
 high ground or just take off 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.569
 the terrain here is half dependent 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.780
 good luck and half of how you 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.550
 read the opponent for example if you 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.440
 see that your opponent is hiding then 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.750
 try to calculate its trajectory 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.540
 Movement though it is not visible and then 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.180
 can try to huk now about hands 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.130
 through creeps and so on if you see 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.810
 that your opponent is standing next to a creep 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.000
 then you need to hook a little more to the side 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.250
 free block of the enemy because 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.380
 uk can touch the target which is on the side of 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.950
 him that is, creep and attract thereby 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.079
 this creep they goal now talk about 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.510
 how to start right after the hook 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.790
 apply ultuet on the enemy for 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.600
 you need this when you clicked into place 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.850
 flight hook 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.070
 and saw that you hooked him and now 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.750
 he will be yours at the same time 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.240
 push the culture on the opponent 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.250
 then your opponent won't even have 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.140
 a chance to leave except instant skills 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.850
 who do not have a delay of application 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.550
 for example shift while and only and heaps 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.620
 viverra well on this until all the lights 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.690
 turned out small but informative 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.850
