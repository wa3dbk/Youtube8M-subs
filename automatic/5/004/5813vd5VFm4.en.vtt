00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 main field bentegodi stage for 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 verona milan we immediately feel riccardo 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.730
 cucchi peron and milan confront each other later 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.099
 having completed an identical path in 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.900
 series a has so far 11 points for both 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.269
 with 3 wins and 2 pairs and a defeat 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 and that should say and a challenge 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.560
 balanced with identical science for 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 each team the milan scores the most 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.920
 the verona collects less both have 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.689
 however, want to leave an impression 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.609
 on this championship the Milan for 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.680
 return to the great Verona for 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.570
 confirm team of value 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.340
 let's go the trident formations for 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.790
 both verona take sides like this 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.860
 rafael between the posts then moras markets marx 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
 together with Augustines behind ionite 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 tachsidis and franzoni in the middle 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.789
 commerce tones and jankovic 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.890
 torres and el 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.660
 sharaawy the first check only one 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 so far the latter as you know 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.350
 expressed his dissatisfaction in the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 course of the week for the few 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.489
 opportunities offered to him 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.620
 both now have the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.930
 chance to convince inzaghi so 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.600
 the milan have you among the stakes 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.860
 to the former branches and abbot behind muntari 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.080
 esseen and poles and a half 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.630
 el shaarawy torres and honda in front 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 Verona hot day about 30,000 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.659
 spectators in the stands 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.970
 referee valeri from roma the core sandy 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.619
 balloon for Augustines then for marques 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.049
 the Brazilian in possession of the ball yes 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.549
 look around space is not appreciated 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.770
 can launch enough 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.810
 jankovic's precise header a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.150
 look for someone on the right who does not 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.250
 there he was late on this occasion 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.350
 on this occasion gomez the ball lost 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.050
 and the Milan that reconquers it with el 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.780
 shaarawy at the height of 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.640
 own meta field now the exchange in the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 circle of midfield with esseen the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.140
 launch of the latter to look very much 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.020
 off new abate check with the chest 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.960
 the cross 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.210
 a sensational own goal by markers 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.619
 and we have seen it wrong and he who in 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.259
 attempt to repel the ball 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.799
 harmless we must now say inside 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.149
 of the Verona 's penalty area 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.119
 completely wrong the impact on 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.399
 balloon and have beaten the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.409
 his Rafael goalkeeper and where Milan is 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.440
 takes the lead we repeat with a 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.209
 sensational own goal by marter changes the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.819
 partial to the twenty-first minute of play 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.319
 Verona 0 Milan 1 from Cagliari now 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.640
 there is a break of Verona with 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.460
 hallfredsson the shot 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.080
 ends very little on the side lapping the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.250
 pole to the left of siati la 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.860
 the best storytelling opportunity 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.900
 built by verona during this 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.940
 first time with this progression 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.350
 powerful and fast by 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.200
 hallfredsson who then let go 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.810
 a nice low shot low shot that yes 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.180
 is off very little on the bottom than the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.099
 double the doubling of the apple 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.200
 two to zero for me the thing we are at 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.719
 twenty-sixth the honda network 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.079
 we confirm the 2 to 0 honda networks 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.400
 26th that to you the line therefore 2 to 0 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.439
 for the Milan 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.299
 the network was marked by honda as 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.980
 told the twenty-seventh minute of this 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.810
 time now we are at the half hour of 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.189
 game grasslands have opened up in 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.200
 that occasion the occasion of the 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.510
 doubling for the formation of inzaghi e 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.280
 honda could really do what she did 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.109
 wanted in the air of rigor while there is a 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.060
 corner kick for the verona without the 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.459
 website tool thompson the ball ends 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.139
 on the bottom there was no deviation from 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.760
 part of the defenders of the milan hooper yes 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.079
 will restart with a kick-off in 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.790
 favor of the healthy and varied team 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.579
 entrusted to have and therefore 2 to 0 for 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.530
 the Milan seems to have learned the measures 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.599
 to the opponent and have somehow 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.430
 also took the helm of the game 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.069
 we must say, however, that there was one 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.500
 nice conclusion a few moments ago from 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.200
 part of tones in acrobatics from the summit 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.519
 of the door area and therefore in the area of 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.439
 rigor of the Milan with an intervention 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.450
 definitely not easy for you to have that 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.489
 neutralized the beautiful play by 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.319
 part of tones that surely the most 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.359
 dangerous always there in ambush 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.519
 in the midst of Milan militia defenders 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.949
 but now it appears more peaceful is 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.109
 managing a 2 to 0 that has been in some 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.000
 way triggered by resounding own goal by 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.109
 markers that caused then 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.150
 obviously the imbalance 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.370
 offensive of the verona who sought the same 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.409
 and on the prairies on the space that is 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.419
 naturally opened behind he slipped 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.640
 honda for the 2 to 0 in favor of the 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:08.880
 Rossoneri and a second substitution 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.770
 the third marking by the milan 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.680
 fifteen minutes of play in the second 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.900
 time yet i have a nice japanese that of 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.720
 remittance as an opportunity to be seized 18 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.600
 in the first half therefore verona 0 thousand 3 a 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.160
 so the line is 3 to 0 for Milan 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.960
 once again I wanted to say remittance 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.260
 the player was very well primed 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.780
 Japanese that has sprung towards the area 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.580
 of rigor entered expected the release of 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.100
 goalkeeper of the Verona rafael and has it 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.710
 threaded with a precise diagonal on the 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.170
 second goal a nice goal by 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.490
 honda's precision for a verona 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.380
 which now reacts with a conclusion 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.060
 from long distance by 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.770
 jankovic, however, who does not frame the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.090
 target does not frame the door 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.550
 verona that having that the best 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.320
 evidently in the final phase of the 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.660
 the first time such people to be 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.040
 very responsive the milan came into 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.500
 field with the right air above all 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.240
 has been able to manage the times of 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.430
 defending game when it was 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.570
 evidently necessary and striking of 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.240
 put back in the spaces that inevitably 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.890
 now open for the team of 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.780
 filippo inzaghi evidently given 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.940
 the most pronounced attitude in 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.830
 forward from that of mandorlini 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.690
 in addition to 0 I would say almost inevitable 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.420
 we therefore confirm the thirteenth 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.200
 verona 0 milan 3 and line to emanuele 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.680
 learned in the parma 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.310
 the 42nd with lopez therefore changes the 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.710
 partial Verona 1 Milan 3 to you the line 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.970
 has barely touched a few moments 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.250
 before it turns into a link 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.260
 also the second marking for Verona 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.600
 missing the target a few meters 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.040
 from the door and raising the 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.650
 ball therefore in the final minutes 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.270
 verona who has also demonstrated for others 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.850
 in other ways during the game 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.040
 of never wanting to give up 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.720
 was putting a result in crisis that 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.820
 seems to me to have already acquired 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.910
 remember that the partial has changed to 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.100
 42nd nico lopez for the verona has 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.950
 shortened the left distances dry from 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.810
 outside the low ball area and angled this 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.790
 the network signed by the Verona player 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.590
 and he also remembered that a bar had come out 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.880
 the author of the Milanese double win at 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.280
 his place in the field is bonera 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.240
 we are at the 44th minute at the end more 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.090
 recovery 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.310
 Verona 1 Milan three lines to Cagliari and 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.740
 nervousness in the end of the game with 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.750
 four minutes of recovery was 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.240
 expelled for dual warnings markets 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.990
 rafa márquez a few moments ago and now 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.630
 there was a face to face between 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.900
 bonaventura drilling his own 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.060
 opponent on the occasion moras both 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.980
 and above all moras has awakened another 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.260
 red the game ends here and ends 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.600
 however with the success of the Milan on 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.070
 verona for 3 to 1 the cagliari idea there 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.249
 we give the line our studio and let's go 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.559
 then with the comments starting 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:50.299
 at the bentegodi with the clear victory of the 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:51.199
 milan passed in the house of verona 

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:53.689
 riccardo cucchi 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:56.119
 we still remember the final milan 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:58.789
 beats Verona 3 to 1 have not scored 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:07:00.619
 torres and el sharaawy thought of it as a wave 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:02.779
 with two goals in the twenty-seventh in the 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:06.109
 first time in the eleventh of the second 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:08.119
 maila at the start of success off of 

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:10.069
 Milan had given the central defender 

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:12.349
 Brazilian del verona martes with a 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.659
 sensational own goal to the twenty-first Milan 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.309
 good at hitting spaces but verona 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:18.529
 we must never say dome and above all 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:20.839
 lively at the front have to be thin 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:22.549
 numerous interventions not easy but in the 

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.529
 football as we know well wins who 

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:26.629
