hey all me again continuing a couple

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.630 
hey all me again continuing a couple
lessons<00:00:04.020> that<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.170> was<00:00:04.319> asked<00:00:04.560> for<00:00:04.650> somebody

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
lessons that I was asked for somebody

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.480 
lessons that I was asked for somebody
asked<00:00:06.060> for<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> lesson<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.990> don't<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.890> do<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.160> by

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
asked for a lesson on don't you do it by

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.730 
asked for a lesson on don't you do it by
the<00:00:08.550> band<00:00:08.960> that's<00:00:09.960> that's<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.320> great<00:00:10.500> call

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the band that's that's a great call

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.070 
the band that's that's a great call
there's<00:00:11.040> not<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> lot<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.519> versions<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.540> that

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
there's not a lot of versions of that

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.460 
there's not a lot of versions of that
song<00:00:13.380> out<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.769> YouTube<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.929> it's<00:00:15.929> relatively

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
song out on YouTube and it's relatively

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.130 
song out on YouTube and it's relatively
simple<00:00:17.010> core<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:18.420> there's<00:00:18.720> there's<00:00:19.050> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
simple core so on but there's there's a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.380 
simple core so on but there's there's a
chord<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.500> there<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:20.000> people<00:00:21.000> get

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
chord in there that I think people get

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.859 
chord in there that I think people get
thrown<00:00:21.660> by<00:00:22.010> so<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.100> any<00:00:23.220> case<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:24.300> again<00:00:24.689> it's

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
thrown by so in any case this again it's

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.689 
thrown by so in any case this again it's
a<00:00:24.960> real<00:00:25.140> simple<00:00:25.410> song<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> couple<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
a real simple song just a couple of

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.570 
a real simple song just a couple of
parts<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.500> let<00:00:28.500> me<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.619> run<00:00:28.949> through<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
parts to it let me just run through the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.040 
parts to it let me just run through the
main<00:00:29.900> main<00:00:30.900> hook<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.660> I'll<00:00:33.780> explain

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
main main hook and and then I'll explain

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:50.380 
main main hook and and then I'll explain
that<00:00:43.219> oops<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> idea<00:00:47.010> so

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.639 

what<00:00:51.390> we're<00:00:51.539> doing<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.199> doing<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.440> G

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
what we're doing here is we're doing a G

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.639 
what we're doing here is we're doing a G
chord<00:00:52.680> um<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.750> F<00:00:54.899> shape<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
chord um it's it's the F shape on the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
chord um it's it's the F shape on the
third<00:00:55.890> fret<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.489> sure<00:00:57.120> he<00:00:57.210> doesn't<00:00:57.510> play<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
third fret I'm sure he doesn't play the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.040 
third fret I'm sure he doesn't play the
full<00:00:58.250> I<00:00:59.250> think<00:00:59.309> actually<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.840> see

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
full I think actually if you can see

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.900 
full I think actually if you can see
them<00:01:01.170> doing<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> last<00:01:01.829> waltz<00:01:02.219> anyway

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
them doing it in the last waltz anyway

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
them doing it in the last waltz anyway
so<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> first<00:01:03.870> chord<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> G<00:01:04.530> chord

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so the first chord is just a G chord

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.570 
so the first chord is just a G chord
strike<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:06.180> next<00:01:06.479> chord<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.680> ball<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
strike the next chord is a ball at the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.840 
strike the next chord is a ball at the
fifth<00:01:08.850> fret<00:01:09.409> second<00:01:10.409> finger<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.520> B<00:01:11.790> string

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
fifth fret second finger on the B string

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.960 
fifth fret second finger on the B string
at<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> sixth<00:01:13.049> fret<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> third<00:01:14.220> finger<00:01:14.790> on

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
at the sixth fret and third finger on

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.539 
at the sixth fret and third finger on
the<00:01:15.119> g<00:01:15.360> string<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:17.630> seventh<00:01:18.630> fret<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.549> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the g string at the seventh fret so you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.020 
the g string at the seventh fret so you
get<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:22.310> really<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.549> sure<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:23.909> it's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
get that really not sure what it's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.860 
get that really not sure what it's
called<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.070> chord<00:01:26.280> though

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.680 

then<00:01:29.440> he<00:01:29.530> lands<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:29.980> seat<00:01:30.310> on<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.730> seaboard

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
then he lands on a seat on the seaboard

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.600 
then he lands on a seat on the seaboard
you<00:01:31.930> could<00:01:32.140> probably<00:01:32.350> play<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.920> full<00:01:33.100> court<00:01:33.370> I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
you could probably play the full court I

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.000 
you could probably play the full court I
suppose<00:01:34.420> but<00:01:34.780> I<00:01:34.990> don't<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:35.440> just<00:01:35.650> played<00:01:35.860> the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
suppose but I don't I just played the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.800 
suppose but I don't I just played the
power<00:01:36.190> chord<00:01:36.610> even<00:01:37.120> if<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.330> looks<00:01:37.450> like<00:01:37.570> I'm

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
power chord even if it looks like I'm

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.680 
power chord even if it looks like I'm
boring<00:01:38.470> I'm<00:01:38.680> not<00:01:38.950> I'm<00:01:39.790> just<00:01:39.820> probably<00:01:40.210> using

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
boring I'm not I'm just probably using

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:49.470 
boring I'm not I'm just probably using
that<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.870> string<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:42.130> far<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.400> got<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:49.150> then

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
that a string so so far you got and then

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.500 
that a string so so far you got and then
the<00:01:49.600> next<00:01:49.870> bit<00:01:50.110> is<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.400> a<00:01:51.490> turn<00:01:51.700> back<00:01:51.970> over<00:01:52.180> to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
the next bit is just a turn back over to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.320 
the next bit is just a turn back over to
the<00:01:52.630> G<00:01:52.900> on<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.620> same<00:01:53.830> G<00:01:54.100> chord<00:01:54.400> shape<00:01:54.670> what

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
the G on the same G chord shape what

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.120 
the G on the same G chord shape what
he's<00:01:55.480> doing<00:01:55.900> though<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.200> he's<00:01:56.350> hammering<00:01:56.980> on

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
he's doing though is he's hammering on

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.270 
he's doing though is he's hammering on
the<00:01:57.910> g<00:01:58.120> string<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.690> 3rd<00:01:59.320> string<00:01:59.680> from<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.920> 3rd

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the g string a 3rd string from the 3rd

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.560 
the g string a 3rd string from the 3rd
fret<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.880> 4th<00:02:01.300> fret<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:03.300> and<00:02:04.300> then<00:02:04.450> he's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
fret to the 4th fret so and then he's

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.570 
fret to the 4th fret so and then he's
landing<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.410> full<00:02:05.650> g<00:02:05.860> chord<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:07.619> um<00:02:08.619> I

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
landing on the full g chord so um I

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.220 
landing on the full g chord so um I
think<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:10.119> if<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.480> listen<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.840> some<00:02:10.929> live

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
think that if you listen to some live

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.900 
think that if you listen to some live
versions<00:02:11.710> occasioning<00:02:12.550> he'll<00:02:12.700> do<00:02:12.850> this<00:02:14.910> and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
versions occasioning he'll do this and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.960 
versions occasioning he'll do this and
then<00:02:16.210> go<00:02:16.360> back<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.220> could<00:02:18.460> alternate

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
then go back to so you could alternate

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.280 
then go back to so you could alternate
it<00:02:19.150> that's<00:02:19.330> one<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.570> those<00:02:19.720> where<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.140> could

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
it that's one of those where you could

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.140 
it that's one of those where you could
probably<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.070> any<00:02:21.220> which<00:02:21.430> way<00:02:21.460> neither<00:02:21.970> is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
probably do it any which way neither is

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.550 
probably do it any which way neither is
right<00:02:22.360> or<00:02:22.510> wrong<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.840> think<00:02:22.900> he<00:02:23.080> does<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.290> both

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
right or wrong I think he does it both

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:43.300 
right or wrong I think he does it both
ways<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.520> whole<00:02:24.670> pattern<00:02:24.910> again<00:02:25.360> is

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.480 

then<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.330> only<00:02:44.480> other<00:02:44.600> part<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:46.370> just

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
then the only other part is it's just

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:57.450 
then the only other part is it's just
basically<00:02:46.730> G<00:02:47.450> chord<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.960> C<00:02:48.230> chord

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

you

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.330

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.360 

that's<00:03:14.300> that<00:03:14.510> part<00:03:14.690> um<00:03:14.959> really<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.010> meat<00:03:16.340> of

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
that's that part um really the meat of

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:26.259 
that's that part um really the meat of
it<00:03:16.550> is<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.920> I'll<00:03:25.129> make<00:03:25.430> up<00:03:25.610> give<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.090> trouble
