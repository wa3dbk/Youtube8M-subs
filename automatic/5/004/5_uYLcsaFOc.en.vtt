 can of condensed milk of 397 grams 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.690

 the juice of 6 lemons can be more can 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.750
 to be less more good is to your liking we are going to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.030
 also use 2 teaspoons 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.960
 or 14 grams of gelatin or gelatine without 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.420
 flavor we're going to grind in a blender or 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.729
 crusher two biscuit packets 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.970
 vanilla 170 grams as we see it 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.830
 there is like a small town and finally 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.540
 we're going to need butter too 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.910
 melted without salt here are 100 grams 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.980
 in a mold that you have as in my case 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.510
 a removable mold or in which you 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.280
 have at hand we are going to open a 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.100
 little oil after we're going to go 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.440
 placing all the cookie monedita going 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.560
 to put all the butter 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.450
 melted and we're going to incorporate 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.870
 perfectly that we have a mass 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.680
 homogeneous is we are going to place it as 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.440
 base in the mold so that it fits 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.180
 we will take it later to the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.010
 refrigerator for about 10 or 15 minutes 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.009
 only so that it is finished 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.750
 compact now is the time to 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.000
 prepare our gelatin or gelatine 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.880
 without flavor and we will occupy for it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.479
 cold water we are going to place him 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.610
 our genetics about 5 or 6 tablespoons 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.100
 we are going to dissolve very well what we integrate 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.560
 perfectly and let rest for some 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.380
 3 minutes we will have one 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.150
 very thick consistency we are going to 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.250
 take to the microwave oven for 30 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.120
 seconds you can also take it to the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.610
 stove 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.770
 based on a bain-marie in case we 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.350
 it has to be 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.760
 consistency similar to liquid and 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.760
 that's what we 're going to reserve 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.950
 Now the simplest thing is to place all the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.359
 mix that we have liquefied in the mold 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.189
 where we already have our base of 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.500
