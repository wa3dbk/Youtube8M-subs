activity for little ones you might find

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.569 
activity for little ones you might find
that<00:01:05.609> the<00:01:05.850> very<00:01:05.880> young<00:01:06.389> children<00:01:07.429> struggle<00:01:08.429> it

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
that the very young children struggle it

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.760 
that the very young children struggle it
with<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> twisting<00:01:09.569> motion<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.679> you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
with that twisting motion so what you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
with that twisting motion so what you
can<00:01:11.039> do<00:01:11.219> with<00:01:11.340> them<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.759> is<00:01:12.030> help<00:01:12.359> them<00:01:12.450> hold

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
can do with them is is help them hold

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.469 
can do with them is is help them hold
and<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.079> they<00:01:13.229> could<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.409> take<00:01:13.740> one

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
and then they could just take one

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
and then they could just take one
actually<00:01:15.479> around<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.590> other<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.549> might

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
actually around the other and they might

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.819 
actually around the other and they might
find<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> easier<00:01:18.539> to<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.810> than<00:01:19.319> actually<00:01:19.649> to

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
find that easier to do than actually to

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.510 
find that easier to do than actually to
twist<00:01:20.130> both<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.329> same<00:01:21.539> time<00:01:22.310> now<00:01:23.310> if

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
twist both at the same time now if

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.709 
twist both at the same time now if
you're<00:01:23.639> wanting<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> challenge<00:01:24.569> your

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
gives the same sort of effect that they

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.010 
gives the same sort of effect that they
get<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> little<00:01:35.119> opportunity<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.630> practice

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
get a little opportunity to practice

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.959 
get a little opportunity to practice
their<00:01:37.200> platting<00:01:37.649> skills<00:01:38.099> and<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.670> kinda

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
their platting skills and it's kinda

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.249 
their platting skills and it's kinda
nice<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.270> play<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.659> because<00:01:39.810> they<00:01:40.079> don't

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
nice to play with because they don't

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.389 
nice to play with because they don't
sort<00:01:40.469> of<00:01:40.529> thought<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:40.799> they're<00:01:41.189> quite

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
sort of thought about they're quite

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.489 
sort of thought about they're quite
rigid<00:01:41.849> and<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.899> make<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.109> little<00:01:43.289> bit

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
rigid and that can make a little bit

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.800 
rigid and that can make a little bit
easier<00:01:44.099> especially<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.579> those<00:01:44.819> early<00:01:45.389> first

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
easier especially for those early first

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.529 
easier especially for those early first
platinum<00:01:46.469> attempts<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.969> also<00:01:48.209> make<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
platinum attempts and they also make a

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.719 
platinum attempts and they also make a
really<00:01:48.630> nice<00:01:48.990> robust<00:01:49.560> candy<00:01:50.399> cane<00:01:50.579> because

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
really nice robust candy cane because

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.599 
really nice robust candy cane because
you've<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:50.999> three<00:01:51.950> pipe<00:01:52.950> cleaners<00:01:53.369> there

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
you've got three pipe cleaners there

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.550 
you've got three pipe cleaners there
rather<00:01:54.209> than<00:01:54.389> just<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.810> two<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.349> little

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
rather than just the two it's a little

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.870 
rather than just the two it's a little
bit

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
bit

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880 
bit
sturdy<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:56.840> there's<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.200> isn't<00:01:57.590> as<00:01:57.770> an

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
sturdy so there's that isn't as an

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.609 
sturdy so there's that isn't as an
option<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.670> what<00:01:59.659> we've<00:01:59.810> done<00:02:00.020> here<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
option and what we've done here the

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.490 
option and what we've done here the
children<00:02:01.030> wanted<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.299> add<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.899> little<00:02:03.140> bit<00:02:03.289> more

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
children wanted to add a little bit more

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.440 
children wanted to add a little bit more
color<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:04.039> them<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.759> course<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.060> could<00:02:05.270> use

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
color to them so of course you could use

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.109 
color to them so of course you could use
different<00:02:05.630> colors<00:02:06.200> pipe<00:02:06.740> cleaners<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:07.820> we

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
different colors pipe cleaners but we

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.220 
different colors pipe cleaners but we
had<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.630> Tim<00:02:09.289> all<00:02:10.150> probably<00:02:11.150> wouldn't<00:02:11.630> have

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
had a Tim all probably wouldn't have

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.890 
had a Tim all probably wouldn't have
been<00:02:12.349> floating<00:02:12.830> around<00:02:12.860> for<00:02:13.220> ages<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.450> we

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
been floating around for ages and we

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.570 
been floating around for ages and we
thought<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.470> perfect<00:02:15.920> job<00:02:16.550> for

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
thought this was the perfect job for

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.059 
thought this was the perfect job for
them<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.390> we've<00:02:17.510> simply<00:02:18.050> just<00:02:18.290> threaded<00:02:18.860> up

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
them and we've simply just threaded up

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.009 
them and we've simply just threaded up
one<00:02:19.599> pipe<00:02:20.599> cleaner<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.530> added<00:02:22.069> on<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:23.269> our

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
one pipe cleaner and added on and our

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.160 
one pipe cleaner and added on and our
selection<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.920> beads<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.150> they<00:02:26.450> do<00:02:26.510> fine

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
selection of beads and they do fine

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.589 
selection of beads and they do fine
through<00:02:27.530> really<00:02:27.800> really<00:02:27.920> easily<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.849> to

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
through really really easily and to

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.350 
through really really easily and to
secure<00:02:30.170> what<00:02:30.410> we<00:02:30.590> eat<00:02:30.799> song<00:02:31.130> end<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:32.060> can't

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
secure what we eat song end you can't

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.830 
secure what we eat song end you can't
just<00:02:32.569> fold<00:02:32.959> up<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.590> very<00:02:33.980> very<00:02:34.310> base<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:35.000> your

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
just fold up the very very base of your

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.150 
just fold up the very very base of your
pipe<00:02:36.049> cleaner<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.500> make<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.890> little<00:02:36.980> bit

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
pipe cleaner to make it a little bit

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160 
pipe cleaner to make it a little bit
thicker<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.940> then<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.330> bead<00:02:38.510> can<00:02:38.780> simply

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
thicker and then the bead can simply

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.770 
thicker and then the bead can simply
sort<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.440> sit<00:02:39.769> on<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.670> top<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.420> holds

sort of sit on the top of that and holds
into<00:02:42.049> place<00:02:42.319> or<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.549> could<00:02:43.790> even<00:02:43.940> dab<00:02:44.750> a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
into place or you could even dab a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.720 
into place or you could even dab a
little<00:02:44.930> bit<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.349> glue<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.799> love<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.220> who<00:02:46.430> glue
