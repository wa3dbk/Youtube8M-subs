00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
no I just tested the globe plugs and

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.410 
no I just tested the globe plugs and
multimeter<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.819> the<00:00:05.819> one<00:00:05.940> I'm<00:00:06.089> filling

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
multimeter and the one I'm filling

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.080 
multimeter and the one I'm filling
before<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.990> open<00:00:07.410> circuit<00:00:07.950> all<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.820> rest<00:00:08.970> of

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
before is open circuit all the rest of

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.910 
before is open circuit all the rest of
the<00:00:09.179> motor<00:00:09.389> mount<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.690> same<00:00:09.990> but<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> will

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
the motor mount the same but I will

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.120 
the motor mount the same but I will
still<00:00:11.490> remove<00:00:11.849> them<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.360> see<00:00:12.630> how<00:00:13.500> glowy<00:00:13.799> they

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
still remove them and see how glowy they

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.210 
still remove them and see how glowy they
actually<00:00:14.580> are<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.440> probably<00:00:16.440> replace<00:00:16.949> them

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
actually are and probably replace them

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.370 
actually are and probably replace them

all this one is gone they've all done
the<00:00:19.529> same<00:00:19.560> their<00:00:20.070> work<00:00:20.750> they're<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:21.869> probably

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the same their work they're all probably

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.870

smell like burning oil but this engine

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.120 
smell like burning oil but this engine
is<00:01:13.890> using<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.729> oil<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.180> didn't<00:01:15.540> notice

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
is using a bit of oil I didn't notice

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.179 
is using a bit of oil I didn't notice
because<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.939> black<00:01:18.509> black<00:01:19.500> smokes

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189

in I need to move this thing put in your
fuel<00:02:25.180> filter<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:27.490> damn<00:02:27.700> thumbs

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
fuel filter on it so it's damn thumbs

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.540 
fuel filter on it so it's damn thumbs
stuffed<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.440> can't<00:02:29.709> climb<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:32.550> usually

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
stuffed so I can't climb it so usually

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.430 
stuffed so I can't climb it so usually
you<00:02:33.640> can't<00:02:33.970> can<00:02:34.240> crank<00:02:34.510> Prime<00:02:34.840> these<00:02:35.080> things

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
you can't can crank Prime these things

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.270 
you can't can crank Prime these things
so<00:02:35.950> see<00:02:36.190> how<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.580> go<00:02:37.709> going<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.770> take<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> while

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
so see how I go going to take a while

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.780 
so see how I go going to take a while
maybe<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.970> charge<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.540> battery<00:02:44.190> now<00:02:45.190> cuz<00:02:45.550> that

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
maybe a charge of a battery now cuz that

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.620 
maybe a charge of a battery now cuz that
damn<00:02:46.060> priming<00:02:46.810> pump<00:02:47.050> doesn't<00:02:47.620> work<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:48.070> got<00:02:48.100> my

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
damn priming pump doesn't work I got my

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.900 
damn priming pump doesn't work I got my
syringe<00:02:49.630> anomaly<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:50.730> sucking<00:02:51.730> out

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
syringe anomaly is for sucking out

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.540 
syringe anomaly is for sucking out
reservoirs<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.690> brake<00:02:52.900> fluid<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:54.190> put<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> hose

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
reservoirs of brake fluid and put a hose

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.210 
reservoirs of brake fluid and put a hose
on<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.180> threw<00:02:55.900> some<00:02:56.170> fuel<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.590> until<00:02:57.130> it

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
on it and I threw some fuel up until it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.699 
on it and I threw some fuel up until it
came<00:02:57.400> into<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.760> syringe<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.420> took<00:02:59.019> about<00:02:59.110> ten

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
came into the syringe I took about ten

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.050 
came into the syringe I took about ten
calls<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.280> there<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.700> go

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
calls and there you go

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.180 
calls and there you go
filter<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.450> school<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.500> connected<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:03.070> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
filter the school so connected up the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.190 
filter the school so connected up the
engine<00:03:03.519> again<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.030> hopefully<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:04.660> own<00:03:04.840> pump

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
engine again so hopefully it's own pump

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.040 
engine again so hopefully it's own pump
can<00:03:05.440> pull<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.769> through<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.810> where<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.900> comes

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
can pull it through and where it comes

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.320 
can pull it through and where it comes
to<00:03:08.290> worst<00:03:08.470> I'll<00:03:08.769> just<00:03:08.950> bleed<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> little<00:03:09.940> bit<00:03:10.180> up

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
to worst I'll just bleed a little bit up

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.800 
to worst I'll just bleed a little bit up
to<00:03:10.480> here<00:03:10.600> bit<00:03:10.780> well<00:03:14.970> now<00:03:15.970> let's<00:03:16.209> see<00:03:16.300> if<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.630> can

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
to here bit well now let's see if I can

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.759 
to here bit well now let's see if I can
get<00:03:16.959> itself<00:03:17.320> going<00:03:17.620> now<00:03:17.950> if<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.130> need<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:19.769> take

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
get itself going now if I need to take

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.130 
get itself going now if I need to take
off<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.130> return<00:03:21.459> lines<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.209> pull<00:03:22.780> fuel

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
off the return lines and pull fuel

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
off the return lines and pull fuel
through<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.590> way<00:03:25.620> looks<00:03:26.620> like<00:03:26.799> it's<00:03:26.980> going

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
through that way looks like it's going

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.150 
through that way looks like it's going
inject<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.790> leak<00:03:29.130> yeah

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
inject a leak yeah

00:03:31.160 --> 00:04:02.640 
inject a leak yeah
I<00:03:44.860> don't<00:03:45.860> think

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.600 

yeah<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:04.489> might<00:04:04.730> go<00:04:09.069> see<00:04:10.069> what<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.400> look<00:04:10.580> like

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
yeah it might go see what it look like

00:04:10.610 --> 00:05:00.189 
yeah it might go see what it look like
on<00:04:11.090> behind

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.179 

camera<00:05:00.740> sees<00:05:01.060> my<00:05:02.650> time<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.770> get<00:05:03.919> physical

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.189 
camera sees my time to get physical

00:05:04.189 --> 00:06:14.539 
camera sees my time to get physical
tried

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:14.549 

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:21.120 

definitely<00:06:15.549> long

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:07:04.919 

put<00:06:21.910> the<00:06:22.030> fan<00:06:22.300> on<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:22.600> pole<00:06:22.930> I'm<00:06:23.440> cooking<00:06:23.860> today

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:04.929 

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:07.929 

blow-by
