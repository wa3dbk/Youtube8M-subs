benefit of a hoist to get it off the
ground<00:00:25.269> but<00:00:26.269> you<00:00:26.599> know<00:00:26.839> he's<00:00:26.989> jack<00:00:27.259> up<00:00:27.470> your

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.499 
ground but you know he's jack up your

place here there and then one here take
those<00:00:38.269> three<00:00:38.480> bolts<00:00:38.780> out<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:38.960> we<00:00:39.230> had<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> one

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
those three bolts out and we had a one

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.889

place there

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
place there
we're<00:00:47.030> just<00:00:47.149> tucking<00:00:47.390> it<00:00:47.600> out<00:00:47.690> of<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.870> way

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.800 

there's<00:00:51.050> four<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:51.410> back<00:00:51.679> piece<00:00:51.980> right<00:00:52.249> there

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
there's four that back piece right there

there's four that back piece right there
a<00:00:54.550> little<00:00:55.550> tricky<00:00:55.850> to<00:00:55.880> get<00:00:56.090> out<00:00:56.510> there's<00:00:57.230> my

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
a little tricky to get out there's my

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.130 
a little tricky to get out there's my
stubby<00:00:58.450> 13<00:00:59.450> or<00:00:59.930> my<00:01:00.110> stubby<00:01:00.740> Philips<00:01:02.020> then<00:01:03.020> we

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
stubby 13 or my stubby Philips then we

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.100 
stubby 13 or my stubby Philips then we
have<00:01:03.260> pretty<00:01:03.470> nice<00:01:03.740> access<00:01:05.020> to<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.490> belt<00:01:08.110> you

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
have pretty nice access to the belt you

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.550 
have pretty nice access to the belt you
can<00:01:09.200> see<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.530> routing<00:01:09.860> here

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.350 

just<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.680> our<00:01:19.800> tension<00:01:20.160> right<00:01:20.370> here

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.730 

three-eighths<00:01:24.360> I'll<00:01:25.140> fit<00:01:25.410> in<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.560> square

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
three-eighths I'll fit in the square

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
three-eighths I'll fit in the square
hole<00:01:29.000> right<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:35.150> turn<00:01:36.150> my<00:01:36.270> wrench<00:01:36.480> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
hole right in there turn my wrench to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.840 
hole right in there turn my wrench to
the<00:01:36.690> off<00:01:36.960> position<00:01:37.260> and<00:01:37.800> we<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.220> simply

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the off position and we can just simply

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.390 
the off position and we can just simply
go<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.750> way<00:01:42.710> that's<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.920> needed<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.220> do

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
go this way that's all I needed to do

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.000 
go this way that's all I needed to do
I'm<00:01:45.270> gonna<00:01:45.450> take<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> belt<00:01:45.930> off

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.480 

and<00:01:52.010> then<00:01:52.190> route<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.520> belt<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:54.710> course<00:01:54.770> and

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
and then route the belt of course and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.970 
and then route the belt of course and
then<00:02:00.250> put<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.370> back<00:02:01.400> on<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:02.650> think<00:02:03.650> what<00:02:03.830> we'll

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
then put it back on I think what we'll

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.700 
then put it back on I think what we'll
be<00:02:04.100> doing<00:02:04.280> is<00:02:04.580> pulling<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:05.330> down<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:06.560> this

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
be doing is pulling this down to this

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.340 
be doing is pulling this down to this
position<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:08.270> we'll<00:02:08.390> take<00:02:08.540> it<00:02:08.600> off<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:09.050> top

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
position and we'll take it off that top

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.230 
position and we'll take it off that top
pulley<00:02:09.890> up<00:02:10.100> there<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.610> might<00:02:10.820> be<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.090> best

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
pulley up there that might be the best

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.050 
pulley up there that might be the best
spot

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.559 

just<00:02:16.870> want<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.140> show<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.410> that's<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.800> did

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
just want to show you that's what I did

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.990 
just want to show you that's what I did
took<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.690> off<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.170> top<00:02:20.560> pulley<00:02:20.890> up<00:02:21.069> there<00:02:21.370> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
took it off the top pulley up there and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.750 
took it off the top pulley up there and
then<00:02:22.630> back<00:02:22.840> there<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.470> little<00:02:24.310> bit<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> tight

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
then back there a little bit of a tight

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.430 
then back there a little bit of a tight
fit<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.270> alternator<00:02:25.690> back<00:02:25.989> there<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:26.410> I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
fit on the alternator back there but I

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.370 
fit on the alternator back there but I
did<00:02:26.680> get<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.980> off<00:02:27.099> and<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:28.720> take<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.020> off<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
did get it off and just take it off the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:41.600 
did get it off and just take it off the
rest<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> way<00:02:36.989> should<00:02:37.989> slide<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:38.739> behind

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.009 

attention<00:02:42.610> you're<00:02:42.730> pulling<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.150> that

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.340 

and<00:02:47.019> it's<00:02:47.200> off<00:02:48.600> reverse<00:02:49.600> procedure<00:02:50.110> to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
and it's off reverse procedure to

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.250 
and it's off reverse procedure to
install

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.699

so ever new belt wrapped on the AC the
power<00:02:57.920> steering<00:02:59.709> right<00:03:00.709> around<00:03:00.950> here<00:03:01.400> looked

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
power steering right around here looked

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.900 
power steering right around here looked
at<00:03:02.360> behind<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.780> tensioner<00:03:03.489> we'll<00:03:04.489> just<00:03:04.730> draw

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
at behind the tensioner we'll just draw

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:17.380 
at behind the tensioner we'll just draw
this<00:03:05.090> back<00:03:05.390> here<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.830> alternator<00:03:16.390> drum

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
this back here to the alternator drum

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.600 
this back here to the alternator drum
the<00:03:17.510> alternator<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.080> noise<00:03:18.440> our<00:03:18.620> tensioner

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
the alternator the noise our tensioner

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.550 
the alternator the noise our tensioner
and<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:20.360> course<00:03:20.569> pull<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.900> back<00:03:21.050> like<00:03:21.230> we<00:03:21.380> did

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
and of course pull it back like we did

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.059 
and of course pull it back like we did
before<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.280> put<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.239> on<00:03:23.330> that<00:03:23.480> top<00:03:23.989> pulley<00:03:24.769> and

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.890 
before and put it on that top pulley and
be<00:03:25.400> done<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.970> I'm<00:03:32.060> pulling<00:03:32.269> down<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.600> this

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
be done so I'm pulling down on this

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.620 
be done so I'm pulling down on this
tensioner<00:03:33.680> assembly<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:35.000> I've<00:03:35.150> wrapped<00:03:35.450> it

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
tensioner assembly and I've wrapped it

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.800 
tensioner assembly and I've wrapped it
around<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.769> alternator<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:38.600> we're<00:03:38.720> just

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
around the alternator and we're just

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.020 
around the alternator and we're just
gonna<00:03:38.989> lift<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.410> up<00:03:39.590> over<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.459> last<00:03:40.640> play

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
gonna lift it up over that last play

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.420 
gonna lift it up over that last play
right<00:03:41.239> there<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.799> we<00:03:42.920> can<00:03:43.069> release<00:03:43.250> the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
right there and we can release the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.070 
right there and we can release the
tension<00:03:43.670> but<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.299> do<00:03:44.420> need<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.630> pull<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
tension but you do need to pull the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.110 
tension but you do need to pull the
tension<00:03:45.530> R<00:03:45.769> down<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.670> put<00:03:46.850> it<00:03:46.910> on<00:03:47.000> the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
tension R down to put it on the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.660 
tension R down to put it on the
alternator<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.780> back<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.430> pulley

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
alternator in the back and that pulley

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.140 
alternator in the back and that pulley
on<00:03:50.239> top

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.460 

so<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.270> pulleys<00:03:57.570> on<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.140> do<00:03:58.290> want<00:03:58.440> to

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
so the pulleys on and you do want to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.610 
so the pulleys on and you do want to
double-check<00:03:59.450> make<00:04:00.450> sure<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.020> belt<00:04:01.440> is

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
double-check make sure that the belt is

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.660 
double-check make sure that the belt is
actually<00:04:01.980> riding<00:04:02.340> in<00:04:02.490> all<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.760> grooves<00:04:04.670> mine

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
actually riding in all the grooves mine

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.540 
actually riding in all the grooves mine
is<00:04:05.850> actually<00:04:06.410> not<00:04:07.410> on<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.740> power<00:04:07.950> string<00:04:08.400> all

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
is actually not on the power string all

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.690 
is actually not on the power string all
the<00:04:08.580> way<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.060> did<00:04:09.240> have<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:10.490> relieve<00:04:11.490> some

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the way so I did have to relieve some

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.310 
the way so I did have to relieve some
tension<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.180> make<00:04:12.570> sure<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.780> got<00:04:12.870> slowed<00:04:13.170> down

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
tension and make sure it got slowed down

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:21.470 
tension and make sure it got slowed down
there<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:15.240> belt<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.630> now<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:20.330> started<00:04:21.330> up

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
there but the belt is now on started up

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.690 
there but the belt is now on started up
just<00:04:22.410> start<00:04:22.650> up<00:04:22.800> quick<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.430> I'll<00:04:23.520> make<00:04:23.670> sure

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
just start up quick and I'll make sure

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.390 
just start up quick and I'll make sure
the<00:04:23.940> belts<00:04:24.180> ride<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:24.540> true<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.050> straight<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
the belts ride and true and straight and

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.010 
the belts ride and true and straight and
you<00:04:26.490> can<00:04:26.610> put<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:26.820> back<00:04:26.850> together<00:04:27.120> for<00:04:27.900> your

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
you can put it back together for your
