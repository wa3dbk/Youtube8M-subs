based<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:34.040> pink<00:02:35.040> tinted<00:02:35.700> sort<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.420> like

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
based a pink tinted sort of like

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.089 
based a pink tinted sort of like
highlight<00:02:37.110> for<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.379> cheekbones<00:02:37.890> or

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
something like that so that's really

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.300 
something like that so that's really
awesome<00:02:39.720> peripheral<00:02:40.530> products<00:02:40.860> are<00:02:40.980> quite

awesome peripheral products are quite
expensive<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.420> think<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.019> a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
expensive so I think that this is a

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050 
expensive so I think that this is a
great<00:02:43.379> product<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:44.010> get<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.400> your<00:02:44.549> box<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
next product in my box is a really

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.369 
next product in my box is a really
interesting<00:02:47.400> one<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.329> actually<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> thermal

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
interesting one it's actually a thermal

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.170 
interesting one it's actually a thermal
spring<00:02:49.739> water<00:02:50.040> spray<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.849> have<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> feeling

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
spring water spray and I have a feeling

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.259 
spring water spray and I have a feeling
it's<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.870> bit<00:02:52.170> comparable<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.069> mac<00:02:53.340> fix+<00:02:53.879> so

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
it's a bit comparable to the mac fix+ so

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.449 
it's a bit comparable to the mac fix+ so
let's<00:02:54.750> see<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.319> um<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.950> might<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.430> to

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
let's see if it is um I might have to

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.160 
let's see if it is um I might have to
try<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:56.910> out<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.420> let<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:57.780> guys<00:02:57.930> know

out for an updated sort of review on

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.050 
out for an updated sort of review on
this<00:03:05.099> but<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.370> think<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.700> an<00:03:05.879> awesome

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
this but I think this is an awesome

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.900 
this but I think this is an awesome
product<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.079> unique<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.010> something<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.489> I

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
product so unique and something that I

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.819 
product so unique and something that I
probably<00:03:09.540> wouldn't<00:03:09.900> buy<00:03:10.019> for<00:03:10.200> myself<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.680> it's

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
probably wouldn't buy for myself so it's

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.190 
probably wouldn't buy for myself so it's
cool<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.130> get<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.790> try<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.090> out<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.540> yeah<00:03:13.170> I

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
cool to get it and try it out and yeah I

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.660 
cool to get it and try it out and yeah I
think<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.560> might<00:03:13.650> be<00:03:13.709> comparable<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.519> mac

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
think it might be comparable to the mac

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.030 
think it might be comparable to the mac
fix+<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.569> let's<00:03:15.750> see<00:03:15.870> how<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.019> goes<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.769> next

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
fix+ so let's see how that goes the next

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.039 
fix+ so let's see how that goes the next
