00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.270 
bit hey let's just bring it down a
little<00:01:37.870> bit<00:01:38.080> darker<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.620> then<00:01:38.830> let's<00:01:39.040> mess

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
little bit darker and then let's mess

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.700 
little bit darker and then let's mess
with<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.550> material<00:01:39.909> properties<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.470> here

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
with the material properties so here

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.560 
with the material properties so here
we've<00:01:41.950> got<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.430> bunch<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.729> effects<00:01:43.060> like<00:01:43.270> all<00:01:43.450> of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
we've got a bunch of effects like all of

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.969 
we've got a bunch of effects like all of
our<00:01:43.659> parts<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.140> game<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.470> can<00:01:44.590> mess<00:01:44.770> with

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
our parts in the game you can mess with

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.219 
our parts in the game you can mess with
the<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.610> know<00:01:45.940> how<00:01:46.060> much<00:01:46.210> how<00:01:46.360> metal<00:01:46.659> it<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:46.780> if

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
the you know how much how metal it is if

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.260 
the you know how much how metal it is if
it's<00:01:47.409> rubber<00:01:47.620> if<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.130> cloth<00:01:48.400> in<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:49.090> case

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
it's rubber if it's cloth in this case

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.430 
it's rubber if it's cloth in this case
for<00:01:49.479> carts<00:01:49.750> we<00:01:49.870> have<00:01:49.990> what's<00:01:50.200> called<00:01:50.320> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
for carts we have what's called the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.770 
for carts we have what's called the
candy<00:01:50.799> coating<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.850> that's<00:01:52.000> how<00:01:52.120> glossy<00:01:52.510> it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
candy coating and that's how glossy it

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.100 
candy coating and that's how glossy it
is<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.170> how<00:01:53.409> some<00:01:53.890> cars<00:01:54.159> have<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.520> secondary

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
is and how some cars have that secondary

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.240 
is and how some cars have that secondary
color<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.500> paint<00:01:56.680> job<00:01:56.860> where<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.130> can

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
color in the paint job where you can

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.039 
color in the paint job where you can
wear<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.520> or<00:01:57.640> hits<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.120> light<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:58.659> I'm<00:01:58.870> going

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
wear it or hits the light so I'm going

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.870 
wear it or hits the light so I'm going
to<00:01:59.080> crank<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.409> metal<00:01:59.650> up<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.830> bit<00:02:00.010> because<00:02:00.640> I

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
to crank the metal up a bit because I

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.090 
to crank the metal up a bit because I
like<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.240> nice<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.570> shiny

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.680 

so<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.610> little<00:02:05.880> bit<00:02:06.150> too<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.570> we're

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
so that's a little bit too much so we're

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.590 
so that's a little bit too much so we're
gonna<00:02:06.780> dial<00:02:07.020> are<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> now<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.240> got<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> nice

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
gonna dial are down so now we got a nice

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.780 
gonna dial are down so now we got a nice
shiny<00:02:09.929> shiny<00:02:10.350> metal<00:02:10.679> car<00:02:10.979> which<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.250> good<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
shiny shiny metal car which is good and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.030 
shiny shiny metal car which is good and
now<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.930> we've<00:02:13.050> got<00:02:13.200> our<00:02:13.230> body<00:02:13.500> let's<00:02:13.830> go

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
now that we've got our body let's go

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.270 
now that we've got our body let's go
pick<00:02:14.430> some<00:02:14.580> other<00:02:14.700> parts<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:16.080> let's<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.980> an

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
pick some other parts so let's get an

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760 
pick some other parts so let's get an
engine<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.880> here<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:19.080> old<00:02:19.260> standard<00:02:19.590> engine

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
engine in here the old standard engine

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.710 
engine in here the old standard engine
works<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.250> fine<00:02:20.490> but<00:02:20.730> we've<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.330> lots<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
works just fine but we've got lots of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.270 
works just fine but we've got lots of
other<00:02:21.870> cool<00:02:22.050> engines<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.950> we've<00:02:23.040> got<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> bunch

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
other cool engines so we've got a bunch

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.250 
other cool engines so we've got a bunch
of<00:02:23.400> standard<00:02:23.760> engines<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.510> choose<00:02:24.720> from

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.480 

here's<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.350> nice<00:02:28.500> little<00:02:28.560> truck<00:02:28.980> engine<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
here's a nice little truck engine and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.100 
here's a nice little truck engine and
then<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:29.820> start<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.150> go<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.330> your<00:02:30.630> fantasy

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
then we start to go to your fantasy

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.480 
then we start to go to your fantasy
engines<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.650> have<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.920> unlock<00:02:32.190> like

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
engines that you have to unlock like

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.890 
engines that you have to unlock like
your<00:02:32.760> your<00:02:33.720> battery<00:02:34.020> pack<00:02:34.260> or<00:02:35.239> your<00:02:36.239> rocket

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
your your battery pack or your rocket

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.490 
your your battery pack or your rocket
engine<00:02:38.840> maybe<00:02:39.840> you're<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> great--you're

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
engine maybe you're a great--you're

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.530 
engine maybe you're a great--you're
green<00:02:41.010> person<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:41.670> you've<00:02:41.820> got<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> solar<00:02:42.300> cell

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
green person so you've got a solar cell

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.170 
green person so you've got a solar cell
for<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.020> here<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.800> you're<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.820> exact

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
for you in here if you're the exact

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.180 
for you in here if you're the exact
opposite<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.600> green<00:02:45.840> we've<00:02:46.050> got<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> nuclear

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
opposite of green we've got the nuclear

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.580 
opposite of green we've got the nuclear
engine<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:48.570> it's<00:02:48.810> basically<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.440> to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
engine so it's basically up to you to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.229 
engine so it's basically up to you to
create<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.920> kind<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.459> crazy<00:02:50.670> cart<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.150> I

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
create the kind of like crazy cart and I

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.720 
create the kind of like crazy cart and I
think<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:52.380> even<00:02:52.410> have<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:54.800> hamster<00:02:55.800> wheel<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.250> if

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
think we even have a hamster wheel so if

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.820 
think we even have a hamster wheel so if
you're<00:02:57.270> hopefully<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.200> don't<00:02:58.290> find<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.620> too

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
you're hopefully you don't find that too

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.430 
you're hopefully you don't find that too
cruel<00:02:59.070> but<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.400> hamster<00:02:59.900> goes<00:03:00.900> really<00:03:01.170> fast

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
cruel but this hamster goes really fast

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.320 
cruel but this hamster goes really fast
and<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.430> going<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.700> go<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.030> rocket

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
and I'm going to go for the rocket

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.949 
and I'm going to go for the rocket
powered<00:03:03.510> engine<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:06.330> there<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:06.570> go<00:03:06.600> we<00:03:06.840> got<00:03:06.930> a

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
powered engine so there we go we got a

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.920 
powered engine so there we go we got a
sweet<00:03:07.230> jet<00:03:07.410> engine<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.800> their<00:03:08.660> carts<00:03:09.660> starting

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
sweet jet engine in their carts starting

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.070 
sweet jet engine in their carts starting
to<00:03:09.989> come<00:03:10.110> together<00:03:10.580> now<00:03:11.580> let's<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.750> some

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
to come together now let's get some

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.580 
to come together now let's get some
accessories<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.780> again<00:03:16.019> we've<00:03:16.140> broken<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.500> up

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
accessories so again we've broken it up

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.870 
accessories so again we've broken it up
into<00:03:16.709> zones<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:17.820> just

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
into zones for you so you can just

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.160 
into zones for you so you can just
really<00:03:18.239> get<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.660> where<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.900> need<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.140> go

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
really get to where you need to go

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.990 
really get to where you need to go
really<00:03:19.530> fast<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.220> I'm<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.880> get

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
really fast so I'm going to get
