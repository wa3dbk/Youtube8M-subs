00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.719
 hello today I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.070
 how I made this fall look 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.050
 I think it's really an eye hair pike 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.209
 under this my favorite color le 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.820
 lips is a bit in between for the fall 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.439
 barry and red and i the cattle 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.489
 combined with brown and one 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.050
 olive green color 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.669
 I'm going to show you how I race 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.869
 made so you were allowed to 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.759
 curious about it then you just have to 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.860
 keep looking at what i'm starting with is the 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.239
 dia telecom may focus on this fall 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.160
 I sometimes found it difficult to weigh 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.739
 spots and therefore your foundation goes 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.290
 and often no more beautiful than 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.760
 break a pore minimizer on the and that 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.800
 makes the mother more pores less 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.600
 become visible and provide tape at the same time 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.320
 for a base in the places where mine 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 house or it is there 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.579
 then nothing i sick two of whose 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.949
 max factor 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.510
 so that it becomes the ideal color for me and 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.540
 I then apply it with a buffer 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.540
 brush 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.570
 smiley concealer from essence and I am 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.119
 Carmar necessary so up there some 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.469
 places where could purify and that is me 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.469
 again with the same post 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:37.100
 I do use your favorite powder from 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.570
 mac and her colleague much more than directly 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.580
 my eyebrows at colors and the doe 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.830
 i 'm a better say of 11 and slash 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.620
 could see say with five starts at the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.340
 top and a week always within the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.340
 section like that 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.260
 in 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.260
 I can pretty much continue 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.020
 and then I go to quite eyeshadow base 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.939
 important because otherwise you stay 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.770
 eyeshadow just doesn't sit properly 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.769
 I start with a brown color of rimmel 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.090
 and I apply it to the bottom of my eyelid 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.090
 is really against my eyelashes 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.299
 and now use olive green color from 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.519
 mac and I'm going up there applicators 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.629
 work as it were in layers normally 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.849
 I work I go from the inside out 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.909
 but the element works from bottom to bottom 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.909
 above 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.560

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.970

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.680
 I apply under my eyebrow 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.070
 a highlight and there I go everything 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.070
 with blending 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.599
