00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:03.379 
how do you land players we're here with

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.380 
how do you land players we're here with
another<00:00:03.409> quick<00:00:03.919> gear<00:00:04.370> review<00:00:04.790> and<00:00:05.000> today

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
another quick gear review and today

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.110 
another quick gear review and today
we've<00:00:06.260> got<00:00:06.590> the<00:00:06.920> platypus<00:00:07.700> big<00:00:08.029> zip<00:00:08.390> a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
we've got the platypus big zip a

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.120 
we've got the platypus big zip a
hydration<00:00:11.120> pack<00:00:11.300> so<00:00:12.140> this<00:00:12.350> is<00:00:12.500> a<00:00:12.530> three<00:00:12.920> liter

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
hydration pack so this is a three liter

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.670 
hydration pack so this is a three liter
pouch<00:00:13.460> or<00:00:13.790> a<00:00:13.849> hundred<00:00:14.300> ounces<00:00:14.750> however<00:00:15.500> this

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
pouch or a hundred ounces however this

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.349 
pouch or a hundred ounces however this
might<00:00:15.889> be<00:00:16.070> a<00:00:16.099> big<00:00:16.429> one<00:00:16.609> but<00:00:16.789> they<00:00:16.880> do<00:00:16.939> come<00:00:17.240> in

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
might be a big one but they do come in

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.540 
might be a big one but they do come in
different<00:00:17.390> sizes<00:00:18.019> so<00:00:18.409> depends<00:00:19.249> on<00:00:19.339> what<00:00:19.429> you

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
different sizes so depends on what you

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.460 
different sizes so depends on what you
need<00:00:19.579> so<00:00:20.539> we've<00:00:20.720> had<00:00:20.839> these<00:00:20.989> for<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:21.230> little

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
need so we've had these for a little

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.309 
need so we've had these for a little
while<00:00:21.619> and<00:00:21.859> they<00:00:22.759> replaced<00:00:23.239> an<00:00:23.749> older<00:00:24.050> set<00:00:24.230> of

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:24.319 
while and they replaced an older set of

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.269 
while and they replaced an older set of
Nalgene<00:00:25.480> pouches<00:00:26.480> that<00:00:26.659> we<00:00:26.779> have<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.279> some

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
Nalgene pouches that we have and some

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.829 
Nalgene pouches that we have and some
things<00:00:28.460> about<00:00:28.640> this<00:00:28.819> that<00:00:28.880> are<00:00:29.269> just<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:29.659> cut

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
things about this that are just a cut

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.170 
things about this that are just a cut
above<00:00:30.109> is<00:00:30.679> that<00:00:31.159> it's<00:00:31.460> got<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:31.880> biggest

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
above is that it's got the biggest

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.630 
above is that it's got the biggest
feature<00:00:32.359> of<00:00:32.599> course<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.199> big<00:00:33.379> zip<00:00:33.649> which

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
feature of course is the big zip which

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.270 
feature of course is the big zip which
is<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.059> zipper<00:00:35.750> bag<00:00:35.930> type<00:00:36.289> of<00:00:36.469> closure<00:00:36.890> at<00:00:37.190> the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
is the zipper bag type of closure at the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.970 
is the zipper bag type of closure at the
top<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:37.910> makes<00:00:38.149> it<00:00:38.269> really<00:00:38.600> easy<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.260> clean

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
top this makes it really easy to clean

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.970 
top this makes it really easy to clean
to<00:00:40.550> filled<00:00:40.850> empty<00:00:41.329> no<00:00:41.809> matter<00:00:41.960> like<00:00:42.260> what<00:00:42.500> your

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
to filled empty no matter like what your

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.000 
to filled empty no matter like what your
situation<00:00:43.190> is<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:45.079> just<00:00:45.230> pop<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.649> air<00:00:45.829> out

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
situation is and just pop the air out

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.720 
situation is and just pop the air out
and<00:00:46.250> then<00:00:47.500> this<00:00:48.500> clamp<00:00:48.920> slides<00:00:49.309> right<00:00:49.609> on<00:00:51.730> and

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
and then this clamp slides right on and

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.069 
and then this clamp slides right on and
then<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.089> can<00:00:53.120> test<00:00:53.449> them<00:00:53.600> of<00:00:53.749> course<00:00:53.960> by

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
then you can test them of course by

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.660 
then you can test them of course by
going<00:00:54.199> upside<00:00:54.620> down<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.039> I've<00:00:55.129> never<00:00:55.339> seen<00:00:55.609> a

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
going upside down and I've never seen a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.200 
going upside down and I've never seen a
cop<00:00:55.940> leak<00:00:56.210> yet<00:00:56.920> so<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.339> material<00:00:58.789> is<00:00:58.879> actually

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
cop leak yet so the material is actually

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.819 
cop leak yet so the material is actually
really<00:00:59.329> soft<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.839> flexible<00:01:00.109> but<00:01:00.710> it's

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
really soft and flexible but it's

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.319 
really soft and flexible but it's
actually<00:01:01.219> really<00:01:01.429> tough<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:01.909> you<00:01:01.969> don't<00:01:02.149> don't

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
actually really tough so you don't don't

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.900 
actually really tough so you don't don't
worry<00:01:02.390> too<00:01:02.690> much<00:01:02.719> about<00:01:02.960> puncturing<00:01:03.859> at<00:01:04.760> the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
worry too much about puncturing at the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.200 
worry too much about puncturing at the
bottom<00:01:05.270> it<00:01:05.540> has<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:06.380> valve<00:01:07.040> for<00:01:07.400> connecting<00:01:08.000> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
bottom it has a valve for connecting the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.690 
bottom it has a valve for connecting the
hose<00:01:08.420> which<00:01:08.900> has<00:01:09.110> an<00:01:09.260> easy<00:01:09.440> quick<00:01:09.980> release<00:01:10.310> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
hose which has an easy quick release and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.020 
hose which has an easy quick release and
it's<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.510> pretty<00:01:11.810> easy<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.230> use

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
it's a pretty easy to use

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.130 
it's a pretty easy to use
well<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.120> hose<00:01:14.270> that<00:01:14.480> comes<00:01:14.630> with<00:01:14.870> it<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.110> a

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
well the hose that comes with it is a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.770 
well the hose that comes with it is a
nice<00:01:15.410> clear<00:01:16.010> flexible<00:01:16.300> there's<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.390> nice<00:01:17.540> quick

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
nice clear flexible there's a nice quick

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.420 
nice clear flexible there's a nice quick
disconnect<00:01:18.380> down<00:01:18.530> here<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:18.980> I<00:01:19.040> like<00:01:19.220> this

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
disconnect down here and I like this

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
disconnect down here and I like this
sideways<00:01:19.910> kind<00:01:20.270> it's<00:01:21.140> much<00:01:21.800> better<00:01:22.010> than<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
sideways kind it's much better than the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.420 
sideways kind it's much better than the
kind<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:23.990> kind<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.260> rotates<00:01:24.680> in<00:01:24.920> place<00:01:25.190> I've

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
kind that kind of rotates in place I've

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.830 
kind that kind of rotates in place I've
had<00:01:25.520> some<00:01:25.670> problems<00:01:25.820> with<00:01:26.090> those<00:01:26.330> leaking<00:01:26.720> on

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
had some problems with those leaking on

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.050 
had some problems with those leaking on
other<00:01:27.050> designs<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.370> actually<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.790> same

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
other designs this is actually the same

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.840 
other designs this is actually the same
size<00:01:29.260> connector<00:01:30.260> as<00:01:30.580> some<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.730> other

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
size connector as some of the other

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.150 
size connector as some of the other
brands<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.570> water<00:01:33.200> filters<00:01:33.560> use<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.040> that's

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
brands and water filters use so that's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.310 
brands and water filters use so that's
convenient<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.240> then<00:01:35.780> it's<00:01:35.930> got<00:01:36.050> a<00:01:36.110> nice

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
convenient and then it's got a nice

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.260 
convenient and then it's got a nice
good-sized<00:01:36.920> bite<00:01:37.280> valve<00:01:37.520> that's<00:01:37.940> actually

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
good-sized bite valve that's actually

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.980 
good-sized bite valve that's actually
got<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.450> replaceable<00:01:39.050> inner<00:01:39.350> part<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:41.180> a

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
got a replaceable inner part and a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.690 
got a replaceable inner part and a
locking<00:01:42.230> mechanism<00:01:42.410> which<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.250> really

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
locking mechanism which is really

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.760 
locking mechanism which is really
important<00:01:44.210> always<00:01:45.020> lock<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.470> when<00:01:45.590> you're

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
important always lock it when you're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.440 
important always lock it when you're
transporting<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.640> or<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.940> could<00:01:47.180> set<00:01:47.420> your

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
transporting it or you could set your

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.480 
transporting it or you could set your
pack<00:01:47.720> down<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.470> have<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.040> nice<00:01:49.250> wet

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
pack down on it and have a nice wet

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.150 
pack down on it and have a nice wet
surprise<00:01:49.940> this<00:01:50.750> hose<00:01:51.020> actually<00:01:51.350> comes<00:01:51.950> with<00:01:52.070> a

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
surprise this hose actually comes with a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.890 
surprise this hose actually comes with a
clip<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:52.760> that<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:52.940> can<00:01:53.030> clip<00:01:53.240> it<00:01:53.360> on<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.750> your

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900
