00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.840
 tonight really made us 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.510
 amuse great naples yes goals e 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.940
 show was expecting hamsik 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.220
 pandev create spaces for higuain is 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.590
 it was wayne to make room for them 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.860
 variety of important patterns an attack 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.140
 atomic the challenge is launched yes it is clear 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.359
 that we must talk on the field first 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.010
 you can say something but then read 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.159
 perifano the difference of them did 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.499
 and with it he feels and has declared himself 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.420
 we are openly fighting for 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:40.370
 scudetto didn't hide behind anything 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.859
 scudetto and champions we can do it 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.159
 a wide and competitive rose 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.879
 no I say that every game we have to 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.389
 face it he thought we can 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.479
 to win 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:54.019
 I don't say we have to overcome the challenges 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:56.659
 hard or not this many years he did 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:00.109
 coach says it 's important to have 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:03.109
 this trust in ourselves but every 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.580
 game is important and then we see where 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.590
 we arrive one game at a time 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.690
 the important thing was to start well and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.460
 you did it at the study that 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.950
 imagine a lot of curiosity on the part of 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.500
 study and had to be seen also with 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.840
 make good eras movements of 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.120
 this new naples of benitez however the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.550
 word I want to give it to marco civoli 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.000
 anarco greeting rafa benitez 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.030
 thirty years later he returns to Italy three years 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 three years ago it didn't go very well though 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.450
 I remember a world championship won 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.730
 with the inter 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.220
 in short these are a super cup 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.700
 Super Cup has changed in the past three years 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.040
 benitez remained the same coach 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.460
 no I think that every year we learn a 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.060
 little 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.280
 It is clear that we say a little older 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.560
 this means that if you look a little 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.530
 all in a different way but in 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.700
 terms of what he did there is more or 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.550
 less the same 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.800
 I have a good memory of the fans and it is 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.710
 so many people working with us 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.560
 the only thing and afterwards in the field we have 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.049
 won two trophies but everyone waited 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.239
 something more but clear we have seen 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.889
 after that it was not easy 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.310
 this is a new road this 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:17.810
 new need with a mentality 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.780
 grow up and am very happy for 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.359
 this we have movements of fact 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.329
 very interesting of Naples that has 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:28.400
 changed form as benitez bacone 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.889
 ready to make us believe it was 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.849
 the coach of naples please adriano yes 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:37.609
 already now I welcome back thanks and I wanted 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.889
 show you the action of the goal 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.870
 very beautiful because it shows one 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.489
 characteristic of the team that it is today 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.889
 the capacity of 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.569
 move without a ball and see i 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.579
 movements Hamsik and the callejon 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.439
 higuain shoulders swapping 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.200
 often and opposition here and callejon that 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.549
 good to take the ball and power the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.129
 possession on the trocar field 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.139
 hamsik opponent goes in search of space 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.849
 on the outside and then free at 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.889
 central runner for calaiò that yes 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.480
 throws in at maximum speed an 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.489
 perfect cut then it is good at coming back 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.260
 offside and go for the tap in 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.340
 winning on the hamsik shot of the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.720
 combinations 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.610
 that it is not easy to see the first one already 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.030
 day yes we did when we did the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.250
 choice of size with the people said 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.620
 a player who comes to the real but is not 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.209
 one who played all the games but he 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.920
 he has this quality he can do a 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.200
 cut behind the defense and create one 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.629
 space or an opportunity for him 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.790
 this is why he is a player for us 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.069
 important because the others someone comes 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.709
 between lines to catch the ball but he to 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.010
 doing this is different is difficult 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:46.849
 find it in soccer now thanks 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.380
 we follow fulvio to rafah i do 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.880
 congratulations for tonight's game 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.000
 of course, however , he takes away one 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.500
 curiosity, what is the difference between? 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.480
 how he managed to convince de 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.030
 laurentiis any player the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.980
 ask for the sa26 says his 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.019
 wish while wins moratti to how much 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.709
 apparently she wanted certain players 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:10.190
 noè didn't take them back talking about the 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.739
 future is not the past 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.810
 aurelio de laurentiis always tries to 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:20.950
 buy but did not buy all that me 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.950
 I wanted one this evening 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.630
 but he, as I said before, had done 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.910
 an exposed company made an effort 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.920
 you can always do something more but it is 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.990
 clear that it is not easy I am very 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.140
 satisfied satisfied very happy 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.930
 what the company has done today 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.580
 let 's see the president always said the 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.680
 my best purchase was benitez 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.620
 also in the coastal basin of the seafarers 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.750
 said yes and friend I think he knows 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.150
 that we work strong sure that he 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.090
 agent the unit that says how we work e 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.340
 after the personal report the report 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.130
 personal and good I think he is one 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.260
 clever good person and he has 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.410
 understood that by working if then arriving 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.000
 far away but as I said at the beginning one 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.280
 game at a time we are at the beginning e 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.990
 we have to be a bit with two feet a 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.690
 land absolutely beyond the 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.000
 great purchases if you even found one 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.700
 champion as hamsik and made one 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.130
 there is an extraordinary match with Ivan Zazzaroni 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.480
 for her well preserved I speak more than I do 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.419
 that I would not want to know what i am 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:28.530
 players she wanted because jackson 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.479
 martinez carter is at least smile however 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.280
 real change beyond the i module 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.250
 I saw the 4 2 3 1 very often too 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.050
 with mazzarri it is in the way of playing ie 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.390
 much ball spin compared to the past 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.490
 much less research too 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.450
 vertical and a proper research of the 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.040
 the players improvise this depth 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.830
 instead of midfield well but it is not 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.880
 changed they learned very easily 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.380
 this kind of game because 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.890
 objectively they were used to it 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.770
 otherwise it was clear that they have 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.860
 changed the way of playing a little 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.840
 understand the things they have to do in the field 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.389
 always help 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.760
 the local wine phono attacks on the violin 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.669
 three new deserves quality players 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.830
 which normally did not mention the team 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.020
 strong that they have it with the ball not 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.100
 always above possession 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:22.260
 this helps the other we pan de 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.330
 femmes ego distinguished players who have 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.300
 quality I think we have to use this 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.010
 quality and at the same time use the 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.990
 work the legs that have the 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.720
 midfielder who made a 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.979
 great effort this game e 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.380
 especially last year they have 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.979
 done these things to get to 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.290
 second place 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.810
 we have only thirty seconds to finish 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.060
 time binds juve saw her yesterday 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.050
 as the view I saw the game I have 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.729
 seen a strong one with a good coach 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.380
 sure it will be difficult but we have 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.870
 done our work today we see the 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.669
 next week 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:00.000
 I'm sorry for a moment that I see it 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:02.250
 the better I come I see it in shape 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.740
 if you allow me to lose weight too, I don't know 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.600
 but I see it much more in the form of some 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.270
 long ago gene you mean when they had 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.680
 ask rafah salve are gene dumplings 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.960
 Meanwhile, we'll know why in 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:18.210
 bench on so much you look like paolo 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.500
 bonolis and can also it does not matter and then 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.080
 it's not another thing 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.000
 risk a big one there is a big one 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.490
 improvement with the Italian language in 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.180
 effects however the thing that I ask you is you 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.520
 do more parts with difficulty talking when 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:36.180
 one speaks to you in Italian when he speaks to you 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.380
 de laurentiis I understand very well 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.250
 violent especially when 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.250
 let's talk about the market 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.370
 this is the last thing continues what 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.320
 let us see the socks I do 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.800
 see the football can do if I do n't have it 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.480
 brought by brought a huge not 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:08:00.780
 waiting he had aroused many 

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.780
 congratulations thanks thanks
