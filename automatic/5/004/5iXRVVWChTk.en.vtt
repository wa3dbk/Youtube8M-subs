00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
gender and all sorts of things so I was

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.230 
gender and all sorts of things so I was
worried<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.189> those<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.000> themes

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
short I was worried it would become a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.050 
short I was worried it would become a
super<00:01:31.170> generic<00:01:31.500> action<00:01:32.040> film<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
super generic action film like the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
super generic action film like the
adaptation<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> World<00:01:34.380> War<00:01:34.470> Z<00:01:34.590> which<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
adaptation of World War Z which is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160 
adaptation of World War Z which is
another<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> my<00:01:35.549> favorite<00:01:35.880> books<00:01:36.079> when<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
another one of my favorite books when it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.289 
another one of my favorite books when it
was<00:01:37.290> adapted<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.729> was<00:01:38.970> really

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
was adapted it just it was really

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
was adapted it just it was really
lackluster<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:40.049> my<00:01:40.170> opinion<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:40.950> really

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
lackluster in my opinion I was really

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.830 
lackluster in my opinion I was really
disappointed<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:42.479> worried

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
disappointed with it so I was worried

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
disappointed with it so I was worried
that<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.619> would<00:01:43.829> happen<00:01:43.860> as<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that this would happen as well with the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.030 
that this would happen as well with the
Martian<00:01:45.270> especially<00:01:45.869> considering<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.590> bevy

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
Martian especially considering the bevy

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.090 
Martian especially considering the bevy
of<00:01:47.220> space<00:01:48.000> action<00:01:48.840> films<00:01:49.140> lately<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.799> will

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
admit I was also a little bit worried

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.420

casting<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.800> am<00:02:15.190> sometimes<00:02:15.460> weary<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.030> a-list

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
casting I am sometimes weary of a-list

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.510 
casting I am sometimes weary of a-list
castings<00:02:16.990> but<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.560> really<00:02:18.040> seems<00:02:18.280> like<00:02:18.400> a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
castings but this really seems like a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.370 
castings but this really seems like a
great<00:02:18.880> choice<00:02:19.180> on<00:02:19.450> many<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.990> characters

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
great choice on many of the characters

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.820 
great choice on many of the characters
parts<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.010> like<00:02:21.610> kate<00:02:22.000> mara<00:02:22.270> as<00:02:22.630> Johansson<00:02:23.620> and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
parts I like kate mara as Johansson and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.890 
parts I like kate mara as Johansson and
I<00:02:24.100> really<00:02:24.550> liked<00:02:24.730> Jessica<00:02:24.940> Chastain<00:02:25.570> as

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
I really liked Jessica Chastain as

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.080 
I really liked Jessica Chastain as
commander<00:02:26.620> Lewis<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.190> think<00:02:27.520> those<00:02:27.730> are<00:02:27.760> really

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
commander Lewis I think those are really

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.210 
commander Lewis I think those are really
good<00:02:28.209> choices<00:02:28.540> I'm<00:02:29.170> also<00:02:29.380> really<00:02:29.800> happy<00:02:29.950> about

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
good choices I'm also really happy about

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.980 
good choices I'm also really happy about
the<00:02:30.430> casting<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.880> Donald<00:02:31.300> Glover<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.810> she

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
the casting of Donald Glover and she

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.650 
the casting of Donald Glover and she
would<00:02:32.110> tell<00:02:32.290> Ejiofor<00:02:32.920> as<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.820> people<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.390> NASA

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
would tell Ejiofor as the people in NASA

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.140 
would tell Ejiofor as the people in NASA
I<00:02:35.170> really<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.220> NASA<00:02:36.400> plot<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
I really like the NASA plot in the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150 
I really like the NASA plot in the
novels<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.440> was<00:02:38.560> worried<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.070> would

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
novels and I was worried that it would

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.500 
novels and I was worried that it would
be<00:02:39.280> kind<00:02:39.520> of<00:02:39.580> downplayed<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.300> film

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
be kind of downplayed in the film

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.210 
be kind of downplayed in the film
because<00:02:40.870> obviously<00:02:41.050> it's<00:02:41.440> not<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.709> action<00:02:42.130> II

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
because obviously it's not as action II

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.070 
because obviously it's not as action II
as<00:02:42.400> being<00:02:42.670> an<00:02:42.760> astronaut<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:43.930> that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
as being an astronaut but I like that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.990 
as being an astronaut but I like that
they<00:02:44.260> took<00:02:44.530> careful<00:02:44.980> attention<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.640> how<00:02:45.850> they

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
they took careful attention to how they

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.940 
they took careful attention to how they
cast<00:02:46.239> down<00:02:46.390> as<00:02:46.540> well<00:02:46.690> cuz<00:02:47.320> Kapoor<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.739> one<00:02:47.890> of

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
cast down as well cuz Kapoor is one of

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.380 
cast down as well cuz Kapoor is one of
my<00:02:48.010> favorite<00:02:48.340> characters<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.850> book<00:02:49.060> in

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
my favorite characters in the book in

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.420 
my favorite characters in the book in
the<00:02:49.570> teaser<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.230> characters<00:02:50.620> all<00:02:50.830> interacted

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
the teaser the characters all interacted

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.280 
the teaser the characters all interacted
with<00:02:51.610> each<00:02:51.670> other<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.060> naturally<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:52.900> it

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
with each other so naturally that it

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.410 
with each other so naturally that it
just<00:02:53.500> felt<00:02:53.739> like<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.890> very<00:02:54.190> correct<00:02:54.730> choice<00:02:55.120> and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
just felt like a very correct choice and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.449 
just felt like a very correct choice and
casting<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.050> I'm<00:02:56.260> excited<00:02:56.590> as<00:02:57.190> for<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
casting so I'm excited as for the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.100 
casting so I'm excited as for the
trailer<00:02:57.880> we<00:02:58.090> start<00:02:58.420> out<00:02:58.570> with<00:02:58.600> Mark<00:02:58.930> Watney

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
trailer we start out with Mark Watney

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.050 
trailer we start out with Mark Watney
talking<00:02:59.739> about<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.070> human<00:03:00.310> tendency<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.880> help

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
talking about the human tendency to help

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.300 
talking about the human tendency to help
one<00:03:01.239> another<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.200> really<00:03:02.770> liked<00:03:02.980> how<00:03:03.130> was<00:03:03.280> a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
one another and I really liked how was a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.100 
one another and I really liked how was a
more<00:03:03.520> gentle<00:03:03.880> start<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.390> trailer<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.930> was

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
more gentle start to that trailer I was

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.840 
more gentle start to that trailer I was
kind<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.680> worried<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.010> would<00:03:06.100> be<00:03:06.190> super<00:03:06.489> action

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
kind of worried it would be super action

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.760 
kind of worried it would be super action
he<00:03:07.150> just<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:07.450> loud<00:03:07.690> music<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.170> explosions

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
he just like loud music and explosions

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.400 
he just like loud music and explosions
so<00:03:09.100> this<00:03:09.730> was<00:03:09.940> very<00:03:10.180> nice<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.840> while<00:03:11.290> it

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
so this was very nice and while it

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.990 
so this was very nice and while it
avoided<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.860> lot<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.190> cliches<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
avoided a lot of the cliches of the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.570 
avoided a lot of the cliches of the
summer<00:03:13.270> action<00:03:13.780> film<00:03:13.989> trailer<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.739> do<00:03:15.220> have<00:03:15.549> a

summer action film trailer I do have a
complaint<00:03:16.030> with<00:03:16.239> how<00:03:16.630> much<00:03:16.870> was<00:03:17.049> spoiled<00:03:17.680> as<00:03:18.220> a

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
complaint with how much was spoiled as a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.920 
complaint with how much was spoiled as a
book<00:03:18.610> reader<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:18.910> thought<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.480> trailer<00:03:19.690> was

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
book reader I thought the trailer was

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.930 
book reader I thought the trailer was
fantastic<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:20.830> love<00:03:21.160> seeing<00:03:21.519> how<00:03:21.640> some<00:03:21.910> of

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
fantastic and I love seeing how some of

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.520 
fantastic and I love seeing how some of
the<00:03:22.060> later<00:03:22.269> action<00:03:22.720> scenes<00:03:22.989> in<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.230> book<00:03:23.410> were

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
the later action scenes in the book were

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.710 
the later action scenes in the book were
portrayed<00:03:23.950> however<00:03:24.880> for<00:03:24.970> someone<00:03:25.390> who<00:03:25.480> didn't

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
portrayed however for someone who didn't

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.539 
portrayed however for someone who didn't
read<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.930> books<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.380> spoils<00:03:26.739> way<00:03:26.860> too<00:03:26.920> much<00:03:27.280> I

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
read the books it spoils way too much I

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.520 
read the books it spoils way too much I
mean<00:03:27.760> obviously<00:03:28.239> we<00:03:28.750> need<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.080> know<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.350> mark

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
mean obviously we need to know that mark

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.130 
mean obviously we need to know that mark
Watney<00:03:29.830> is<00:03:29.860> alive<00:03:30.280> but<00:03:31.120> showing<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.780> rescue

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
Watney is alive but showing the rescue

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.710 
Watney is alive but showing the rescue
mission<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.709> goes<00:03:32.890> on<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.519> all<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.600> the

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
mission that goes on and all of the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.690 
mission that goes on and all of the
attempts<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:35.440> are<00:03:35.590> made<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:36.130> rescue<00:03:36.519> mark

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
attempts that are made to rescue mark

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.100 
attempts that are made to rescue mark
Watney<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.269> think<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.660> was<00:03:37.750> just<00:03:37.810> too<00:03:38.080> much

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
Watney I think it was just too much

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.890 
Watney I think it was just too much
since<00:03:39.070> we<00:03:39.220> have<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.489> Hermes<00:03:39.850> teaser<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.510> really

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
since we have the Hermes teaser I really

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.750 
since we have the Hermes teaser I really
don't<00:03:41.110> think<00:03:41.260> we<00:03:41.620> needed<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.070> long<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.700> a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
don't think we needed that long of a

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.729 
don't think we needed that long of a
trailer<00:03:43.269> especially<00:03:43.840> one<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:43.989> spoiled<00:03:44.380> so

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
trailer especially one that spoiled so

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.740 
trailer especially one that spoiled so
much<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.519> teaser<00:03:45.820> let<00:03:46.120> us<00:03:46.239> assess<00:03:46.570> how<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
much the teaser let us assess how the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.810 
much the teaser let us assess how the
characters<00:03:47.230> behave<00:03:47.530> with<00:03:47.709> each<00:03:47.860> other<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:48.430> I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
characters behave with each other so I

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.550 
characters behave with each other so I
think<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.329> trailer<00:03:49.780> could<00:03:49.989> have<00:03:50.079> just<00:03:50.260> ended

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
think the trailer could have just ended

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.020 
think the trailer could have just ended
at<00:03:50.799> Mark<00:03:51.010> watney's<00:03:51.400> attempt<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.850> communicate

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
at Mark watney's attempt to communicate

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.300 
at Mark watney's attempt to communicate
on<00:03:52.630> Mars<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.860> would<00:03:53.950> have<00:03:54.040> been<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.160> lot

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
on Mars and it would have been a lot

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.949 
on Mars and it would have been a lot
more<00:03:54.370> effective<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.120> more<00:03:55.180> spoiler-free

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
more effective and more spoiler-free

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.380 
more effective and more spoiler-free
seeing<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.070> stills<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.670> all<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.940> footage<00:03:58.209> on
