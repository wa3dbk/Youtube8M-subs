which to me is completely

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.510 
which to me is completely
counterintuitive<00:02:03.020> because<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:04.190> entire

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
counterintuitive because the entire

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.940

why would you want to patch that why

would you want to stop the ability to be
make<00:03:50.600> yourself<00:03:51.019> stronger<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:53.120> me<00:03:53.299> the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
make yourself stronger and to me the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.140 
make yourself stronger and to me the
only<00:03:53.780> criticism<00:03:54.049> in<00:03:54.650> this<00:03:54.890> is<00:03:55.040> sure<00:03:55.730> it's<00:03:56.030> a

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
only criticism in this is sure it's a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.970 
only criticism in this is sure it's a
shield<00:03:56.390> that's<00:03:56.630> doing<00:03:56.900> all<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.260> work<00:03:57.440> but<00:03:57.739> if

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
shield that's doing all the work but if

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.740 
shield that's doing all the work but if
you<00:03:58.100> lose<00:03:58.370> your<00:03:58.610> shield<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.269> doesn't<00:03:59.630> work

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
you lose your shield it doesn't work

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.500 
you lose your shield it doesn't work
anymore<00:04:00.049> so<00:04:00.680> it's<00:04:00.829> perfectly<00:04:01.310> balanced<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.120> I

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
anymore so it's perfectly balanced and I

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.960 
anymore so it's perfectly balanced and I
just<00:04:02.709> why<00:04:03.709> would<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.040> cry<00:04:04.190> about<00:04:04.519> something

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
just why would you cry about something

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.290 
just why would you cry about something
that<00:04:05.000> doesn't<00:04:05.180> hurt<00:04:05.870> anyone

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
that doesn't hurt anyone

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.850 
that doesn't hurt anyone
all<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.660> does<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.960> help<00:04:08.140> people<00:04:08.320> it<00:04:08.710> helps

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
all it does is help people it helps

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.910 
all it does is help people it helps
people<00:04:09.130> have<00:04:09.430> more<00:04:09.670> fun<00:04:09.850> with<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.150> game<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:11.140> I

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
people have more fun with the game it I

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.030 
people have more fun with the game it I
just<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.460> don't<00:04:12.700> understand<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.210> at<00:04:13.330> all<00:04:13.480> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
just I don't understand it at all and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.229 
just I don't understand it at all and
one<00:04:15.040> thing<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.370> would<00:04:15.430> say<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.820> they<00:04:16.060> could

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
one thing I would say that they could

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.910 
one thing I would say that they could
patch<00:04:16.480> would<00:04:16.930> be<00:04:17.170> so<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.620> damage

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
patch would be so that the damage

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.800 
patch would be so that the damage
calculation<00:04:18.130> isn't<00:04:18.940> purple<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.570> for<00:04:19.750> the

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
calculation isn't purple it for the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.750 
calculation isn't purple it for the
shotguns<00:04:20.290> because<00:04:20.980> that's<00:04:21.190> when<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.489> damage

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
shotguns because that's when the damage

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.940 
shotguns because that's when the damage
gets<00:04:21.970> really<00:04:22.390> stupid<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:22.990> there's<00:04:23.410> videos<00:04:23.710> of

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
gets really stupid and there's videos of

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.890 
gets really stupid and there's videos of
people<00:04:24.070> killing<00:04:24.430> terramorphous<00:04:24.940> in<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.750> like

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
people killing terramorphous in in like

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.960 
people killing terramorphous in in like
a<00:04:25.930> second<00:04:26.470> people<00:04:27.100> tearing<00:04:27.430> him<00:04:27.550> down<00:04:27.580> really

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
a second people tearing him down really

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.730 
a second people tearing him down really
quickly<00:04:28.270> but<00:04:28.810> one<00:04:28.990> thing<00:04:29.200> you've<00:04:29.350> got<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.530> bear

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
quickly but one thing you've got to bear

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.130 
quickly but one thing you've got to bear
in<00:04:29.770> mind<00:04:29.890> guys<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.550> these<00:04:30.910> people<00:04:31.300> are<00:04:31.630> using<00:04:31.930> a

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
in mind guys is these people are using a

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
set up that you can't realistically do

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.870 
set up that you can't realistically do
unless<00:04:34.480> you<00:04:34.720> specs<00:04:35.340> directly<00:04:36.340> towards<00:04:36.730> that

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
unless you specs directly towards that

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.080 
unless you specs directly towards that
kind<00:04:37.090> of<00:04:37.180> damage<00:04:37.890> like<00:04:38.890> all<00:04:39.250> these<00:04:39.520> videos<00:04:39.880> are

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
kind of damage like all these videos are

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.910 
kind of damage like all these videos are
generally<00:04:40.420> with<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.600> gunzerker<00:04:41.050> wielding

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
generally with the gunzerker wielding

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.180 
generally with the gunzerker wielding
two<00:04:42.010> powerful<00:04:42.490> shotguns<00:04:43.120> using<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.720> b<00:04:43.900> and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
two powerful shotguns using the b and

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.920 
two powerful shotguns using the b and
destroying<00:04:45.190> him<00:04:45.550> but<00:04:46.090> if<00:04:46.210> you<00:04:46.240> tried<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.720> do<00:04:46.810> it

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
destroying him but if you tried to do it

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.570 
destroying him but if you tried to do it
with<00:04:46.960> any<00:04:47.200> other<00:04:47.350> character<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:48.220> would<00:04:48.340> not

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
with any other character you would not

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.460 
with any other character you would not
kill<00:04:48.820> him<00:04:49.030> half<00:04:49.270> as<00:04:49.480> fast<00:04:49.720> because<00:04:50.320> that's

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
kill him half as fast because that's

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.420 
kill him half as fast because that's
just<00:04:50.620> not<00:04:50.800> how<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:51.100> works<00:04:51.720> like<00:04:52.720> that<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:54.160> one

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
just not how it works like that that one

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.620 
just not how it works like that that one
character<00:04:54.850> does<00:04:55.000> so<00:04:55.180> much<00:04:55.300> damage<00:04:55.540> because

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
character does so much damage because

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.540 
character does so much damage because
you<00:04:55.990> can<00:04:56.140> spec<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.650> way<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.040> don't<00:04:57.340> get<00:04:57.460> me

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
you can spec that way and don't get me

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.340 
you can spec that way and don't get me
wrong<00:04:57.700> this<00:04:57.850> boss<00:04:58.090> doesn't<00:04:58.450> last<00:04:58.780> all<00:04:59.020> that
