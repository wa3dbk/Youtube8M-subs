00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.630 
protects the front which is really nice
and<00:02:39.560> then<00:02:40.560> obviously<00:02:40.860> when<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.460> get<00:02:41.610> your

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and then obviously when you get your

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.840 
and then obviously when you get your
destination<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.640> easily<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:47.310> clip<00:02:47.670> the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
destination you can easily just clip the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.270 
destination you can easily just clip the
fans<00:02:48.090> back<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.760> places<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:52.280> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
fans back in to the places you want the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.380 
fans back in to the places you want the
fans<00:02:53.580> are<00:02:53.850> as<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.630> was<00:02:54.750> saying<00:02:54.959> earlier<00:02:55.280> are

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
fans are as I was saying earlier are

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.430 
fans are as I was saying earlier are
very<00:02:57.390> good<00:02:57.630> because<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:57.959> move<00:02:58.260> them

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
very good because you can move them

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.520 
very good because you can move them
about<00:02:59.030> then<00:03:00.030> another<00:03:00.570> good<00:03:00.959> thing<00:03:00.990> is<00:03:01.230> that

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
about then another good thing is that

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.130 
about then another good thing is that
they're<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.310> casing<00:03:02.970> which<00:03:03.630> means<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
they're in this casing which means it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.710 
they're in this casing which means it
can<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.590> soft<00:03:05.340> surfaces<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:06.300> still<00:03:06.570> be

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
can be on soft surfaces and still be

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.080 
can be on soft surfaces and still be
running<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> bed<00:03:07.620> or<00:03:07.650> something<00:03:08.160> whereas

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
running like a bed or something whereas

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.030 
running like a bed or something whereas
other<00:03:09.240> fans<00:03:09.570> they<00:03:10.170> don't<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> case<00:03:10.770> in

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
other fans they don't have a case in

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
fans propellers just hit the soft

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.490 
fans propellers just hit the soft
surface<00:03:14.760> which<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.540> really<00:03:15.870> good<00:03:16.050> about<00:03:16.170> this

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
surface which is really good about this

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.560 
surface which is really good about this
for<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> traveling<00:03:17.790> aspects<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.330> things

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
for the traveling aspects of things

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.030 
for the traveling aspects of things

which protects the fan really wet bar at
the<00:03:52.500> same<00:03:52.709> time<00:03:52.950> it's<00:03:53.310> hard<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.850> open<00:03:54.030> up<00:03:54.360> the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
the same time it's hard to open up the
