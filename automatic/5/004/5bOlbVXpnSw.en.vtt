00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320

with this four-blade broadhead but

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.700 
with this four-blade broadhead but
you're<00:01:10.560> ready<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.950> find<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.560> going

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you're ready to find out this is going

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.850 
you're ready to find out this is going
to<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.010> 20<00:01:14.369> yards<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.530> you're<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.680> going

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
to be at 20 yards and you're just going

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:56.580 
to be at 20 yards and you're just going
to<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> take<00:01:17.460> me<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.820> word

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.660 

so<00:01:57.590> let's<00:01:58.070> see<00:01:58.310> how<00:01:58.490> much<00:01:58.700> penetration<00:01:59.090> we<00:01:59.690> got

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
so let's see how much penetration we got

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.210 
so let's see how much penetration we got
not<00:02:01.670> real<00:02:02.600> great<00:02:04.090> but<00:02:05.090> remember<00:02:06.010> this<00:02:07.010> is<00:02:07.190> a

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
not real great but remember this is a

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.420 
not real great but remember this is a
four-blade<00:02:07.820> broadhead<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:12.680> board<00:02:13.070> is

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
four-blade broadhead and this board is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.280 
four-blade broadhead and this board is
also<00:02:14.350> denser<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.530> thicker<00:02:16.390> than<00:02:17.390> just<00:02:18.140> about

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
also denser and thicker than just about

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.570 
also denser and thicker than just about
any<00:02:19.190> animals<00:02:20.060> bone<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:25.220> going<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.459> go

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
any animals bone and so I'm going to go

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.360 
any animals bone and so I'm going to go
back<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.770> we're<00:02:27.770> going<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.920> do<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.190> again

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
back and we're going to do this again

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.930 
back and we're going to do this again
and<00:02:28.640> also<00:02:28.940> remember<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:30.380> block<00:02:30.800> right<00:02:31.280> here

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and also remember this block right here

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.340 
and also remember this block right here
is<00:02:32.300> designed<00:02:33.020> for<00:02:33.350> stopping<00:02:34.070> broadheads<00:02:35.350> the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
is designed for stopping broadheads the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.729 
is designed for stopping broadheads the
the<00:02:37.010> two<00:02:37.220> blade<00:02:37.580> variety<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:39.170> Stinger<00:02:39.560> and

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
the two blade variety of the Stinger and

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.900 
the two blade variety of the Stinger and
the<00:02:39.830> buzz<00:02:40.010> cut<00:02:40.900> penetrates<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.260> better

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
the buzz cut penetrates this better

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.110 
the buzz cut penetrates this better
these<00:02:43.910> bleeders<00:02:44.510> will<00:02:44.750> tend<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.110> hang<00:02:45.290> up<00:02:45.530> so

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
these bleeders will tend to hang up so

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.520 
these bleeders will tend to hang up so
I'm<00:02:47.120> going<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.330> go<00:02:47.450> back<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.900> do<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.170> again

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
I'm going to go back and do this again

00:02:48.530 --> 00:03:26.240 
I'm going to go back and do this again
and<00:02:48.800> see<00:02:49.610> what<00:02:49.640> happens

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.020 

okay<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:28.890> it's<00:03:29.890> pretty<00:03:30.160> obvious<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.760> it

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
okay so it's pretty obvious that it

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.630 
okay so it's pretty obvious that it
didn't<00:03:31.270> penetrate<00:03:31.420> all<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.230> way<00:03:32.380> through<00:03:32.770> but

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.800 

just<00:03:36.640> like<00:03:36.820> what<00:03:37.090> i<00:03:37.120> said<00:03:39.090> if<00:03:40.090> i'll<00:03:40.360> get<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.720> to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
just like what i said if i'll get it to

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.210 
just like what i said if i'll get it to
focus<00:03:41.610> these<00:03:42.610> leader<00:03:43.150> blades<00:03:43.600> here<00:03:45.720> hang<00:03:46.720> up

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
focus these leader blades here hang up

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.830 
focus these leader blades here hang up
but<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.060> two<00:03:52.300> blade<00:03:52.660> variety

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
but the two blade variety

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.460 
but the two blade variety
from<00:03:55.530> Magnus<00:03:56.930> they<00:03:57.930> penetrate<00:03:58.620> better<00:03:59.000> and<00:04:00.470> no

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
from Magnus they penetrate better and no

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.119 
from Magnus they penetrate better and no
amount<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:02.060> cutting<00:04:03.060> diameter<00:04:04.099> is<00:04:05.099> a

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
amount of cutting diameter is a

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.460 
amount of cutting diameter is a
substitute<00:04:06.000> for<00:04:06.239> penetration<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.230> shot

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
substitute for penetration and shot

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.860 
substitute for penetration and shot
placement<00:04:10.730> did<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.849> go<00:04:12.030> all<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.390> way<00:04:12.420> through

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
placement did it go all the way through

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.439 
placement did it go all the way through
no<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.830> didn't<00:04:14.190> but<00:04:16.669> like<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.820> said<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:18.239> is

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
no it didn't but like I said this is

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.460 
no it didn't but like I said this is
more<00:04:18.690> dense<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.940> harder<00:04:21.079> than<00:04:22.079> just<00:04:22.320> about

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
more dense and harder than just about

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.250 
more dense and harder than just about
any<00:04:22.860> game<00:04:23.250> animal<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.720> might<00:04:24.930> be<00:04:25.110> going

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
any game animal that you might be going

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.670 
any game animal that you might be going
