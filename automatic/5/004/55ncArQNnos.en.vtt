00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
of his in real life interviews was that

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.740 
of his in real life interviews was that
he<00:01:03.320> absolutely<00:01:03.890> hated<00:01:04.699> being<00:01:05.089> called<00:01:05.149> a<00:01:05.479> gamer

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
he absolutely hated being called a gamer

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.440 
he absolutely hated being called a gamer
the<00:01:06.619> reason<00:01:06.920> for<00:01:07.069> this<00:01:07.189> as<00:01:07.369> he<00:01:07.700> described<00:01:08.090> was

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
the reason for this as he described was

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.149 
the reason for this as he described was
because<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:08.990> such<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.200> one-dimensional<00:01:09.979> term

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
because it's such a one-dimensional term

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.279 
because it's such a one-dimensional term
and<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:10.850> completely<00:01:11.299> disregards<00:01:11.869> all<00:01:11.959> other

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
and it completely disregards all other

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.069 
and it completely disregards all other
aspects<00:01:12.889> of<00:01:13.009> his<00:01:13.310> beam<00:01:13.609> so<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.689> can't<00:01:15.020> argue
