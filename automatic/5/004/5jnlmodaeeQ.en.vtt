00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.569
 and 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.130
 I have heard various opinions on the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.380
 issue of sterilization and 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.720
 castration of the cats this is 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.660
 advisable clear jenny is 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.270
 absolutely recommended because 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.300
 a street kitten that can 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.670
 develop your sex life naturally 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.369
 will assemble how much female can 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.279
 find a girl is ready 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.110
 to have a birth every two months and 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.650
 these females can get pregnant 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.500
 five or ten cats and have children ica ica 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.409
 a litter of different cats that is 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.750
 that hormonal overloads are very 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:48.140
 high when you bring a kitten home 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.540
 you can not provide sex 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.430
 that I would have on the street so these 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.290
 overloads will alter your tract 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.900
 player over time can cause 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.239
 cancer tumors 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.650
 and then apart from that it alters its 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.360
 behavior because then it 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.729
 manifest hormonal behaviors 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.850
 marked but when you say that having 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.740
 as the behavior that happens that like 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.979
 they begin to act as 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.470
 with hormones ruffled by the cat 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.350
 You will start urinating all part 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.140
 to attract females to their territory 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.720
 although we have in the part of the kitten 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.509
 in an apartment a cat or a female 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.490
 can sniff the pheromones of 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.039
 reproduction or a female in heat until 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.170
 80 meters away why many of 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.810
 their kittens are thrown out the windows 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.179
 for looking for the female other than that 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.130
 the vocalizations begin 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.490
 meows of the cats in heat are 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.200
 awesome looking for the cat and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.409
 apart that they have their bleeds that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.270
 it's quite annoying I imagine that 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.490
 this has as a proper time for 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.600
 do it when you have to do it and as 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.220
 it's always better to do it before 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.319
 the females before they reach their 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.689
 first zeal that reaches him between 6 and 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.909
 8 months in such a way that when 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.409
 there are no sex hormones in the blood 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.299
 they will never develop that kind of 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.340
 behaviors and the kittens are going to 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:13.820
 keep more playful 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.170
 and it's really not going to affect your anatomy 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.160
 if they are operated very 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.030
 and finally, there is a fear 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.580
 common within people about it from 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.950
 this issue of neutering or sterilizing 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.390
 the cats because they say it's after 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.480
 I do not know what gives them cancer that they 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.850
 Hair falls down that become like vomiting 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.560
 so then tell me you are the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.590
 expert in the subject that is so true 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.720
 Well, thank you very much, because he 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.050
 sterilize the females will marry the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.239
 males is like you have said myths no 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.090
 I can not have cancer in a 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.620
 reproductive device that I have removed from 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.540
 there is cancer when the device 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.540
 player remains in the body of the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.510
 animal without any functionality with the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.660
 enough functionality the other thing is 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.510
 what 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.120
 in food houses there is food 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.390
 Special for cats operated where then 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.840
 they do not have so many calories but one 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.690
 enough fiber so they do not get fat 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.480
 and one very important thing is that the cat 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.270
 what he loses is a little his behavior 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.250
 exploratory is to say that it is no longer going to 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.080
 found despair when present 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.810
 he or the kitten encelÃ³ is not going to want 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.610
 fly out of your apartment and stay 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.450
 much quieter but it does not mean 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.230
 they lose that are not playful or that 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.340
 go silly 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.260
 It is definitely recommended 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.660
 castration and sterilization of our 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.640
 cats to avoid medical problems for 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.320
 keep them quiet at home but 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.470
 fundamentally for the control of 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.470
 birth
