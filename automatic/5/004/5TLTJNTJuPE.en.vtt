00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.740
 the beginning of the image jp that chamakh a match between them two young french 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.829
 of course way to shoot 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.829
 a month ie it's not difficult 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.960
 here's never easy to play against a buddy contract let alone 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.899
 a club partner like 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.779
 of all the rides and well signify them in conditions like that gets 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:29.769
 made 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.270
 it's even harder for me 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.500
 nothing on them here since yesterday 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.300
 the material was immaculate it was really very playable it was not too much 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.470
 sliding for biarrots we are hungry 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.840
 and then% but I put my best rebel pierrÃ¢t very well played 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.850
 otherwise there is nothing to say at the billiards is true world of very good 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.770
 equipment 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.620
 for the first time here who is herself you are internship yes I 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.980
 am from strasbourg actually i'm the regional of the stage when 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.000
 even the title 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.580
 % and 27% 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.159
 ngokwey it was hard enough but hey it's my first time 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.259
 eugene am very happy to be able to participate in this tournament 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.579
 and I hope we'll maybe next year if I play well this 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.630
 year is not over yet for me I'm going to try to qualify I'm going 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.110
 try to no longer qualify so for next year 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.030
 but the material but let's face the pr and berrier with d be 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.220
 the finish the sector 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.420
 tomorrow the day before 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.080
 wonder 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 in front of Marc Emig for me his wonderful ration of leap forward 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.220
 it was especially good not to miss the last because sometimes it can do that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.780
 can last six months 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.399
 to start establishing 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.690
 two hotels the match etc yes we played percent 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.220
 not at the time a few years ago anyway 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.729
 the championships of France junior so in France 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.920
 so the national championships 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.970
 so we did some parts before 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.620
 it has always been 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.990
 cherki win a little me who wins but also a few times 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.190
 so it's a little bit used to play together anyway 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.119
 pity I had lucas of the science of matter 40 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.579
 if slept and spiked 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.699
 for a little bit scared not too much points 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.889
 but kaufmann was playing very well 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.269
 system that seemed very fit and that is able to play very well 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.169
 as well 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.139
 we must have played very well 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.139
 we can make a link between these two point 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.769
 but anyway I'm not too much of an opponent I'm focusing on 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.159
 myself on every day 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.159
 no matter if I play I try to always play the best start possible 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.919
 my dear in this area 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.059
 thank you, thank you very much
