00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
I found was a real up for this vehicle

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.999 
I found was a real up for this vehicle
is<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.849> transmission<00:05:39.360> now<00:05:39.930> often<00:05:40.499> times<00:05:40.529> you

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
is the transmission now often times you

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.529 
is the transmission now often times you
see<00:05:41.189> in<00:05:41.279> these<00:05:41.430> vehicles<00:05:41.729> when<00:05:42.059> they<00:05:42.089> have<00:05:42.360> the

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
automatic style transmissions it's

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.820 
automatic style transmissions it's
really<00:05:45.149> clunky<00:05:45.569> and<00:05:45.990> you<00:05:46.110> put<00:05:46.289> your<00:05:46.379> foot<00:05:46.589> down

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
really clunky and you put your foot down

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.709 
really clunky and you put your foot down
it<00:05:47.129> doesn't<00:05:47.279> shift<00:05:47.639> how<00:05:47.819> your<00:05:47.969> brain<00:05:48.240> wants<00:05:48.599> it

it doesn't shift how your brain wants it
to<00:05:48.810> shift<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.499> has<00:05:49.710> lag<00:05:50.069> I<00:05:50.399> didn't<00:05:50.819> find<00:05:50.939> any<00:05:51.149> of

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
to shift it has lag I didn't find any of

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.550 
to shift it has lag I didn't find any of
that<00:05:51.479> in<00:05:51.659> this<00:05:51.749> vehicle<00:05:52.199> in<00:05:52.289> fact<00:05:52.469> these

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
that in this vehicle in fact these

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.959 
that in this vehicle in fact these
shifts<00:05:52.889> when<00:05:52.979> I<00:05:53.009> wanted<00:05:53.370> to<00:05:53.430> shift<00:05:53.759> and

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
shifts when I wanted to shift and

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.149 
shifts when I wanted to shift and
there's<00:05:54.300> also<00:05:54.419> no<00:05:54.779> lag<00:05:55.050> between<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:55.560> gears<00:05:55.770> my

there's also no lag between the gears my

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.769 
there's also no lag between the gears my
down<00:05:56.430> for<00:05:56.639> this<00:05:56.729> vehicle<00:05:57.120> although<00:05:57.539> it's

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
down for this vehicle although it's

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.989

00:05:59.989 --> 00:05:59.999 
pretty close to perfect I can always do

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.360 
pretty close to perfect I can always do
with<00:06:00.149> a<00:06:00.240> little<00:06:00.360> extra<00:06:00.779> trunk<00:06:01.139> space<00:06:01.289> and<00:06:01.709> if

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
with a little extra trunk space and if

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.010 
with a little extra trunk space and if
it<00:06:02.580> was<00:06:02.699> just<00:06:02.879> a<00:06:02.969> few<00:06:03.209> inches<00:06:03.330> longer<00:06:03.719> and

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
it was just a few inches longer and

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.170 
it was just a few inches longer and
maybe<00:06:04.139> a<00:06:04.289> couple<00:06:04.620> inches<00:06:04.740> wider<00:06:05.159> in<00:06:05.520> the<00:06:05.580> trunk

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180
