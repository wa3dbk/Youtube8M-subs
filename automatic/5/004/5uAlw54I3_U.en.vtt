00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
adrena objects but apparently is not

that<00:01:11.520> interesting<00:01:12.479> according<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.960> Modocs<00:01:13.380> as

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that interesting according to Modocs as

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
that interesting according to Modocs as
you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.189> probably<00:01:14.400> expect<00:01:15.090> there's<00:01:15.360> also

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you can probably expect there's also

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.749 
you can probably expect there's also
going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.900> some<00:01:16.080> new<00:01:16.170> armor<00:01:16.680> pieces<00:01:16.920> it's

going to be some new armor pieces it's
going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.240> added<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.720> well<00:01:19.189> it's<00:01:20.189> also

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
going to be added as well it's also

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.399 
going to be added as well it's also
worth<00:01:20.729> noting<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.509> as<00:01:21.960> I've<00:01:22.259> already

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
worth noting that as I've already

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.130 
worth noting that as I've already
mentioned<00:01:22.820> there's<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.600> rumors

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
mentioned there's going to be a rumors

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.030 
mentioned there's going to be a rumors
that<00:01:25.290> you're<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.680> able<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.890> fly

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that you're going to be able to fly

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.730 
that you're going to be able to fly
dragons<00:01:26.670> however<00:01:27.240> whether<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
dragons however whether that's a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
dragons however whether that's a
scripted<00:01:29.400> event<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:29.909> whether<00:01:30.689> that's<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
scripted event or whether that's you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.170 
scripted event or whether that's you
know<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.799> actually<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> tame<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
know you actually get to tame it as you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.719 
know you actually get to tame it as you
would<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> horse<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.049> example<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:35.040> completely

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
would a horse for example is completely

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.429 
would a horse for example is completely
unknown<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.420> example<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.869> could<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> end

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
unknown for example it could be the end

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.740 
unknown for example it could be the end
of<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> quest<00:01:37.860> line<00:01:38.159> which<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> probably<00:01:39.450> is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
of a quest line which it probably is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.569 
of a quest line which it probably is
considering<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> name<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> title<00:01:41.310> is

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
considering the name of the title is

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.600 
considering the name of the title is
actually<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> dragon<00:01:42.630> born<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.979> let's<00:01:44.250> assume

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
actually a dragon born so let's assume

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
actually a dragon born so let's assume
that<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.960> actually

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that that is and you know you actually

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.200 
that that is and you know you actually
do<00:01:46.439> beget<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> rain<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.159> some<00:01:47.610> dragons<00:01:48.030> why

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
do beget to rain on some dragons why

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.480 
do beget to rain on some dragons why
literally<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.439> would<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.710> very<00:01:50.070> very

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
literally that would be very very

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.450 
literally that would be very very
interesting<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.180> very<00:01:51.570> cool<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:53.009> think

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
interesting and very very cool I think

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.310 
interesting and very very cool I think
that<00:01:53.610> probably<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.180> last<00:01:54.390> piece<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> Skyrim

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that probably the last piece of Skyrim

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560 
that probably the last piece of Skyrim
DLC<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.430> interested<00:01:56.909> about<00:01:57.119> was

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
DLC are really interested about was

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.929 
DLC are really interested about was
actually<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.710> course<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> dawnguard<00:01:59.430> piece

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
actually of course the dawnguard piece

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.630 
actually of course the dawnguard piece
of<00:02:00.090> DLC<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.380> course<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
of DLC and of course it was that one to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
of DLC and of course it was that one to
