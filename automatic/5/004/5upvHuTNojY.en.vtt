00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
smaller and really I don't know that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.180 
smaller and really I don't know that
I'll<00:00:33.149> ever<00:00:33.180> use<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.719> 72<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.500> maybe<00:00:34.739> should

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
I'll ever use all 72 so I maybe should

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.330 
I'll ever use all 72 so I maybe should
have<00:00:35.219> gotten<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> 24<00:00:36.270> or<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> 36<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
have gotten the 24 or the 36 but this is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
have gotten the 24 or the 36 but this is
what<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> got<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:41.809> watercolor

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.680 
what I got so they are watercolor
pencils<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.489> ink<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
pencils but they have ink in them so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.020 
pencils but they have ink in them so
there's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> couple<00:00:46.140> things<00:00:46.700> they're<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> little

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
there's a couple things they're a little

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.080 
there's a couple things they're a little
different<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:52.550> little<00:00:53.550> dowel<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
different so on this little dowel I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.049 
different so on this little dowel I
already<00:00:54.270> colored<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.890> dry<00:00:56.219> once

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
already colored it and just dry once

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.360 
already colored it and just dry once
these<00:00:57.210> colors<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.660> dry<00:00:57.899> they're<00:00:58.289> set<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
these colors are dry they're set so you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
these colors are dry they're set so you
can<00:00:59.609> rewatch<00:00:59.940> though<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:00.960> i<00:01:01.050> wanted<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> i

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
can rewatch though so if i wanted to i

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.820 
can rewatch though so if i wanted to i
could<00:01:01.590> come<00:01:01.890> come<00:01:02.309> back<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:03.359> maybe<00:01:03.830> this

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
could come come back in with maybe this

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.570 
could come come back in with maybe this
darker<00:01:05.220> color

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.300 

like<00:01:13.580> that<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.480> just<00:01:14.600> have<00:01:14.960> my<00:01:15.350> little

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
like that and I just have my little

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.260 
like that and I just have my little
water<00:01:16.580> brush<00:01:17.270> here<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.850> you're<00:01:19.970> just<00:01:20.060> going

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
water brush here and you're just going

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.850 
water brush here and you're just going
to<00:01:20.330> wet<00:01:20.480> that<00:01:20.690> ink<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:26.180> is<00:01:26.330> quite<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.600> bit<00:01:26.870> of<00:01:27.740> a

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
to wet that ink this is quite a bit of a

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.850 
to wet that ink this is quite a bit of a
darker<00:01:28.220> color<00:01:28.490> but<00:01:29.000> I'm<00:01:29.810> not<00:01:30.290> really<00:01:30.440> spend

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
darker color but I'm not really spend

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.100 
darker color but I'm not really spend
the<00:01:31.010> time<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.340> kind<00:01:31.760> of<00:01:31.820> blend<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.210> but<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.050> you

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
the time to kind of blend it but so you

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.150 
the time to kind of blend it but so you
get<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.440> idea<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.770> can<00:01:37.010> lay

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
get the idea so the so you can lay

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.500 
get the idea so the so you can lay
around<00:01:37.280> that's<00:01:37.670> what<00:01:37.820> I'm<00:01:37.940> trying<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.270> say<00:01:38.360> and
