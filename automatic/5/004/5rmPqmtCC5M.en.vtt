00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.250
 and that's it you annals 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.350
 today on your none of them 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.750
 find with their shapes with the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 cap so suddenly face a small 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.280
 parenthesis if you like the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.410
 cap 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.330
 do not hesitate to tell me we are fighting in the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.750
 comments and we will watch what we 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.760
 can do 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.000
 here and then today we find ourselves 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.500
 for a recipe from this island lurks at 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.269
 very nice cheese that we can 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 find at quick 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.160
 so now it is you will need to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.679
 flour an egg a little bit of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.530
 oatmeal salt from pepper pepper 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.290
 paprika dm2 pronounces and of course the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.350
 cheese and I took some emmental 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.940
 the first step we will cut cubes 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.430
 in the cheese you cut 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.500
 first in that sense then in this 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.360
 meaning there and there simply you 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 make cubes according to the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.770
 size of your future so if the watches 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.480
 you want something big enough 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.370
 you are very tall otherwise you 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.109
 do like me about and then 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.870
 now we will go to the preparation 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.329
 of the finery for the breadcrumbs we are going 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.689
 install and pepper add the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.979
 paprika the herbs of provence 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:13.110
 ellaone and we mix all of a sudden we 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.640
 not going to go cheese so for that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.500
 it's very simple we go through a first 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.830
 flour 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.780
 then we come to the work we have 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.150
 just beat with a little bit 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.430
 milk then once that's fine 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.140
 back and we're back in the flour 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.640
 and we'll do it a second time 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.890
 the pieces of cheese are now 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.939
 well breakdown and it's hot and the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.439
 delicately gold to come and cook them 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.840
 then you will see are very very 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.600
 good the cheese it cooks rather 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 quickly about 3 minutes and a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.020
 Once it's done we'll drain it 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.960
 on paper towels and we go on to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.509
 tasting to the enemy it's gone for 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.670
 the tasting of small nuggets these 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.329
 things to his good it makes you want 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.130
 so it's gone brown frankly 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.070
 it's super good we firstly 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.619
 crisp spicy and then we went 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.209
 this sweetness the melted cheese that comes 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.099
 like that it's just perfect 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.110
 you 've seen that it's very simple to 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.940
 to do at home you can try to 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.310
 to make varieties that are rather not 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.989
 badly I hated breakdowns and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.209
 little babybel and frankly it's very 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.950
