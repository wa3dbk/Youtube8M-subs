00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
there's where you adjust the idle rpm

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.760 
there's where you adjust the idle rpm
and<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> screws<00:00:39.870> onto<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> top<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.530> carb

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and the screws onto the top of the carb

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.459 
and the screws onto the top of the carb
this<00:00:41.070> goes<00:00:41.280> down<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.670> connects<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> slide

this goes down and connects to the slide
the<00:00:43.469> rest<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> carb<00:00:44.010> isn't<00:00:44.250> attached<00:00:44.520> but

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the rest of the carb isn't attached but

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
the rest of the carb isn't attached but
there's<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> wire<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.020> comes<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.680> here

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
there's a wire that comes out right here

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.790 
there's a wire that comes out right here
you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:48.000> use<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> disconnect<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.680> can

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you can use a disconnect and you can

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
you can use a disconnect and you can
disconnect<00:00:50.190> those<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:50.610> wires<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.420> can

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
disconnect those two wires or you can

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.000 
disconnect those two wires or you can
just<00:00:51.719> cut<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.559> cut<00:00:52.680> them<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:52.980> I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
just cut them I just cut them because I

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.610 
just cut them I just cut them because I
didn't<00:00:53.190> want<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> wires<00:00:53.610> hanging<00:00:53.879> down<00:00:54.149> there

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
didn't want the wires hanging down there

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.020 
didn't want the wires hanging down there
that's<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> first<00:00:55.949> step<00:00:56.219> disconnect<00:00:56.910> those

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that's the first step disconnect those

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
that's the first step disconnect those
two<00:00:57.239> wires<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.170> always<00:00:58.320> hook<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.739> this

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
two wires you can always hook all this

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.920 
two wires you can always hook all this
back<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.579> cut<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
back up if you don't cut it it's not a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.840 
back up if you don't cut it it's not a
big<00:01:01.140> deal<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> sell<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> quad

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
big deal so if you want to sell the quad

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
big deal so if you want to sell the quad
and<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> stock<00:01:03.480> condition<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.140> that's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and have it stock condition then that's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.780 
and have it stock condition then that's
fine<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> next<00:01:06.330> thing<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> there's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.790> little

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
fine the next thing is there's a little

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.609 
fine the next thing is there's a little
mounting<00:01:09.180> bracket<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:10.369> here<00:01:12.590> with<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
mounting bracket right here with a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.020 
mounting bracket right here with a
single<00:01:14.130> screw<00:01:14.220> hole<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
single screw hole it's going to have a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.910 
single screw hole it's going to have a
little<00:01:15.210> gadget<00:01:15.600> looking<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.110> looks

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
little gadget looking like this looks

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
little gadget looking like this looks
like<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.310> computer<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.600> just

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
like a little computer you just

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
like a little computer you just
disconnect<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.320> unscrew<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.280> take<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> out

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
disconnect that unscrew it take it out

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.030 
disconnect that unscrew it take it out
of<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> second<00:01:22.530> step<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
of there that's the second step the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.359 
of there that's the second step the
third<00:01:23.909> step<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.259> you're<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
third step is up here you're going to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.359 
third step is up here you're going to
have<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.140> wire<00:01:28.140> coming<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:28.890> throttle

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
have a wire coming out of your throttle

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.330 
have a wire coming out of your throttle
right<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:32.070> unscrew

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
right there you can actually unscrew

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670 
right there you can actually unscrew
these<00:01:32.579> three<00:01:32.820> screws<00:01:33.110> take<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> two<00:01:34.409> screws

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
these three screws take the two screws

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.260 
these three screws take the two screws
out<00:01:34.890> where<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> micro<00:01:35.610> switch<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.119> there

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
out where the micro switch is in there

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.880 
out where the micro switch is in there
that<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.750> tells<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.470> clicks<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that just tells what it just clicks and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.410 
that just tells what it just clicks and
tells<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> throttle<00:01:38.640> when<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.880> or<00:01:39.119> tells

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
tells the throttle when it's or tells

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.700 
tells the throttle when it's or tells
that<00:01:39.540> computer<00:01:39.960> when<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.229> open<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.619> when

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that computer when it's open and when

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.980 
that computer when it's open and when
it's<00:01:40.829> not<00:01:41.090> follow<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.270> wire<00:01:42.450> down<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.899> then

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it's not follow that wire down and then

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.300 
it's not follow that wire down and then
underneath<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> wire<00:01:43.710> harness<00:01:44.130> down

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
underneath and the wire harness down

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.510 
underneath and the wire harness down
here<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.899> actually<00:01:45.930> uncloak<00:01:46.890> unplug<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
here you can actually uncloak unplug it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
here you can actually uncloak unplug it
and<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.390> keep<00:01:48.720> everything<00:01:48.990> intact

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and so you can keep everything intact

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.719 
and so you can keep everything intact
don't<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.009> cut<00:01:50.159> anything<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> don't

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
don't have to cut anything if you don't

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.359 
don't have to cut anything if you don't
want<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.290> removing<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> tours<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.950> my<00:01:53.040> opinion

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
want to removing the tours in my opinion

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.530 
want to removing the tours in my opinion
is<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.729> first<00:01:53.970> things<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> should<00:01:54.450> do

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
is one of the first things you should do

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.910 
is one of the first things you should do
if<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> Banshee<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.470> hasn't<00:01:55.649> already

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
if we get a Banshee if it hasn't already

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.899 
if we get a Banshee if it hasn't already
been<00:01:56.219> removed<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:58.219> highly<00:01:59.219> recommend<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
been removed I highly recommend the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.310 
been removed I highly recommend the
Eliminator<00:02:00.329> kit<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.840> gets<00:02:01.049> rid<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
Eliminator kit because it gets rid of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
Eliminator kit because it gets rid of
all<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.500> stuff<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:02.040> top<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> tours<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
all this stuff on top of the tours it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.539 
all this stuff on top of the tours it
makes<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.170> lot<00:02:04.320> easier<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.009> set<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> idle

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
makes it a lot easier to set the idle

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.960 
makes it a lot easier to set the idle
and<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.030> set<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:07.099> idle<00:02:08.099> jetting<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.729> well

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and to set the idle jetting as well

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.790 
and to set the idle jetting as well
keeps<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.420> rpms<00:02:09.810> much<00:02:10.050> more<00:02:10.259> steady<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
keeps your rpms much more steady and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.190 
keeps your rpms much more steady and
it's<00:02:11.730> much<00:02:11.910> more<00:02:12.090> predictable

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it's much more predictable

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.260 
it's much more predictable
so<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:14.190> what<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.400> Yankee<00:02:14.670> tours<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.120> your

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
so if what do Yankee tours on your

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.180 
so if what do Yankee tours on your
banshee<00:02:15.690> that's<00:02:16.050> my<00:02:16.680> opinion<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.010> way<00:02:17.130> you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
banshee that's my opinion the way you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.730 
banshee that's my opinion the way you
should<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.580> it
