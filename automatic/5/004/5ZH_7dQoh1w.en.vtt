00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
don't really need all of it to go

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.229 
don't really need all of it to go
through<00:03:35.650> just<00:03:35.800> just<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.730> vast<00:03:37.140> majority<00:03:39.239> so

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
through just just a vast majority so

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.360 
through just just a vast majority so
then<00:03:40.330> you're<00:03:40.450> just<00:03:40.569> going<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.959> pull<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.739> up<00:03:41.980> and

then you're just going to pull it up and
this<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.060> really<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.480> lot<00:03:43.810> easier<00:03:44.170> with<00:03:44.470> an

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
this is really a lot easier with an

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.170 
this is really a lot easier with an
actual<00:03:44.950> mirror<00:03:45.280> but<00:03:45.489> I'm<00:03:45.580> just<00:03:45.700> using<00:03:45.910> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
actual mirror but I'm just using the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.620 
actual mirror but I'm just using the
viewfinder<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.709> yeah<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.760> then<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.120> have<00:03:49.390> your

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
viewfinder so yeah so then you have your

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.760 
viewfinder so yeah so then you have your
hair<00:03:49.840> bead<00:03:50.080> threaded<00:03:50.680> into<00:03:51.190> your<00:03:51.700> hair<00:03:52.060> and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
hair bead threaded into your hair and

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.530 
hair bead threaded into your hair and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
you are going to take all of your little

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.050 
you are going to take all of your little
feathers<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.530> make<00:03:57.100> sure<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.459> they<00:03:57.640> are<00:03:57.790> all

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
feathers and make sure that they are all

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.270 
feathers and make sure that they are all
all<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.840> tips<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.349> them<00:03:59.560> are<00:04:00.450> aligned

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
all of the tips of them are aligned

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.620 
all of the tips of them are aligned
because<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:03.730> they're<00:04:03.880> not<00:04:04.120> then<00:04:04.510> they're

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
because if they're not then they're

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.030 
because if they're not then they're
going<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.870> feel<00:04:05.110> really<00:04:05.319> weird

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
going to feel really weird

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.640

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
if you're dyeing your hair make sure

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.719 
if you're dyeing your hair make sure
that<00:06:03.930> you<00:06:04.050> take<00:06:04.229> them<00:06:04.440> out<00:06:04.590> because<00:06:04.800> they<00:06:05.550> may

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
that you take them out because they may

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.030 
that you take them out because they may
not<00:06:05.760> get<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:06.750> full<00:06:06.780> amount<00:06:07.350> of<00:06:07.470> dye<00:06:07.650> but<00:06:07.889> they

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
not get the full amount of dye but they

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.680 
not get the full amount of dye but they
will<00:06:08.250> soak<00:06:08.550> up<00:06:08.729> some<00:06:08.910> of<00:06:09.000> the<00:06:09.090> dyes<00:06:09.270> they<00:06:09.540> are

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
will soak up some of the dyes they are

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.650 
will soak up some of the dyes they are
very<00:06:09.930> porous<00:06:10.260> just<00:06:10.650> like<00:06:10.770> hair<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:11.449> if<00:06:12.449> you

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
very porous just like hair and if you

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.050 
very porous just like hair and if you
put<00:06:12.900> them<00:06:13.020> in<00:06:13.260> after<00:06:13.680> you<00:06:13.830> freshly<00:06:14.669> dyed<00:06:14.880> your

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
put them in after you freshly dyed your

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.480 
put them in after you freshly dyed your
hair<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.630> you<00:06:15.780> wash<00:06:16.050> them<00:06:16.380> then<00:06:16.830> they<00:06:17.160> could

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
hair and you wash them then they could

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.730 
hair and you wash them then they could
bleed<00:06:18.210> because<00:06:18.810> some<00:06:18.990> of<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.199> color<00:06:19.440> may

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
bleed because some of the color may

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.580 
bleed because some of the color may
bleed<00:06:20.100> onto<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:21.000> feathers<00:06:21.360> so<00:06:22.080> be<00:06:22.320> wary<00:06:22.500> of

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
bleed onto the feathers so be wary of

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.469 
bleed onto the feathers so be wary of
that<00:06:22.680> I<00:06:22.889> honestly<00:06:23.699> would<00:06:23.910> just<00:06:24.120> if<00:06:24.300> your

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
that I honestly would just if your

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.420 
that I honestly would just if your
dyeing<00:06:24.750> your<00:06:24.870> hair<00:06:24.930> wait<00:06:25.560> till<00:06:26.130> you've<00:06:26.280> washed

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
dyeing your hair wait till you've washed

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.189 
dyeing your hair wait till you've washed
it<00:06:26.669> three<00:06:26.850> or<00:06:27.030> four<00:06:27.240> times<00:06:27.419> and<00:06:27.780> then<00:06:27.900> put<00:06:28.080> the

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
it three or four times and then put the

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.800 
it three or four times and then put the
feathers<00:06:28.470> in<00:06:28.650> because<00:06:29.240> that's<00:06:30.240> going<00:06:30.690> to<00:06:30.750> be

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
feathers in because that's going to be

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.659 
feathers in because that's going to be
your<00:06:31.050> best<00:06:31.169> option<00:06:31.410> you're<00:06:32.100> going<00:06:32.250> to<00:06:32.310> want<00:06:32.550> to

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
your best option you're going to want to

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.590 
your best option you're going to want to
move<00:06:33.330> your<00:06:33.660> bead<00:06:33.990> up<00:06:34.289> about<00:06:34.770> every<00:06:35.669> three<00:06:36.479> to

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
move your bead up about every three to

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.240 
move your bead up about every three to
four<00:06:36.810> weeks<00:06:36.870> depending<00:06:37.289> on<00:06:37.620> how<00:06:37.740> fast<00:06:38.010> your

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
four weeks depending on how fast your

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.909 
four weeks depending on how fast your
hair<00:06:38.490> grows<00:06:38.820> and<00:06:39.210> that's<00:06:39.840> only<00:06:40.110> because<00:06:40.260> the

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 
hair grows and that's only because the

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:42.350 
hair grows and that's only because the
bead<00:06:41.220> is<00:06:41.340> going<00:06:41.490> to<00:06:41.550> get<00:06:41.669> really<00:06:41.940> really<00:06:42.090> low

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
bead is going to get really really low

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.990 
bead is going to get really really low
and<00:06:42.660> that<00:06:42.840> could<00:06:43.020> be<00:06:43.139> hard<00:06:43.410> to<00:06:43.770> handle<00:06:44.400> because

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
and that could be hard to handle because

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.960 
and that could be hard to handle because
you<00:06:45.419> definitely<00:06:45.690> do<00:06:46.260> not<00:06:46.289> want<00:06:46.590> to<00:06:47.130> brush<00:06:47.700> over

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
you definitely do not want to brush over

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.589 
you definitely do not want to brush over
this<00:06:48.479> because<00:06:48.930> it's<00:06:49.229> gonna<00:06:49.470> hurt<00:06:50.010> oh<00:06:50.460> my<00:06:51.389> god<00:06:51.570> I

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 
this because it's gonna hurt oh my god I

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.089 
this because it's gonna hurt oh my god I
remember<00:06:52.020> when<00:06:52.110> I<00:06:52.139> first<00:06:52.349> got<00:06:52.500> these<00:06:52.740> put<00:06:52.979> in

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:53.099 
remember when I first got these put in

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.159 
remember when I first got these put in
and<00:06:53.550> I<00:06:53.820> forgot<00:06:54.150> about<00:06:54.240> it<00:06:54.389> and<00:06:54.690> I<00:06:54.720> just<00:06:54.870> brushed

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
and I forgot about it and I just brushed

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.770 
and I forgot about it and I just brushed
and<00:06:55.500> I<00:06:55.820> pretty<00:06:56.820> sure<00:06:57.000> I<00:06:57.060> just<00:06:57.090> like<00:06:57.389> ripped

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
and I pretty sure I just like ripped

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.400 
and I pretty sure I just like ripped
like<00:06:58.110> a<00:06:58.400> small<00:06:59.400> bald<00:06:59.789> spot<00:07:00.120> into<00:07:00.450> my<00:07:00.599> head<00:07:00.870> so

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
like a small bald spot into my head so

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.529 
like a small bald spot into my head so
yeah<00:07:02.340> definitely<00:07:02.490> don't<00:07:02.880> brush<00:07:03.090> over<00:07:03.389> them

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
yeah definitely don't brush over them

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.020 
yeah definitely don't brush over them
make<00:07:03.750> sure<00:07:03.900> you<00:07:04.229> change<00:07:04.680> your<00:07:04.979> bead<00:07:05.190> or<00:07:05.580> move

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
make sure you change your bead or move

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.820 
make sure you change your bead or move
your<00:07:06.210> bead<00:07:06.360> up<00:07:06.599> every<00:07:06.990> three<00:07:07.260> to<00:07:07.380> four<00:07:07.530> weeks

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
your bead up every three to four weeks

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.219 
your bead up every three to four weeks
and<00:07:08.130> to<00:07:08.700> do<00:07:08.849> that<00:07:09.060> you<00:07:09.270> can<00:07:09.449> still<00:07:09.780> reuse<00:07:10.080> the

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
and to do that you can still reuse the

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.719 
and to do that you can still reuse the
same<00:07:10.410> bead<00:07:10.620> if<00:07:10.800> you're<00:07:10.919> careful<00:07:11.460> but

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
same bead if you're careful but

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:13.279 
same bead if you're careful but
basically<00:07:12.120> all<00:07:12.210> you<00:07:12.449> have<00:07:12.599> to<00:07:12.690> do<00:07:12.780> is<00:07:12.990> clamp

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
basically all you have to do is clamp

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.189 
basically all you have to do is clamp
your<00:07:13.500> bead<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:14.070> opposite<00:07:14.669> direction

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 
your bead the opposite direction

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.560 
your bead the opposite direction
slightly<00:07:16.199> shift<00:07:17.099> the<00:07:17.340> beat<00:07:17.520> up<00:07:17.699> clamp<00:07:18.360> back

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
slightly shift the beat up clamp back

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.939 
slightly shift the beat up clamp back
down<00:07:18.810> again<00:07:19.050> so<00:07:19.080> it's<00:07:19.410> really<00:07:19.620> really<00:07:19.830> simple

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:19.949 
down again so it's really really simple

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:22.129 
down again so it's really really simple
I<00:07:20.639> absolutely<00:07:21.060> love<00:07:21.449> these<00:07:21.630> hair<00:07:21.840> feathers

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 
I absolutely love these hair feathers

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:23.629 
I absolutely love these hair feathers

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 
like I said I used to be totally

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.760 
like I said I used to be totally
obsessed<00:07:23.910> with<00:07:24.120> them<00:07:24.330> and<00:07:24.660> I<00:07:25.199> used<00:07:25.500> to<00:07:25.620> have

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
obsessed with them and I used to have

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.290 
obsessed with them and I used to have
like<00:07:26.010> a<00:07:26.220> bead<00:07:26.370> my<00:07:26.580> whole<00:07:26.789> head<00:07:27.000> was<00:07:27.150> pretty

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
like a bead my whole head was pretty

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.540 
like a bead my whole head was pretty
much<00:07:27.479> covered<00:07:27.840> in<00:07:27.960> them<00:07:28.139> and<00:07:28.410> I<00:07:29.039> do<00:07:29.099> have<00:07:29.340> quite

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
much covered in them and I do have quite

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.770 
much covered in them and I do have quite
a<00:07:29.580> few<00:07:29.669> more<00:07:29.849> so<00:07:30.120> I'm<00:07:30.210> probably<00:07:30.330> going<00:07:30.630> to<00:07:30.690> put

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 
a few more so I'm probably going to put

a few more so I'm probably going to put
a<00:07:30.840> couple<00:07:31.080> more<00:07:31.199> in<00:07:31.530> but<00:07:32.160> yeah<00:07:32.520> that<00:07:32.789> is<00:07:33.000> my

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:33.449 
a couple more in but yeah that is my

extensions and I know that it was not
very<00:07:37.800> formal<00:07:38.580> but<00:07:38.610> that's<00:07:38.880> because<00:07:39.090> I<00:07:39.539> am<00:07:40.289> NOT
