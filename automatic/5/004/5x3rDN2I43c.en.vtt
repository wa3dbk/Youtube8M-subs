00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
think it's 14 yeah I don't think they

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.759 
think it's 14 yeah I don't think they
sent<00:03:03.060> me<00:03:03.180> too<00:03:03.299> well<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:03.989> 14<00:03:04.409> or<00:03:04.439> so<00:03:04.650> it

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
sent me too well but this is 14 or so it

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.699 
sent me too well but this is 14 or so it
comes<00:03:04.980> down<00:03:05.359> this<00:03:06.359> long<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:08.069> I'm<00:03:08.310> five<00:03:08.609> nine

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
comes down this long and I'm five nine

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.839 
comes down this long and I'm five nine
so<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:10.829> comes<00:03:11.010> too<00:03:11.220> small<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:14.069> only<00:03:14.340> thing

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
so it comes too small the only thing

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.490 
so it comes too small the only thing
about<00:03:15.329> this<00:03:15.599> hair<00:03:16.879> that<00:03:17.879> I<00:03:17.909> think<00:03:18.419> some<00:03:19.139> of<00:03:19.169> you

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
about this hair that I think some of you

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.349 
about this hair that I think some of you
would<00:03:19.709> find<00:03:19.739> as<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.069> negative<00:03:20.340> it's<00:03:20.909> not<00:03:21.120> really

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
would find as a negative it's not really

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.550 
would find as a negative it's not really
negative<00:03:21.780> from<00:03:21.900> me<00:03:22.049> because<00:03:22.169> it<00:03:22.379> looks<00:03:22.500> more

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
negative from me because it looks more

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.610 
negative from me because it looks more
natural<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.699> density<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.720> hair<00:03:25.379> is<00:03:25.500> a
