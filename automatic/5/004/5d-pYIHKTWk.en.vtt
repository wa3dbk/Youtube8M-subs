swing
now<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.840> golf<00:00:34.020> swing<00:00:34.230> does<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> most<00:00:34.680> damage

now that golf swing does the most damage

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.980 
now that golf swing does the most damage
and<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> move<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.540> want<00:00:36.900> to

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
and that is the move that you want to

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.439 
and that is the move that you want to
connect<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> obviously<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.090> you're<00:00:39.180> sort<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
connect so obviously when you're sort of

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:40.939 
connect so obviously when you're sort of
timing<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.050> attack<00:00:40.199> enemies<00:00:40.559> make<00:00:40.800> sure

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
timing or your attack enemies make sure

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.860 
timing or your attack enemies make sure
you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.250> kind<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.460> you've<00:00:42.239> got<00:00:42.390> enough<00:00:42.629> time

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
you can kind of you've got enough time

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.270 
you can kind of you've got enough time
so<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.199> can<00:00:43.320> try<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.530> land<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:43.949> because

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
so you can try and land that one because

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
so you can try and land that one because
that's<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> does<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.719> most<00:00:45.989> damage

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that's the one that does the most damage

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160 
that's the one that does the most damage
adding<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.030> press<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
adding to that if you press a you do a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
adding to that if you press a you do a
kind<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.500> horizontal<00:00:49.770> smash<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.850> is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
kind of horizontal smash and that is

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.939 
kind of horizontal smash and that is
used<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.539> knocking<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.809> enemies<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.769> if<00:00:52.859> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
used for knocking out enemies so if you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
used for knocking out enemies so if you
get<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> chance<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:54.239> also<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.570> good

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
get a chance that's also really good

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.479 
get a chance that's also really good
having<00:00:55.320> said<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.800> golf<00:00:56.039> swing<00:00:56.160> can

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
having said that your golf swing can

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.380 
having said that your golf swing can
also<00:00:56.699> days<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.600> knock<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.840> enemies<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.199> well

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
also days or knock out enemies as well

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.319 
also days or knock out enemies as well
then<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.199> hold<00:01:02.129> down<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.210> basically

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
then if you hold down or you basically

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.840 
then if you hold down or you basically
charge<00:01:03.719> your<00:01:03.870> hammer<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.250> then<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.730> let

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
charge your hammer and then when you let

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
charge your hammer and then when you let
it<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.270> you're<00:01:06.540> standing<00:01:06.750> still<00:01:07.050> it<00:01:07.620> will

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it go if you're standing still it will

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.220 
it go if you're standing still it will
do<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> powerful<00:01:08.520> smash<00:01:08.700> however<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.780> you're

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
do a powerful smash however if you're

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.520 
do a powerful smash however if you're
charging<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.950> run<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> let<00:01:12.060> go

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
charging it and you run and you let go

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.600 
charging it and you run and you let go
then<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.770> basically<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
then you basically do this kind of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.360 
then you basically do this kind of
tornado<00:01:15.390> spinning<00:01:15.750> move<00:01:15.870> now<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.950> move<00:01:17.130> here

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
tornado spinning move now this move here

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.730 
tornado spinning move now this move here
is<00:01:17.550> a<00:01:17.610> move<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.750> want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.050> use<00:01:19.200> it's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
is a move you do not want to use it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.200 
is a move you do not want to use it's
not<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.580> you're<00:01:20.730> going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.910> charge<00:01:21.030> your

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
not if you're going to charge your

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.310 
not if you're going to charge your
hammer<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.810> want<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> run<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.260> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
hammer then you want to run it's the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.610 
hammer then you want to run it's the
enemy

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
enemy

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.890 
enemy
stand<00:01:23.190> still<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.300> powerful<00:01:24.570> smash

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
stand still and get the powerful smash

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.390 
stand still and get the powerful smash
instead<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.950> spinning<00:01:26.220> move

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
instead because that spinning move

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.650 
instead because that spinning move
leaves<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.150> open<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
leaves you really really open and

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.390 
leaves you really really open and
compared<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.710> other<00:01:28.830> move<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.220> doesn't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
compared to the other move it doesn't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580 
compared to the other move it doesn't
actually<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.270> much<00:01:30.450> damage<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:31.260> might<00:01:31.440> look

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
actually do as much damage it might look

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.590 
actually do as much damage it might look
impressive<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.730> isn't<00:01:33.090> worth<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
impressive but it really isn't worth it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.340 
impressive but it really isn't worth it
especially<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.110> you're<00:01:34.230> fighting

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
especially when you're fighting

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
especially when you're fighting
something<00:01:34.590> stronger<00:01:34.860> muscles<00:01:35.190> later<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
something stronger muscles later and you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.430 
something stronger muscles later and you
just<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.660> can't<00:01:36.810> afford<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.080> be<00:01:37.200> left<00:01:37.320> open

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
just really can't afford to be left open

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.170 
just really can't afford to be left open
for<00:01:37.620> that<00:01:37.800> long<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.100> where<00:01:38.610> possible<00:01:38.730> trying

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
for that long so where possible trying

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
for that long so where possible trying
to<00:01:39.240> avoid<00:01:39.390> using<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.190> again<00:01:41.190> with<00:01:41.400> this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to avoid using that again with this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.740 
to avoid using that again with this
weapon<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> adopt<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> kind<00:01:42.510> of<00:01:42.600> hit

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
weapon you want to adopt the kind of hit

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
of some of them in action and then so go

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.270 
of some of them in action and then so go
from<00:02:02.939> there<00:02:03.439> so<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.860> run<00:02:05.100> into

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
from there so as you can see I run into

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.020 
from there so as you can see I run into
the<00:02:05.340> enemy<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.190> obviously<00:02:08.759> try<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the enemy and also obviously try and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.759 
the enemy and also obviously try and
time<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.810> my<00:02:09.989> full<00:02:10.560> three

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
time it so that I can get my full three

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.250 
time it so that I can get my full three
hits<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:12.540> afterwards<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.140> will

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
hits in and then afterwards I will

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.199 
hits in and then afterwards I will
always<00:02:13.560> roll<00:02:13.739> out<00:02:13.890> because<00:02:14.250> after<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.030> land

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
always roll out because after you land

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.100 
always roll out because after you land
the<00:02:15.300> third<00:02:15.450> goal<00:02:15.630> swing

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the third goal swing

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.050 
the third goal swing
you<00:02:16.290> are<00:02:16.410> left<00:02:16.680> vulnerable<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.910> few

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
you are left vulnerable for a few

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.850 
you are left vulnerable for a few
minutes<00:02:18.269> school<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.900> are<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> few<00:02:19.170> minutes<00:02:19.410> few

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
minutes school so are a few minutes few

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.340 
minutes school so are a few minutes few
seconds<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.090> afterwards<00:02:21.420> rolling<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:22.230> is

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
seconds so afterwards rolling out is

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.039 
seconds so afterwards rolling out is
definitely<00:02:22.410> your<00:02:22.709> best<00:02:22.860> bet<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.810> then<00:02:24.900> other

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
definitely your best bet and then other

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.110 
definitely your best bet and then other
than<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.200> whenever<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.190> try<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.000> get

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
than that whenever you can try and get

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.580 
than that whenever you can try and get
some<00:02:27.239> charge<00:02:27.450> hits<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.750> because<00:02:28.049> that<00:02:28.230> does<00:02:28.440> do

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
some charge hits in because that does do

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470 
some charge hits in because that does do
a<00:02:28.620> lot<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.830> damage<00:02:29.010> but<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.269> really

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
a lot of damage but you don't really

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.880 
a lot of damage but you don't really
want<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.690> run<00:02:30.840> around<00:02:31.019> with<00:02:31.230> charge<00:02:31.470> too<00:02:31.709> much

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
want to run around with charge too much

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.259 
want to run around with charge too much
because<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.280> does<00:02:32.400> deplete<00:02:32.730> your<00:02:32.819> stamina<00:02:33.030> bar

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
because it does deplete your stamina bar

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.809 
because it does deplete your stamina bar
so<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:33.989> no<00:02:34.110> stamina<00:02:34.350> then<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.700> will

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
so if you have no stamina then it will

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.759 
so if you have no stamina then it will
make<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.180> automatically<00:02:36.660> user<00:02:36.870> move<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.290> if

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
make you automatically user move and if

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.229 
make you automatically user move and if
you're<00:02:37.890> running<00:02:38.069> then<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.519> result<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.150> you

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
you're running then your result that you

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.850 
you're running then your result that you
do<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> whirlwind<00:02:39.870> move<00:02:40.049> which<00:02:40.560> means<00:02:40.739> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
do in the whirlwind move which means you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.770 
do in the whirlwind move which means you
will<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:41.069> left<00:02:41.220> even<00:02:41.640> more<00:02:41.790> open<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.600> want

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
will be left even more open so you want

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.220 
will be left even more open so you want
to<00:02:42.870> avoid<00:02:43.049> doing<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:44.630> alright<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:46.080> was

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
to avoid doing that alright so that was

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.620 
to avoid doing that alright so that was
just<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.530> quick<00:02:46.650> overview<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> hammer

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
just a quick overview for the hammer

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.460
