00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.610 
enemies I mean it's going to be pretty
goal<00:03:32.160> like<00:03:32.459> not<00:03:32.940> every<00:03:33.330> item<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:34.110> going<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.470> be

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
goal like not every item is going to be

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.729 
goal like not every item is going to be
under<00:03:35.310> use<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.630> even<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.410> beginning

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
under use so even in the beginning

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.080 
under use so even in the beginning
they're<00:03:37.890> going<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.160> be<00:03:38.250> really<00:03:38.519> cool<00:03:38.670> items

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
they're going to be really cool items

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.360 
they're going to be really cool items
kind<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.690> kind<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.350> like<00:03:40.470> economy<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.130> guess

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
kind of kind of like economy I guess

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.050 
kind of kind of like economy I guess
you'd<00:03:41.519> say<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:42.570> okami<00:03:42.959> they<00:03:43.200> have<00:03:43.410> cool

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
you'd say with okami they have cool

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.509 
you'd say with okami they have cool
upgrades<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.239> stuff<00:03:45.390> like<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.650> in<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.040> like

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
upgrades and stuff like that in the like

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.280 
upgrades and stuff like that in the like
earlier<00:03:48.000> levels<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.600> stuff<00:03:48.660> like<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:48.959> and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
earlier levels and stuff like that and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.990 
earlier levels and stuff like that and
then

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
then

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.730 
then
like<00:03:50.180> at<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.330> later<00:03:50.660> end<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.290> level<00:03:51.440> they

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
like at the later end of the level they

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.980 
like at the later end of the level they
had<00:03:51.950> like<00:03:52.250> at<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.730> end<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.150> game<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.750> last

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
had like at the end of the game the last

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.140 
had like at the end of the game the last
time<00:03:54.230> was<00:03:54.410> kind<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.740> yeah<00:03:55.160> but<00:03:55.880> they<00:03:56.000> don't

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
time was kind of yeah but they don't

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.760 
time was kind of yeah but they don't
want<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.660> feel<00:03:56.840> like<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.170> missed<00:03:57.380> out<00:03:57.740> on

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
want you to feel like you missed out on

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.190 
want you to feel like you missed out on
any<00:03:58.340> like<00:03:58.790> use<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.390> good<00:03:59.630> like<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.960> coolest

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.230 
any like use of good like the coolest
items<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.430> think<00:04:01.520> it's<00:04:01.730> going<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.880> be<00:04:01.940> sort

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
items so I think it's going to be sort

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.230 
items so I think it's going to be sort
of<00:04:02.300> like<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:04.250> know<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.610> mean<00:04:04.910> from

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
know I haven't hear too much about the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.430 
know I haven't hear too much about the
arrow<00:04:15.260> use<00:04:15.650> I've<00:04:16.489> heard<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.030> it's<00:04:17.420> like<00:04:18.260> it

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
arrow use I've heard that it's like it

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.650 
arrow use I've heard that it's like it
works<00:04:18.680> well<00:04:18.980> but<00:04:19.250> it's<00:04:19.459> just<00:04:19.670> not<00:04:19.730> as<00:04:19.970> fast<00:04:20.269> as

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
works well but it's just not as fast as

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.760 
works well but it's just not as fast as
a<00:04:21.610> using<00:04:22.610> like<00:04:23.000> with<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.590> twilight<00:04:24.590> princess

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
a using like with the twilight princess

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.890 
a using like with the twilight princess
using<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> Wii<00:04:25.610> pointer<00:04:26.180> but<00:04:26.419> um<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:26.780> know

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
using the Wii pointer but um you know

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.990 
using the Wii pointer but um you know
you<00:04:26.960> do<00:04:27.320> get<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.710> sense<00:04:27.980> of<00:04:28.070> using<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.550> actual

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
you do get that sense of using it actual

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.970 
you do get that sense of using it actual
arrow<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.419> guess<00:04:29.720> you'd<00:04:29.870> say<00:04:30.050> also<00:04:30.800> what<00:04:30.950> the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
arrow I guess you'd say also what the

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.030 
arrow I guess you'd say also what the
game<00:04:31.190> turns<00:04:31.730> out<00:04:31.910> that<00:04:31.940> they're<00:04:32.540> trying<00:04:32.750> to

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
game turns out that they're trying to

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.620 
game turns out that they're trying to
like<00:04:34.040> with<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.520> game<00:04:34.669> it's<00:04:34.940> not<00:04:35.180> just<00:04:35.240> going

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
like with the game it's not just going

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.360 
like with the game it's not just going
to<00:04:35.750> be<00:04:35.840> like<00:04:36.020> hacking<00:04:36.530> /<00:04:36.680> or<00:04:37.040> anything<00:04:37.340> like

them so I found them really pretty in my

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.800 
them so I found them really pretty in my
opinion<00:06:25.450> Zelda<00:06:26.020> games<00:06:26.230> are<00:06:26.500> not<00:06:26.650> about<00:06:26.890> like

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
opinion Zelda games are not about like

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.840 
opinion Zelda games are not about like
totally<00:06:28.810> taking<00:06:29.290> full<00:06:29.770> advantage<00:06:29.800> of<00:06:30.460> like

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
totally taking full advantage of like

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.940 
totally taking full advantage of like
graphics<00:06:31.570> am<00:06:31.810> I<00:06:31.960> I<00:06:32.140> mean<00:06:32.350> I<00:06:32.470> think<00:06:32.500> that's<00:06:32.830> what

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
graphics am I I mean I think that's what

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.070 
graphics am I I mean I think that's what
Mario<00:06:33.280> games<00:06:33.520> before<00:06:33.730> Zelda<00:06:34.600> games<00:06:34.810> they're
