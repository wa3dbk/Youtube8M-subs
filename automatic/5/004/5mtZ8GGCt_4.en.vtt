00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.769
 super mega turbo jos and welcome a 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.990
 more time to the channel and maybe listen to me 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.790
 will erase and well you know why not 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.070
 post on facebook I've been with 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.740
 infections in the throat and like five 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.300
 more non-derived diseases cough cough 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.980
 etcetera but not in this video I wanted 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.869
 talk to you about my impressions of bar 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.900
 the fill 4 and what I think I have not played 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.279
 very much the game so it happened I've 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.290
 played enough I have not played it very 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.760
 little bit of fact I have it for pc since 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.370
 I was on sale a few days ago it came out 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.760
 in 200 pesos the fib is worth 4 discharged 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.190
 for the pc and this I want you to see here 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.110
 something very funny here I knew I was 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.670
 the guy back here and I go to bed I say 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.250
 right now he's going to enter this chapita has 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.870
 to enter does not throw a grenade I say 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.950
 there are not all not now going to enter 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.360
 now goes back throws another grenade and 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.770
 This is where I must enter 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.930
 waiting for the prologue on the minimap 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.310
 they come from behind when I turn around 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.110
 the guy and he kills me and then there's the other 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.010
 once this was very funny the truth is 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.869
 I think so with water face 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.820
 but the truth is that it was very funny 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.040
 but he kept telling them about 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.490
 the dance the fill 4 this gameplay is not 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.890
 well I killed 5 and I died 10 times the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 I spent almost the entire game almost dead 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.030
 could you say of chiripa reach kill 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.680
 that almost the entire game I had 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.390
 dead but I wanted to talk to you about the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.890
 it's worth 4 what I think the truth is that it's a 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.460
 good game 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.170
 the little time that I've played it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.729
 have wanted to continue playing or 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.070
 is not your typical game that you play a 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.229
 two games and they say ah I got bored no 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.520
 already or is it a game that could be 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.590
 playing all day 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.170
 practically not or by saying a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.060
 example there are games that are parents but 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 you play them for a little while and you say 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.899
 bored another thing not then this game 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.569
 what he has to say is that if I eat 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.670
 that exists in the middle also hooks ok 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:00.300
 is what I liked now the differences 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.509
 between pc and xbox are not many but yes 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.569
 that there is a very strong one that is good 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.979
 that the one I notice the most that is good 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.080
 It's not the one I command, it's the one that 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.450
 the world is not there or what is the amount of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.489
 players 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.550
 Supports twice as many players 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.400
 then having more players like that 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.290
 the experience changes a little more ok to 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.349
 this change should such 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.239
 in the xbox the maps are big not 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.890
 but as it is not enough to fill 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.870
 the whole map like that can have more 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.800
 freedom to run around the map 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.739
 ok in the dps changes the thing because they are 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.540
 so many players that you do not even give 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.489
 count when they kill you from behind you 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.860
 they kill on their side they kill you over the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.840
 roof are many players then 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.540
 what you have to do in the dps is 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.130
 change a little bit more I do not mean 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.319
 change in the sense of being in a 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.980
 place and not move but you must 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.829
 avoid moving around the map ok yo 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.630
 I think it's I think that is the biggest 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.180
 difference because they are more are many 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.160
 players or I have 25 bullets and horita 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.170
 I get three or four there in front as 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.849
 can see he did not manage to kill even one 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.410
 because because they do not give me the bullets to 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.150
 kill five or six people when 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.239
 they come out in front that's the biggest 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.250
 difference take the fil in pc and in xbox 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.320
 that there are more players 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.320
 and having more players obviously 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.330
 you kill more or die more or depend on me 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.700
 case I no more than those who killed me the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.950
 he spent almost the entire game dead because 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.990
 I have not played much and then it has not 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.010
 used to much until I do not know well 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.050
 ok the maps then that's like if 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.440
 as if in part it's the biggest 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.140
 difference between the pc and the xbox and 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.000
 obviously I started I began the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.150
 game is graphically you see a little bit 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.830
 better is very light, the truth is not noticeable 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.610
 so you say wow what a difference 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.190
 abysmal, I 'm not playing it high 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.050
 high definition all I do not think that that 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.980
 when in ultra is that I do not remember 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.180
 because I'm moving the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.850
 configurations but I think I am 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.520
 playing high and I'm recording ok and 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.020
 still as I can see it's going to fluid to me 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.390
 start when I start the game like this 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.580
 As I thought I gave the guide but 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.250
 already afterwards since he recognizes it well 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.900
 the card is already going all fluid not what 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.870
 I notice a little more fluid instead in the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.479
 from in the xbox graphically like that 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.370
 it looks a little paler I do not know if 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.250
 you have noticed 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.860
 but well maybe it's just just very 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.350
 light but not good the biggest difference 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.050
 here is between the players on 24 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.930
 It has always been characterized 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.580
 characterized by having many 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.680
 players on pc has always had more 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.169
 players on pc that in xbox I mean 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.940
 playing though at the moment is that the 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.919
 it's true that it's great it's very good 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.199
 I like more players 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.729
 especially in the game modes that are 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.870
 by objectives ok 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.820
 that's where I think it could be 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.590
 enjoy a little more since in team 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.360
 deathmatch or duel by teams and is 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.950
 crazy the truth that there are so many 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.770
 players 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.070
 but there you have to take it 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.520
 a little more slowly and good for ya 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.140
 to end if I recommend the 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.480
 game I do not recommend it if I already know 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.430
 they bought or not or if they wanted to see the 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.150
 game I recommend it the truth is that a 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.910
 I liked it if it was not because I play 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.670
 several games this I would spend playing 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.310
 all day we go is what happens with me 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.010
 is that 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.500
 I no longer type in a single game 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.840
 go or whether I play right now several 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.400
 games or gears all in fact is very 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.870
 well the game is in closed beta 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.490
 when the open sale comes out 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.830
 like to take some videos of gerzon 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.050
 so they know the game and for sure 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.100
 you already saw it and it 's great 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.560
 truth is that the game is great is going to 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.350
 be a free game for pc is a free 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.930
 to play blizzard and the truth is that 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.240
 it's good the game was playing 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.330
 a little hairston because you already know too 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.400
 League of Legends is worth 4 , but feel 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.650
 I've played them like that a little bit 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.450
 little all no no I do not like it anymore 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.150
 shut up in a single game I feel that 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.000
 it's ridiculous to play a single game when 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.230
 you can play several games and good 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.360
 truth is that the game I liked the 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.510
 Valencia 4 is very good if I would buy 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.220
 the dlcs since they include several things 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.690
 and I hope you like it I do not know I do not know a 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.150
 they think of you be reading it 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.590
 the feel 4 I also say no not to do 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.210
 exclusive the channel I do not intend to be 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.060
 exclusive the channel of some single game 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.010
 I plan on raising my variety with days 2 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.990
 to day this this day I will upload this 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.280
 another to keep a bit of 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.030
 variety in the channel and then the 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.800
 people do not tell me 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.780
 he does not stop going up ligo play in his old age and 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.480
 the souvenir goes up this then I want 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.400
 bring a little of everything not with measure and 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.310
 Enjoy the games and enjoy the 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.260
 channel that you like not me 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.390
 I ask for your opinion to know what they think and 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.070
 what do they think if they want the fil 4 better? 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.770
 for example a comment that they leave a 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.630
 like to share it with your friends and we 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.630
