00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:09.940
 hello youtube friends welcome to 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:11.900
 this review on the smart watch 8 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.930
 unfortunately it is not rational it is brown 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.930
 watson 8 original I received a copy 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.000
 in spite of that the cooked one is enough 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.000
 Good complies with all the functions that 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.250
 What should he do? 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.259
 the smart watch 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.110
 well I have already raised a claim 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.040
 with the seller for not getting the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.030
 original product that promotes 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.399
 in your ad but a copy 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 I will wait for a refund of my money 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.440
 This product is not original 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.790
 despite this I can say that the clock 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.790
 is 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.850
 pretty functional 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:07.040
 all its functions work well it 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.040
 connect well to the smartphone 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.440
 by the application that I found in google 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.480
 play that is called that is very good is 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.170
 better than the original one in which it comes in 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.250
 the manual serves as a warning 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.250
 the application is called 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.290
 mediatek 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.140
 smart device can get it for free 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 in google play 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.920
 fit and 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.180
 I can tell you the clock works 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.050
 you can make calls exactly 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.060
 from it you can see the agenda 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.060
 the most fluid touch 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.060
 does not have the vibration function that if 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.060
 has the original 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.310
 but what gives the place very well 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.310
 notifications and 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.440
 the warnings is correctly the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.320
 instantly reaching the phone 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.330
 keeps connected does not disconnect 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.330
 It's easy if you get away from it 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.189
 and that's another one of the things that do not have 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.970
 the original that does not have the anti those that 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:32.790
 you get away from the phone they have it but from 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.790
 rest has all the functions 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.620
 his pressure is really economic no 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.620
 can follow for $ 35 on ebay 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.530
 but as I tell you, it's not the original 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.110
 that I have raised a claim 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.970
 to the seller 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.010
 and I'm waiting for your answer 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.800
 however, despite being a copy, 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.800
 it is a bad copy they can use 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.070
 good friends this is all 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.370
 I hope you see looks good to me in the 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.150
 box so that cheating does not enter 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.420
 most of these sellers 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.480
 advertise 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.700
 the original story and they send you the copy 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.330
 they also asked for it with your received in 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.810
 colour 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.100
 so be very careful and good luck with your 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.100
 shopping thanks
