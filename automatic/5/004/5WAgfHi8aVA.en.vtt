00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.120
 the pilot in the result of 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.090
 during the people 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.049
 such a TV on and 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.799
 yes that nice can follow and then the great unknown came out or not 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.729
 yes that's right 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:17.609
 god is an bit 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.640
 little researched 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.480
 the club and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.970
 yes it was not to underestimate club doors and they just didn't 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.980
 performed well last year and a real competition 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.980
 we also just have a lot of quality europe try to know more about it 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.630
 come short time 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.790
 after they turned off an engine in the previous round 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.010
 therefore without counter goals 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.240
 have a home 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.620
 haiti brianti getting bigger 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.700
 the no-one is therefore unknown 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.660
 yes they run on a donkey quality the koeman was approached one more time 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.120
 important it is for this group to be group stage language role interest through 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.620
 in person 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.090
 very important for me personally and also for the team 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.730
 very important that we now 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.250
 rp started playing and also really got into the pool phase yes there is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.710
 we will say no easy ears considering the strength of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.370
 the competition in which they play 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.580
 certainly the star competition and 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 what i said we shouldn't underestimate and slow ours for months 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.140
 own party time goes year than the competition but how did you feel about it 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 approached creatively hard after the defeat in the in zwolle 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.670
 yes that is part of it I mean 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.480
 everything is under a magnifying glass hour and 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.120
 yes it was right of course 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.870
 then criticism run away 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.880
 yes already spoken and that is now 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.140
 just left us behind and learn to look forward to the next 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.130
 Contest then it is said Stefan de Vrij is a current young Liverpool 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.230
 in itself a compliment life march 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.700
 I will be very disadvantageous for a football player 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.630
 yes maybe for a soccer player already 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.200
 m yes that that still has to do with your character with it that is already anyway 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.950
 difficult winter 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.149
 yes what can you do ruthlessness for years 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.950
 clothes 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.100
 yes it does 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.509
 might think that knowing that also has to do with experience 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.520
 that I have to learn from such situations that also have to deal with it differently 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.610
 but how do you do it just because you make mistakes 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.759
 of course he didn't blew them 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.159
 Yes sometimes 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.189
 years usually happens and then afterwards each must check and and 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.079
 years of thinking about how I felt differently we should do 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.439
 and then you have to learn crazy hey that criticism all plays stalin 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.279
 passed 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.719
 yes of course we are on it but we assume I have experienced it before and 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.579
 and then it only makes me stronger 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.259
 and there also seemed to be little mutual discussion with the trainer on Sunday 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.479
 appointment smit eleven winners received a lot 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.499
 well what i do what i said before if it doesn't work but a job 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.519
 there you hit the turning point that is no more than normal 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.749
 just pick it up 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:56.439
 yes that there too team was approached and and left behind us and 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.230
 yes now we only look ahead japin extra important by the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.230
 defeat in swollen and fruit so that you play at ajax next week 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.329

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.969
 very important but that is that is 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.459
