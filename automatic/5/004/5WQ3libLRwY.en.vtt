 friends this doubtless on the cover 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.280
 Exclusive and we'll do top talked 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.110
 frankfurt international car 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 this is a hall without doubt of 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.750
 who wore crossover gloves that started 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.160
 civilians in the 1980s the first to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.490
 to launch the concept of the world was to cross 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.800
 in 1982 launching the Cherokee in the market 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.130
 american jeep grand cherokee arriving 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.720
 here in the hall its third generation and with 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 same success 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.399
 but now the question of modifying the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.829
 crossover is very intensive crossover 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.300
 They began to be used for the very 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.070
 time is not for now 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.739
 some 10 years ago a little more 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.309
 concept of lycra like this one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.180
 prototype that wr will rogers da 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.489
 citroen gives a French brand that has 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.100
 also your various crossover on the shoulders 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.329
 In fact, the French bet a lot on this 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.079
 concept that the shadow 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.600
 both citroen and pejô renô itself 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.299
 citroen has in the Brazilian market the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.770
 cc aircross and other men who are 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.400
 also marketed here on the market 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.619
 European 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.350
 this highest car concept that gives 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.750
 a more and more imposing position that gives 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.570
 a leading position for a better 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.600
 visibility and leads to the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.009
 driver feels more secure 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.439
 of course, it could only succeed and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.119
 if that vehicle is the structure a 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 platform of a beige chevette sedan 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.460
 has a condition of running in a sedan and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 hatchback without those without seeming a 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.970
 traffic crash 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.460
 evidently that this car has a 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.070
 tendency to be a global success 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.619
 who most used the plane's 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.960
 design turning a suv into crossover 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.970
 but leaving this crossover with a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.890
 pint of aggressive a guerrilla 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.470
 urban transport were with jack 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 global sportage success is a car 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.570
 that the French cyril council is 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.450
 closed he is an attentive muscled guy 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.909
 there are people who think it a muscular in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.159
 over with another example a success 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.469
 world is the range rover evoque 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.160
 who would say range rover one was 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.430
 go around with crossed 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.710
 of global success this game that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.320
 did not succeed when under 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.990
 mastery of form by became 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.380
 success under tata indians domination 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.850
 motors i'm danson drug owners 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.250
 but never appear stand behind the scenes 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 that India really does not have 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.350
 credibility as a manufacturer of 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.810
 but here the car francs hall 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.110
 synthesizes this trend very well 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.840
 global philosophers mandarin markets 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.970
 now on the 1st and 2nd 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.290
 now from september of October alias to gm 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.930
 is presenting to the market 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.300
 Brazilian trox is a captive more 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.500
 most beautiful compact that will take the 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.270
 trade name on the market 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.580
 Latin American Brazilian market 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.100
 imported from mexico a new crossover 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.440
 also from GM means no brand 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.240
 world that is not exploiting this 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.320
 concept that is the concept of 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.320
 crossover in global markets
