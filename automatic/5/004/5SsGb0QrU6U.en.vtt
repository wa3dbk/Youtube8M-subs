 This time I'm going to show you how 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.430
 to achieve is the experience of the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.609
 enemies by enemy or multiplied 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.470
 for five and that's a very good thing 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.630
 If you have high level and soon

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.380
 I'll show you how it works 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.899
 unfortunately it 's the only way you 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.110

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.780
 will be purchased from l 6 I do not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.989
 I remember with exactly what you have to do. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.149
 buy but it's one of them and you go 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.940

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.699
 equipment and will have this 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.579
 bow here what does that bow do 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.350
 provides the experience that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.470
 enemies give to you 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.540
 multiplied by five, ie it is a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.070
 very good thing as I already said you want it 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.159
 quickly the pa 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.540
 But your character is of course 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.640
 your contract is not right 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.630
 what he has and has a very strong 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.600
 low is a very weak mark and its 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.009
 family also falls much faster or 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.080
 be the controller and use 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.970
 example always so strong enemy 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 hit him a thousand and when you give him 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.250
 Last hit on it 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.130
 switch to the bow take experience x 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 5 I'm going to kill you the enemy for you 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.750

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.950
 right side will appear a pee and 15 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.840
 what does the team mean by 5? 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.219
 the character here the staff here not a 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.219
 monster here I have 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:09.679
 there with you came in the corner 808 xp x 5 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.959
 so it was more a tip for game 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.220
 a very useful tip 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.520
 As I already told you who the pope wants 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.410

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.420
 Good guys, this was one more.

 video short but with a tip that I 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.170
