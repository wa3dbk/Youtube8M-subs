00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
average was 15 milliseconds ping and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.120

black<00:02:00.030> ops<00:02:00.240> 2<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.659> around<00:02:00.869> 30<00:02:01.320> 35

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
black ops 2 was around 30 35

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240 
black ops 2 was around 30 35
milliseconds<00:02:02.490> ping<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.380> average<00:02:04.380> that's<00:02:05.040> how

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
milliseconds ping on average that's how

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.620 
milliseconds ping on average that's how
much<00:02:05.399> difference<00:02:05.820> there<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.090> between<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
much difference there was between the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.680 
much difference there was between the
two<00:02:06.840> games<00:02:07.110> quite<00:02:07.950> dramatic<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
