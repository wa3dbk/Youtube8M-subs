her<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.410> into<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.770> counter<00:00:29.490> promenade

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
her out into a counter promenade

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.620 
her out into a counter promenade
position<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:31.129> here<00:00:32.180> into<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> promenade

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
position and here into a promenade

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.630 
position and here into a promenade
position<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.920> called<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> crossover

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
position so it's called a crossover

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
position so it's called a crossover
because<00:00:35.910> our<00:00:36.000> feet<00:00:36.149> are<00:00:36.210> crossing<00:00:36.660> over<00:00:36.810> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
because our feet are crossing over so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
because our feet are crossing over so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
side okay so let's do it once this way

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.259 
side okay so let's do it once this way
so<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.249> can<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.579> we're<00:02:08.669> gonna<00:02:08.789> offset<00:02:08.999> a

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
so you can see it we're gonna offset a

around we come into closed position and
on<00:03:56.970> both<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.359> those<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.989> outside<00:03:58.380> breaks<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
on both of those the outside breaks and

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.940 
on both of those the outside breaks and
the<00:03:59.519> crossover<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.620> any<00:04:01.769> amount

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
the crossover is you can do any amount
