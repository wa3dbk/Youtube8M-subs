USB hub that you're currently using

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.099 
USB hub that you're currently using
sucks<00:00:16.320> oh<00:00:16.670> yeah<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:18.000> may<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.270> seven<00:00:18.779> ports

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
sucks oh yeah it may have seven ports

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.200 
sucks oh yeah it may have seven ports
there<00:00:20.060> in<00:00:21.060> uh<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.529> problem<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> well

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
there in uh but the problem is is well

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.609 
there in uh but the problem is is well
the<00:00:24.330> devices<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:24.900> connected<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the devices you have connected to that

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
the devices you have connected to that
hub<00:00:25.859> aren't<00:00:26.220> getting<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.760> power<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.269> they

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
hub aren't getting the power that they

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.320 
hub aren't getting the power that they
they<00:00:27.990> need<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.830> run<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.699> ever<00:00:29.820> plugged<00:00:30.150> in

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
they need to run you ever plugged in

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.479 
they need to run you ever plugged in
like<00:00:30.660> high<00:00:31.109> power<00:00:31.349> device<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> scanner<00:00:32.160> or

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
like high power device like a scanner or

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.630 
like high power device like a scanner or
printer<00:00:33.170> into<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> USB<00:00:34.770> hub<00:00:34.920> only<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> find<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
printer into a USB hub only to find that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.729 
printer into a USB hub only to find that
you<00:00:35.969> were<00:00:36.030> having<00:00:36.149> issues<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.170> knew<00:00:37.620> it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
you were having issues like you knew it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.950 
you were having issues like you knew it
was<00:00:37.860> working<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.000> operating<00:00:39.420> system<00:00:39.690> was

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
was working but the operating system was

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170 
was working but the operating system was
kind<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> detecting<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
kind of detecting it but not really and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.880 
kind of detecting it but not really and
you<00:00:42.329> weren't<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.899> sure<00:00:43.230> what<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.710> needed

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
you weren't really sure what you needed

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.310 
you weren't really sure what you needed
to<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.610> things<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> work<00:00:45.149> well<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:46.110> was

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to do to get things to work well it was

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.850 
to do to get things to work well it was
likely<00:00:46.649> related<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.879> USB<00:00:48.570> device<00:00:48.870> not

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
likely related to that USB device not

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.330 
likely related to that USB device not
having<00:00:50.700> enough<00:00:51.180> power<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.350> again<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> an

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
having enough power so again this is an

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
having enough power so again this is an
intervention<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.360> wanted<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> tell

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
intervention because I wanted to tell

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.310 
intervention because I wanted to tell
you<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.760> newer<00:00:57.539> technology

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you about this it's a newer technology

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.430 
you about this it's a newer technology
so<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.100> an<00:00:59.550> older<00:01:00.300> technology<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.289> it's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
so it's an older technology but it's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.570 
so it's an older technology but it's
from<00:01:01.680> newer<00:01:01.920> technology<00:01:02.840> sells<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.110> around

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
from newer technology sells for around

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
seven port USB 2.0 hub better than the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.249 
seven port USB 2.0 hub better than the
rest<00:01:32.540> each<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.110> every<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.970> these<00:01:36.659> ports

rest each and every one of these ports
gets<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.820> 500<00:01:39.860> milliamps<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:41.729> means<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
gets up to 500 milliamps which means you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.649 
gets up to 500 milliamps which means you
can<00:01:43.409> run<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.790> high<00:01:45.000> powered<00:01:45.450> USB

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
can run all your high powered USB

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.499 
can run all your high powered USB
devices<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> hub<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
devices from the hub and not have a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.929 
devices from the hub and not have a
problem<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.259> $30.00<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.399> same<00:01:50.579> amount<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
problem for $30.00 so the same amount of

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.429 
problem for $30.00 so the same amount of
money<00:01:51.090> you're<00:01:51.329> likely<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.020> spend<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
money you're likely going to spend in a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.920 
money you're likely going to spend in a
hub<00:01:52.560> anyway<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.220> got<00:01:53.700> my<00:01:53.970> hub<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.600> three

hub anyway so I got my hub for three

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.910 
hub anyway so I got my hub for three

enough USB devices but are you having

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.510 
enough USB devices but are you having
problems<00:02:11.250> could<00:02:12.180> be

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
problems could be

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.370 
problems could be
related<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.030> hub<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:13.660> again<00:02:14.020> your

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
related to the hub so again your

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.780 
related to the hub so again your
computer<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.890> have<00:02:15.040> been<00:02:15.190> talking<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.730> we

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
computer and I have been talking and we

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.970 
computer and I have been talking and we
think<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.540> need<00:02:16.660> e<00:02:16.720> better<00:02:17.140> USB<00:02:17.590> hub<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:17.920> as

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
think you need e better USB hub and as

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.240 
think you need e better USB hub and as
far<00:02:18.160> as<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.610> know<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.140> admittedly<00:02:20.740> they<00:02:20.980> didn't

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
far as I know and admittedly they didn't

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.910 
far as I know and admittedly they didn't
send<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.610> me<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:22.210> review<00:02:22.600> but<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.470> jumped

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
send this to me to review but I jumped

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.470 
send this to me to review but I jumped
at<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.040> chance<00:02:24.070> because<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.970> know<00:02:25.060> me

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
at the chance because you know me

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.720 
at the chance because you know me
USB<00:02:25.780> guy<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.440> got<00:02:26.830> like<00:02:27.010> what<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> seven

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
USB guy I got like what is it a seven

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.550 
USB guy I got like what is it a seven
for<00:02:27.940> port<00:02:28.240> USB<00:02:28.390> hub<00:02:28.600> back<00:02:28.930> there<00:02:29.140> but<00:02:29.260> even<00:02:29.500> I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
for port USB hub back there but even I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.900 
for port USB hub back there but even I
have<00:02:29.590> problems<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.160> because<00:02:30.400> not<00:02:30.550> every

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
have problems that because not every

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.900 
have problems that because not every
channel<00:02:31.150> gets<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.570> power<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:32.080> needs<00:02:32.520> well<00:02:33.520> I'm

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
channel gets the power it needs well I'm

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.670 
channel gets the power it needs well I'm
going<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.120> be<00:02:34.210> replacing<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:35.020> newer

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
going to be replacing it with newer

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.880 
going to be replacing it with newer

technologies USB 2.0 hub and I'm sure at

technologies USB 2.0 hub and I'm sure at
some<00:02:38.950> point<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.310> future<00:02:39.400> they<00:02:39.910> will<00:02:40.030> support

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
some point in future they will support

some point in future they will support

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
USB 3.0 either way at this point I don't

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.960 
USB 3.0 either way at this point I don't
really<00:02:43.540> have<00:02:43.720> any<00:02:43.900> USB<00:02:44.560> 3.0<00:02:45.010> devices<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.520> USB

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
really have any USB 3.0 devices so a USB

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.450 
really have any USB 3.0 devices so a USB
2.0<00:02:46.360> hub<00:02:46.570> will<00:02:47.110> suffice<00:02:47.460> specifically

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
2.0 hub will suffice specifically

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.810 
2.0 hub will suffice specifically
because<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.970> know<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:50.020> devices<00:02:50.560> won't<00:02:51.130> have

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
because I know the devices won't have

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.810 
because I know the devices won't have
problems<00:02:52.780> because<00:02:53.410> 90%<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> problems

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
problems because 90% of the problems

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.610 
problems because 90% of the problems
aren't<00:02:55.030> related<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.600> devices<00:02:56.050> aren't

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
necessarily related to the drivers but

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.390 
necessarily related to the drivers but
because<00:02:58.690> they're<00:02:59.080> not<00:02:59.320> getting<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.190> power

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
because they're not getting the power

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.930 
because they're not getting the power
they<00:03:00.760> require<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.440> if<00:03:02.770> you're<00:03:03.280> ready<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.610> chuck
