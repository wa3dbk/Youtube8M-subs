oh I might do weigh ins and record them
because<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.650> can<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:40.730> know<00:03:40.850> do<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.300> on<00:03:41.390> my<00:03:41.480> up<00:03:41.660> my

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
because I can you know do it on my up my

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.990 
because I can you know do it on my up my
iphone<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.770> automatically<00:03:43.310> uploads<00:03:43.850> to

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
iphone and it automatically uploads to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000 
iphone and it automatically uploads to
youtube<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.420> it's<00:03:44.570> pretty<00:03:44.690> quick<00:03:45.020> versus

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
youtube and it's pretty quick versus

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.930 
youtube and it's pretty quick versus
this<00:03:46.190> way<00:03:46.400> because<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.790> takes<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.060> long<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:48.940> but

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
this way because it takes so long so but

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.240 
this way because it takes so long so but
I<00:03:50.030> think<00:03:50.240> that's<00:03:50.420> pretty<00:03:50.570> much<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.860> my<00:03:51.860> first

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
I think that's pretty much it my first

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.130 
I think that's pretty much it my first
