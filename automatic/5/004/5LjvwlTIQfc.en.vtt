hello<00:00:07.740> guys<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.220> Matt<00:00:08.880> from<00:00:08.910> KCK<00:00:09.719> here<00:00:09.960> and

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
hello guys it's Matt from KCK here and

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.959 
hello guys it's Matt from KCK here and
today<00:00:10.590> we're<00:00:10.830> checking<00:00:10.860> out<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> Seagate

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
today we're checking out the Seagate

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.930 
today we're checking out the Seagate
sshd<00:00:12.929> hybrid<00:00:13.920> 2<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> half<00:00:14.490> inch<00:00:14.730> drive

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
sshd hybrid 2 and a half inch drive

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.660 
sshd hybrid 2 and a half inch drive
we've<00:00:15.809> got<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> 500<00:00:16.740> gigabyte<00:00:17.160> seven

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
we've got the 500 gigabyte seven

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.609 
we've got the 500 gigabyte seven
millimeter<00:00:18.119> thick<00:00:18.449> variant<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.140> take<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> look

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
millimeter thick variant to take a look

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.609 
millimeter thick variant to take a look
at<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.789> what<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.330> well<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.380> combination

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
at so what is it well it's a combination

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.310 
at so what is it well it's a combination
of<00:00:23.070> an<00:00:23.220> SSD<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.240> conventional<00:00:24.539> mechanical

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
both worlds the performance of an SSD

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.209 
both worlds the performance of an SSD
but<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> capacity<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.710> mechanical

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
but with the capacity of a mechanical

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.970 
but with the capacity of a mechanical
drive<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.390> drive<00:00:33.630> still<00:00:33.989> looks<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.469> feels<00:00:34.739> as

drive the drive still looks and feels as
you<00:00:35.219> would<00:00:35.370> expect<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:36.210> both<00:00:36.420> SATA<00:00:36.719> power

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you would expect with both SATA power

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.520 
you would expect with both SATA power
and<00:00:37.290> SATA<00:00:37.739> data<00:00:38.040> connections<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> bottom

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
SATA 6 gigabit per second interface so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.670 
SATA 6 gigabit per second interface so
you<00:00:45.120> should<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.510> maximum<00:00:46.020> performance<00:00:46.170> from

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
you should see maximum performance from

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
you should see maximum performance from
the<00:00:46.770> drive<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.489> using<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> device<00:00:48.120> which

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the drive when using a device which

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
the drive when using a device which
supports<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.559> he'll<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.190> do

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
supports this so he'll get up to do

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
supports this so he'll get up to do
