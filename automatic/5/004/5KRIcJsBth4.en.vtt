00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
awfully adjustable so you can just

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.979 
awfully adjustable so you can just
adjust<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.649> by<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.610> quite<00:02:11.760> good

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and it's kind of

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.990

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
though is because they feel really

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.420 
though is because they feel really
flimsy<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.170> because<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.800> use<00:02:26.040> these<00:02:26.250> to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
flimsy and because I use these to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.610 
flimsy and because I use these to
commute<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.700> work<00:02:26.940> with<00:02:27.349> that<00:02:28.349> they're

with<00:04:54.470> your<00:04:54.710> dude<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.950> back<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.190> up<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.490> order

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
with your dude to back it up the order

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.640 
with your dude to back it up the order
is<00:04:55.790> fantastic<00:04:56.390> but<00:04:57.020> not<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.350> build<00:04:57.530> quality

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
is fantastic but not the build quality

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.550 
is fantastic but not the build quality
to<00:04:57.980> back<00:04:58.130> it<00:04:58.280> up<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:58.990> it's<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.110> bit<00:05:00.230> of<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.350> shame

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
to back it up and it's a bit of a shame

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.500 
to back it up and it's a bit of a shame
because<00:05:01.010> they're<00:05:01.610> already<00:05:01.730> fantastic<00:05:02.090> and

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
because they're already fantastic and

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.510 
because they're already fantastic and
phones<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.960> they're<00:05:03.920> reasonably

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
phones and they're reasonably

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.580 
phones and they're reasonably
comfortable<00:05:04.730> for<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.780> songs<00:05:06.050> that<00:05:06.260> they<00:05:06.440> are

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
comfortable for the songs that they are

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.360 
comfortable for the songs that they are
and<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:08.150> know<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.570> price<00:05:08.780> is<00:05:09.260> probably<00:05:09.620> I

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
and you know the price is probably I

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.700 
and you know the price is probably I
would<00:05:11.000> guess<00:05:11.030> roughly<00:05:11.600> right<00:05:11.930> they<00:05:12.380> just<00:05:12.590> need

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
would guess roughly right they just need

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.220 
would guess roughly right they just need
to<00:05:12.800> get<00:05:12.860> their<00:05:13.400> sort<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.120> quality<00:05:14.600> on<00:05:14.870> the

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
to get their sort of quality on the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.840 
to get their sort of quality on the
headphones<00:05:15.530> sorted<00:05:15.980> because<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:16.580> just<00:05:16.730> all

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
headphones sorted because it's just all

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.570 
headphones sorted because it's just all
plasticky<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.510> it's<00:05:17.780> kind<00:05:18.050> of<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:18.400> don't<00:05:19.400> know

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
plasticky and it's kind of I don't know

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.190 
plasticky and it's kind of I don't know
like<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.880> ear<00:05:20.000> cut<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.330> ear<00:05:20.420> cups<00:05:20.690> are<00:05:20.930> fine

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
like the ear cut the ear cups are fine

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.800 
like the ear cut the ear cups are fine
but<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.220> bit<00:05:22.370> is<00:05:22.520> made<00:05:22.730> out<00:05:22.880> of<00:05:23.000> is<00:05:23.180> plasticky

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
but the bit is made out of is plasticky

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.040 
but the bit is made out of is plasticky
and<00:05:24.080> it's<00:05:24.260> kind<00:05:24.530> of<00:05:24.710> as<00:05:25.130> a<00:05:25.190> no<00:05:25.400> it's<00:05:25.700> just<00:05:26.050> the

and it's kind of as a no it's just the
sounds<00:05:27.380> really<00:05:27.530> great<00:05:27.710> but<00:05:27.770> it's<00:05:28.100> just<00:05:28.310> kind

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
sounds really great but it's just kind

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.980

Razer Electra's which also possess the
Razer<00:06:35.900> Electra<00:06:36.050> is<00:06:36.320> are<00:06:36.530> better<00:06:36.800> for<00:06:37.450> for

Razer Electra is are better for for

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.879 
Razer Electra is are better for for

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:39.889 
comfort but were

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.520 
comfort but were
for<00:06:40.189> audio<00:06:40.759> so<00:06:41.180> what<00:06:41.719> I'd<00:06:41.930> really<00:06:42.199> like<00:06:42.289> to<00:06:42.409> see

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
for audio so what I'd really like to see

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.409 
for audio so what I'd really like to see
actually<00:06:42.860> is<00:06:43.009> them<00:06:43.490> develop<00:06:44.180> a<00:06:44.240> hybrid

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
actually is them develop a hybrid

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.920 
actually is them develop a hybrid
between<00:06:44.780> the<00:06:45.110> DeRose<00:06:45.590> and<00:06:45.999> the<00:06:46.999> Electra's<00:06:47.419> so

they've got fantastic audio fantastic
comfort<00:06:53.599> and<00:06:53.719> everything<00:06:53.930> like<00:06:53.990> that<00:06:54.080> I<00:06:54.379> think

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
comfort and everything like that I think

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.860 
comfort and everything like that I think
the<00:06:54.860> problem<00:06:54.979> is<00:06:55.219> my<00:06:55.939> ears<00:06:56.210> are<00:06:56.330> quite<00:06:56.389> big<00:06:56.659> and

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870 
the problem is my ears are quite big and

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.469 
the problem is my ears are quite big and
the<00:06:57.020> antral<00:06:57.319> cups<00:06:57.560> are<00:06:58.249> quite<00:06:58.849> small<00:06:59.240> and

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
the antral cups are quite small and

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:00.879 
the antral cups are quite small and
they're<00:06:59.599> round<00:06:59.810> as<00:07:00.050> well<00:07:00.199> your<00:07:00.590> ears<00:07:00.740> are<00:07:00.860> not

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:00.889 
they're round as well your ears are not

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.350 
they're round as well your ears are not
round<00:07:01.189> they're<00:07:01.490> kind<00:07:01.729> of<00:07:01.819> more<00:07:01.999> square<00:07:02.330> than

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
round they're kind of more square than

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.839 
round they're kind of more square than
they<00:07:02.569> are<00:07:02.659> round<00:07:02.870> or<00:07:02.990> triangular<00:07:03.469> and<00:07:03.800> so<00:07:04.520> I

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
they are round or triangular and so I

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.029 
they are round or triangular and so I
think<00:07:05.719> they're<00:07:05.810> trying<00:07:05.990> to<00:07:06.020> like<00:07:06.319> adapt<00:07:06.800> to

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 
think they're trying to like adapt to

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.170 
think they're trying to like adapt to
everybody's<00:07:07.430> ears<00:07:07.610> and<00:07:07.849> if<00:07:07.939> you've<00:07:08.029> got<00:07:08.150> a

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
everybody's ears and if you've got a

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.309 
everybody's ears and if you've got a
small<00:07:08.419> raise<00:07:08.569> you're<00:07:08.900> probably<00:07:09.050> right

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 
small raise you're probably right

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.540 
small raise you're probably right
because<00:07:09.590> they<00:07:09.680> probably<00:07:09.800> fit<00:07:10.069> in<00:07:10.099> the<00:07:10.340> cups

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
because they probably fit in the cups

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.679 
because they probably fit in the cups
and<00:07:10.759> they're<00:07:10.849> probably<00:07:10.969> a<00:07:11.330> lot<00:07:11.659> more

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:11.689 
and they're probably a lot more

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:14.050 
and they're probably a lot more
cushioned<00:07:12.289> because<00:07:13.039> might<00:07:13.250> because<00:07:13.550> the<00:07:13.669> the

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
cushioned because might because the the

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.760 
cushioned because might because the the
padding<00:07:14.539> rests<00:07:14.960> on<00:07:15.050> the<00:07:15.139> outside<00:07:15.409> of<00:07:15.500> my<00:07:15.560> ears

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
padding rests on the outside of my ears

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.409 
padding rests on the outside of my ears
i<00:07:15.949> get<00:07:16.370> fatigued<00:07:16.639> after<00:07:16.819> about<00:07:17.060> half<00:07:17.240> an<00:07:17.330> hour

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419 
i get fatigued after about half an hour

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:20.800 
i get fatigued after about half an hour
so<00:07:17.689> yes<00:07:18.080> i<00:07:18.349> it's<00:07:19.250> kind<00:07:19.520> of<00:07:19.610> been<00:07:19.789> not<00:07:20.509> the<00:07:20.659> best

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
so yes i it's kind of been not the best

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.679 
so yes i it's kind of been not the best
