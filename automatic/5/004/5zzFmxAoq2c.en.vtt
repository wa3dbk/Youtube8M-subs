00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.630 
I really like the wall design on the
outside<00:01:40.600> with<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.140> cobblestone<00:01:42.010> wall<00:01:42.370> and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
outside with the cobblestone wall and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.420 
outside with the cobblestone wall and
the<00:01:43.510> sandstone<00:01:43.990> underneath<00:01:44.740> with<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.010> bush<00:01:45.220> I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
the sandstone underneath with the bush I

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.280

let's check out the backyard now you

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.810 
let's check out the backyard now you
probably<00:06:02.470> saw<00:06:02.710> something<00:06:03.070> from<00:06:03.220> the<00:06:03.370> flyby

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
probably saw something from the flyby

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.740 
probably saw something from the flyby
and<00:06:03.880> it<00:06:04.030> isn't<00:06:04.180> like<00:06:04.450> your<00:06:04.600> traditional

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
and it isn't like your traditional

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.720 
and it isn't like your traditional
backyard<00:06:05.500> where<00:06:05.770> Pete<00:06:06.340> what's<00:06:06.520> done<00:06:06.700> here

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
backyard where Pete what's done here

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.610 
backyard where Pete what's done here
nothing<00:06:07.300> where<00:06:07.750> people<00:06:08.020> just<00:06:08.140> usually<00:06:08.470> put

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
nothing where people just usually put

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.020 
nothing where people just usually put
swimming<00:06:08.950> pools<00:06:09.130> and<00:06:09.340> I<00:06:09.400> like<00:06:09.640> the<00:06:09.760> fact<00:06:09.940> that

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
swimming pools and I like the fact that

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.610 
swimming pools and I like the fact that
they<00:06:10.180> didn't<00:06:10.480> use<00:06:10.630> this<00:06:10.720> room<00:06:10.900> so<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:11.380> kind<00:06:11.590> of

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
they didn't use this room so you kind of

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.680 
they didn't use this room so you kind of
just<00:06:11.680> like<00:06:11.920> mixes<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.430> up<00:06:12.520> a<00:06:12.640> bit<00:06:12.670> so<00:06:13.030> you<00:06:13.540> got<00:06:13.660> a

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
just like mixes it up a bit so you got a

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.420 
just like mixes it up a bit so you got a
path<00:06:13.930> going<00:06:14.140> around<00:06:14.290> here<00:06:14.470> does<00:06:14.620> this<00:06:14.770> nice

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
path going around here does this nice

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.720 
path going around here does this nice
pond<00:06:15.910> with<00:06:16.180> this<00:06:16.330> kind<00:06:16.960> of<00:06:17.020> like<00:06:17.200> it's<00:06:17.500> just

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730
