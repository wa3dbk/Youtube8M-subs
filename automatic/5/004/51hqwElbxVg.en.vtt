00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
bullet because mp3 got another phone it
was<00:00:49.500> only<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.710> hundred<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.980> 10x<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> it's

that's a less HP don't quote me on that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.110 
that's a less HP don't quote me on that
