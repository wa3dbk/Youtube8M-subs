 and also the famous crates are 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.260
 the boxes that exchange the festive weapons in the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.899
 team since this giant comes 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.890
 along with that map that the be rock or 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.969
 be a gigantic map that the robots 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.820
 enemies, right? 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.290
 logical and stole enemy will go through a 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:09.490
 way to your base in the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.659
 Syria or it 's easy not because you should 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.270
 because bigger corridor but this robot 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.009
 What's going to work? 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.580
 so I do not know what work this is anymore 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.080
 It will give so no matter to the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.759
 corridor is great you have more time to 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.610
 kill the smaller robots because the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.210
 engineer mz godzilla 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.880
 damn he even talked a little about the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.950
 guns now face 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.710
 we have here to vaccinate because the weapon 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.310
 doctor you get 50% off the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.710
 Cargo loading bt ie ard 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.500
 it will load faster but by another 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.930
 you lose 66 percent of the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.180
 overweight was on the cure is the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.020
 more life gain is the booth 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.270
 then you will have less 66% to leave 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.210
 On the other hand, it's good when you are 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.799
 looking for someone will add 10 per 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.500
 resistance for you and the 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.039
 his comrade for the damages that came 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.790
 So it's good when you 've given the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.489
 bertin charge is the charge will provide 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.579
 has 5% resistance for the danny 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.620
 received or you were not immune anymore 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:27.560
 you will get 75% protection and all 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.430
 I have a colleague if I hit the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.730
 enemy 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:37.760
 you get 25 percent healing or 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.980
 pray that your friend has a good look 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.579
 we do not want to escape from the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.519
 moment is he releases face cannonballs 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.459
 too much mass has a time to cast 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:55.760
 these ditches time two seconds 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:59.959
 that only one of the fuses in that court is 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.760
 burn and you can speed up these two 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.750
 seconds pushing the firing button 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.819
 holding down these bullets is 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.950
 cannon unfortunately do not explode in the 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.950
 impact 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.650
 thaeme and they have a beck touch 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.900
 that is if you hit someone with this 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.639
 Cannonball and someone will get 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.940
 a damage that I do not know which one was not 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:25.459
 shown and the player will go back 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.669
 understood this is the notebook is just like the street 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.030
 new page that gives a push in 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.650
 face and if you happen to get this 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.729
 cannonball to hit some 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.449
 surface 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:41.449
 it will take 50% less damage in the 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:44.269
 comrade where she arrives 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:48.919
 It seems like a fun game. 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:52.760
 we have rec rangers here for what gave 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:56.470
 to understand when you press out but the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.470
 mouse button shoot you use metal 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.560
 to carry is to take the construction to the 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.889
 long range and also in doubt still 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.340
 I did not understand something cool that he 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:13.280
 said to a special screw that can 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.239
 is to repair the friendly buildings do not know 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.180
 to repair their buildings more than 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.130
 Far you can help your friend ia 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.630
 always leave constructions in general 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.630
 fell to 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.160
 the downside is that you carry less 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.740
 50% of primary ammunition, ie all 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.340
 Time will have to carry and you lose. 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.060
 34% in size of his or cartridge is 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.090
 Bullet cartridges will then spend a lot 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.920
 thing that you're going to be kind of lost and 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.660
 if I 'm not mistaken, it will have a 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.630
 equal head death when the defendant 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.580
 zikovs light run I think it will have 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.500
 This too if I understand correctly and that's it 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.860
 these are the three new weapons that 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.050
 arrived seem to be quite fun to play 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.669
 I think it's more complicated is this 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.680
 engineer who is r rangers but it's good 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.400
 see that it will not roll this to 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.080
 finalize this video have reached new 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.680
 new rescues 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.919
 I'm going to say 7 dude because it's really 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.200
 a sad one has that have that red 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.540
 he really is just the hatch is that 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.970
 yellow and I did not like it very much 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.330
 well we got this blue I found 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.419
 sensational a flip flop connect the 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.330
 The little mustache 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.930
 they were perfect dude i like it very much 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.910
 to have a regime so who knows the pallium 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.120
 became insane 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.500
 so that was for me the most 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.650
 psychedelic they did was this panel 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.710
 scenery scattered hair fields 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.100
 was sensational and finalizing also 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.390
 one the scout wants i found end names 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.600

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.550
