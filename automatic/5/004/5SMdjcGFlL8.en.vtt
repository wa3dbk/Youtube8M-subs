00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
ball common mistake number two is that

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.449 
ball common mistake number two is that
the<00:02:30.140> ball<00:02:30.319> goes<00:02:30.500> out<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.980> side<00:02:31.220> because

the controlling foot isn't square enough

number<00:02:41.450> three<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.079> player<00:02:42.349> doesn't

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
number three is that the player doesn't

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.170 
number three is that the player doesn't
position<00:02:43.099> themselves<00:02:43.549> right<00:02:43.730> behind<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
they stay in the same spot and try to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.059 
they stay in the same spot and try to
reach<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.450> ball<00:02:50.650> another<00:02:51.650> similar

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.380 
reach for the ball another similar
mistake<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.519> look<00:02:52.640> for<00:02:52.879> is<00:02:52.970> ever<00:02:53.120> player

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
mistake to look for is ever player

positions<00:02:53.900> their<00:02:54.110> body<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.160> ball<00:02:55.310> is

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
positions their body so that the ball is

positions their body so that the ball is
coming<00:02:55.610> towards<00:02:56.120> them<00:02:56.299> at<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:56.930> different<00:02:57.349> body

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
coming towards them at a different body

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.380 
coming towards them at a different body
parts<00:02:57.890> such<00:02:58.040> as<00:02:58.069> their<00:02:58.370> thigh<00:02:58.610> where<00:02:59.269> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
parts such as their thigh where the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.990 
parts such as their thigh where the
player<00:02:59.599> still<00:02:59.870> tries<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.230> use<00:03:00.379> their<00:03:00.620> foot

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
player still tries to use their foot

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.430 
player still tries to use their foot
it's<00:03:02.000> important<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.540> remind<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.900> fire<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.290> get

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
it's important to remind the fire to get

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.020 
it's important to remind the fire to get
behind<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.920> ball<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.250> position<00:03:04.700> their<00:03:04.819> body

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
behind the ball and position their body

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.059 
behind the ball and position their body
so<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.450> ball<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.690> coming<00:03:06.079> in<00:03:06.170> feet<00:03:06.380> height<00:03:06.620> by

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
so the ball is coming in feet height by

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.450 
so the ball is coming in feet height by
the<00:03:07.130> time<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.609> ball<00:03:07.730> gets<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.060> their<00:03:08.239> body
