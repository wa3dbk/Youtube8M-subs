00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.250
 Why? 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.420
 Why did you leave? 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.540
 Why? Why? 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.540
 Why did you leave? 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.210
 Why? 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.690
 Why did I cry after that? 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.360
 Why did you cry like a fool? 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.950
 I do not know ~ 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.700
 But I .. 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.380
 I still want to tell you .. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.590
 To come back to me ~ 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.550
 I really did not want to leave you ~ 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.760
 Oh. Why? 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.840
 Why is it still foolish? 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.270
 Still in my heart? 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.790
 Why do I cry like that? 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.330
 Whenever you see a sad series? 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.780
 Your heart that is gone knows nothing 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.450
 Nothing now connects me and you ~ 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.880
 I can not accept it ~ 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 I can not believe it ~ 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.370
 Memories that do not forget much with you ~ 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.260
 I realized that your heart has become too far ~ 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.420
 I felt so shocked ~ 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.580
 This never happened .. 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.340
 In my imagination or in my dreams 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 What will i do now? 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.760
 Will I be able to continue living? 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.100
 Will I appreciate and have disappeared the reason I lived for? 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.190
 I continue to drown in those dark questions ~ 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.450
 The time does not seem to pass in your absence ~ 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.130
 Why? 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.300
 Why did you leave? 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.420
 Why? Why? 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 Why did you leave? 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.090
 Why? 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.570
 Why did I cry after that? 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.240
 Why did you cry like a fool? 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.830
 I do not know ~ 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580
 But I .. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.260
 I still want to tell you .. 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.470
 To come back to me ~ 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.430
 I really did not want to leave you ~ 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.690
 Oh. Why? 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.200
 For your skin ~ 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.380
 So I will not cause you wounds 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.030
 For the certainty that you will not abandon me ~ 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.220
 I made a decision .. 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.720
 That I will leave first 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.210
 See your sadness and you are with me .. 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.690
 Made me better .. 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.190
 To see you smiling with another man ~ 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.670
 And this is why you leave 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.600
 where are you? 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600
 where did you go? 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.740
 What more place would you like to go to after you left? 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.580
 Are you happy with that place? 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.440
 Do not you miss me? 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.910
 Or am I exaggerating in my opinion? 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.690
 Why do I keep looking at my phone, then? 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.870
 I am from your migration ~ 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.210
 I am from you 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.410
 So why wait for your return with all this despair? 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.530
 What are my speeches? 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.840
 Love does not have to be forever 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.470
 I try ~ 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.090
 And keep trying ~ 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.970
 But why can not I forget you? 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.830
 Oh. Why? 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.340
 Why did you leave? 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.460
 Why? Why? 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.460
 Why did you leave? 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.130
 Why? 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.610
 Why did I cry after that? 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.280
 Why did you cry like a fool? 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.870
 I do not know ~ 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.620
 But I .. 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.300
 I still want to tell you .. 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.510
 To come back to me ~ 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.470
 I really did not want to leave you ~ 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.520
 Oh. Why?
