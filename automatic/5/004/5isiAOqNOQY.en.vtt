 the mobile that same luggage bar 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.590
 have any a new equipment 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.479
 at the initial level the card mobile 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.220
 learning and almost in me I want to see you from 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.770
 books in English 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.820
 Jennifer sounds of the friction that I have 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.659
 by moving to each area of â€‹â€‹his age he 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.659
 will move dedicating 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.770
 in mind 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:43.280
 and they gave me a new footballer in the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:49.820
 Tuesday and is very close to emergency in 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:55.090
 line on the day in which highlights 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.090
 group fiction in cultivation 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.670
 so that they think 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.800
 tinelli in it from the human being a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.190
 doctor what good are we going to give three 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.690
 weeks of rest to the team we know 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.989
 that on the 27th we have a match 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.550
 very important in the champions in egypt 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.200
 we want the team to get the best 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.730
 prepared not only possible that match 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.650
 but how hard the season is going to be 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.390
 of next year playing three 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.760
 competitions like are the champions the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.950
 throne and motorboat then 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.000
 we have to plan from two points 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.220
 of sight at the level of 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.770
 of rest that are the point of view 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.750
 physical and psychological point of view 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.160
 the players from the point of view of 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.200
 psychological they will be able to rest 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.400
 perfectly these three weeks because 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.130
 they will work outside of what is their 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.950
 usual routine environment that is the day 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.209
 to day here in the stadium with us what 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.950
 they will be able to do with their families 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.640
 traveling and resting and sharing 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.140
 time with all their families but no no 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.130
 it is a total rest is a rest 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.780
 relative we have made meetings 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.640
 individualized with each of the 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.620
 footballers depending on the need 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.810
 that each of them has so that the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.250
 day 15 when they arrive here and be the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.810
 first day of training so they can 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.100
 come in optimal conditions and not 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.959
 have to start from scratch taking in 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.340
 realize that we are going to have two weeks 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.260
 to be able to prepare the party so 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.420
 important then these jobs 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.160
 individualized, it is stated that the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.590
 footballer from the second and 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.910
 third week of rest they will have 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.320
 to do a job to get in 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.840
 optimal conditions in terms of 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.730
 percentage of fat and weight on the return 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.890
 to day 15 and as for work from 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.690
 resistance that we will control it with 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.120
 parameters that we have at the level 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.680
 of fat percentage to measure the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.140
 fat percentage and measure the weight of the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.000
 footballer so that on the way back 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.200
 as for that percentage of fat 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.400
 even the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.800
 footballers who do not meet those 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.890
 parameters and then we have a test 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.860
 assessment at the resistance level of 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.510
 Aerobic capacity where we already have 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.310
 parameters set now and the day 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.860
 15 when we return we will repeat this test 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.440
 so that the footballers then when 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.490
 have come to this period of rest 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.780
 we can verify that they really have 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.790
 done the work that we have done 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.550
 sent and that come in a few conditions 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.840
 optimal for the work that we 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.000
 we have planned in these two weeks 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.830
 pre-match 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.780
 good the last three league matches 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.109
 we have not been at the level that the team 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.730
 has shown in all parties 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.489
 before then we feel like 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.480
 also to finish as best as possible 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.130
 change a bit the image of these 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.810
 last three games also have in 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.420
 mind that the third game is still 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.560
 third place is not at stake so 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.360
 So much for us is very important 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.150
 get a win away from home 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.740
 this weekend and wait a bit for the 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.570
 other results that can be given for 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.490
 try to occupy that third position 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.890
 we are not happy with the season 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.050
 what we have done but the latter is missing 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.340
 last step in this competition against 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.260
 a team that will be difficult 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.000
 Experience tells us that against 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.680
 teams below are against those who more 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.620
 we have suffered and worse results we have 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.110
 obtained therefore we want to go from 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.610
 vacations and to finish the league with 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.560
 good taste in the mouth trying to get 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.540
 a victory that brings us closer to that 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.640
 third place and see if we can 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.380
 get good we have designed a 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.300
 work program for these three 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.820
 weeks in which the first week 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.960
 it has to be a rest week 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.610
 practically total after all the 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.960
 matches and trainings that we lead 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.580
 accumulated 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.139
 the soccer player needs to rest 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.780
 then the first week we have 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.250
 planned as rest and the others 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.199
 two weeks later we said a 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.970
 progressive work in which we are going 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.919
 doing more and more sessions more 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.630
 volume more intensity to get in 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.360
 the best conditions at first 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.470
 training on June 15 with 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.449
 these workouts we try 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.550
 guarantee that the footballer does not climb 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.050
 your percentage of fat does not lose 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.120
 physical abilities like strength or 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.530
 as the resistance we will try that 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.860
 Each player is in his best state 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.699
 For this we also design the programs 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.440
 in such a way that they are individualized 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.120
 based on the needs of each 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.130
 footballer there have been footballers who have 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.750
 suffered injuries during this year and 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.940
 they need a specific job to 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.949
 reinforce that part of your body that has 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.990
 suffered injury there are players who have 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.490
 had a program a problem or has it 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.289
 missed training because they have had 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.090
 have been out of the group for a 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.099
 period of time due to injury have to 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.990
 work something apart then we try 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.520
 design the program in such a way that 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.229
 go very individualized to the need 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.060
 of each footballer there is a general part 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.639
 for everyone but then there is one more part 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.229
 specific that is designed for each 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.889
 footballer with this we try that the 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.360
 player is 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.280
 perfect state 'the first day of 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.900
 training and that we can avoid 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.729
 typical lesions of the principle of 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.729
 training after a break and that 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.020
 we can guarantee that the following 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.460
 workouts are of quality 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.779
 enough to be able to face the 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.949
 first rival that we have that is the day 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.949
 on June 26
