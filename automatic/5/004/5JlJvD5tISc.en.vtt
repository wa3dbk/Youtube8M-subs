me here to improve my general health and
also<00:00:15.379> use<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> non-invasive<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.640> run<00:00:17.880> technique

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
also use a non-invasive to run technique

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
also use a non-invasive to run technique
which<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.500> I've<00:00:20.460> been<00:00:20.640> learning<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.150> lot<00:00:21.179> about

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
which is I've been learning a lot about

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.590 
which is I've been learning a lot about
this

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
this

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.690 
this
for<00:00:24.170> seniors<00:00:24.530> and<00:00:24.800> I<00:00:25.160> think<00:00:25.490> it's<00:00:25.640> a

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
for seniors and I think it's a

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.910 
for seniors and I think it's a
it's<00:00:26.970> press<00:00:27.360> them<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.830> be

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
it's press them now but is going to be

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.660 
it's press them now but is going to be
this<00:00:29.070> way<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.940> years<00:00:30.920> very<00:00:31.920> interesting<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:32.670 
this way it's years very interesting to

this way it's years very interesting to
have<00:00:32.760> this<00:00:32.970> top<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.080> line

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.880 

so<00:00:39.820> I'm<00:00:40.030> here<00:00:40.269> expecting<00:00:40.719> good<00:00:40.930> results<00:00:41.620> for

hi<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:12.320> field<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.950> there<00:01:13.790> be<00:01:13.939> there<00:01:14.119> probably

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
hi this field is there be there probably

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.149 
hi this field is there be there probably
this<00:01:14.930> feeling<00:01:15.350> this

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
this feeling this

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.149 
this feeling this
so<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:16.850> decided<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.749> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.730 

to<00:01:20.369> achieve<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:22.520> say<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.499> feel<00:01:25.679> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you are knowledgeable about stem cell

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.010 
you are knowledgeable about stem cell
technology<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.659> little<00:01:30.659> bit<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.350> course<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
technology a little bit of course not a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.899 
technology a little bit of course not a
scientist<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> nothing<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.880> I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.770 
experience and resume
so<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:22.130> feel<00:02:22.430> pretty<00:02:22.460> comfortable

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
so I feel pretty comfortable

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.010 
so I feel pretty comfortable
I'm<00:02:24.959> pretty<00:02:25.290> sure<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:26.550> very<00:02:27.330> small<00:02:27.660> channel

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
I'm pretty sure is very small channel

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.290 
I'm pretty sure is very small channel
okay<00:02:29.740> good<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.820> what<00:02:31.000> are<00:02:31.150> your

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
okay good and so what are your

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.280 
okay good and so what are your
expectations<00:02:31.720> from<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.740> procedure<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
expectations from the procedure on a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.520 
expectations from the procedure on a
regular<00:02:35.620> laser<00:02:36.930> resurface<00:02:38.400> skin<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:40.120> get

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
regular laser resurface skin you get

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.980 
regular laser resurface skin you get
some<00:02:41.530> results<00:02:41.770> but<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.880> very<00:02:43.120> limited<00:02:43.810> what

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
some results but it's very limited what

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.860 
some results but it's very limited what
they<00:02:44.110> can

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
they can

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.920 
they can
deeper<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.890> skin<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.909> regenerate<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
deeper in the skin to regenerate the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.500 
deeper in the skin to regenerate the
entire<00:02:48.290> school<00:02:48.680> as<00:02:49.400> with<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.909> procedure<00:02:50.360> she

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
entire school as with this procedure she

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.240 
entire school as with this procedure she
would<00:02:50.810> be

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
would be

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.190 
would be
to<00:02:53.250> achieve<00:02:53.640> these<00:02:53.880> goals<00:02:54.030> because<00:02:54.780> they<00:02:54.960> go

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
to achieve these goals because they go

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.320
