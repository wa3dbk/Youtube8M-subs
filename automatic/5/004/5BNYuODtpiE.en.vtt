00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.080 
hair and I'm just taking you know a
little<00:02:12.319> bit<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.950> jar<00:02:13.220> at<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.430> time<00:02:13.700> and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
little bit out of the jar at a time and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.780 
little bit out of the jar at a time and
just<00:02:14.230> placing<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.349> right<00:02:15.379> along<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.099> edge

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
just placing it right along that edge

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.930 
just placing it right along that edge
where<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.569> hair<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.500> sewn<00:02:19.220> into<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.610> weft

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
where the hair is sewn into the weft

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.630 
where the hair is sewn into the weft
this<00:02:20.450> helps<00:02:20.989> with<00:02:21.260> eliminating<00:02:22.190> lots<00:02:22.400> of

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
this helps with eliminating lots of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.870 
this helps with eliminating lots of
shedding<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:24.590> just<00:02:25.099> protects<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.640> hair

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
shedding and it just protects the hair

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.270 
shedding and it just protects the hair
so<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.180> lasts<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.690> long<00:02:26.900> time<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.860> that's<00:02:28.069> all

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
so it lasts a long time so that's all

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.819 
so it lasts a long time so that's all
