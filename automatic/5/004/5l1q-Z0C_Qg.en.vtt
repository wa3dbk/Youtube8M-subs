good<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.439> mean<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.729> weird<00:01:27.090> cuz

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
good this I mean it's like weird cuz

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.330 
good this I mean it's like weird cuz
it's<00:01:27.900> about<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.530> cross-dressing<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.020> like

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
it's about like cross-dressing and like

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.880 
it's about like cross-dressing and like
otaku's<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.310> embroil<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
otaku's and I think it's like embroil of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
otaku's and I think it's like embroil of
like<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.220> cross-dressing<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.479> crazy<00:01:40.310> god<00:01:42.200> but

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
like the cross-dressing is crazy god but

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.499 
like the cross-dressing is crazy god but
basically<00:01:43.409> missus<00:01:44.070> we're<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.299> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
basically missus we're just going to it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
basically missus we're just going to it
okay<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.860> basic<00:01:46.979> premise<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
okay so the basic premise of this is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.450 
okay so the basic premise of this is
that<00:01:48.509> there's<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.869> Club<00:01:49.229> which<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.100> called

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
again chicken and canned chicken is a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.429 
again chicken and canned chicken is a
club<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.420> University<00:01:55.079> Club<00:01:55.229> which

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
club and it's a University Club which

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.380 
club and it's a University Club which
means<00:01:55.619> college<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.640> college<00:01:57.030> type<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
means college it's a college type of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
means college it's a college type of
club<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.719> high<00:01:57.899> school<00:01:58.170> setting<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.530> college

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
club not high school setting but college

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
club not high school setting but college
and<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.909> need<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.390> get<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.689> least<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.170> more

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
member otherwise they're getting a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.139 
member otherwise they're getting a
shutdown<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:06.000> go
