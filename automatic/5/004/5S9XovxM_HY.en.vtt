the<00:01:39.390> glitch<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> lot<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the glitch and if you have a lot of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.109 
the glitch and if you have a lot of
zombies<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.119> most<00:01:42.479> likely<00:01:42.659> will<00:01:42.840> die

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
zombies there you most likely will die

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.399 
zombies there you most likely will die
or<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.270> least<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.140> good<00:01:46.259> at

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
or at least I do I'm not very good at

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.670 
or at least I do I'm not very good at
this<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.799> why<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.909> glitches<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:49.439> even

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
this that's why I have glitches but even

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.109 
this that's why I have glitches but even
with<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> glitch<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.220> don't<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.490> good<00:01:50.729> because

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
with the glitch I don't do good because

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
with the glitch I don't do good because
I<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> glitch<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.560> don't<00:01:53.430> know

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
I get out of the glitch I don't know

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.050 
I get out of the glitch I don't know
what<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.810> anyway<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
what I do but anyway and if you want to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
what I do but anyway and if you want to
throw<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> grenade<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> kill<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> them<00:01:58.229> just

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
throw a grenade to kill all of them just

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.830 
throw a grenade to kill all of them just
aim<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.700> pillar<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.450> throw<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
aim for this pillar there and throw it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.300 
aim for this pillar there and throw it
because<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.680> throw<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.950> front<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
because if you throw in front of you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830

them<00:02:32.970> up<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:37.880> some<00:02:38.880> here's<00:02:39.330> when<00:02:39.570> they're

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
them up and some here's when they're

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.870

close<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.710> can<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.490> end<00:02:41.730> up

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
close like this I can that end up

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.740 
close like this I can that end up
killing<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.650> try<00:02:44.070> not<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.310> do<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.750> if

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
