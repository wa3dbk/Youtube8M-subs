then<00:02:00.509> they<00:02:00.659> went<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.159> after<00:02:02.640> i<00:02:02.670> pack<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
then they went I have to after i pack it

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.370 
then they went I have to after i pack it
up<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.329> sent<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.659> them<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> I've<00:02:04.079> gotten

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
up and sent it to them and I've gotten

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.410 
up and sent it to them and I've gotten
the<00:02:04.439> new<00:02:04.560> Conine<00:02:04.950> once<00:02:05.460> their<00:02:05.820> straightener

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the new Conine once their straightener

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.139 
the new Conine once their straightener
once<00:02:06.630> they<00:02:06.869> received<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:08.149> then

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
once they received this one back then

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.839 
once they received this one back then
the<00:02:09.569> pack<00:02:10.430> replacement<00:02:11.430> which<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.670> probably

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the pack replacement which are probably

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.890 
the pack replacement which are probably
with<00:02:12.239> my<00:02:12.390> luck<00:02:12.629> me<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> reefer

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
with my luck me a reefer

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.410 
with my luck me a reefer
but<00:02:14.470> they'll<00:02:14.710> pack<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.250> up<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.640> they'll<00:02:16.180> send

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
but they'll pack it up and they'll send

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.010 
but they'll pack it up and they'll send
it<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.720> me

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
it to me

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.720 
it to me
so<00:02:17.560> I've<00:02:17.950> gone<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.870> expense<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.470> ship<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.220> I've

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
so I've gone to expense to ship it I've

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.330 
so I've gone to expense to ship it I've
gone<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.270> expense<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.260> buy<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.710> second<00:02:24.100> one<00:02:24.220> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
gone to expense to buy a second one that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.340 
gone to expense to buy a second one that
I<00:02:24.400> don't<00:02:24.670> need<00:02:24.940> having<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.720> back<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.020> might<00:02:26.200> be

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
I don't need having a back that might be

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.110 
I don't need having a back that might be
nice<00:02:26.470> but<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:27.010> really<00:02:27.040> can't<00:02:27.400> afford<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.820> backup

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
nice but I really can't afford a backup

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.270 
nice but I really can't afford a backup
right<00:02:28.300> now<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.350> then<00:02:29.560> also<00:02:29.770> there's<00:02:30.100> all<00:02:30.250> of

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
right now and then also there's all of

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.970 
right now and then also there's all of
my<00:02:30.460> time<00:02:30.700> involved<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.240> doing<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.860> told

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
my time involved in doing it so I told

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.010 
my time involved in doing it so I told
them<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.760> rather<00:02:33.970> than<00:02:34.240> spend<00:02:34.570> all<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.870> that

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
them that rather than spend all of that

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.650 
them that rather than spend all of that
time<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.530> money<00:02:35.650> doing<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.340> instead<00:02:37.090> I'll

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
time and money doing that instead I'll

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.540 
time and money doing that instead I'll
spend<00:02:37.990> a<00:02:38.170> little<00:02:38.410> bit<00:02:38.560> less<00:02:38.650> time<00:02:39.160> here

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
spend a little bit less time here

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.330 
spend a little bit less time here

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.390 
three-year warranty this is what it does
right<00:02:55.330> now<00:02:55.390> it's<00:02:55.690> turned<00:02:55.959> off<00:02:56.170> when<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:56.920> turn<00:02:57.250> it

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
right now it's turned off when I turn it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.630 
right now it's turned off when I turn it
on<00:02:57.520> you're<00:02:58.060> going<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.300> hear<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.570> vibrate<00:02:59.110> and

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
on you're going to hear a vibrate and

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.880 
on you're going to hear a vibrate and
it's<00:03:00.640> quick<00:03:01.300> it's<00:03:01.600> real<00:03:02.140> quick<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.680> have

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
it's quick it's real quick so you have

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.860 
it's quick it's real quick so you have
to<00:03:03.010> listen<00:03:03.160> for<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.550> but<00:03:04.150> when<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.390> hear<00:03:04.690> that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
to listen for it but when you hear that

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.229 
to listen for it but when you hear that
that<00:03:05.290> indicates<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.550> vibrate<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.030> going

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
that indicates that the vibrate is going

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.100 
that indicates that the vibrate is going
to<00:03:07.300> work<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:08.170> I'm<00:03:08.470> going<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.650> turn<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.040> here

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.930 

hear<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.140> vibrate<00:03:14.800> okay<00:03:15.489> that's<00:03:15.820> the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
hear that vibrate okay that's the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.729 
hear that vibrate okay that's the
temperature<00:03:16.709> going<00:03:17.709> up<00:03:17.920> at<00:03:18.790> any<00:03:19.000> rate<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:20.500> is

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
temperature going up at any rate that is

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.050 
temperature going up at any rate that is
the<00:03:20.860> where<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.100> supposed<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.370> vibrate<00:03:21.790> so

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
the where it's supposed to vibrate so

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.940 
the where it's supposed to vibrate so
when<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.299> close<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:23.049> it's<00:03:23.230> on<00:03:23.410> your<00:03:23.650> hair

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
when you close it and it's on your hair

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.610 
when you close it and it's on your hair
and<00:03:24.190> all<00:03:24.580> for<00:03:24.790> also<00:03:25.239> not<00:03:25.450> on<00:03:25.480> your<00:03:25.780> hair<00:03:25.959> when

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
and all for also not on your hair when

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.130 
and all for also not on your hair when
you<00:03:26.709> close<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:26.980> it's<00:03:27.310> supposed<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.730> vibrate<00:03:28.140> so

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
you close it it's supposed to vibrate so

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.830 
you close it it's supposed to vibrate so
here<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:29.709> go<00:03:32.459> well<00:03:33.459> look<00:03:33.610> at<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.910> no<00:03:34.450> vibrate

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
here we go well look at that no vibrate

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.520 
here we go well look at that no vibrate
hmm

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
hmm

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.670 
hmm
so<00:03:36.420> open<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.540> back<00:03:37.660> up<00:03:37.720> just<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.470> make<00:03:38.650> sure

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
so open it back up just to make sure

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.770 
so open it back up just to make sure
that<00:03:39.010> everything's<00:03:39.400> right<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.390> push<00:03:40.630> it

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
that everything's right and I push it

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.750 
that everything's right and I push it
again<00:03:41.080> which<00:03:41.500> puts<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.160> non<00:03:42.310> vibrate

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
again which puts it in the non vibrate

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.550 
again which puts it in the non vibrate
mode<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.239> you'll<00:03:43.360> hear<00:03:43.540> there's<00:03:43.720> no<00:03:43.870> vibrate

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.780 

no<00:03:47.560> vibrate<00:03:48.600> when<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.690> close<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.980> should

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
no vibrate when you close it as should

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.900 
no vibrate when you close it as should
be<00:03:51.940> no<00:03:52.450> vibrate<00:03:53.610> go<00:03:54.610> back

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.120 

hear<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.780> vibrate<00:04:00.350> okay<00:04:00.890> goes<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.850> vibrate

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
hear that vibrate okay goes to vibrate

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.600 
hear that vibrate okay goes to vibrate
look<00:04:04.130> at<00:04:04.250> that

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
look at that

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
look at that
no<00:04:05.090> vibrate<00:04:05.680> okay<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.310> this<00:04:07.730> is<00:04:07.940> just<00:04:08.090> my<00:04:08.300> video

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
no vibrate okay so this is just my video
