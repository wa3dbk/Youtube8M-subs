powerful features of mr. normal at least

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
powerful features of mr. normal at least
for<00:01:07.170> generating<00:01:07.560> normal<00:01:08.369> maps<00:01:08.549> from<00:01:08.790> diffuse

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
for generating normal maps from diffuse

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880 
for generating normal maps from diffuse
images<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.200> change<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.680> balance

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
images is that we can change the balance

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.780 
images is that we can change the balance
of<00:01:11.220> fine<00:01:12.090> medium<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> large<00:01:13.830> structures

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of fine medium and large structures

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.810 
of fine medium and large structures
within<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> topography<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.430> map<00:01:17.610> for

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
within that topography so this map for

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
within that topography so this map for
example<00:01:18.330> has<00:01:18.630> leave<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> fine

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
example has leave just the fine

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.789 
example has leave just the fine
structures<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.850> fine<00:01:21.090> details<00:01:21.799> emphasized

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
structures the fine details emphasized

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
structures the fine details emphasized
but<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.549> could<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:23.790> choose<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> emphasize

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
but we could also choose to emphasize

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.469 
but we could also choose to emphasize
just<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> fine<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.369> very<00:01:26.520> large<00:01:26.759> scale

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
just the fine and the very large scale

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
just the fine and the very large scale
features<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.470> we'll<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> very<00:01:29.130> different

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
features and we'll get a very different

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.590

and set that to penetrate and that's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.140 
and set that to penetrate and that's
going<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> use<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.040> maximum<00:03:02.280> height<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the topography as you can see we've

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.120 
the topography as you can see we've
we've<00:03:08.100> made<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.610> really<00:03:09.090> interesting

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
we've made a really interesting

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.980 
we've made a really interesting
architectural<00:03:11.130> feature<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:12.390> for<00:03:12.510> example<00:03:12.870> we

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
architectural feature so for example we

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.310 
architectural feature so for example we
can<00:03:13.200> add<00:03:13.470> Perlin<00:03:14.130> noise<00:03:14.160> as<00:03:15.050> one<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.200> our

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
can add Perlin noise as one of our

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.310 
can add Perlin noise as one of our
functions<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.640> add<00:03:17.880> a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
functions and that will add a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.240 
functions and that will add a
randomization<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.620> surface<00:03:19.980> who<00:03:20.100> will

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
make it make it look very natural we can

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.690 
make it make it look very natural we can
even<00:03:24.060> set<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.510> cut-off<00:03:25.230> onto<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.100> noise<00:03:26.340> and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
even set a cut-off onto that noise and

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.320 
even set a cut-off onto that noise and
that<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.900> cutoff<00:03:28.410> will<00:03:29.010> generate<00:03:29.670> what

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
that that cutoff will generate what

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.910 
that that cutoff will generate what

say the spire brush set the brush size
and<00:04:17.640> intensity<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.720> then<00:04:19.260> use<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.680> spire

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
and intensity and then use the spire

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.210 
and intensity and then use the spire
brush<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.520> increase<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.210> topography<00:04:21.960> of

so<00:04:26.610> we're<00:04:26.780> customizing<00:04:27.780> our<00:04:28.020> on<00:04:28.319> normal<00:04:29.069> map

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
so we're customizing our on normal map

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.170 
so we're customizing our on normal map
interactively<00:04:30.539> by<00:04:30.569> eye<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:32.220> bring<00:04:32.789> out<00:04:33.000> an

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
interactively by eye to bring out an

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.740 
interactively by eye to bring out an
emphasize<00:04:34.020> certain<00:04:34.889> areas<00:04:35.639> that<00:04:36.389> we<00:04:36.539> feel

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
emphasize certain areas that we feel

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.600 
emphasize certain areas that we feel
would<00:04:37.050> be<00:04:37.400> would<00:04:38.400> be<00:04:38.550> beneficial<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:40.610> let's

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
would be would be beneficial so let's

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.640 
would be would be beneficial so let's
look<00:04:41.729> at<00:04:41.880> this<00:04:41.970> normal<00:04:42.360> map<00:04:42.539> in<00:04:42.780> preview<00:04:43.470> mode

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
look at this normal map in preview mode

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.999 
look at this normal map in preview mode
so<00:04:44.550> here<00:04:44.699> we<00:04:44.819> can<00:04:45.030> see<00:04:45.270> we've<00:04:45.650> raised<00:04:46.650> the

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
so here we can see we've raised the

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.309 
so here we can see we've raised the
topography<00:04:47.669> in<00:04:48.030> these<00:04:48.599> areas<00:04:48.960> actually<00:04:49.259> on

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
topography in these areas actually on

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.550 
topography in these areas actually on
the<00:04:49.440> bands<00:04:49.680> in<00:04:49.949> this<00:04:50.310> this<00:04:50.669> rock<00:04:50.940> texture<00:04:51.560> so

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
the bands in this this rock texture so

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.330 
the bands in this this rock texture so
there's<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.740> couple<00:04:52.919> of<00:04:53.009> other<00:04:53.130> interesting

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
there's a couple of other interesting

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.400 
there's a couple of other interesting
tools<00:04:54.000> in<00:04:54.330> in<00:04:54.630> drawing<00:04:54.990> mode

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
tools in in drawing mode

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.830 
tools in in drawing mode
there's<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.190> smooth<00:04:56.669> and<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.060> sharpen<00:04:57.539> brush

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
there's the smooth and the sharpen brush

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.830 
there's the smooth and the sharpen brush
so<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.830> smooth<00:04:59.070> brush<00:04:59.370> as<00:04:59.759> its<00:05:00.389> name<00:05:00.599> suggests

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
so the smooth brush as its name suggests

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.920 
so the smooth brush as its name suggests
will<00:05:01.410> lower<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.039> topography<00:05:02.759> in<00:05:03.120> those<00:05:03.539> areas

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
will lower the topography in those areas

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.950 
will lower the topography in those areas
in<00:05:04.139> which<00:05:04.169> we<00:05:04.320> paint<00:05:05.000> making<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.509> surface

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
in which we paint making the surface

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.439 
in which we paint making the surface
look<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.440> lot<00:05:07.590> more<00:05:07.770> smooth<00:05:08.180> whereas<00:05:09.180> the

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
look a lot more smooth whereas the

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.260 
look a lot more smooth whereas the
sharpen<00:05:10.050> brush<00:05:10.289> does<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.009> opposite<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:12.060> will

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
sharpen brush does the opposite it will

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.170 
sharpen brush does the opposite it will
increase<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.680> topography<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.490> features<00:05:14.970> in

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
increase the topography of features in

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.360 
increase the topography of features in
those<00:05:15.360> areas<00:05:15.720> that<00:05:15.900> we<00:05:16.020> paint<00:05:16.289> so<00:05:17.130> let's<00:05:17.310> have

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
those areas that we paint so let's have

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.060 
those areas that we paint so let's have
a<00:05:17.460> look<00:05:17.610> at<00:05:17.759> this<00:05:17.880> in<00:05:18.120> in<00:05:18.419> 3d<00:05:18.990> mode<00:05:19.199> and<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:20.039> can

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
a look at this in in 3d mode and you can

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.010 
a look at this in in 3d mode and you can
see<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.610> area<00:05:20.669> is<00:05:21.000> much<00:05:21.630> smoother<00:05:21.990> than

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
see that this area is much smoother than

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.080 
see that this area is much smoother than
it<00:05:22.199> was<00:05:22.409> before<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:23.310> down<00:05:23.550> here<00:05:23.759> on<00:05:23.909> this

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
it was before and down here on this

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.240 
it was before and down here on this
lower<00:05:24.300> band<00:05:24.630> we<00:05:25.139> can<00:05:25.319> see<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.560> topography<00:05:25.860> is

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
lower band we can see the topography is

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.210 
lower band we can see the topography is
much<00:05:26.520> higher<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:28.080> we<00:05:28.169> can<00:05:28.319> use<00:05:28.470> drawing<00:05:28.889> mode

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
much higher so we can use drawing mode

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.050 
much higher so we can use drawing mode
in<00:05:29.520> mr.<00:05:30.240> normal<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:31.229> really<00:05:32.190> modify<00:05:32.669> and

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
in mr. normal to really modify and

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.899 
in mr. normal to really modify and
tailor<00:05:33.570> on<00:05:33.750> all<00:05:34.020> maps<00:05:34.380> so<00:05:35.009> they're<00:05:35.280> exactly

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
tailor on all maps so they're exactly

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.300 
tailor on all maps so they're exactly
what<00:05:36.150> we<00:05:36.300> need<00:05:36.479> another<00:05:37.320> feature<00:05:37.620> offered<00:05:38.159> by

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
what we need another feature offered by

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.360 
what we need another feature offered by
mr.<00:05:38.639> noir<00:05:38.970> is<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.240> ability<00:05:39.419> to<00:05:39.659> fix

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
mr. noir is the ability to fix

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.070 
mr. noir is the ability to fix
pre-existing<00:05:41.370> normal<00:05:41.759> maps<00:05:41.940> so<00:05:42.659> we<00:05:42.750> can<00:05:42.900> make

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
pre-existing normal maps so we can make

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.959 
pre-existing normal maps so we can make
modifications<00:05:43.259> to<00:05:44.099> normal<00:05:44.639> maps<00:05:44.820> that

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
modifications to normal maps that

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.450 
modifications to normal maps that
already<00:05:45.300> exist<00:05:45.659> so<00:05:45.900> we<00:05:46.469> can<00:05:46.590> import<00:05:46.830> a<00:05:47.039> normal

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
already exist so we can import a normal

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.260 
already exist so we can import a normal
map<00:05:47.639> from<00:05:47.969> a<00:05:48.240> file<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:49.250> we<00:05:50.250> can<00:05:50.550> then<00:05:51.030> choose

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
map from a file and we can then choose

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.890 
map from a file and we can then choose
to<00:05:51.419> display<00:05:51.659> that<00:05:51.960> form<00:05:52.250> normal<00:05:53.250> map<00:05:53.430> by<00:05:54.150> not

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
to display that form normal map by not

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.600 
to display that form normal map by not
doing<00:05:55.050> anything<00:05:55.409> to<00:05:55.590> it<00:05:55.710> not<00:05:55.889> flipping<00:05:56.340> it<00:05:56.460> so

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
doing anything to it not flipping it so

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.899 
doing anything to it not flipping it so
this<00:05:57.599> is<00:05:57.719> the<00:05:57.900> input<00:05:58.110> normal<00:05:58.770> map<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.310> then<00:05:59.820> we

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
this is the input normal map and then we

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.350 
this is the input normal map and then we
can<00:06:00.090> choose<00:06:00.360> for<00:06:00.599> example<00:06:00.659> to<00:06:01.349> flip<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:02.360> y

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
can choose for example to flip the y

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.659 
can choose for example to flip the y
coordinate<00:06:03.990> system<00:06:04.320> so<00:06:05.039> this<00:06:05.159> is<00:06:05.280> changing

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
coordinate system so this is changing

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.689 
coordinate system so this is changing
the<00:06:05.729> format<00:06:06.270> of<00:06:06.539> the<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.590> normal<00:06:07.919> map<00:06:08.070> we

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
the format of the the normal map we

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.730 
the format of the the normal map we
could<00:06:08.880> choose<00:06:09.120> to<00:06:09.360> change<00:06:09.630> flip<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.320> z

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
could choose to change flip the z

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.589 
could choose to change flip the z
coordinate<00:06:11.280> and<00:06:11.490> what<00:06:11.909> this<00:06:12.030> will<00:06:12.210> do<00:06:12.389> is

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
coordinate and what this will do is

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.080 
coordinate and what this will do is
we'll<00:06:12.810> make<00:06:13.159> those<00:06:14.159> features<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:14.699> appear<00:06:14.820> to

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
we'll make those features that appear to

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.330 
we'll make those features that appear to
stick<00:06:15.360> out<00:06:15.570> in<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:16.110> normal<00:06:16.469> map<00:06:16.620> they'll<00:06:17.009> make

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
stick out in a normal map they'll make

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.629 
stick out in a normal map they'll make
those<00:06:17.610> features<00:06:17.940> appear<00:06:18.419> to<00:06:19.050> stick<00:06:19.500> into<00:06:19.770> the

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
those features appear to stick into the

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.939 
those features appear to stick into the
surface<00:06:21.060> so<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:21.930> can<00:06:22.110> see<00:06:22.289> on<00:06:22.380> this<00:06:22.530> surface

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
surface so you can see on this surface

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.610 
surface so you can see on this surface
for<00:06:23.130> example<00:06:23.159> all<00:06:23.610> those<00:06:23.789> ridges<00:06:24.270> are<00:06:24.509> now<00:06:25.259> on

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
for example all those ridges are now on

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.379 
for example all those ridges are now on
our<00:06:25.919> little<00:06:26.130> gullies<00:06:26.610> on<00:06:26.880> that<00:06:27.060> on<00:06:27.180> the

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
our little gullies on that on the

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.180 
our little gullies on that on the
surface<00:06:27.630> at<00:06:27.930> the<00:06:28.020> normal<00:06:28.289> map<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:28.770> let's<00:06:29.009> just

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
surface at the normal map and let's just

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.399 
surface at the normal map and let's just
reverse<00:06:29.550> that<00:06:29.580> so<00:06:30.120> you<00:06:30.180> can<00:06:30.449> see<00:06:30.479> that<00:06:31.229> now

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
reverse that so you can see that now

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.980 
reverse that so you can see that now
these<00:06:31.680> these<00:06:32.570> features<00:06:33.570> are<00:06:33.750> actually

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
these these features are actually

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.680 
these these features are actually
sticking<00:06:34.260> out<00:06:34.500> of<00:06:34.710> that<00:06:34.740> topography<00:06:35.539> and<00:06:36.539> we

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
sticking out of that topography and we

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.320 
sticking out of that topography and we
could<00:06:36.810> also<00:06:36.930> change<00:06:37.740> the<00:06:38.130> weight<00:06:38.550> of

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
could also change the weight of

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.540 
could also change the weight of
the<00:06:39.449> normal<00:06:40.199> map<00:06:40.379> so<00:06:41.039> that<00:06:41.069> this<00:06:41.400> will

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
the normal map so that this will

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.670 
the normal map so that this will
increase<00:06:41.879> the<00:06:42.000> intensity<00:06:42.840> of<00:06:42.990> features<00:06:43.440> on

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
increase the intensity of features on

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.469 
increase the intensity of features on
the<00:06:44.190> surface<00:06:45.020> or<00:06:46.020> we<00:06:46.470> could<00:06:46.650> decrease<00:06:47.039> the

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
the surface or we could decrease the

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.570 
the surface or we could decrease the
intensity<00:06:48.479> of<00:06:48.629> those<00:06:48.800> features<00:06:49.800> so<00:06:50.250> let's<00:06:50.400> go

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
intensity of those features so let's go

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.240 
intensity of those features so let's go
to<00:06:50.639> the<00:06:50.879> the<00:06:51.300> normal<00:06:51.870> map<00:06:52.050> view<00:06:52.259> decrease

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
to the the normal map view decrease

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.339 
to the the normal map view decrease
those<00:06:53.460> features<00:06:53.879> by<00:06:54.060> 1/2<00:06:54.300> and<00:06:54.569> you'll<00:06:55.050> see<00:06:55.199> the

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349 
those features by 1/2 and you'll see the

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.800 
those features by 1/2 and you'll see the
contrast<00:06:55.800> of<00:06:55.979> the<00:06:56.069> normal<00:06:56.400> map<00:06:56.580> decreases<00:06:57.270> the

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
contrast of the normal map decreases the

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.050 
contrast of the normal map decreases the
final<00:06:58.169> useful<00:06:58.650> feature<00:06:58.979> in<00:06:59.310> mr.<00:06:59.669> Knoll<00:06:59.819> is

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
final useful feature in mr. Knoll is

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.510 
final useful feature in mr. Knoll is
that<00:07:00.479> we<00:07:00.629> can<00:07:00.840> choose<00:07:01.020> to<00:07:01.080> produce<00:07:01.620> normal

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
that we can choose to produce normal

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.300 
that we can choose to produce normal
maps<00:07:02.789> by<00:07:03.539> batch<00:07:03.870> processing<00:07:04.530> so<00:07:05.069> we<00:07:05.159> can

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
maps by batch processing so we can

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.219 
maps by batch processing so we can
select<00:07:05.610> a<00:07:05.729> whole<00:07:05.879> list<00:07:06.270> of<00:07:06.509> diffuse<00:07:06.960> files

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
select a whole list of diffuse files

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.830 
select a whole list of diffuse files
then<00:07:08.069> select<00:07:08.580> the<00:07:08.699> preset<00:07:08.909> that<00:07:09.300> describes

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
then select the preset that describes

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.020 
then select the preset that describes
what<00:07:10.470> the<00:07:10.800> properties<00:07:11.250> of<00:07:11.280> the<00:07:11.580> normal<00:07:11.879> map

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
what the properties of the normal map

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.629 
what the properties of the normal map
that<00:07:12.180> we<00:07:12.300> want<00:07:12.509> and<00:07:12.770> generate<00:07:13.770> those<00:07:14.069> one

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 
that we want and generate those one

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.879 
that we want and generate those one
