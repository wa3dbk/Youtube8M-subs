these solutions on a single GPU let's

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:24.899 
these solutions on a single GPU let's

a pair of a cz vertex drives and
software<00:01:27.580> rate<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.990> going<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.229> set<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.470> that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.809 

let's<00:01:41.500> test<00:01:41.619> our<00:01:41.740> Peaks<00:01:42.009> are<00:01:42.100> 183<00:01:42.580> on<00:01:42.759> the

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
let's test our Peaks are 183 on the

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.749 
let's test our Peaks are 183 on the
right<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:43.330> then<00:01:43.509> about<00:01:43.659> 325<00:01:44.560> for<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.950> read<00:01:45.130> so

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
right and then about 325 for the read so

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.460 
right and then about 325 for the read so
in<00:01:45.880> there's<00:01:46.030> no<00:01:46.119> in<00:01:46.179> this<00:01:46.299> new<00:01:46.420> solution<00:01:46.750> we're

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
in there's no in this new solution we're

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.749 
in there's no in this new solution we're
going<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.649> go<00:01:47.830> into<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.310> integral<00:01:48.549> for

going to go into the integral for
riffles<00:01:49.119> menu<00:01:49.569> and<00:01:50.819> you'll<00:01:51.819> see<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.179> we'll

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
riffles menu and you'll see that we'll

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.969 
riffles menu and you'll see that we'll
have<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.539> change<00:01:52.720> this<00:01:53.020> from<00:01:53.259> automatic<00:01:53.649> set

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
have to change this from automatic set

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.949 
have to change this from automatic set
it<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.190> be<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:54.700> just<00:01:54.729> be<00:01:55.030> or<00:01:55.539> whatever<00:01:55.750> device

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
it to be we just be or whatever device

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.340 
it to be we just be or whatever device
you<00:01:56.229> want<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.500> pair<00:01:56.740> enabled<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.170> case

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
you want to pair enabled in this case

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.359 
you want to pair enabled in this case
we're<00:01:59.560> testing<00:01:59.799> your<00:01:59.890> set<00:02:00.039> at<00:02:00.159> three

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
we're testing your set at three

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.350 
we're testing your set at three
connections<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.179> looks<00:02:01.869> like<00:02:01.959> santa<00:02:02.319> three

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
connections so looks like santa three

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.889

now<00:02:04.360> we're<00:02:04.479> going<00:02:04.569> to<00:02:04.630> test<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.500> same<00:02:05.709> thing

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
now we're going to test the same thing

a 200 so to conclude this test what
we've<00:03:01.359> seen<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.719> that<00:03:01.749> even<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.379> these

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
we've seen is that even with these

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.379 
we've seen is that even with these
