00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.149 
feet so how many stops it's the stations
that<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.430> 21<00:01:48.240> stations<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> distance

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that we have 21 stations so the distance

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.300 
that we have 21 stations so the distance
is<00:01:50.670> about<00:01:50.820> three-quarters<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.960> mile<00:01:52.310> we

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
is about three-quarters of a mile we

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.179 
is about three-quarters of a mile we
actually<00:01:53.729> had<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> lot<00:01:54.450> less<00:01:54.750> stations<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:56.040> we

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
actually had a lot less stations when we

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.289 
actually had a lot less stations when we
started<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> process<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.990> we

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
started the process but when we

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.080 
started the process but when we
completed<00:02:00.299> our<00:02:00.540> analysis<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.090> ridership

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
completed our analysis of the ridership

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.120 
completed our analysis of the ridership
and<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> travel<00:02:04.079> demand<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.680> found<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and the travel demand we found that

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.760 
and the travel demand we found that
there<00:02:06.060> were<00:02:06.210> very<00:02:06.509> few<00:02:06.600> people<00:02:07.229> who<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.590> be

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
there were very few people who would be

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.850 
there were very few people who would be
actually<00:02:08.629> traveling<00:02:09.629> from<00:02:09.929> Bethesda<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.679> new

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
actually traveling from Bethesda to new

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.680 
actually traveling from Bethesda to new
carrollton<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.760> found<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> much

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
carrollton what we found is a much

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.220 
carrollton what we found is a much
greater

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
greater

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.190 
greater
for<00:02:14.069> short<00:02:14.370> trips<00:02:14.610> people<00:02:15.390> going<00:02:15.840> from<00:02:16.019> their

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
for short trips people going from their

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.490 
for short trips people going from their
neighborhood<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> metro<00:02:17.849> station<00:02:18.379> from<00:02:19.379> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
neighborhood to a metro station from a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.009 
neighborhood to a metro station from a
metro<00:02:19.860> station<00:02:20.159> act<00:02:20.640> about<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.659> one<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
metro station act about to one of the

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.680 
metro station act about to one of the
activity<00:02:22.590> centers<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.150> that's<00:02:24.360> how<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:24.569> ended

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
activity centers so that's how we ended

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.070 
activity centers so that's how we ended
up<00:02:25.049> with<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.349> 21<00:02:25.680> stations<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:27.030> other<00:02:27.239> thing

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
up with the 21 stations the other thing

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.920 
up with the 21 stations the other thing
is<00:02:28.110> since<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.430> light<00:02:29.910> rail<00:02:30.239> we<00:02:30.540> were<00:02:30.690> able

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
is since it is light rail we were able

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.100 
is since it is light rail we were able
to<00:02:31.140> fit<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.610> light<00:02:32.819> rail<00:02:33.030> system<00:02:33.569> into

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
to fit the light rail system into

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.199 
to fit the light rail system into
communities<00:02:34.769> right<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.280> neighborhoods<00:02:35.849> so

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
communities right in neighborhoods so

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.119 
communities right in neighborhoods so
it's<00:02:36.330> not<00:02:36.480> disruptive<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.230> any<00:02:37.349> way<00:02:37.560> no<00:02:37.890> and

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
it's not disruptive in any way no and

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.520 
it's not disruptive in any way no and
the<00:02:38.489> stations<00:02:39.000> are<00:02:39.180> much<00:02:39.660> smaller<00:02:39.959> than<00:02:40.200> like

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
the stations are much smaller than like

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.699 
the stations are much smaller than like
a<00:02:40.560> metro<00:02:41.340> station<00:02:41.610> right<00:02:42.299> bigger<00:02:43.230> that's

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
a metro station right bigger that's

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.770 
a metro station right bigger that's
right<00:02:43.980> well<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.489> guess<00:02:44.879> my<00:02:45.060> final<00:02:45.450> question<00:02:45.540> is

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
right well I guess my final question is

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.940 
right well I guess my final question is
