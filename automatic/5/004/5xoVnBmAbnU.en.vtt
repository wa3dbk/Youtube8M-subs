engineering and power can offer you I
wish<00:05:53.029> you're<00:05:53.180> all<00:05:53.300> here<00:05:53.479> to<00:05:53.629> feel<00:05:53.779> the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
wish you're all here to feel the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.050 
wish you're all here to feel the
difference<00:05:54.080> I<00:05:54.560> can't<00:05:55.189> believe<00:05:55.460> how<00:05:55.669> much<00:05:55.819> of<00:05:55.969> a

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
difference I can't believe how much of a

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.670 
difference I can't believe how much of a
difference<00:05:56.360> there<00:05:56.539> is<00:05:56.689> it's<00:05:57.139> not<00:05:57.229> just

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
difference there is it's not just

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.860 
difference there is it's not just
pushing<00:05:57.919> a<00:05:58.159> button<00:05:58.189> it<00:05:58.939> really<00:05:59.000> isn't

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
pushing a button it really isn't

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.140 
pushing a button it really isn't
I've<00:06:00.319> seen<00:06:00.680> buttons<00:06:01.099> that<00:06:01.339> say<00:06:01.550> Sport<00:06:01.969> and

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
I've seen buttons that say Sport and

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.029 
I've seen buttons that say Sport and
comfort<00:06:02.599> and<00:06:02.779> I<00:06:02.990> mean<00:06:03.169> they<00:06:03.469> make<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.770> engine

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
comfort and I mean they make the engine

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.189 
comfort and I mean they make the engine
sound<00:06:04.310> different<00:06:04.759> they<00:06:05.060> make<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:05.389> car<00:06:05.659> you

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
sound different they make the car you

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.350 
sound different they make the car you
know<00:06:06.319> drive<00:06:07.159> differently<00:06:07.699> they<00:06:07.849> hold<00:06:08.060> years

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
know drive differently they hold years

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.570 
know drive differently they hold years
longer<00:06:08.659> but<00:06:09.050> I<00:06:09.080> mean<00:06:09.409> this<00:06:09.620> is<00:06:09.830> well<00:06:10.159> beyond

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
longer but I mean this is well beyond

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.290 
longer but I mean this is well beyond
that<00:06:10.759> with<00:06:11.479> with<00:06:11.870> you<00:06:12.409> know<00:06:12.529> adaptive<00:06:13.370> dynamic

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
that with with you know adaptive dynamic

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.779 
that with with you know adaptive dynamic
