00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.290
 fort carson is a village located in bone 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.360
 conti san andreas is a mixture of 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.789
 city ​​town since it has a large 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.430
 avenue a medical center and a drive-in 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.560
 for this town round a great mystery 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.110
 it is said that at midnight you can hear 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.530
 cavalry steps this mystery 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.690
 it even has a little story in 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.700
 1842 a cavalry rode near 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.100
 fort carson going to the call of 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.440
 help from some locals the cavalry 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.260
 that he conquered the west he fought against 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.270
 Indians where many good died in 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.570
 this town is said to be heard noises 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.600
 strangers and I will investigate this 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 curious mystery 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.440
 at first I did not believe much in that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.899
 mystery but there is a test that makes 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.879
 that it might be possible if we get to this 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.489
 Quimey club at 00 hours 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.890
 the restaurant closes this is curious 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.550
 because no other restaurant in San 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.219
 andreas 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.339
 never closes while this one does and 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.950
 then at 6 am it reopens 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.990
 let's wait for 00 to be done 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.359
 hours to see that the triangle 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.119
 yellow disappears not allowing us 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.280
 enter the plugin b meantime they 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.200
 I will give some details of this place 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.200
 example here the poster of fort carson 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.790
 I will move away so that it is possible to see well the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.790
 poster 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.140
 I will show you a lot of the poster 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.480
 plus the yellow triangle to see 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.970
 that is still there I warn everyone that 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.030
 The gta I'm using does not have a box 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.950
 one alone nor animations nor sky anything of 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.790
 nothing so in case we find 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.220
 the mystery will be 100% real clarified all 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.970
 let's continue to surround the place while 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.970
 we go time 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.510
 I was already forgetting here in the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.600
 population number of fort carson 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.580
 we will see again the number 69 on 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.210
 number that rockstar always places us 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.369
 in the game like area 69 the dock 69 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.530
 de sant fierro among other things more 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.260
 a rockstar child to the sexual position 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.790
 69 I will not tell you more about these issues 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.790
 because this is a family schedule 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.160
 there's the rockstar number yes 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.530
 that are a few loquitos keep burning 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.020
 time apologize for having anticipated 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.180
 both at 00 hours but I needed 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.460
 do it to give them these details and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.470
 I wanted to do it without cuts because I want to 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.610
 that they see that everything is real and that I do not 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.560
 montages or nothing 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.960
 this is for greater credibility in the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.820
 video said this we go to the part of 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.130
 back of club kimberley we will see about 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.800
 poorly placed bushes 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.560
 here are the bushes badly placed 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.870
 they are floating rather these are in 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.000
 a bad positioning maybe due to laziness 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.360
 or I do not know but they 're in the air like 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.360
 can observe 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.790
 shit but what happens here ha ha ha ha 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.340
 this guy must be drunk to drive 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.299
 hand over the keys to driving madman 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.299
 what cj says 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.010
 is already arriving 00 hours I would like 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.780
 put quick camera to not make them 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.180
 wait but as I explained 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.580
 I needed the time to give them all the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.680
 information previously told good 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.990
 enough of asking so many excuses 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.090
 I hope we can hear those sounds 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.959
 first we must wait for that club 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.959
 kimberley close 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.620
 We look forward to the longed for moment when the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.250
 restaurant will close so they are very 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.800
 attentive so that they are witnesses ready the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.870
 club see now closed look you can not 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.390
 enter the place there is no way to do it 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.760
 this is a mystery no local in san 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.650
 Andreas closes but this one does the 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.960
 possible explanation of this is that the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.180
 employees of this restaurant listened 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.070
 the sounds of that war at 00 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.740
 hours scared by that event 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.780
 paranormal closed after that 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.670
 they heard again the noises and 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.340
 They decided that the place would be closed 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.410
 every day at 00 hours 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.620
 that is the possible explanation of this 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.690
 case 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.359
 I made this cut to investigate more 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.850
 early they are a little over 00 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.650
 this is another day and we are going to walk 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.600
 for the place where it is said 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.270
 listen to these cavalry sounds 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.070
 remember that at 00 hours the club 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.320
 Kimberley has already closed so now 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.389
 we will need concentration listening 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.280
 all sounds with the editor of 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.350
 videos that I use I will increase the volume 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.990
 to the audio track of the recording of 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.120
 my gta so we can listen more and 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.210
 you do not need to raise him so much 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.190
 volume your hearing aids or speakers are not 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.380
 worry I will not throw any 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.380
 screamer now I will stop talking 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.230
 shit that was 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.770
 there's nothing but where did that come from 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.790
 good explosion does not matter let's continue on the 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.790
 search for those sounds 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.790
 ah 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.770
 so far there is no strange noise 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.750
 not even something paranormal out there 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.750
 let's hope our luck changes 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.900
 that hurt me poor person but 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:01.030
 this is not our issue is already 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.030
 dawning and nothing of our mystery 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.500
 good after spending all night 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.750
 walking through those lonely places of 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.060
 fort carson where it is supposed to be 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.160
 they heard sounds of ancient cavalry 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.440
 sounds of an old war that 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.650
 fought in this place over 200 years ago 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.060
 but we do not hear anything unfortunately 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.220
 according to my research if it 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.919
 I was listening to something but we found that 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.560
 if they want me to continue researching more 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:47.810
 mysteries of the gta san andreas tell me 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.550
 in the comments there are many things that 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.160
 I discovered and I think they are not in 

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:55.160
 internet yet I dismiss the name of 

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.320
 gta productions films 1 I am cj and 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.889
 I hope you liked the video until 

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.889
 the next
