00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.150
 Then welcome to another video. 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.100
 destination channel this time is like you 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.710
 You can see I'm playing with that snip. 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.119
 Primary is no land beyond 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.970
 As you know, I had released a 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.140
 series for you is for you to choose 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.930
 a weapon that I may be playing 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.940
 here a crucible had an inscription that 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.010
 said that it was for me to play with these 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.220
 no lenton land and playing with 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.110
 she got a match until she was good with 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.290
 she did not turn me negative 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.400
 I got 15 that with her there in that 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.559
 match 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.720
 only that this match is not 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.900
 complete because I had to give some 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.470
 because sometimes I 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.809
 it was stopped but it's not because of taka 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.269
 operating but rather because it is 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.640
 Cell phone phone these things all there. 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.720
 For you who is a gamer, you know what I am. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.700
 Speaking 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.580
 and well this mp will only stay in the background 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.409
 I want to talk to you about 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.720
 a very interesting subject here 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.180
 I kept thinking here I even talked 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.570
 here with some of my colleagues who no longer 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.729
 let me want to talk to you 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.729
 it is 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.210
 Have you ever thought about it 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.240
 I was thinking about some things like that. 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.549
 It's more on that raid type screen goes the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.729
 end of quota that had multiplayer 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.329
 in that fd crust would be interesting 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.299
 type like this would be normal phase, right? 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.020
 europe would be there in the background there together 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.579
 with that a supreme there is like olhÃ£o 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.609
 it's like 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.109
 the player can do 15 that goes 15 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.619
 that here in the northeast is very difficult 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:05.210
 You do more than that but it goes 15 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.579
 that the listener goes there appears on the screen 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.280
 one supreme there for you to push a button 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.800
 then you tighten and that effect of that 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.420
 a supreme affects everyone like kills 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.210
 everybody like it's a look 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.620
 I was thinking about that, then I 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.870
 I found it very interesting and I wanted to know 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.400
 of you if you think so 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.730
 interesting 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.810
 and put it in the comments if this 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.040
 would give right here in destiny beauty and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.450
 in this video here 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.129
 I wanted to give a very good tip to 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.180
 You 're the one who plays the flag. 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.810
 iron 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.659
 This is the brand that is very worth it. 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.349
 too bad for those who like it already 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.239
 I played with her and I liked it a lot 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.180
 that she holds the hawk for who has 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.799
 plays the lord falcon on the iron flag 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.940
 I have two companies here that I 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:06.109
 already captured until it no longer back the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.959
 game to make the game already near 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.480
 share already the Japanese aggravated if I 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.430
 need it already has 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.319
 I could do two very good matches there 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.829
 good color hawk and my friends this 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.260
 gun this dog to thorn is also good but 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.230
 hawk awaits for this flag of 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.879
 Iron, it's very good, I'm trying to father. 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.319
 the flag of israel to see if I can 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.370
 pick up that exclusive automatic that 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.099
 has it 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.629
 I'm trying to get him there because my 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.879
 friends said that the rifle is very 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:45.319
 Good, and I need a rifle. 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:49.970
 the primary automatic primary 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:53.510
 that I have is that sometimes I want 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.900
 to use the ice break is like second weapon 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.840
 I can not because I do not have it. 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.449
 an automatic rifle is primary 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.340
 so I'm throwing the flag of 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:08.930
 iron as friends there in the next mp 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.879
 You'll see their names, now I 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.639
 I do not remember cork, it's a very name. 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.970
 who played in there we played more 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.190
 10 to 15 more or less matches 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.769
 I think it was that, and the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.599
 people lost think only once that alone 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.880
 was once because two ways of 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:32.360
 Our team left twice 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.240
 It was only one I know that from all 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.610
 He rolled up the guys there so ok 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.550
 given that hint there and on a gun 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.500
 I also wanted to talk to you about death. 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.969
 scarlet the death carlat is one of the 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.280
 best gaming weapons 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.819
 before she was crap but she is better 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.699
 because when you release that 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.139
 skull that she has every 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.479
 What do you do 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.280
 it increases your energy increases your 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.349
 blood is your life 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.300
 so it's a great weapon to have the 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.659
 Scarlet death her father that she is a 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.539
 she's a top gun she's very good 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:11.939
 It sure was not good, I guess that's it. 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.000
 I just wanted to pass on to you, which is a 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.800
 hemiplegia there RapidÃ£o then whom 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.659

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.639
 favorite for disclosure who is not 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:24.629
