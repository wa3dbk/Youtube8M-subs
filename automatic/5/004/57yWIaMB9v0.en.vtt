 Well, of the cherry blossom award 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:20.610
 Videos Well I'm talking about a video like a target horse from reaction training as an upload 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:24.890
 Do you say that the result is also a reasonable result? 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.850
 I expected that on my blog after that though 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.800
 Well people of that favorite is 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:36.630
 Tomo Even if you think you were talking about in Unfortunately favorite is Well That house of the index and the video I was 4 pieces 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 Or it was the 12 of the index of the out-mer I bought a pretty junior waiting been as it is born 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.300
 Seed 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.719
 Wow 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.719
 that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.640
 The Tteyuu horse that was heroism was extraordinarily Te Aya' is just that 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:58.570
 It will be criticized if you lose anything, but it is the first martial arts limited game 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.000
 It is a watch of the pattern that there is no horse which has won the past also in the aspect of Torture 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.950
 After that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.790
 Well I had not been in a large number of people, and I had one more factor in spite of various anxiety materials 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.300
 When it was 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.940
 If it loses, this is an interesting part of my stepmother 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.570
 I was looking at that, I thought again 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.570
 Maa's 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.510
 If the popular horse loses, hey 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.010
 Some people write bad things to this horse, but some also change it to the net. 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.480
 Well, that's why 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.550
 Also the Well base of if you can stop the horse 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.730
 Because I was Takahashi who was making a living 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.540
 I think that it is best to respect and support 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:42.770
 Well , it's a matter of course, but I thought it was a second prize for the next month. 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:49.219
 To say that the current meeting April 15, during the day of the week consumer now 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:53.960
 In respect Satsuki Award What orally at a little difficult because my best in the situation pupil is 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:02:00.100
 It is First in Dechotto money have thought that I want to hit from the other place 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.100
 If you know , most are the first run ahead 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:12.930
 Well there is a lot of consecutive wins as it is, so that is the feature of the Satsuki Prize 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.550
 There is such a meaning, but there are many things that do not end breaking the boundary of what is called disappointment 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.500
 I am 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.500
 I think that is the tone again 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.290
 It is playing 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.350
 Um there is a numerical value of horse racing book rating two books in that that book that I've used 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.480
 Of betting surgery become a that right that I am allowed to write 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.250
 It is an index that is also the basis of that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.670
 I have put out 59.91 at the stage up to the previous race 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:45.360
 If you have a rating, call it a rating and have a routing 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:50.040
 It is to be Well basically it is horses are out you are buying ahead home but 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:54.870
 It is when the condition is take a look at it but I Tsukun called in yet before run 1 to wear 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.700
 Oh, a little bit that this Satsuki moon prize strange thing is happening, and it is 1 degree 2 mag every time 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.700

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:15.450
 Sato Crown 59.8 1st place is not in Thailand, but it is 0.1 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:20.489

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:25.620
 It will be swimming situation This is a little interesting, isn't it? 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.970
 Numerical The of another village Guraunkita San black Well from the past trend just 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.970
 Than just a little less 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.600
 There 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.659
 It's coming, but there 's no way to say with that figure, but the trend is that they are out of place 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.950
 And the first run Bakka 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:46.810
 Good horse rating has in Well 59.9 more minute 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:50.140

 By the way, it's very high especially per Danone Platinum. 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.580
 It is supposed to be 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.770

 That are buying the Der place called 12 such as a little much or before run-up up of 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.770
 Many 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:05:02.370

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.520
 But 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:35.740
 With the momentum of the past two years 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.550

 That's right. The crown of the first-class star-ri from Kanto Kanto 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.350

 Well, even if you look only in the last 56 years, there is really no horse higher than this horse. 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:12.880
 The logotype was also 62 languages
