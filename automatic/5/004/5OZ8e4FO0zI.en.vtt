00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.909
 well well 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.250
 these kids that how is it good 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 basically teach how to put letters of 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.260
 colors with different defects in the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.600
 chat voucher teaches us here quickly to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.180
 see how many types were 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 play minecraft I do not know yet very well 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.230
 I do not remember the controls very well 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.660
 Okay I put this and put ham cooked 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.540
 Well, because if it's worth I'll explain the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.390
 command if you can put several colors 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.370
 it's a little messy, it's not so easy and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.469
 I recommend this command that each 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.589
 Once you want it or have it targeted 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.859
 in a notebook as it is or not 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.539
 you have copy in another world or in a notebook 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.749
 of notes or whatever because this is 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.600
 rather difficult is worth of the raw clothe 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:55.440
 p is worth the closest one and we put here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.089
 we opened quotes this project exploded 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.069
 this project as I say very complicated 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.440
 that this series to put a text and 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.950
 extra to put already modifications worth 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.750
 since it would be here text 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.390
 ok we put this we put here between 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.510
 these two quotes we put ham 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.510
 Cooked 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.440
 Kitty is worth and here we can see 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.930
 and I would change from cooked ham to kitten 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.940
 Several shits here puts color voucher 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.010
 I'm going to go here and I'm going to do that color 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.250
 put network here we can change it to blue 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:41.100
 blue green green but never put this 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.100
 well because it may not work 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.580
 it does not come out only in white I'll go 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.560
 to bring here again I do not know 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.240
 where was he here 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.520
 you always have to put in 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.430
 tiny for it to work now bolt 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.780
 it would be like bold underlined but not 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.240
 is going to be bold in this case is going to 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.830
 be in red if you remove falsetto here I put 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.420
 true 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.340
 I would put it like that, kitten, it's worth seeing 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.110
 difference there is between this and this 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.580
 so it's ok and if we remove to see I'm going to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.110
 take a while because the command is very 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.960
 rare 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.510
 vol 3 what we also put fake 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.650
 again now and such and that would be I do not know 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.450
 how to explain it but what it teaches 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.600
 equally true 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.730
 reactivate and see how rooms come out and not 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.000
 he 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.930
 well do not delay me I like so 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.840
 less 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.060
 I'll look again for the 'latics' to the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.840
 maybe to see fake 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.030
 a berlin would be underlines worth this 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.940
 we remove false we put true 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.700
 and we underline it I do not know if it can be done 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.120
 the sub radiation of another color but 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.819
 it would be much more complicated but 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.100
 moment we do it worth and if it is more 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.000
 about this command I say it I think it 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.000
 I forgot to remove him 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.500
 paranoia 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.500
 false 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.350
 strikeout I think it's thrown out 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.700
 do not listen to me but I think it's 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.610
 seen to see 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.490
 if the kitten with a stripe in the middle and 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:31.780
 then obfuscating you tried to remove this 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.780
 fall is looking for you we put it true 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.930
 this is how it is to follow the letters 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.720
 that movement is pretty cool and 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.660
 we can do one thing if we put if 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.300
 we stop looking for assets and we put 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.430
 here in text 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:55.880
 here we put a few and 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.500
 something will come out that so 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.380
 and it's pretty cool and you can play 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.060
 a lot with this and good then 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.420
 basically anything goes, I'm going to teach you 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.540
 so you can see that the colors are not all 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.070
 you look for example is the color goal worth 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.459
 that color there is no goal would be is worth 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.310
 it would be that in yellow that but what 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.100
 difference between gol and yellow is worth 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.460
 it would be ice because there is this difference what 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.460
 teach 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.010
 I think it's written like that there's that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.190
 difference 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:37.150
 one is more clear and this one a tad more 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.460
 dark and it's also dark blue green 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.310
 good to see basically the colors 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.750
 can be bar is with boro is with the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.480
 barrabrava teams 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.250
 If you have a creative end, you give 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.820
 option is worth having to create a tilde of 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.920
 that blue option for example color and here 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.170
 appear three colors vouchers black der 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.040
 vlugt of the green to keep king of 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.750
 soccer gray dar gray blue green water hay 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.510
 for example water this one that I like 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:12.990
 a lot we came here and we were with 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:16.230
 james young we put water to see if 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.390
 it works if you get a blue and it 's more 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.610
 clear instead of if we put blue that 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.950
 it would leave one plus one a little bit more cool 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.830
 and well this basically all of this 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.250
 tutorial I hope you liked it and 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.650
 of the best tutorials and if you like and 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.770
 that could start a series of a 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.860
 server more or less pvp is worth as much as 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.160
 to be a brunette I thought or something like that and 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.650
 well I went up series so it goes like this 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.050
