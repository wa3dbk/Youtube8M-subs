00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
fingers on the case I don't know if I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.849 
fingers on the case I don't know if I
can<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.260> can<00:04:16.290> see<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.709> up<00:04:16.799> through<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.580> camera

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
can you can see it up through the camera

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.170 
can you can see it up through the camera
but<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:20.039> have<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.310> constantly<00:04:20.580> be<00:04:20.789> clear<00:04:21.090> on

but you have to constantly be clear on

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.810 
but you have to constantly be clear on
it<00:04:21.380> okay<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:22.440> with<00:04:22.770> drop<00:04:22.979> protection<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.610> would

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
it okay so with drop protection I would

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.320 
it okay so with drop protection I would
definitely<00:04:24.060> trust<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:25.020> case

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
definitely trust this case

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.379 
definitely trust this case
to<00:04:25.659> protect<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.139> back<00:04:26.409> of<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.800> ipad<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:28.270> know

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
to protect the back of the ipad you know

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.510 
to protect the back of the ipad you know
it's<00:04:28.509> doable<00:04:28.840> material<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.800> polycarbonate

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's doable material the polycarbonate

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.600 
it's doable material the polycarbonate
its<00:04:31.000> scratch<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.229> it<00:04:32.770> doesn't<00:04:33.129> scratch<00:04:33.340> easily

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
its scratch it it doesn't scratch easily

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.830 
its scratch it it doesn't scratch easily
so<00:04:34.240> that's<00:04:34.990> good<00:04:35.319> but<00:04:35.939> you<00:04:36.939> know<00:04:37.060> if<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.419> ipad

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
so that's good but you know if the ipad

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.040 
so that's good but you know if the ipad
was<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.139> fall<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:39.460> know<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.849> face<00:04:40.240> face<00:04:40.900> of

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
was to fall you know the face face of

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.730 
was to fall you know the face face of
the<00:04:41.139> ipad<00:04:41.550> definitely<00:04:42.550> not<00:04:43.449> good<00:04:43.689> but<00:04:44.169> if<00:04:44.560> it

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
the ipad definitely not good but if it

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.959 
the ipad definitely not good but if it
was<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:44.979> fall<00:04:45.159> on<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.400> back<00:04:45.550> i<00:04:45.580> would

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
was to fall on the back i would
