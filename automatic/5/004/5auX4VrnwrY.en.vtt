course the advantage of that is you

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.579 
course the advantage of that is you
don't<00:00:40.059> ever<00:00:40.239> run<00:00:40.480> out<00:00:40.539> of<00:00:40.719> gas<00:00:41.050> while<00:00:41.409> you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
don't ever run out of gas while you

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.619 
don't ever run out of gas while you
cooking<00:00:42.039> you<00:00:42.190> always<00:00:42.640> half<00:00:42.909> gasps<00:00:43.179> you<00:00:43.480> don't

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
cooking you always half gasps you don't

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.540 
cooking you always half gasps you don't
have<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:43.899> worry<00:00:44.050> about<00:00:44.170> having<00:00:44.949> your<00:00:45.219> tank

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
have to worry about having your tank

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.419 
have to worry about having your tank
refilled<00:00:46.149> or<00:00:46.390> exchanging<00:00:47.050> tanks<00:00:47.559> most<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.309> us

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
refilled or exchanging tanks most of us

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.970 
refilled or exchanging tanks most of us
don't<00:00:48.670> have<00:00:48.819> natural<00:00:49.239> gas<00:00:49.749> so<00:00:50.350> we<00:00:50.530> just<00:00:50.739> use

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
don't have natural gas so we just use

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.419 
don't have natural gas so we just use
propane<00:00:51.640> when<00:00:52.449> you<00:00:52.690> buy<00:00:52.929> a<00:00:52.960> new<00:00:53.199> grill<00:00:53.800> most<00:00:54.249> of

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
propane when you buy a new grill most of

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.979 
propane when you buy a new grill most of
the<00:00:54.519> time<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.999> doesn't<00:00:55.030> come<00:00:55.479> with<00:00:55.659> a<00:00:55.690> propane

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
the time it doesn't come with a propane

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.639 
the time it doesn't come with a propane
tank<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.789> I<00:00:58.149> would<00:00:58.420> recommend<00:00:58.449> that<00:00:59.260> when<00:00:59.440> you

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
tank so I would recommend that when you

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.389 
tank so I would recommend that when you
buy<00:00:59.859> your<00:01:00.069> propane<00:01:00.639> tank<00:01:01.030> by<00:01:01.329> 2<00:01:01.389> and<00:01:02.069> that<00:01:03.069> way

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
buy your propane tank by 2 and that way

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.910 
buy your propane tank by 2 and that way
when<00:01:04.030> you're<00:01:04.479> cooking<00:01:04.780> if<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.440> run<00:01:05.680> out<00:01:05.860> of

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
when you're cooking if you run out of

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.130 
when you're cooking if you run out of
gas<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:07.030> another<00:01:07.360> tank<00:01:07.750> right<00:01:08.110> there

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
gas you have another tank right there

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.499 
gas you have another tank right there
that<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:09.070> can<00:01:09.250> just<00:01:09.369> switch<00:01:09.700> tanks<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.390> go

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
that you can just switch tanks and go

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.749 
that you can just switch tanks and go
ahead<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.810> finish<00:01:11.200> cooking<00:01:11.829> well<00:01:12.399> if<00:01:12.579> you

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
ahead and finish cooking well if you

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.569 
ahead and finish cooking well if you
just<00:01:13.030> have<00:01:13.240> one<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:14.049> run<00:01:14.290> out<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.530> gas<00:01:14.890> then

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
just have one and run out of gas then

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.569 
just have one and run out of gas then
you<00:01:15.790> have<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.240> stop<00:01:16.600> go<00:01:17.409> have<00:01:17.649> it<00:01:17.829> refilled<00:01:18.340> or

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
you have to stop go have it refilled or

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.520 
you have to stop go have it refilled or
exchange<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.180> come<00:01:19.479> back<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:20.020> lot<00:01:20.170> of<00:01:20.289> times

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
exchange it come back and a lot of times

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.249
