00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.889
 hello very good we're all here with 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.059
 a new video to do the boxing of the 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.090
 or that nerdy spirit 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.700
 p 21 0 1 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.270
 this engine is the engine that was 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.260
 using tight small in the last 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:34.000
 world championship where he was champion is 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:38.500
 say is the world champion engine of 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.190
 18 dtv imported by us by the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.930
 company 1 rc colombia has many 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.890
 low which is one thing that most 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.080
 characterizes or that is the low for 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.920
 the cities especially that are with 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.450
 a lot of height then let's move on to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.170
 open it one of the features that 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.770
 we were more surprised just to open it 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:07.810
 is the new box comes a new box 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.480
 with that unfortunate plastic here 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.300
 can appreciate 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.810
 right now true 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.710
 and I told myself we're going with a 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.380
 with that degree is very excellent 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.810
 presentation and with the typical box of 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 cardboard that is using that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.189
 good and let's go to it let's open them 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.450
 we open here and we have the manual of 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.140
 instructions in several languages 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 is in English we also have the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.340
 parts 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.730
 is in Japanese although I think that as 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.720
 that we are not going to find out much truth 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:52.810
 we see that it is something of caution a note 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.060
 of English and Japanese caution and the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.510
 stickers or as I call it stickers 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.260
 later that speed to the typical leaflet 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.250
 of stickers that comes with 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.250
 like that 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.000
 we take out the typical box also from 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.300
 plastic 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.200
 we found very good detail 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.100
 here you are seeing that they are the plugs and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 cough for when we take the engine out of the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.490
 car and we have maintenance 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.200
 any little bear we have all the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.750
 plugs for both the exhaust outlet 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.150
 for the carburetor and for the inlet 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.329
 of additional gas comes with it 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.860
 the cost of leakage of plastic from 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.790
 escape that gets between escape and the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.350
 engine we have here the good engine before 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 we are going to go 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.700
 with an accessory that is here this engine 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.180
 comes with two ventures the venturi of 6.5 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.080
 what are you seeing here and the venturi of 6 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.960
 which is placed in the engine 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.550
 we also see the spark plug that is not 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.569
 placed the spark plug 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.740
 ep3 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.000
 we are seeing lacquer 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.000
 it is separately 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.230
 and we are going to open this great engine 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.500
 amazing 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:31.580
 we already have the famous s 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:38.740
 2101 net spirit winner of the world 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:42.610
 in italy 2014 current world champion 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.040
 the butt with holes here for the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.540
 weight reduction and this 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.709
 discounted was in the butt is 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.829
 oversized and discounted is 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.460
 put inside the body all the 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.390
 bs carburetor 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.390
 ceramic bearings 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.700
 we have 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.350
 the famous s 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.240
 they also commented some data 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.540
 technicians 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.709
 We are talking about the weight of the motor 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:22.000
 they are exactly 352 grams 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:26.030
 and it has a revs rise up 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.669
 42 thousand revolutions make this a little 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.039
 that also depending on the type of 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.080
 nitro could go down a bit or go up a 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:38.470
 little more but we are there 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.069
 in those revolutions truth and they are two 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.599
 points 61 horses and us from 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.000
 our point of view what we have 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:52.520
 tested we recommend 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.530
 with the exhaust the 20 90 sc is the one 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.820
 we give us the power consumption 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.520
 we know that there are other pilots who have 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.250
 been using other types of leaks and 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.490
 it has also worked well for them is not 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.500
 necessary as 100% on 20 90 but good 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.449
 and I am what you recommend or is what 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.419
 we have tried can not say 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.310
 exactly with one another how 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.069
 it would work I will talk to the pilots 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.979
 who want Colombia to see what 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:27.900
 are they driving what is 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:31.229
 using it to really see 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.940
 what performance is giving them true and 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.360
 well that 's all I hope you have 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.930
 liked this a boxing of speed tunisia 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.160

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.160
 bye see you 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.700
