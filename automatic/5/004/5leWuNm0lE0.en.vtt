phones a volume is at max is to be fair

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.349 
phones a volume is at max is to be fair
on<00:00:25.350> both<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> phones<00:00:25.820> okay<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:26.880> let's<00:00:27.210> start

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
on both the phones okay so let's start

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:49.180 
on both the phones okay so let's start
off<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.689> g2<00:00:28.140> first<00:00:39.260> quickly<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> g3<00:00:40.739> now

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.799 

as<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.910> Sun<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.420> g3<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
as you can see the Sun on the g3 is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.299 
as you can see the Sun on the g3 is
quite<00:00:52.680> loud

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
quite loud

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.340 
quite loud
he<00:00:53.699> said<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:53.969> louder<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
he said not louder than the one on the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.650 
he said not louder than the one on the
g2<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.340> sound<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> g2<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> bit<00:00:57.480> more

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
g2 but the sound on the g2 is a bit more

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.840 
g2 but the sound on the g2 is a bit more
crisp<00:00:58.050> than<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.800> g3<00:00:59.129> reason<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
crisp than the g3 reason for that is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.250 
crisp than the g3 reason for that is
because<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.300> speakers<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> g2<00:01:01.230> are

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
because the speakers on the g2 are

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.130 
because the speakers on the g2 are
actually<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.280> bottom<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> phone<00:01:03.600> just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
actually at the bottom of the phone just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.490 
actually at the bottom of the phone just
there<00:01:04.489> whereas<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.030> speaker<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> g3<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
there whereas the speaker on the g3 is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.090 
there whereas the speaker on the g3 is
at<00:01:08.460> behind<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> behind<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> phone<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> that's

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
at behind and behind the phone so that's

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.160 
at behind and behind the phone so that's
why<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> phone<00:01:11.670> flies<00:01:12.030> flat<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
why when the phone flies flat on the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
why when the phone flies flat on the
surface<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.950> sound<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.180> bit

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
surface the sound is actually a bit

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
surface the sound is actually a bit
muffled<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> pick<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> phone

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
muffled but if I was to pick the phone

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.570 
muffled but if I was to pick the phone
up<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.610> hands<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.939> then<00:01:18.060> play<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> track

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.270
