the game that owned their team's most

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.119 
the game that owned their team's most

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
likely wouldn't be involved as much and

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.949 
likely wouldn't be involved as much and
you<00:02:35.310> know<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:36.209> kind<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:36.780> they

you know that's kind of you know they
don't<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.440> because<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.129> that

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
don't have that because they have that

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
don't have that because they have that
start<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.000> they<00:02:39.239> don't<00:02:39.420> really<00:02:39.510> get<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.750> sign

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050
