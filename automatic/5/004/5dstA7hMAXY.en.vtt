00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
little chasis and for the VGA output we

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.649 
little chasis and for the VGA output we
support<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.649> three<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.129> output<00:01:02.909> one<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
support the three kind of output one is

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.870 
support the three kind of output one is
T<00:01:04.320> sub<00:01:04.589> DVI<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> other<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.830> hdmi<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
T sub DVI and the other is the hdmi and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.959 
T sub DVI and the other is the hdmi and
we<00:01:09.690> still<00:01:09.960> support<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.800> firewall<00:01:11.370> solution

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
we still support the firewall solution

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.219 
we still support the firewall solution
and<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.990> optical<00:01:13.680> audio<00:01:13.890> output<00:01:15.079> for<00:01:16.079> this

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and the optical audio output for this

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.249 
and the optical audio output for this
model<00:01:16.469> problem<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.979> use<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.549> audio<00:01:18.509> control

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
model problem we use the audio control

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.109 
model problem we use the audio control
use<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.740> real<00:01:20.399> tech<00:01:20.670> solution<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.920> we<00:01:23.119> also

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
use the real tech solution and we also

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.639 
use the real tech solution and we also
support<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> dopey<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.009> DTS<00:01:27.289> for<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.469> edge

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
support the dopey and DTS for the edge

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.240 
support the dopey and DTS for the edge
home<00:01:28.950> theater<00:01:29.430> solution<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.979> everybody<00:01:31.979> can

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
home theater solution and everybody can

see<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.909> old<00:01:33.320> capacitor<00:01:34.320> useless<00:01:34.799> alley

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
see the old capacitor useless alley

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.179 
see the old capacitor useless alley
capacitor<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.750> comp<00:01:37.439> ability<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
capacitor so the comp ability and the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.560 
capacitor so the comp ability and the
performance<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.719> good<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.409> mud<00:01:40.890> work

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
performance very good for this mud work

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
performance very good for this mud work
and<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> other<00:01:43.890> things<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.700> use<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:46.490> 55

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and for the other things we use the 55

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.289 
and for the other things we use the 55
AC<00:01:47.789> speed<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> except<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.299> very

AC speed up in and except or the very

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.959 
AC speed up in and except or the very
good<00:01:52.079> performance<00:01:52.469> for<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.219> power<00:01:53.429> solution

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
good performance for the power solution

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.440 
good performance for the power solution
and<00:01:54.179> not<00:01:54.649> only<00:01:55.649> focus<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.759> home<00:01:56.969> theater

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and not only focus on the home theater

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.279 
and not only focus on the home theater
PC<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.920> also<00:01:59.250> combine<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.479> overclocking

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
PC we all also combine the overclocking

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.319 
PC we all also combine the overclocking
feature<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.939> bios<00:02:03.359> and<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
feature on it bios and I think the

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.240 
feature on it bios and I think the
performance<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.079> mudball<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:07.979> good

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
performance of this mudball is very good

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.660 
performance of this mudball is very good
for<00:02:08.580> overclocking<00:02:09.330> too
