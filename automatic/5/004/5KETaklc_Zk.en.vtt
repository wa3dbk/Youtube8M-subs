00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello, I want to congratulate everyone on the new 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.400
 merry christmas catholic 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.500
 Christmas bread and thanksgiving 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.210
 Pasko March 8 and other 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.710
 holidays with which you never 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.710
 congratulated why you never 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.570
 congratulated well probably because I don't 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.400
 I can congratulate say so if I 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.769
 decided to congratulate you on the new year then this 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.480
 It would have looked that way with the year. 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.279
 and for the new year we had comparisons not 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.439
 on the topic because if we chose 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.910
 New Year's theme comparison looked 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.910
 would be exactly the way grandma evaporates 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:47.129
 ruff is a fish this is a program of this donkey 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.690
 Thank God, the new year has passed 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.750
 new situation was avoided 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.090
 and now I think you can gash the usual 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.800
 such a standard comparison among those 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.210
 proposed by you on VKontakte group 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.129
 The most popular topics were 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 associated with mobile phones you 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.890
 offered to compare the new htc apple 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.920
 galaxy and many other phones about 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.560
 which I have not even heard before this 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.820
 I thought and decided that if you choose the best 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.439
 company that produce mobile 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.479
 phones then you need to choose 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.640
 really good firm yes and which 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.830
 There is also a long time well, then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.670
 there is for example choose middle of the night and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.850
 samsunga motorola tit and sony but 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.220
 Siemens has, in principle, long ago merged with 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.740
 Nokiy and besides, I've been Siemens for years. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.229
 10 probably did not see so Siemens I 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.509
 I think by sony also merged long ago 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.110
 and although they are no longer the opposite 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.570
 divided 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.920
 Well, in short, sony, too, past motorola 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.439
 motorola generally still exists in general 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.159
 there are only two of us left nokia and 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.159
 samsung 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.960
 samsung right I already told you 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.670
 comparison samsung and sony guess who 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.770
 won if you're interested can see 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.570
 this comparison is here while you are it 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.270
 look I'll tell you a little about 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.630
 noke firm by and large nokia firm 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.900
 appeared in 1865 quite 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.300
 long ago but then it was called nokia abby 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.180
 and did not produce phones 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.069
 and the paper then happened a row with whether they with 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.250
 other large companies one of the non 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.720
 let out cables and another rubber 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.850
 products agree pretty 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 a strange set of products was in nokia 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.569
 almost two centuries ago 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.340
 but then there was a crisis of the 80s and 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.630
 nokia for some reason decided to release 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.489
 Cell phones 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.299
 she really did before 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.190
 electronics produced TVs but 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.549
 1980 she received a large order for 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.000
 equipment for gsm networks and then nokia 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.970
 I thought damn if we produce 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.890
 equipment for gsm networks then why 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.519
 we will not release a mobile phone and 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.079
 since released 1992 legs let 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.769
 world's first mobile phone 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:09.100
 network gsm nokia 1011 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.170
 notice not samsung not si glasses and not even 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.269
 everyone's favorite apple released the first 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.269
 mobile phone operating network gsm 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.829
 namely nokia but among the general 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.290
 number of mobile phones nokia 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.170
 1 thus was not the first mobile 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.090
 The phone became motorola dynatac which 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.069
 released in 1973, but it does not mean 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.769
 say that it is mobile and nokia 1011 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.019
 Of course, I still have a big one 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.380
 antennas she tried just hefty 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.200
 but she already knew how to call 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.930
 and even send sms while 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.180
 first phone from samsung h100 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.130
 could only call and receive text messages 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.170
 that is , by and large he looked like 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.000
 pager you can call but 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.859
 personally it seems to me that it's better with 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.380
 speaking manager than with this 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.050
 because it looked like a suitcase 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.540
 mobile phone and before the appearance 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.940
 motorola dynatac it was such here 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.030
 black suitcase and weighing about 4 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.220
 kilograms and cost about 4 thousand 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.890
 dollars is by the way more expensive than now 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.890
 there is a background but people and why did you buy 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.520
 as time passed the technology evolved and here in 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.210
 2002 nokia releases its first 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.850
 phone with color display nokia 7200 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.890
 one but besides the color display she has 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.460
 were still changeable color panels already 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.280
 nine pieces not so much in the iphone but many 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.470
 7201 was too defiant he design 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.080
 not everyone liked the company at once 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.120
 understood and immediately released a new phone 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.850
 nokia 6610 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.010
 she was inside exactly the same but in 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.170
 more classic case it is perhaps 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.290
 was the most legendary of all mobile 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.560
 phones well, I do nâ€™t think except siemens 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.000
 a65 which was absolutely all 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.040
 Well, just do not have to say that 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.750
 you were not siemens a65 first color 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.430
 the phone from samsung became 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.830
 samsung c100 phone 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.440
 its main difference from nokia was 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.620
 price is only 160 dollars while 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.200
 even the nokia 610 cost as much as 500 dollars 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.300
 besides the c100 was cheap it was 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.610
 also the thinnest mobile phone 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.250
 at that time not as thin as outwardly 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.020
 phone and but still exactly the rest is gone 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.850
 technology has evolved 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.610
 color screens were already one and all 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.760
 and it is time to come up with something new and 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.790
 samsung came up with 16 tonal polyphony 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.290
 Well, that is not samsung came up with but 1 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.450
 began to use it in their devices 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.170
 I still remember those 16-channel 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.810
 polyphony 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.360
 there was always such a person who took 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.430
 the phone listened to music and said it 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.260
 16 tonal polyphony is 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.300
 honestly still don't understand how they are 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.810
 did in principle do not care 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.160
 then the era of mp3 begins 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.020
 technologies evolved and replaced 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.360
 polyphony era has come mp3 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.640
 and then nokia took the lead releasing 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.480
 nokia xpressmusic phone line 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.010
 these phones were truly stylish and 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.390
 loud with them makkrie just 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.930
 sony ericsson walkman 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.530
 but those had power in the columns and 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.780
 headphones aku 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.580
 xpressmusic namely embedded 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.820
 the dynamics of technology 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.580
 evolved and in 2007 iphone comes out 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:23.680
 and the era of smartphones begins but oh 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.680
 smartphones we'll talk next time 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.990
 what did we consider big enough 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.360
 gap from phone history and 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.280
 found out that at the beginning of the two thousandth 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.990
 the best phones were phones from 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.810
 Finnish company nokia 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.030
 but it was 10 years ago and which ones 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.830
 phones are better now we find out in 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.630
 following comparisons to not 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.340
 miss the second part of this release not 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.230
 forget to subscribe to the channel as well 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.720
 same join group vkontakte 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.940
 and then you will not miss a single 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.550
 release of comparisons on this perhaps all I 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.230
 I say goodbye to you but only for a while 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:04.590
 until the following comparisons come out 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.590
 by the way next week happy
