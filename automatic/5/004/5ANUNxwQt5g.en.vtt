helps<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.880> lot<00:03:19.030> use<00:03:19.780> alternative<00:03:20.769> energy<00:03:21.220> which

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
helps a lot use alternative energy which

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.940 
helps a lot use alternative energy which
could<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:22.389> in<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.599> form<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.930> solar<00:03:23.200> panels<00:03:23.829> I

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
could be in the form of solar panels I

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.409 
could be in the form of solar panels I
think<00:03:24.190> there's<00:03:24.370> going<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.609> be<00:03:24.669> a<00:03:24.760> lot<00:03:25.120> more

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
think there's going to be a lot more

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.000 
think there's going to be a lot more
things<00:03:25.660> coming<00:03:26.019> into<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.319> market<00:03:26.769> as

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
things coming into the market as

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.819 
things coming into the market as
alternative<00:03:27.730> energy<00:03:28.180> okay<00:03:28.599> grow<00:03:29.380> trees<00:03:29.620> in

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
alternative energy okay grow trees in

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.030 
alternative energy okay grow trees in
your<00:03:29.859> neighborhood<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:31.569> think<00:03:31.900> what<00:03:32.799> will

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
your neighborhood and I think what will

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.220 
your neighborhood and I think what will
matter<00:03:33.310> more<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.970> not<00:03:34.299> just<00:03:34.540> growing<00:03:34.900> trees

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
matter more is not just growing trees

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.339 
matter more is not just growing trees
don't<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.400> plant<00:03:36.669> trees<00:03:37.030> but<00:03:37.419> stop<00:03:37.870> people
