Packers<00:00:55.350> i<00:00:55.920> believe<00:00:56.399> i<00:00:56.430> had<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> packers

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

beating<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> Minnesota<00:00:57.809> Vikings<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.920> think

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
beating the Minnesota Vikings up I think

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
beating the Minnesota Vikings up I think
I<00:00:59.219> did<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.730> my<00:00:59.789> previous<00:01:00.090> videos<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.840> had<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> go

I did in my previous videos I had to go
back<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.350> check<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.590> i<00:01:01.649> believe<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:01.949> had<00:01:02.280> them

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
