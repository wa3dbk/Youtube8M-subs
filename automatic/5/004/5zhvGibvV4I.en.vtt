and we'll hover it's a little windy so I

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.180 
and we'll hover it's a little windy so I
can't<00:01:41.200> really<00:01:41.290> hover<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.680> but<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:41.860> can<00:01:41.980> see

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
can't really hover it but you can see

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.430 
can't really hover it but you can see
here<00:01:42.490> it'll<00:01:43.420> just<00:01:43.630> stay<00:01:43.900> pretty<00:01:44.200> much<00:01:44.290> in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
here it'll just stay pretty much in

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.580 
here it'll just stay pretty much in
space<00:01:44.830> there<00:01:45.240> doesn't<00:01:46.240> really<00:01:46.270> fall<00:01:46.660> kind<00:01:47.470> of

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
space there doesn't really fall kind of

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.250 
space there doesn't really fall kind of
hovering<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:47.950> there<00:01:48.990> actually<00:01:49.990> it's<00:01:50.080> still

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
hovering it there actually it's still

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.210 
hovering it there actually it's still
pulling<00:01:50.530> up<00:01:51.750> I'll<00:01:52.750> do<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.960> crazy<00:01:53.290> downward<00:01:53.980> roll

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
pulling up I'll do a crazy downward roll

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.290 
pulling up I'll do a crazy downward roll
here<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.670> second

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:28.620 

on<00:02:08.730> a<00:02:08.850> knife-edge

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.480 

those<00:02:29.140> edges

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
those edges

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.370 
those edges
it'll<00:02:31.120> just<00:02:31.300> fly<00:02:31.480> around<00:02:31.540> knife-edge<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.320> now

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
it'll just fly around knife-edge and now

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.480 
it'll just fly around knife-edge and now
you<00:02:32.440> do<00:02:32.620> lose<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.860> little<00:02:33.160> bit<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.400> altitude

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
you do lose a little bit of altitude

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.120 
you do lose a little bit of altitude
over<00:02:33.850> time<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.450> I'm<00:02:34.510> getting<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:35.050> wasn't<00:02:35.950> up<00:02:36.010> at

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
over time and I'm getting I wasn't up at

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.440 
over time and I'm getting I wasn't up at
full<00:02:36.280> throttle<00:02:36.520> either<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:36.910> could<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.210> had<00:02:37.360> it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
full throttle either I could have had it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.660 
full throttle either I could have had it
a<00:02:37.510> little<00:02:37.660> higher<00:02:37.860> there<00:02:38.860> we'll<00:02:39.010> life<00:02:39.430> heads

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
a little higher there we'll life heads

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.080 
a little higher there we'll life heads
up<00:02:39.790> there<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.030> little<00:02:40.270> bit<00:02:41.700> we<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:42.790> pretty<00:02:42.970> much

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
up there a little bit we can pretty much

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.540 
up there a little bit we can pretty much
just<00:02:43.390> fly<00:02:43.660> around<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.230> knife-edge<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.370> keep

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
just fly around in a knife-edge and keep

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.170 
just fly around in a knife-edge and keep
your<00:02:45.730> hoops<00:02:46.000> hit<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> wrong<00:02:47.050> button<00:02:47.440> there

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.930 

use<00:02:50.629> your<00:02:50.780> altitude

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.610 

it'll<00:02:55.540> actually<00:02:55.690> pull<00:02:56.050> out<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.440> knife

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
it'll actually pull out of the knife

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.140 
it'll actually pull out of the knife
head<00:02:56.800> job<00:02:57.010> if<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.280> push<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.670> Rutter's<00:02:57.850> too

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
head job if you push the Rutter's too

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.729 
head job if you push the Rutter's too
much

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.160 

it'll<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.430> backwards<00:03:05.909> routes<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.269> course<00:03:06.569> and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
it'll be backwards routes of course and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.309 
it'll be backwards routes of course and
it<00:03:07.469> has<00:03:07.500> no<00:03:07.799> problem<00:03:08.099> with<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.900> little<00:03:10.170> higher

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
it has no problem with a little higher

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.690 
it has no problem with a little higher
so<00:03:10.590> don't<00:03:10.739> landed<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.099> tennis<00:03:11.370> where<00:03:11.519> it's<00:03:11.609> no

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
so don't landed a tennis where it's no

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
one last knife edge here for a little

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.460 
one last knife edge here for a little
bit

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.270 

behind<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.620> fly<00:03:41.100> away<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.340> what's<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.730> it

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280
