well<00:00:16.520> stuff<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:17.120> starting<00:00:17.510> point<00:00:17.720> was<00:00:17.810> very

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
well stuff the starting point was very

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.390 
well stuff the starting point was very
much<00:00:18.260> trying<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.830> produce<00:00:20.080> a<00:00:21.190> series<00:00:22.190> of

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
much trying to produce a series of

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.380 
much trying to produce a series of
products<00:00:22.820> that<00:00:23.060> which<00:00:25.090> presented<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.360> idea

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
products that which presented the idea

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.230 
products that which presented the idea
more<00:00:27.110> about<00:00:27.440> media<00:00:27.950> and<00:00:28.250> necessary<00:00:28.730> product

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
more about media and necessary product

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.850 
more about media and necessary product
what<00:00:30.169> I<00:00:30.200> mean<00:00:30.439> by<00:00:30.619> that<00:00:30.770> is<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:31.070> each<00:00:31.669> product

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
what I mean by that is that each product

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.180 
what I mean by that is that each product
presents<00:00:33.860> itself<00:00:34.220> as<00:00:34.550> is<00:00:34.910> kind<00:00:35.180> of<00:00:35.240> a<00:00:35.300> solid

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
presents itself as is kind of a solid

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.270 
presents itself as is kind of a solid
continuous<00:00:37.190> block<00:00:38.020> with<00:00:39.020> no<00:00:39.290> parting<00:00:40.040> lines

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
continuous block with no parting lines

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.370 
continuous block with no parting lines
and<00:00:40.760> it<00:00:41.060> doesn't<00:00:41.600> feel<00:00:41.840> like<00:00:41.900> it's<00:00:42.260> an

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
and it doesn't feel like it's an

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.680 
and it doesn't feel like it's an
assemblage<00:00:42.920> of<00:00:43.040> parts<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:43.790> have<00:00:44.390> kind<00:00:44.570> of

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
assemblage of parts that have kind of

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.480 
assemblage of parts that have kind of
been<00:00:44.810> brought<00:00:45.080> together<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:45.830> rather<00:00:46.070> almost

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
been brought together but rather almost

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.820 
been brought together but rather almost
as<00:00:46.610> if<00:00:46.760> it's<00:00:46.910> it's<00:00:47.570> born<00:00:48.080> out<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.350> its<00:00:48.650> own

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
as if it's it's born out of its own

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.440 
as if it's it's born out of its own
material<00:00:49.490> and<00:00:50.200> by<00:00:51.200> doing<00:00:51.410> that<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.910> customer

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
material and by doing that the customer

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.860 
material and by doing that the customer
kind<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.780> feels<00:00:54.400> that<00:00:56.200> it<00:00:57.200> is<00:00:57.590> more<00:00:58.310> like

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
kind of feels that it is more like

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.890 
kind of feels that it is more like
storage<00:00:59.870> media<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:01.070> bit<00:01:01.910> like<00:01:02.060> a<00:01:02.120> video

than necessarily a product that has lots

than necessarily a product that has lots
of<00:01:09.830> components<00:01:10.189> in<00:01:10.580> it<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.850> are<00:01:10.880> working<00:01:11.830> and

of components in it that are working and
part<00:01:14.330> of<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.450> reason<00:01:14.509> to<00:01:14.960> do<00:01:15.140> that<00:01:15.170> was<00:01:15.590> to

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
part of the reason to do that was to

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.550 
part of the reason to do that was to
create<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:17.090> lot<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.450> trust<00:01:18.520> between<00:01:19.520> the

product and the user who is using when

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.120 
product and the user who is using when
you<00:01:25.700> when<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:25.909> take<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.719> lid<00:01:26.929> off<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.920> just

you when you take the lid off it just

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.679 
you when you take the lid off it just
simply<00:01:28.310> reveals<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:30.799> a<00:01:30.920> USB<00:01:31.700> plug<00:01:31.999> which<00:01:32.390> plugs

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
simply reveals a a USB plug which plugs

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.559 
simply reveals a a USB plug which plugs
into<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.990> computer<00:01:33.369> obviously<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:38.390> in

into the computer obviously and that in

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.630 
into the computer obviously and that in
itself<00:01:38.659> means<00:01:39.499> that<00:01:39.799> everything<00:01:40.100> is<00:01:40.369> self

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640

contained within the product it's not

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.830 
contained within the product it's not
like<00:01:42.319> you<00:01:42.530> need<00:01:42.609> many<00:01:43.609> other<00:01:43.850> parts<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.719> be

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
like you need many other parts to be

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.760 
like you need many other parts to be
able<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.139> use<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.639> or<00:01:46.899> cables<00:01:47.899> or<00:01:48.109> transformers

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
able to use it or cables or transformers

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.010 
able to use it or cables or transformers
or<00:01:48.920> those<00:01:49.069> sorts<00:01:49.219> of<00:01:49.369> things

or those sorts of things

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.610 
or those sorts of things
and<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:54.270> starting<00:01:54.540> point<00:01:55.050> for<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> DVD

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
and the starting point for the DVD

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.910 
and the starting point for the DVD
player<00:01:56.040> was<00:01:56.280> again<00:01:56.550> very<00:01:56.940> very<00:01:56.970> much<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.510> same

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
player was again very very much the same

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.820 
player was again very very much the same
but<00:01:59.420> what<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.540> did<00:02:00.690> was<00:02:00.870> add<00:02:03.440> another<00:02:04.440> layer<00:02:04.800> to

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
but what we did was add another layer to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.210 
but what we did was add another layer to
it<00:02:05.160> whereby<00:02:06.530> even<00:02:07.530> though<00:02:07.620> it's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.830> mobile

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
it whereby even though it's a mobile

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.130 
it whereby even though it's a mobile
product<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.820> generally<00:02:09.240> sits<00:02:09.510> on<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> table

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
product it generally sits on the table

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.050 
product it generally sits on the table
and<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.700> when<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.000> turn<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.300> over<00:02:14.060> it's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and so when you turn it over it's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.270 
and so when you turn it over it's
actually<00:02:15.240> reveal<00:02:15.750> any<00:02:15.960> part<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.380> its<00:02:16.530> parts<00:02:17.160> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
actually reveal any part of its parts of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.370 
actually reveal any part of its parts of
it<00:02:17.370> its<00:02:17.580> inner<00:02:18.090> workings<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.840> terms<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.200> its

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
it its inner workings in terms of its

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.620 
it its inner workings in terms of its
dried<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:22.590> was<00:02:22.770> quite<00:02:23.010> an<00:02:23.130> interesting

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
dried and that was quite an interesting

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.130 
dried and that was quite an interesting
idea<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:25.200> demystifying<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> program<00:02:30.140> for

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
idea for demystifying the program for

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.400 
idea for demystifying the program for
this<00:02:32.040> kind<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> market<00:02:32.850> last<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.110> really

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
this kind of market last see is really

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
this kind of market last see is really
the<00:02:34.530> perfect<00:02:34.950> company<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.880> because

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the perfect company to do that because

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.610 
the perfect company to do that because
they're<00:02:36.390> able<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.770> not<00:02:37.770> only<00:02:37.800> take<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.310> risk<00:02:38.670> of

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
they're able to not only take a risk of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.760 
they're able to not only take a risk of
essentially<00:02:40.620> produce<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> box<00:02:41.520> which<00:02:42.770> you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
essentially produce on a box which you

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.820 
essentially produce on a box which you
know<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:45.980> rizal<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:48.390> think<00:02:48.830> by

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
know is rizal that it is and I think by

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.250 
know is rizal that it is and I think by
doing<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.400> it's<00:02:51.000> something<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.840> many

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
doing that it's something that many

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.610 
doing that it's something that many
other<00:02:52.470> companies

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.680 

you
