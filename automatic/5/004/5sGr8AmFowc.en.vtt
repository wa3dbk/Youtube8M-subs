 My personal language is Gaza and we are 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.110

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.330
 thousand and this time if you're looking for 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.670
 an L-filament I'm here with a 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.529
 helmet filament of l is what is a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 team an item you need to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.850
 O upgrade here I'll show 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 You in this video how to get the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.529
 very fast helium foundation 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.630
 Let 's upgrade here and we can 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.210
 keep making fast here you need 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.460
 of 16 in that there are only 13 I already went there to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 People are going to the moon and we are going to do the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.559
 run on the moon take some quickie 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 minutes to patrol moon here and there 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.320
 We're going to finish getting started. 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.660
 on the moon here this is the place of support 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.129
 You will call your vehicle and it will 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.170
 quickly we will remember that these 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.149
 neighborhoods they respond in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.000
 then the last attack where 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.129
 You'll find them and you'll do it. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.949
 this whole race looking here already has a 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.019
 I do not know if they fixed open coils 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.640
 let's get it here, keep an eye on 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.229
 these coils also because they give 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.939
 he already had a filament dr 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.979
 the first one you 'll want to enter 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.659
 This one here you will see that here 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.760
 has a chest usually has at times 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.520
 Sometimes it's not okay so do not be surprised if 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.320
 When you come in, you do not have a thing. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.360
 very normal because as I already said the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.670
 chests are in random locations on that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.920
 someone else there also tends to have 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.960
 people gave luck here already have it then 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.790
 You'll see it will not always be the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.130
 same date can be here it can be there 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.200
 so check very well before you leave 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.150
 whether or not you have the will 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.579
 neighborhoods shine then it becomes very easy 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.770
 to see later will rise here in that part 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.750
 they sometimes in this part near here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.759
 of this stone has a chest and then 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.040
 eye and then if it does not it will pass here 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.290
 this little house here also tends to have 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.299
 It's something to see if you have it in our 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.250
 if you do not even have it up here 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.310
 keep an eye out too because you can 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.770
 having this here is going to have to have an eye 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.270
 sinister will leave here will look at this 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.219
 up here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.990
 usually also in the neighborhood here but 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.600
 can not always be here he can 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.060
 appear that such roundness here but 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.310
 here it appears here or else in these 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.590
 places here is very smart side of here 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.500
 also the same thing can have here 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.290
 here you will see how there 's no way 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.420
 move to the side of here let's put the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.739
 vehicle that I saw here can also 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.959
 If we had to, let's see if we have 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.930
 not this time it does not have it so will you 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.879
 leave here turn right and come here 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.739
 you will turn right 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.230
 here you will enter that part 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.650
 there people are seeing that there are 116 are 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.379
 seeing 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.360
 it might be that way in this 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.340
 Bridge here or whatever. 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.200
 beyond the top but only if you 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.250
 I desperately need you to take these 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.440
 parts here 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.849
 which is kind of up there we chatinho 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.849
 try to get the one here that the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.140
 We have seen there because O will also 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.099
 letting us waste we can 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.319
 and is climbing up here in good 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.250
 we collect 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.410
 come back 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.690
 the critters you can decide whether to go or 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.540
 do not kill garden on reels stay on eye 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.730
 because it's interesting too 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.819
 said it was just a coil but not 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.160
 help with nothing here in this room here 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.709
 It's usually yours up here, too. 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.139
 here in the corner and be smart let's go 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.480
 coming back here will turn right in 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.829
 apart ac / dc first you look at 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.260
 left here to see if they usually have 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.870
 O is there or else you have not you will 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.790
 go down here and here 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.290
 before entering this I saw here in this 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.389
 other part here you will turn 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.880
 right here on this site here sometimes 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.130
 also tends to have in our case too 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.690
 we tend not to go back 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.880
 This race here takes about four 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.310
 five minutes and usually picks up from 15 to 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.019
 20 and 10 to 15 depends on luck 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.690
 depends on whether other guys already 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.959
 Pick up, you're going to come here. 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.359
 quickly to and fro to the right 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.919
 We're still here picking up our 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.829
 stop 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.750
 now you can come here I call sparrow 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.630
 to move faster 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.519
 come here, come here and have this 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.660
 here in this house he already has a 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.130
 foundation that we have seen people going 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.440
 I'll get it soon I do not know if it repaired 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.019
 there in the front here they usually have here 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.359
 in this place or in the corners then 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.519
 Look, these little houses do not fit in our house. 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.859
 We're going to the next house here, too. 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.870
 usually on the floor or in the corner 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.210
 see if you have or what is on top 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.240
 keep an eye do not have it too 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.919
 from here to jump and look at the match 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.750
 imac might be in these nooks and crannies 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.130
 here I usually come to the side of here 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.910
 to see the agent there was a filament of 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.139
 l 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.910
 here we are killing only for the 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.550
 animals did not fill the bag here on the trigger 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.560
 have seen one then one more time now 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.840
 You're getting lucky again, leaving 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.520
 Passed here is a good item only. 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.080
 So you're going to come back here to stay 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.039
 calm and know that you are in the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.370
 right path 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:53.699
 see this curve coming down the vehicle 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.250
 It was faster, let's go over here in this 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.220
 place once having been there by car here 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.680
 also have a good eye too can 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.330
 being on top of the stone also and here the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.470
 People do not have to go right now to 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.639
 People come straight 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.560
 We'll get the flamengo who had 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.849
 seen the time that we looked at him 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.889
 O're seeing here 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.750
 Let's get it here, too. 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.400
 with the filaments now in with these 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.530
 at least one of the items on the floor comes 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.819
 entering here this part comes running 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.409
 here the people of Spain where some 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.210
 if you want to kill animals and about spending 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.710
 running goes on you 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.080
 this part here also exist here in 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.659
 cantinho or here or here in the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.270
 We do not have any luck there. 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.370
 there also tends to be there also 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.520
 filaments on the floor so it always remains 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.830
 eye under this part here in that entrance 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.770
 here you can also find something 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.430
 in our case we did not think either 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.320
 pass 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.909
 It's good for you to go all this way. 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.530
 The way I'm doing here because it 's 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.419
 where you can not find 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.460
 it may be that the next time you 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.620
 enter you find and sometimes where people 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.080
 found here in this way find not in 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.810
 next here also usually has that 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.969
 on the floor here can also have chest then 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.270
 be smart do not have in our case 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:05.789
 Let's keep right here in the 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.139
 right also has either here or 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.699
 back there is good 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.590
 Hello, just here to show you if you do not 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.900
 here you may have it here too 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.560
 so it's smart our case is not 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.590
 has 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.389
 Let's go straight and here we are. 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.310
 at the beginning again that one was at a 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.039
 place that we came in and here 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.139
 Let's get the sparrow is exactly where the 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.090
 We reached the first place in that 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.039
 first one we came in now 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.960
 that we 've already done this whole race 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.759
 people can not be repeated because they 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.310
 We got everyone at this place. 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.839
 call the orbit and will repeat the process 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.580
 as soon as we get into orbit 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.840
 We're going to the moon again and it starts. 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.790
 all over again this quick video video 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.199
 to show you this race to 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.600
 to get helium filaments, let's just give a 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.800
 pause here he is talking wrong let's go 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.760
 take a step here to see 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.889
 while we had when 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.139
 We need to have 12 now. 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.160
 we got in this race were 9 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.600
 I was with three 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.130
 so it was not a good race but the 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.690
 Sometimes we get more or less 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.580
 this video was based on a video 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.400
 gringo link is in the description for you 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.690
 watch if you want and that's what I hope 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.130
 I really liked it so much for having 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.540
 watched if you liked the video deja
