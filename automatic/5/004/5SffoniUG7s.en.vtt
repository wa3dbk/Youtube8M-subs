00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.000
 We had a warm welcome to our guests 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.590
 here are diego benaglio marcel schÃ¤fer 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.590
 and kevin de bruyne 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.340
 and the first question must be natural 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.440
 you are the same at home 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.630
 Once again it was a ride on 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:50.670
 from the wagon ground or sport ticked off 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.050
 where I 've heard of everything 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.309
 already if you do not always in the future 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.270
 he sends luck to the carriage floor 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.270
 to be brought 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.879
 Ultimately doing what the manager did 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.080
 in three blocks i believe in the case 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.650
 we will be another solution 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.330
 Find 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.009
 we have a very nice picture now 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.780
 Also gone through in all media 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.190
 one sees kevin sitting there in the back 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.990
 the middle of the water is where you get it 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:21.000
 happy on the quiet place 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.270
 in your head 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.530
 moment as the village this window four 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:34.680
 made in the 93 minute the whole 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.149
 Do not believe in the moment as well as 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.380
 We in the first and second half 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.850
 played if that was a giant 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.740
 difference between the two halves 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.810
 and then you see them coming back 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.040
 always 44 and you know now 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.040
 difficult to win the thing yet 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.330
 I am still happy for him that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.360
 he made the goal for us 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.460
 Of course, the three points I do 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.770
 believe after 5 after the 4-victory 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.290
 complete track only 150 meters from 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.330
 place sprinted must say quite honestly 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.010
 that's nice of course that we 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.480
 Relations play the Bundesliga 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.980
 history is still one 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.239
 play where we think I believe so much 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.070
 maybe even learning from it 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.989
 have to 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.880
 on the way we deny and 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.440
 where we want to go I think you have to 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.080
 after a 3 0 lead 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.720
 the second half a bit boring 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.320
 shape and win the victory home safely 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.100
 bring 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.100
 Zion, of course 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.770
 it's natural that I believe so 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.050
 a game was that everyone likes 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.130
 also looked at the wolfsburger with 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.110
 to change positively 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.430
 I think we really have advertising there 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.930
 has made for the bundesliga 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.810
 really great fun but 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.100
 I think if you have the leverkusener 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.590
 it's not so much fun to ask them 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.700
 even if you are a part of it 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.050
 Do you even feel that way? 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.180
 You would not have to play after the Bayern 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.620
 actually say now stood by the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.750
 form you are currently the number one 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.000
 in Germany 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.250
 yes I think the role distribution is 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.050
 clearly so I think the bavaria have in 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.940
 shown the last months or years 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.810
 that they are the measure in europe at the moment 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.420
 all things are and I believe that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.520
 a good times in that was the one time 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.140
 no we are we are natural 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.130
 Somewhat satisfied that ours 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.810
 development in recent months 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.670
 absolutely going in the right direction 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.710
 that we are constantly evolving 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.170
 but we still know or something 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.760
 long way to go have us in 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.580
 actually all areas how to 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.110
 example has still seen yesterday 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.010
 need to be able to improve and improve 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.570
 that is our goal 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.070
 and that's why we do not pretend 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.200
 very different with the situation 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.030
 the second one is to be in germany 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.140
 behind the bavaria but we want 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.990
 continue our way 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.160
 Of course we want to be on time 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.110
 establish in the table above 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.870
 I believe it is important too and then 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.120
 seen from second power 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.460
 you have to be long term and 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.650
 keep it up more constant 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.390
 that is definitely our goal and that 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.620
 we work hard but with the 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.240
 We deal with other things 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.130
 not observed 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.210
 because that was not quite as long as we 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.640
 You both have that kind of a bit 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.080
 feel that you feel like something here 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.910
 something develops on a permanent basis 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.130
 maybe not at the moment but up 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.520
 duration also with Bayern Munich paroli 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.520
 can offer 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.350
 Everything as I am as I am 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.000
 I 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.850
 now we are the number two me 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.530
 Try to become even if 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.930
 the bavaria drove eight 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.040
 I'm not here and there now 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.730
 title to win 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.050
 I'm here to win every game 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.920
 and I try they will also 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.920
 team to ensure 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.840
 thank you today for the tango 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.950
 benaglio marcel shepherd and kevin de 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.950
 bruyne thank you 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.670
 Have a nice evening until next time 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.670
 at the audi star talk
