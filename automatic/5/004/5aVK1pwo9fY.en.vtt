in a mural in the business and I might

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.350 
in a mural in the business and I might

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
can barely see them but I put a lot of

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.820 
can barely see them but I put a lot of
in<00:02:44.940> depends<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.050> size<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> room<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:46.770> I

in depends on the size of the room but I

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.690 
in depends on the size of the room but I
put<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> lot<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.400> stars<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:49.130> Adams<00:02:50.130> let's<00:02:50.460> say<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
put a lot of stars in Adams let's say I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.960 
put a lot of stars in Adams let's say I
do<00:02:50.880> 8,000<00:02:51.870> stars<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.620> room<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:53.400> might<00:02:53.610> see

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
do 8,000 stars in a room you might see

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.380 
do 8,000 stars in a room you might see
80<00:02:54.360> stars<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.190> majority<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.790> stars<00:02:57.120> will

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
80 stars so the majority of stars will

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.050 
80 stars so the majority of stars will
not<00:02:57.570> be<00:02:57.750> seen<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:59.130> you're<00:02:59.340> gonna<00:02:59.460> see<00:02:59.760> a
