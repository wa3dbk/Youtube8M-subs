before

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.090 
before
took<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:38.940> plunge<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.240> bought<00:05:39.450> this<00:05:39.600> unit

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
took the plunge and bought this unit

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.350 
took the plunge and bought this unit
even<00:05:41.100> went<00:05:41.220> so<00:05:41.250> far<00:05:41.340> as<00:05:41.520> to<00:05:41.580> buy<00:05:41.820> another<00:05:42.120> unit

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360

with<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.250> sound<00:05:44.520> quality<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:44.970> I<00:05:45.690> think<00:05:46.350> with

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
with the sound quality so I think with

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.380 
with the sound quality so I think with
these<00:05:46.680> touchscreen<00:05:47.280> units<00:05:47.700> a<00:05:47.970> lot<00:05:48.060> of<00:05:48.300> the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
these touchscreen units a lot of the

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.030 
these touchscreen units a lot of the
time<00:05:48.630> you're<00:05:48.900> sacrificing<00:05:49.110> your<00:05:49.680> sound

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
time you're sacrificing your sound

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.800 
time you're sacrificing your sound
quality<00:05:50.430> for<00:05:50.700> some<00:05:50.940> shiny<00:05:51.240> buttons<00:05:51.630> and

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
quality for some shiny buttons and

things<00:05:51.960> like<00:05:52.080> that<00:05:52.140> and<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:53.010> be<00:05:53.040> honest<00:05:53.340> using

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
things like that and to be honest using

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.040 
things like that and to be honest using
them<00:05:54.240> is<00:05:54.330> probably<00:05:54.540> going<00:05:54.690> to<00:05:54.780> be<00:05:54.870> more

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
them is probably going to be more

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.570 
them is probably going to be more
dangerous<00:05:55.500> than<00:05:55.560> it's<00:05:55.830> worth<00:05:55.890> while<00:05:56.310> driving
