 created online you click on it and 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.040
 you will see somewhere writing options 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.040
 which you go into options you 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.320
 search for the place of 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.390
 reappearance is in a place where they 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.420
 had to appear there is either house 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.549
 all this or be you put behind 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.119
 position as soon as you've put last 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.270
 position 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.770
 you go in the campaign mode as 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.000
 I am in campaign mode makes start 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.320
 then you do I new part 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.240
 started here so do not worry 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.740
 it does not affect backups 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.479
 you to the father of anything 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.399
 the part and that you will do you 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.719
 do not save it and by nothing at all I 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.659
 will exactly explain to you how 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.340
 we must be here in the canton 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.759
 begins when we rethink history 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.459
 during the cutscene makes star in 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.240
 line play buy one to one session 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.469
 by invitation otherwise it does not work 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.369
 mandatory session by invitation 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.929
 so do not go wrong do not forget 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.119
 that all the manipulation must is 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.149
 exactly like that if someone 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.950
 otherwise succeeds ben ben me I arrive 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.000
 that like that so I think it's 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.789
 100% safe technique so I want to 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.849
 prevent anyway it's this glitch 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:16.190
 it's after the update 1.4 I believe 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.310
 1.04 down the last update there 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.410
 above from now and the 1.04 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.090
 because this glitch actually were 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.040
 known for a long time but all the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.389
 world says they walk more because 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.850
 of the update but me they walk 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:33.440
