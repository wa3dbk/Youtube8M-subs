little<00:04:24.110> blob<00:04:24.650> of<00:04:24.830> glossy<00:04:25.340> accents<00:04:26.000> just

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
little blob of glossy accents just

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.180 
little blob of glossy accents just
beneath<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.870> eye<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.440> then<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:27.980> can<00:04:28.070> see<00:04:28.130> I

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
beneath the eye and then you can see I

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.400 
beneath the eye and then you can see I
just<00:04:28.220> flipped<00:04:28.580> it<00:04:28.760> up<00:04:28.940> flicked<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.420> up<00:04:29.570> to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
just flipped it up flicked it up to

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.440 
just flipped it up flicked it up to
create<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.740> tier<00:04:31.010> shape<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.610> held<00:04:32.300> it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
create that tier shape I held it

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.240 
create that tier shape I held it
downwards<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:33.200> it<00:04:33.290> dripped<00:04:33.710> down<00:04:33.800> and

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
downwards so that it dripped down and

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.610 
downwards so that it dripped down and
there's<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.300> finished<00:04:35.570> card<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.260> you<00:04:36.500> can

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
there's the finished card and you can

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.560 
there's the finished card and you can
see<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:36.800> added<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.280> couple<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.640> hearts<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.360> some

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.080 
onto my masculine cards and again I had
a<00:04:48.080> very<00:04:48.380> clear<00:04:48.590> idea<00:04:48.650> in<00:04:49.130> my<00:04:49.280> sketchbook<00:04:49.640> of

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
a very clear idea in my sketchbook of

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.760 
a very clear idea in my sketchbook of
where<00:04:50.480> I<00:04:50.510> wanted<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.870> go<00:04:50.930> with<00:04:51.110> this<00:04:51.260> card<00:04:51.500> I

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
where I wanted to go with this card I

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.260 
where I wanted to go with this card I
wanted<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.550> use<00:04:52.640> this<00:04:52.790> black<00:04:53.540> patterned<00:04:54.050> paper

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
wanted to use this black patterned paper

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.920 
wanted to use this black patterned paper
and<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:56.670> outline<00:04:57.670> rockets<00:04:58.120> from<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.690> sets

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
and the outline rockets from the sets

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.770 
and the outline rockets from the sets
and<00:04:59.280> have<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.400> rocket<00:05:00.700> flying<00:05:00.880> on<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.150> patent

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
and have the rocket flying on the patent

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.930 
and have the rocket flying on the patent
paper<00:05:03.750> when<00:05:04.750> when<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.430> paper<00:05:06.430> pad<00:05:06.640> arrived

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
paper when when the paper pad arrived

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.130 
paper when when the paper pad arrived
and<00:05:07.210> I<00:05:07.240> actually<00:05:07.420> looked<00:05:07.720> at<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:07.930> black

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
and I actually looked at this black

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.560 
and I actually looked at this black
paper<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:08.740> decided<00:05:09.460> it<00:05:09.670> wasn't<00:05:09.850> actually<00:05:10.150> going

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
paper I decided it wasn't actually going

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.550 
paper I decided it wasn't actually going
to<00:05:10.900> be<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:12.370> best<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.000> I<00:05:13.240> switched<00:05:14.080> it<00:05:14.320> for

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
to be the best so I switched it for

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.750 
to be the best so I switched it for
another<00:05:14.830> piece<00:05:15.100> of<00:05:15.190> black<00:05:15.310> paper<00:05:15.490> that's<00:05:15.700> a

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
another piece of black paper that's a

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.270 
another piece of black paper that's a
bit<00:05:16.150> more<00:05:16.240> plain<00:05:16.540> and<00:05:16.870> also<00:05:17.860> from<00:05:18.070> that

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
bit more plain and also from that

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.420 
bit more plain and also from that
collection<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.620> then<00:05:20.770> I<00:05:20.800> chose<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.250> color

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
collection and then I chose the color

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.280 
collection and then I chose the color
for<00:05:21.610> my<00:05:21.700> rocket<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.360> didn't<00:05:22.930> find<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.110> one

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
for my rocket I didn't find that one

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.020 
for my rocket I didn't find that one
quite<00:05:23.500> so<00:05:23.650> hard<00:05:23.890> because<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.400> really<00:05:24.730> love<00:05:24.880> this

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
quite so hard because I really love this

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.060 
quite so hard because I really love this
stripy<00:05:25.660> orange<00:05:25.930> paper<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:26.530> I<00:05:26.830> thought<00:05:26.950> a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
stripy orange paper and I thought a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.810 
stripy orange paper and I thought a
stripy<00:05:27.430> orange<00:05:27.790> rocket<00:05:28.150> would<00:05:28.270> be<00:05:28.360> really<00:05:28.540> fun

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
stripy orange rocket would be really fun

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:46.230 
stripy orange rocket would be really fun
so<00:05:30.820> again<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.300> stamped<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:32.220> cut<00:05:33.220> my<00:05:33.340> rocket<00:05:33.610> out

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.370 

and<00:05:48.120> cut<00:05:49.120> our<00:05:49.270> little<00:05:49.509> star<00:05:49.750> as<00:05:49.930> well<00:05:50.110> because

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
and cut our little star as well because

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.510 
and cut our little star as well because
i<00:05:50.410> knew<00:05:50.530> i<00:05:50.560> was<00:05:50.710> going<00:05:50.800> to<00:05:50.860> have<00:05:50.979> stars<00:05:51.280> on<00:05:51.400> my

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
i knew i was going to have stars on my

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.339 
i knew i was going to have stars on my
finished<00:05:51.759> card<00:05:52.000> I<00:05:52.300> want<00:05:52.810> to<00:05:52.870> see<00:05:53.020> how<00:05:53.139> it<00:05:53.259> all

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
finished card I want to see how it all

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.850 
finished card I want to see how it all
work<00:05:53.590> together<00:05:55.259> so<00:05:56.259> then<00:05:56.410> it<00:05:56.530> was<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.680> case<00:05:56.830> of

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
work together so then it was a case of

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.999 
work together so then it was a case of
deciding<00:05:57.610> and<00:05:58.289> what<00:05:59.289> I<00:05:59.319> was<00:05:59.530> going<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.830> have

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
deciding and what I was going to have

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.270 
deciding and what I was going to have
and<00:06:01.319> what<00:06:02.319> what<00:06:02.500> background<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.979> was<00:06:03.099> going<00:06:03.220> to

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
and what what background I was going to

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.710 
and what what background I was going to
have<00:06:03.370> what<00:06:03.490> kind<00:06:03.669> of<00:06:03.699> paper<00:06:03.910> again<00:06:04.419> my

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
have what kind of paper again my

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.300 
have what kind of paper again my
sentiment<00:06:05.259> comes<00:06:05.500> from<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:06.039> year-round

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
sentiment comes from the year-round

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:14.219 
sentiment comes from the year-round
sentiments<00:06:07.150> kit<00:06:08.490> sets<00:06:09.490> sorry<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:11.220> I<00:06:13.110> had<00:06:14.110> an

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
sentiments kit sets sorry and I had an

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.469 
sentiments kit sets sorry and I had an
idea<00:06:14.380> of<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:14.949> layout<00:06:15.250> but<00:06:16.000> it<00:06:16.120> was<00:06:16.210> just<00:06:16.389> a

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
idea of the layout but it was just a

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.670 
idea of the layout but it was just a
case<00:06:16.630> of<00:06:17.400> of<00:06:18.400> putting<00:06:18.880> it<00:06:18.970> together<00:06:19.120> I<00:06:19.680> first

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
case of of putting it together I first

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.189 
case of of putting it together I first
thought<00:06:20.889> I<00:06:21.220> tried<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.729> orange<00:06:22.030> paper<00:06:22.240> in<00:06:22.599> the

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
thought I tried the orange paper in the

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.140 
thought I tried the orange paper in the
background<00:06:23.590> as<00:06:23.740> well<00:06:23.770> as<00:06:24.250> with<00:06:24.639> the<00:06:24.669> Rockets

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
background as well as with the Rockets

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.170 
background as well as with the Rockets
but<00:06:25.659> I<00:06:25.750> didn't<00:06:26.020> really<00:06:26.139> like<00:06:26.349> that<00:06:26.409> look<00:06:27.150> so<00:06:28.150> I

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
but I didn't really like that look so I

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.240 
but I didn't really like that look so I
went<00:06:28.360> through<00:06:28.449> my<00:06:28.690> pad<00:06:28.870> again<00:06:28.990> to<00:06:29.740> choose<00:06:30.009> an

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
went through my pad again to choose an

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.040 
went through my pad again to choose an
alternative<00:06:30.970> I<00:06:31.240> even<00:06:31.630> looked<00:06:31.780> through<00:06:31.960> the

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
alternative I even looked through the

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.809 
alternative I even looked through the
knee<00:06:32.259> highs<00:06:32.440> collection<00:06:33.009> pad<00:06:33.190> to<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.699> see

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
knee highs collection pad to to see

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:34.770 
knee highs collection pad to to see
whether<00:06:34.000> there<00:06:34.180> was<00:06:34.300> something<00:06:34.599> in<00:06:34.659> there

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
whether there was something in there

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.680 
whether there was something in there
that<00:06:34.960> would<00:06:35.050> work<00:06:35.199> I<00:06:37.110> tried<00:06:38.110> them<00:06:38.259> all<00:06:39.449> it<00:06:40.449> was

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
that would work I tried them all it was

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.040 
that would work I tried them all it was
a<00:06:40.720> long<00:06:40.870> process

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
a long process

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.570 
a long process
but<00:06:44.050> eventually<00:06:44.410> i<00:06:44.590> settled<00:06:44.890> on<00:06:44.950> the<00:06:45.070> Reds<00:06:45.310> I

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
but eventually i settled on the Reds I

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.900 
but eventually i settled on the Reds I
like<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:46.330> idea<00:06:46.450> of<00:06:46.660> the<00:06:46.930> rocket<00:06:47.440> being<00:06:47.650> the

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
like the idea of the rocket being the

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.400 
like the idea of the rocket being the
the<00:06:48.910> kind<00:06:49.090> of<00:06:49.120> the<00:06:49.270> only<00:06:49.450> pass<00:06:49.630> that<00:06:50.050> part<00:06:50.260> the

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
the kind of the only pass that part the

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.190 
the kind of the only pass that part the
only<00:06:50.560> pattern<00:06:50.770> on<00:06:51.160> on<00:06:51.700> the<00:06:52.000> card<00:06:52.210> so<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.110> would

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
only pattern on on the card so it would

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.080 
only pattern on on the card so it would
really<00:06:53.350> draw<00:06:53.590> everyone's<00:06:53.920> attention<00:06:53.980> to<00:06:54.490> it

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.780 

so<00:06:58.090> once<00:06:58.240> I<00:06:58.330> chosen<00:06:58.750> that<00:06:58.930> red<00:06:59.200> I<00:06:59.670> could<00:07:00.670> go

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
so once I chosen that red I could go

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
so once I chosen that red I could go
ahead<00:07:00.880> and<00:07:01.000> stamp<00:07:01.480> that<00:07:01.690> sentiments

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.810 

I<00:07:10.900> always<00:07:11.680> stump<00:07:11.980> the<00:07:12.070> sentiments<00:07:12.490> before<00:07:12.790> I

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
I always stump the sentiments before I

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.060 
I always stump the sentiments before I
cut<00:07:13.060> the<00:07:13.150> paper<00:07:13.300> down<00:07:13.600> and<00:07:13.930> this<00:07:14.710> way<00:07:14.889> if<00:07:15.010> I

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
cut the paper down and this way if I

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.409 
cut the paper down and this way if I
make<00:07:15.220> a<00:07:15.250> mistake<00:07:15.370> I've<00:07:15.760> still<00:07:15.970> got<00:07:16.120> lots<00:07:16.270> of

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
make a mistake I've still got lots of

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:22.409 
make a mistake I've still got lots of
paper<00:07:16.630> left<00:07:20.400> and<00:07:21.400> I<00:07:21.490> could<00:07:21.639> probably<00:07:21.850> do<00:07:22.270> the

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
paper left and I could probably do the

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.020 
paper left and I could probably do the
whole<00:07:22.540> card<00:07:22.780> again<00:07:23.550> and<00:07:24.550> without<00:07:24.850> wasting

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
whole card again and without wasting

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.380 
whole card again and without wasting
another<00:07:25.330> whole<00:07:25.540> sheet<00:07:25.750> of<00:07:25.780> paper

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.290 

so<00:07:28.990> there's<00:07:29.170> my<00:07:29.320> sentiment<00:07:29.830> already<00:07:30.310> and<00:07:30.610> it's

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
so there's my sentiment already and it's

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.550 
so there's my sentiment already and it's
finally<00:07:31.630> just<00:07:31.660> time<00:07:31.990> to<00:07:32.020> put<00:07:32.290> the<00:07:32.350> card

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 
finally just time to put the card

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.130 
finally just time to put the card
together<00:07:33.150> the<00:07:34.150> quite<00:07:34.330> a<00:07:34.360> few<00:07:34.480> other<00:07:34.630> details<00:07:34.690> i

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.140 
together the quite a few other details i

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.590 
together the quite a few other details i
added<00:07:35.440> to<00:07:35.560> this<00:07:35.650> card<00:07:35.980> in<00:07:36.280> the<00:07:36.400> end<00:07:36.520> I<00:07:36.850> decided

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:37.600 
added to this card in the end I decided

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.230 
added to this card in the end I decided
to<00:07:38.050> add<00:07:38.200> copious<00:07:38.770> amounts<00:07:39.430> of<00:07:39.490> glossy<00:07:39.850> accents

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 
to add copious amounts of glossy accents

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.620 
to add copious amounts of glossy accents
to<00:07:40.420> that<00:07:40.660> rocket<00:07:41.080> itself<00:07:41.470> I<00:07:41.820> cut<00:07:42.820> out<00:07:42.940> die-cut

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:43.630 
to that rocket itself I cut out die-cut

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.590 
to that rocket itself I cut out die-cut
lots<00:07:43.870> of<00:07:43.990> stars<00:07:44.350> and<00:07:44.790> for<00:07:45.790> the<00:07:45.850> background<00:07:46.030> I

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:46.600 
lots of stars and for the background I

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.210 
lots of stars and for the background I
added<00:07:47.440> some<00:07:47.470> stickles<00:07:47.980> to<00:07:48.160> the<00:07:48.250> stars<00:07:48.580> and<00:07:50.220> was

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.220 
added some stickles to the stars and was

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.220 
added some stickles to the stars and was
left<00:07:51.370> with<00:07:51.550> a<00:07:51.580> lovely<00:07:51.790> shimmery<00:07:52.270> shiny<00:07:52.570> card<00:07:52.990> I

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.230 
left with a lovely shimmery shiny card I

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.440 
left with a lovely shimmery shiny card I
