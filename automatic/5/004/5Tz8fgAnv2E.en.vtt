00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
another option as you can see the right

another option as you can see the right
forms<00:02:00.150> you<00:02:01.150> can<00:02:01.299> also<00:02:01.450> feed<00:02:01.750> them<00:02:01.780> on<00:02:01.960> simians

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
forms you can also feed them on simians

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.160 
forms you can also feed them on simians
such<00:02:02.890> as<00:02:03.070> frogs<00:02:03.369> newts<00:02:04.060> toads<00:02:04.750> and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
such as frogs newts toads and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.920 
such as frogs newts toads and
salamanders<00:02:06.240> although<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.299> do<00:02:07.360> not<00:02:07.600> recommend

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
salamanders although I do not recommend

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.600 
salamanders although I do not recommend
these<00:02:08.200> do<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.530> because<00:02:08.800> they<00:02:08.890> do<00:02:08.950> have<00:02:09.130> toxins

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
these do it because they do have toxins

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.910 
these do it because they do have toxins
as<00:02:09.759> well<00:02:09.940> even<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.390> tadpoles<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.770> only

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
as well even the tadpoles so the only

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.340 
as well even the tadpoles so the only
way<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.220> would<00:02:12.900> recommend<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.050> actually

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
way I would recommend you actually

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.140 
way I would recommend you actually
feeding<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.739> these<00:02:14.890> items<00:02:15.250> as<00:02:15.430> if<00:02:15.910> they<00:02:16.090> were

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
feeding in these items as if they were

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.199 
feeding in these items as if they were
quarantined<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.250> extremely<00:02:18.250> healthy<00:02:18.550> but

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
quarantined and extremely healthy but

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.199 
quarantined and extremely healthy but
still<00:02:19.569> it's<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.290> not<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> best<00:02:21.040> food<00:02:21.880> choice

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
still it's just not the best food choice

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.720 
still it's just not the best food choice
but<00:02:22.630> they<00:02:22.780> will<00:02:22.930> eat<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.280> last<00:02:24.430> thing

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
but they will eat it so the last thing

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.220 
but they will eat it so the last thing
I'll<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:24.910> talking<00:02:25.180> about<00:02:25.450> today<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:25.870> feeder

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
them from your local pet shop then they

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.910 
them from your local pet shop then they
could<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:43.390> lot<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.780> diseases<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.500> toxins

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
could have a lot of diseases and toxins

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.740 
could have a lot of diseases and toxins
since<00:02:45.400> they're<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:45.610> dirty<00:02:46.030> water<00:02:46.150> all<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
since they're in dirty water all the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.610 
since they're in dirty water all the
time<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:49.390> they're<00:02:49.930> always<00:02:50.080> around<00:02:50.470> that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
time and have they're always around that

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.009 
time and have they're always around that
fish<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.040> mean<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.700> isn't<00:02:52.060> exactly<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.720> case

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
fish I mean this isn't exactly the case

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.770 
fish I mean this isn't exactly the case
at<00:02:53.410> Petco<00:02:53.769> or<00:02:54.130> pets<00:02:54.340> Mart<00:02:54.549> but<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.360> never<00:02:55.510> know

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
at Petco or pets Mart but you never know

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.470 
at Petco or pets Mart but you never know
so<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.230> best<00:02:56.380> thing<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.130> do<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:58.000> quarantine

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
so the best thing to do is to quarantine

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.140 
so the best thing to do is to quarantine
them<00:02:58.630> if<00:02:59.560> you<00:03:00.190> don't<00:03:00.310> quarantine<00:03:00.850> your<00:03:00.940> fish

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
them if you don't quarantine your fish

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.940 
them if you don't quarantine your fish

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.319 
hole in the head um fungus and egg so
it's<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.230> better<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.220> make<00:03:09.970> sure<00:03:10.000> that

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
it's just better to make sure that

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.300 
it's just better to make sure that
you're<00:03:10.450> feeding<00:03:10.600> them<00:03:10.840> healthy<00:03:11.260> fish<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.100> they

you're feeding them healthy fish so they

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.620 
you're feeding them healthy fish so they
don't<00:03:12.459> get<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.640> hole<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.940> head<00:03:13.030> like<00:03:13.239> minded

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
brown pellets because it just keeps the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.670 
brown pellets because it just keeps the
tank<00:03:50.049> cleaner<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:51.870> they<00:03:52.870> like<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.319> just<00:03:53.530> the
