a<00:00:08.580> look<00:00:08.820> at<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.630> differences<00:00:10.230> between<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.889> best

skins ever or a zag now at first glance
it's<00:00:15.109> probably<00:00:16.109> pretty<00:00:16.379> difficult<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:17.160> you

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
it's probably pretty difficult for you

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.370 
it's probably pretty difficult for you
to<00:00:17.310> dis<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.970> see<00:00:18.180> or<00:00:18.359> determine<00:00:18.869> which<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.230> is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
to dis to see or determine which one is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.580 
to dis to see or determine which one is
which<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.550> close<00:00:20.580> there's<00:00:21.590> actually

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
which but up close there's actually

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.009 
which but up close there's actually
quite<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:23.369> bit<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.119> difference<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> way

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
quite a bit of difference in the way

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380 
quite a bit of difference in the way
they<00:00:25.199> look<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:26.189> let's<00:00:26.400> go<00:00:26.550> ahead<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.849> show<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
they look so let's go ahead and show you

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.810 
they look so let's go ahead and show you
which<00:00:27.689> ones<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.500> don't<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.609> can

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
which ones which I don't know if you can

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.880 
which ones which I don't know if you can
tell<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.949> let's<00:00:31.949> bring<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:32.550> close<00:00:33.890> see

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
tell but let's bring this up close see

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.139 
tell but let's bring this up close see
how<00:00:34.920> close<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.850> without<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
how close we can get without a

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.510 
how close we can get without a
reflection<00:00:38.600> now<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.800> some<00:00:41.100> dirt<00:00:41.370> on

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
reflection now they do have some dirt on

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.790 
reflection now they do have some dirt on
them<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.000> sort<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.329> thing<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> one

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
them and that sort of thing but the one

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
them and that sort of thing but the one
on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.700> shows<00:00:45.030> more<00:00:45.420> ripple

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
on the right that shows more ripple

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
on the right that shows more ripple
actually<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:47.149> person<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.440> zagg<00:00:49.739> cover<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
actually in person is the zagg cover the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.610 
actually in person is the zagg cover the
one<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> left<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> best<00:00:52.260> consumer

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
one on the left is the best consumer

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.459 
one on the left is the best consumer
obviously<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.600> couple<00:00:54.600> easy<00:00:54.750> ways<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> tell<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
obviously a couple easy ways to tell is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.990 
obviously a couple easy ways to tell is
the<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.039> cut<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.280> around<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> lens

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the way this is cut out around the lens

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.090 
the way this is cut out around the lens
a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:58.199> bit<00:00:58.440> different<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> best

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
a little bit different in the best

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.229 
a little bit different in the best
consumer<00:00:59.460> either<00:01:00.390> way<00:01:00.980> both<00:01:01.980> work<00:01:02.699> well<00:01:02.969> but

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
consumer either way both work well but

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.609 
consumer either way both work well but
they<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.570> different<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.589> are

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
they are different in the way they are

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.210 
they are different in the way they are
applied<00:01:05.420> both<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.720> them<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.799> my<00:01:07.979> wife's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
applied both of them this is my wife's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250 
applied both of them this is my wife's
this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.610> mine<00:01:08.850> she<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> best<00:01:09.810> things<00:01:10.110> ever

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
this is mine she is the best things ever

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.740 
this is mine she is the best things ever
and<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.220> zagged<00:01:11.610> both<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.600> are

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and I have the zagged both of them are

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.499 
and I have the zagged both of them are
very<00:01:13.140> similar<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.580> zagg<00:01:14.880> comes<00:01:15.270> with

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
very similar but the zagg comes with

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.899 
very similar but the zagg comes with
better<00:01:15.840> application<00:01:16.110> tools<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> little

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
better application tools it is a little

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.740 
better application tools it is a little
more<00:01:18.090> pricier<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.890> application

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
more pricier as well so the application

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
more pricier as well so the application
tools<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.990> come<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.650> squeegee<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
tools that come with it are squeegee and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.450 
tools that come with it are squeegee and
some<00:01:24.000> solution<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> best<00:01:25.710> scans<00:01:25.950> ever<00:01:26.159> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
some solution on the best scans ever you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
some solution on the best scans ever you
need<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.759> make<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.090> own<00:01:27.390> solution<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
need to make your own solution it's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.039 
need to make your own solution it's
usually<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.329> bit<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.509> baby<00:01:30.659> soap

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
usually like a a little bit of baby soap

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.270 
usually like a a little bit of baby soap
mixed<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:33.079> some<00:01:34.079> water<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.189> know

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
mixed with some water and then you know

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
mixed with some water and then you know
you<00:01:35.340> don't<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> shake<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.360> kind

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you don't want to shake it and it's kind

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 
you don't want to shake it and it's kind
of<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.290> bit<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.590> pain<00:01:37.799> especially<00:01:38.159> if

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
of a little bit of a pain especially if

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.249 
of a little bit of a pain especially if
you've<00:01:38.610> never<00:01:38.759> done<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> before<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you've never done it before you get the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.569 
you've never done it before you get the
right<00:01:40.380> consistency<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.520> get

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
right consistency so you don't get

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.730 
right consistency so you don't get
bubbles<00:01:42.030> under<00:01:42.270> your<00:01:42.390> screen<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:43.380> you've<00:01:43.560> done

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
bubbles under your screen if you've done

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.940 
bubbles under your screen if you've done
it<00:01:43.799> before<00:01:44.689> or<00:01:45.689> haven't<00:01:46.259> check<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.770> some

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it before or haven't check out some

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
it before or haven't check out some
videos<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.640> I've<00:01:47.970> made<00:01:48.240> or<00:01:48.479> others<00:01:48.780> have

videos that I've made or others have

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
videos that I've made or others have
made<00:01:49.079> showing<00:01:49.860> how<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> apply<00:01:50.310> because<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.729> is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
made showing how to apply because it is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.819 
made showing how to apply because it is
a<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.060> trickier<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.990> also<00:01:52.140> does<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.560> come

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
a bit trickier it also does not come

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.620 
a bit trickier it also does not come

but<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.110> looks<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.740> take<00:01:58.979> pretty

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but it looks like they will take pretty

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.800 
but it looks like they will take pretty
good<00:01:59.250> care<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.299> did<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.689> an

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
good care of you if you did have an

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.590 
good care of you if you did have an
issue<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.520> side<00:02:02.820> let's<00:02:03.149> take<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> look

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
issue so on this side let's take a look

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.990 
issue so on this side let's take a look
at<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> sides<00:02:04.170> because<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> covers<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.729> work

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
at the sides because the covers do work

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.300 
at the sides because the covers do work
a<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.329> bit<00:02:06.509> differently<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.979> zagg

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
a little bit differently on the zagg

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.010 
a little bit differently on the zagg
I'll<00:02:08.700> bring<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> up<00:02:09.149> close<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.629> moment<00:02:09.989> but

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
I'll bring it up close in a moment but

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.140 
I'll bring it up close in a moment but
I'm<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> zagg

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
I'm the zagg

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.300 
I'm the zagg
you<00:02:11.329> have<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> cover<00:02:11.900> little<00:02:12.799> individual

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
you have a cover little individual

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.130 
you have a cover little individual
pieces<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.909> between<00:02:14.269> so<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.599> have<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> long

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
pieces in between so you have a long

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.530 
pieces in between so you have a long
strip<00:02:15.560> here<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.579> like<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.879> do<00:02:17.000> here<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
strip here just like you do here and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.940 
strip here just like you do here and
then<00:02:17.659> you<00:02:17.720> have<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:18.110> piece<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.920> piece

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
then you have a piece here and a piece

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.460 
then you have a piece here and a piece
here<00:02:19.430> on<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:20.420> best<00:02:20.689> skins<00:02:20.959> are<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.439> a

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
here on the best skins are you have a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.530 
here on the best skins are you have a
piece<00:02:21.709> here<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.549> piece<00:02:22.579> here<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.239> nothing

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
piece here and a piece here but nothing

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.449 
piece here and a piece here but nothing
in<00:02:23.659> between<00:02:23.750> let's<00:02:24.709> see<00:02:24.829> if<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:24.980> bring<00:02:25.250> that

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
in between let's see if I can bring that

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.380 
in between let's see if I can bring that
up<00:02:25.489> close<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.400> refocus<00:02:29.000> it'll<00:02:29.239> take<00:02:29.359> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
up close have it refocus it'll take a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.649 
up close have it refocus it'll take a
second<00:02:30.549> let<00:02:31.549> me<00:02:31.579> bring<00:02:31.819> my<00:02:31.970> hand<00:02:32.239> up<00:02:32.390> here<00:02:32.540> to

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
second let me bring my hand up here to

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.369 
second let me bring my hand up here to
refocus<00:02:32.989> there<00:02:33.409> we<00:02:33.590> go<00:02:34.840> okay<00:02:35.840> there<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.200> think

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
refocus there we go okay there I think

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.369 
refocus there we go okay there I think
we<00:02:36.620> can<00:02:36.769> see<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.069> now<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:37.879> you<00:02:37.970> can<00:02:38.120> see<00:02:38.450> there

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
we can see it now so you can see there

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.640 
we can see it now so you can see there
is<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> piece<00:02:40.519> here<00:02:40.849> and<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.209> piece<00:02:41.239> here<00:02:41.780> well

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
is a piece here and a piece here well

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.470 
is a piece here and a piece here well
there's<00:02:42.829> nothing<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.250> between<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:44.209> makes

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
there's nothing in between this makes

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.410 
there's nothing in between this makes
for<00:02:44.569> easier<00:02:44.989> install<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.700> zagg<00:02:47.090> has

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
for easier install but the zagg has

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.830 
for easier install but the zagg has
better<00:02:47.690> protection<00:02:48.409> overall<00:02:48.799> so<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:50.450> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
better protection overall so on the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.110 
better protection overall so on the
front<00:02:51.230> they<00:02:51.530> look<00:02:51.739> identical<00:02:51.920> but<00:02:52.459> there's

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
front they look identical but there's

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.670 
front they look identical but there's
less<00:02:54.459> ripple<00:02:55.459> or<00:02:55.549> orange<00:02:55.939> peel<00:02:56.150> effect<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:56.720> the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
less ripple or orange peel effect on the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.399 
less ripple or orange peel effect on the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
bit thicker application or the material

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.339 
bit thicker application or the material
feels<00:03:04.159> a<00:03:04.280> little<00:03:04.400> thicker<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.139> little

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.530 
feels a little thicker and it's a little
more<00:03:06.470> slippery<00:03:06.859> like<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.340> real<00:03:07.639> face<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.299> the

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
microphone this one just goes up to the

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.500 
microphone this one just goes up to the
microphone<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.430> actually<00:03:43.819> this<00:03:43.970> piece<00:03:44.239> fell

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
microphone and actually this piece fell

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.119 
microphone and actually this piece fell
off<00:03:44.569> but<00:03:45.019> there<00:03:45.139> was<00:03:45.290> just<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.620> piece<00:03:45.859> right

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
off but there was just a piece right

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.069 
off but there was just a piece right
here<00:03:47.650> now<00:03:48.650> on<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:48.919> bottom<00:03:49.400> baskins<00:03:50.359> ever<00:03:50.569> also

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
here now on the bottom baskins ever also

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.189 
here now on the bottom baskins ever also
has<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.290> better<00:03:51.500> protection<00:03:52.129> and<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.810> reason<00:03:54.109> I

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
has a better protection and the reason I

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.990 
has a better protection and the reason I
say<00:03:54.229> that<00:03:54.440> is<00:03:54.620> because<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:55.010> goes<00:03:55.129> around<00:03:55.250> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
say that is because it goes around the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.289 
say that is because it goes around the
speaker<00:03:56.690> holes<00:03:56.900> zagg<00:03:57.829> comes<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.459> stop<00:03:58.790> right

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
speaker holes zagg comes to a stop right

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.240 
speaker holes zagg comes to a stop right
here<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.629> here<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.590> can<00:04:00.709> see<00:04:00.919> a<00:04:00.949> little<00:04:01.129> bit

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
here and here you can see a little bit

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.689 
here and here you can see a little bit

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.820 
of give you a quick comparison of the
two<00:05:28.070> since<00:05:28.460> I've<00:05:28.610> installed<00:05:28.970> both<00:05:29.330> I

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
two since I've installed both I

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.100 
two since I've installed both I
currently<00:05:30.830> have<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.190> Baskins<00:05:31.640> ever<00:05:31.820> on<00:05:32.000> my<00:05:32.210> on

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
currently have a Baskins ever on my on

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.300 
currently have a Baskins ever on my on
my<00:05:33.170> iPad<00:05:33.950> and<00:05:34.160> it<00:05:34.730> seems<00:05:35.000> to<00:05:35.090> work<00:05:35.210> pretty<00:05:35.660> well

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
my iPad and it seems to work pretty well

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.510 
my iPad and it seems to work pretty well
I'm<00:05:37.310> happy<00:05:37.670> with<00:05:37.940> either<00:05:38.120> or<00:05:38.420> I<00:05:38.690> think<00:05:39.520> overall

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
I'm happy with either or I think overall

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.909 
I'm happy with either or I think overall
ease<00:05:41.300> of<00:05:41.540> install<00:05:41.960> may<00:05:42.200> be<00:05:42.260> a<00:05:42.380> consideration

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
ease of install may be a consideration

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.290 
ease of install may be a consideration
for<00:05:43.310> some<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.640> if<00:05:43.700> that's<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.030> case<00:05:44.180> you

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
for some and if that's the case you

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.950 
for some and if that's the case you
might<00:05:44.419> want<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.630> go<00:05:44.750> zeg<00:05:45.050> more<00:05:45.890> pieces<00:05:46.310> but

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
might want to go zeg more pieces but

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.120 
might want to go zeg more pieces but
actually<00:05:47.960> easier<00:05:48.290> because<00:05:48.500> they're<00:05:48.830> smaller

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
actually easier because they're smaller

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.270 
actually easier because they're smaller
pieces<00:05:49.460> so<00:05:50.380> it's<00:05:51.380> really<00:05:51.620> up<00:05:51.770> for<00:05:52.040> you<00:05:52.160> to

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
pieces so it's really up for you to

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.940 
pieces so it's really up for you to
decide<00:05:52.690> but<00:05:53.690> they're<00:05:53.870> both<00:05:54.020> decent<00:05:54.530> products

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
decide but they're both decent products

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.200 
decide but they're both decent products
so<00:05:55.070> check<00:05:55.280> them<00:05:55.400> out<00:05:55.520> but<00:05:55.730> want<00:05:55.910> to<00:05:56.000> hopefully

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
so check them out but want to hopefully

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.150 
so check them out but want to hopefully
give<00:05:56.570> you<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.690> good<00:05:56.930> comparison<00:05:57.320> of<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.680> two<00:05:57.740> if

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
give you a good comparison of the two if

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.070 
give you a good comparison of the two if
you<00:05:58.580> haven't<00:05:58.940> used<00:05:59.120> either<00:05:59.390> of<00:05:59.600> them<00:05:59.720> before

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
you haven't used either of them before

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.950 
you haven't used either of them before
on<00:06:00.290> the<00:06:00.410> iphone<00:06:00.770> 4<00:06:01.100> this<00:06:01.880> is<00:06:02.090> aaron<00:06:02.360> i'll<00:06:02.720> see

check<00:06:05.600> out<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.620> bumper<00:06:07.340> actually<00:06:07.669> had<00:06:07.790> a

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
check out the bumper actually had a

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.520 
check out the bumper actually had a
question<00:06:08.030> about<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.570> will<00:06:08.750> a<00:06:08.780> bumper<00:06:09.230> fit

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
question about this will a bumper fit

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.090 
question about this will a bumper fit
with<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.950> zagg<00:06:10.190> case<00:06:10.460> on<00:06:10.700> i<00:06:11.440> think<00:06:12.440> so<00:06:12.650> let's

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
with the zagg case on i think so let's

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.680 
with the zagg case on i think so let's
try<00:06:13.400> it<00:06:13.490> out<00:06:13.640> I<00:06:13.669> haven't<00:06:14.090> tried<00:06:14.210> it<00:06:14.330> and<00:06:14.600> it's

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
try it out I haven't tried it and it's

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.010 
try it out I haven't tried it and it's
going<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:14.840> be<00:06:14.960> tricky<00:06:15.169> not<00:06:15.680> to<00:06:16.690> yeah<00:06:17.690> looks

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
going to be tricky not to yeah looks

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.980 
going to be tricky not to yeah looks
like<00:06:18.110> it<00:06:18.260> fits<00:06:18.530> just<00:06:18.919> fine<00:06:19.040> a<00:06:19.430> little<00:06:20.419> bit<00:06:20.540> snug

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.390 

better<00:06:23.990> than<00:06:24.230> the<00:06:24.350> I<00:06:24.380> carbons<00:06:25.010> around<00:06:25.280> the

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
better than the I carbons around the

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.690 
better than the I carbons around the
side<00:06:25.610> kind<00:06:26.360> of<00:06:26.450> indented<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.340> feel<00:06:28.340> you<00:06:28.370> may

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
side kind of indented the feel you may

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.220 
side kind of indented the feel you may
want<00:06:28.940> to<00:06:29.000> leave<00:06:29.150> the<00:06:29.330> sides<00:06:29.600> off<00:06:29.870> if<00:06:30.110> you're

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
want to leave the sides off if you're

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.810 
want to leave the sides off if you're
doing<00:06:30.500> this<00:06:30.620> just<00:06:30.800> to<00:06:31.220> give<00:06:31.370> it<00:06:31.400> a<00:06:31.520> little<00:06:31.669> bit

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
doing this just to give it a little bit

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.790 
doing this just to give it a little bit
better<00:06:31.940> feel<00:06:32.300> through<00:06:32.539> the<00:06:32.570> buttons<00:06:32.960> but<00:06:33.620> yeah

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
with the case it's going to work the

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.589 
with the case it's going to work the
same<00:06:38.500> on<00:06:38.710> this<00:06:38.860> no<00:06:39.729> problem<00:06:40.090> there<00:06:40.120> i'm<00:06:40.360> sure
