this becomes all you need to have

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.260 
this becomes all you need to have
wireless<00:01:37.770> audio<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.490> television<00:01:38.790> set

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
an Xbox Playstation 3 I don't think the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.250 
an Xbox Playstation 3 I don't think the
Roku<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.060> well-suited<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.690> this<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.109> guess

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
Roku is well-suited to this but I guess

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.490

for<00:03:35.410> some<00:03:35.470> very<00:03:36.100> casual<00:03:36.880> gaming<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.260> might

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
for some very casual gaming this might

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.810 
for some very casual gaming this might
be<00:03:38.709> ok

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
be ok

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.210 
be ok
