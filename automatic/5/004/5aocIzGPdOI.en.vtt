00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
until you hit the ribcage and now you
can<00:01:13.799> feel<00:01:14.010> me<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.400> around<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.790> ribcage

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
can feel me going around the ribcage

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.570 
can feel me going around the ribcage
here<00:01:15.350> like<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.560> once<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.250> around<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
here like that once you get around the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
here like that once you get around the
ribcage<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.150> poke<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.509> through<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
ribcage just poke it right through and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.620 
ribcage just poke it right through and
bring<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> right<00:01:20.189> along<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bring it right along to the back of the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.730 
bring it right along to the back of the
tail<00:01:22.040> like<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.170> remove<00:01:25.590> this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
tail like that now do not remove this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
tail like that now do not remove this
fillet<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:28.009> one<00:01:29.009> tip<00:01:29.280> leave<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.270> fillet

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
fillet that is one tip leave that fillet

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.510 
fillet that is one tip leave that fillet
on<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> does<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.310> helps

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
on there because what it does it helps

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.819 
on there because what it does it helps
balance<00:01:32.670> off<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.210> fish<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.229> allows<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
balance off your fish and it allows you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.080 
balance off your fish and it allows you
to<00:01:35.460> remove<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.060> fillet<00:01:36.470> very<00:01:37.470> easily

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
to remove the other fillet very easily

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.240 
to remove the other fillet very easily
typically<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.270> would<00:01:39.360> happen<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
typically what would happen is if you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.179 
typically what would happen is if you
take<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.820> other<00:01:41.850> fillet<00:01:42.329> off<00:01:42.829> you'll<00:01:43.829> find

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
take the other fillet off you'll find

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.100 
take the other fillet off you'll find
that<00:01:44.460> you'll<00:01:45.210> cut<00:01:45.450> through<00:01:45.479> these<00:01:45.810> bones

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
that you'll cut through these bones

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380 
that you'll cut through these bones
instead<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.619> alongside<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.210> see

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
instead of alongside them so you can see

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.760 
instead of alongside them so you can see
here<00:01:48.659> I've<00:01:48.899> cut<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> way<00:01:49.500> through<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
here I've cut all the way through the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.499 
here I've cut all the way through the
ribcage<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:50.790> behind<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.329> ribcage

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
ribcage so just go behind the ribcage

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.950 
ribcage so just go behind the ribcage
like<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.439> again<00:01:53.159> right<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> back<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
like that and again right to the back of

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.190 
like that and again right to the back of
the<00:01:55.049> tail<00:01:55.490> now<00:01:56.490> you're<00:01:57.000> okay<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.540> remove<00:01:57.960> your

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
slits so just cut to the ribcage and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200 
slits so just cut to the ribcage and
then<00:02:00.899> cut<00:02:01.110> around<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.590> ribcage<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.340> then

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
then cut around the ribcage and then

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.300 
then cut around the ribcage and then
down<00:02:03.509> along<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.140> side<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> ribcage<00:02:04.680> like

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
down along the side of the ribcage like

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.600 
down along the side of the ribcage like
that<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.329> end<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> fillet

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610
