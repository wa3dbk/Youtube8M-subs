00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
exciting as the World Cup there's a

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.890 
exciting as the World Cup there's a
massive<00:03:11.670> home<00:03:11.970> crowd<00:03:12.270> which<00:03:12.450> should<00:03:12.600> be<00:03:12.690> even

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
massive home crowd which should be even

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.410 
massive home crowd which should be even
more<00:03:13.080> people<00:03:13.230> than<00:03:13.470> there<00:03:13.620> was<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.910> think

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
more people than there was and I think

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300 
more people than there was and I think
you<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:16.019> diving<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.530> your<00:03:16.650> home<00:03:16.769> country

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
you know diving in your home country

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.729 
you know diving in your home country
trying<00:03:18.120> trying<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.840> win<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.019> medal<00:03:19.140> instantly

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
trying trying to win a medal instantly

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.550 
trying trying to win a medal instantly
we<00:03:20.400> were<00:03:20.610> really<00:03:21.480> close<00:03:21.660> with<00:03:21.870> bonds<00:03:22.170> last

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
we were really close with bonds last

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.949 
we were really close with bonds last
time<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.400> think<00:03:23.549> anything<00:03:23.880> above<00:03:24.269> would<00:03:24.780> be

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
time so I think anything above would be

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:25.940 
time so I think anything above would be
also<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.530> great

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
also be great

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.259 
also be great
I'd<00:03:26.040> have<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.430> mean<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.850> Chinese<00:03:27.180> would

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
I'd have to mean that the Chinese would

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.120 
I'd have to mean that the Chinese would
have<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.540> drop<00:03:27.780> because<00:03:28.440> they<00:03:28.560> are<00:03:28.680> pretty<00:03:28.890> far

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
have to drop because they are pretty far

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.520 
have to drop because they are pretty far
ahead<00:03:29.250> first<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.239> win<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.450> gold<00:03:30.660> but<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.230> know
