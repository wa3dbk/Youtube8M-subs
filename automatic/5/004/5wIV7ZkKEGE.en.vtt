we're<00:00:47.610> at<00:00:47.870> 1635<00:00:48.870> I'm<00:00:49.230> hoping<00:00:49.649> today<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.219> can

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we're at 1635 I'm hoping today we can

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.799 
we're at 1635 I'm hoping today we can
hit<00:00:50.550> around<00:00:50.730> maybe<00:00:52.129> 1750<00:00:53.129> maybe<00:00:53.370> 1800<00:00:53.820> we'll

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
hit around maybe 1750 maybe 1800 we'll

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
hit around maybe 1750 maybe 1800 we'll
just<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.379> happens<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:56.460> right

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
just have to see what happens all right

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.950 
just have to see what happens all right
so<00:00:56.699> let's<00:00:56.850> go<00:00:56.969> ahead<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.149> attack<00:00:57.390> base<00:00:57.660> number

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so let's go ahead and attack base number

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.779 
so let's go ahead and attack base number
one<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.320> looks<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.920> Richard<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> K

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
one it looks like it's Richard with a K

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.709 
one it looks like it's Richard with a K
or<00:00:59.820> Ricard

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
or Ricard

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
or Ricard
but<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.680> base<00:01:01.920> looks<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.699> pretty

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
but this base looks like it's pretty

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
but this base looks like it's pretty
good<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.390> attack<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> giant<00:01:04.320> healer

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
good to attack with the giant healer

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
good to attack with the giant healer
strategy<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.240> say<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.570> you're

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
strategy so like I say when you're

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.390 
strategy so like I say when you're
deciding<00:01:06.990> which<00:01:07.619> air<00:01:07.830> defense<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> want<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
deciding which air defense you want to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.590 
deciding which air defense you want to
take<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.880> lightning<00:01:09.060> spells<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
take out with your lightning spells in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.179 
take out with your lightning spells in
this<00:01:09.750> case<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.200> guy<00:01:10.320> has<00:01:10.530> two<00:01:10.710> air<00:01:10.890> defense

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
this case this guy has two air defense

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.850 
this case this guy has two air defense
he<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> left<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.560> walls

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
he is this one on the left and the walls

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.890 
he is this one on the left and the walls
the<00:01:14.220> way<00:01:14.369> they're<00:01:14.580> put<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.720> they're

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the way they're put are the way they're

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.840 
the way they're put are the way they're
placed<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.560> think<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> would<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.340> tough<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.759> my

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
placed I think it would be tough for my

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
placed I think it would be tough for my
wall<00:01:18.060> breakers<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> reach<00:01:18.689> them<00:01:18.930> whereas<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
wall breakers to reach them whereas the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.980 
wall breakers to reach them whereas the
walls<00:01:19.590> right<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.030> two<00:01:21.270> layers<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
walls right here it's just two layers of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
walls right here it's just two layers of
walls<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.470> drop<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:22.799> wall<00:01:22.950> breakers<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
walls I can drop two wall breakers to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.710 
walls I can drop two wall breakers to
break<00:01:23.549> through<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.850> wall<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.390> did<00:01:24.570> right

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
break through this wall like I did right

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.450 
break through this wall like I did right
now<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.590> drop<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> other<00:01:26.189> two

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
now and then I can drop the other two

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.499 
now and then I can drop the other two
and<00:01:26.700> they're<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.060> able<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and they're going to be able to get to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.240 
and they're going to be able to get to
that<00:01:27.630> air<00:01:27.750> defense<00:01:28.049> right<00:01:28.200> away<00:01:28.439> where's<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that air defense right away where's the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
that air defense right away where's the
one<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> left<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.240> probably<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:30.840> have

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
one on the left it probably would have

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.569 
one on the left it probably would have
been<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> little<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.590> difficult<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
been a little bit more difficult to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.310 
been a little bit more difficult to
break<00:01:32.939> through<00:01:33.240> those<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> way<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
break through those I think the way the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.020 
break through those I think the way the
walls<00:01:34.619> were<00:01:34.799> set<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.189> might<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.549> had<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
walls were set up I might have had to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
walls were set up I might have had to
drop<00:01:36.270> six<00:01:36.900> wall<00:01:37.079> breakers<00:01:37.409> instead<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.829> four

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
drop six wall breakers instead of four

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.980 
drop six wall breakers instead of four
wall<00:01:38.250> breakers<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.780> side

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
wall breakers it's just that this side

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.300 
wall breakers it's just that this side
was<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.500> bit<00:01:40.619> easier<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:41.100> why<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
was a little bit easier that's why I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.819 
was a little bit easier that's why I
attacked<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.110> point<00:01:43.320> my<00:01:43.439> Giants

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
attacked it so at this point my Giants

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.830 
attacked it so at this point my Giants
are<00:01:43.920> doing<00:01:44.159> pretty<00:01:44.640> well<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> guys

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
are doing pretty well and if you guys

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
are doing pretty well and if you guys
noticed<00:01:46.409> look<00:01:46.680> above<00:01:46.979> my<00:01:47.159> Archer<00:01:47.490> Queen<00:01:47.700> icon

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
noticed look above my Archer Queen icon

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.490 
noticed look above my Archer Queen icon
you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:48.570> see<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.200> mouse

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you can actually see a little mouse

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
you can actually see a little mouse
thing<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> before<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.060> guys<00:01:51.149> ask<00:01:51.420> I'm<00:01:51.630> not

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
thing and before you guys ask I'm not

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.069 
thing and before you guys ask I'm not
playing<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.200> my<00:01:52.320> PC<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> actually<00:01:53.159> record<00:01:54.079> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
playing on my PC I actually record the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780 
playing on my PC I actually record the
clash<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.470> clans<00:01:55.710> through<00:01:55.979> my<00:01:56.100> PC<00:01:56.490> through<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
clash of clans through my PC through a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.789 
clash of clans through my PC through a
screen<00:01:57.149> capture<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.810> for<00:01:58.259> some<00:01:58.409> reason<00:01:58.710> my

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
screen capture and for some reason my

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.800 
screen capture and for some reason my
mouse<00:01:59.070> got<00:01:59.369> stuck<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.759> screen<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
mouse got stuck on the screen so if you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.719 
mouse got stuck on the screen so if you
guys<00:02:00.899> haven't<00:02:01.110> noticed<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.530> already<00:02:01.680> uh<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
guys haven't noticed that already uh I

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
guys haven't noticed that already uh I
guess<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.390> probably<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.020> made<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> look<00:02:04.409> at

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
guess I probably just made you look at

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.330 
guess I probably just made you look at
it<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:04.860> you're<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> probably

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it and now you're going to probably

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.770 
it and now you're going to probably
stare<00:02:05.700> at<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> rest<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> episode

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
stare at it for the rest of the episode

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.650 
stare at it for the rest of the episode
but<00:02:06.930> when<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> saw<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.680> annoyed<00:02:07.979> me<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.220> much

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
but when I saw it it annoyed me so much

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.850 
but when I saw it it annoyed me so much
but<00:02:09.660> unfortunately<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.259> didn't<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.709> till

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
but unfortunately I didn't see it till

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.790 
but unfortunately I didn't see it till
after<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> start

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
after I start

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800 
after I start
recording<00:02:12.280> good<00:02:12.400> anyways<00:02:12.820> let's<00:02:13.480> go<00:02:13.630> ahead

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
recording good anyways let's go ahead

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.420 
recording good anyways let's go ahead
and<00:02:13.900> keep<00:02:13.990> raiding<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.500> still<00:02:14.740> have<00:02:14.860> about<00:02:14.950> 40

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and keep raiding I still have about 40

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.920 
and keep raiding I still have about 40
troops<00:02:15.700> left<00:02:15.910> as<00:02:16.120> well<00:02:16.300> as<00:02:16.360> my<00:02:16.510> king<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.810> my

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
troops left as well as my king and my

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.510 
troops left as well as my king and my
queen<00:02:17.200> my<00:02:17.440> Giants<00:02:17.800> are<00:02:17.890> doing<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.220> pretty<00:02:18.430> good

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
queen my Giants are doing a pretty good

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.400 
queen my Giants are doing a pretty good
job<00:02:18.640> they<00:02:19.600> just<00:02:19.630> made<00:02:19.930> their<00:02:20.080> way<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
job they just made their way to the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.710 
job they just made their way to the
center<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.640> think<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:21.970> gonna<00:02:22.060> hold<00:02:22.270> off<00:02:22.450> on

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
center and I think I'm gonna hold off on

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.300 
center and I think I'm gonna hold off on
dropping<00:02:23.080> most<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.590> rest<00:02:23.740> of<00:02:23.830> my<00:02:23.920> archers

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
dropping most of the rest of my archers

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.340 
dropping most of the rest of my archers
until<00:02:24.820> my<00:02:25.090> Giants<00:02:25.540> make<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.960> those<00:02:26.050> last

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
until my Giants make it to those last

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.680 
until my Giants make it to those last
couple<00:02:26.440> defenses<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.120> what<00:02:28.240> I'm<00:02:28.330> planning<00:02:28.450> on

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
couple defenses so what I'm planning on

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.080 
couple defenses so what I'm planning on
doing<00:02:28.750> my<00:02:29.470> Giants<00:02:29.860> are<00:02:29.980> still<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.640> guess<00:02:30.850> doing

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
doing my Giants are still I guess doing

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.490 
doing my Giants are still I guess doing
pretty<00:02:31.270> well<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.510> think<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.840> have<00:02:31.990> half<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.380> them

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
pretty well I think I have half of them

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.680 
pretty well I think I have half of them
left<00:02:32.710> once<00:02:33.400> they<00:02:33.580> reach<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:33.880> wizard<00:02:34.480> tower

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
left once they reach that wizard tower

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.630 
left once they reach that wizard tower
on<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:34.990> top<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.650> think<00:02:35.980> they<00:02:36.370> should<00:02:36.610> be

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
on the top I think they should be

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.370 
on the top I think they should be
distracting<00:02:37.330> all<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.810> defenses<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.350> the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
distracting all of the defenses in the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.500 
distracting all of the defenses in the
base<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.920> once<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.280> happens<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.330> start

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
base and once that happens I can start

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.420 
base and once that happens I can start
dropping<00:02:40.840> my<00:02:40.930> archers<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> outside<00:02:42.130> and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
dropping my archers on the outside and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.070 
dropping my archers on the outside and
they<00:02:42.550> can<00:02:42.700> take<00:02:42.910> care<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.480> barracks<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080

can stop drop I can start dropping my
archers<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:03.730> because<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.630> fact<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
archers and because of the fact that the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.630 
archers and because of the fact that the
cannons<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.650> archer<00:03:05.980> tower<00:03:06.280> are

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
cannons and the archer tower are

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.340 
cannons and the archer tower are
shooting<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> giant<00:03:07.510> my<00:03:07.600> archers<00:03:08.020> should<00:03:08.230> be

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
shooting the giant my archers should be

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.320 
shooting the giant my archers should be
untouched<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:09.100> they<00:03:09.790> should<00:03:10.000> be<00:03:10.090> able<00:03:10.180> to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
untouched and they should be able to

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.240 
untouched and they should be able to
clean<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.690> buildings<00:03:11.020> on<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.140> outside<00:03:11.250> so

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
clean up the buildings on the outside so

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.740 
clean up the buildings on the outside so
that's<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:12.550> going<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.820> help<00:03:12.910> save<00:03:13.180> time<00:03:13.210> in

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
that's just going to help save time in

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.750 
that's just going to help save time in
the<00:03:14.110> end<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.620> don't<00:03:14.860> have<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.190> have<00:03:15.610> my

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the end so I don't have to have my

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.310 
the end so I don't have to have my
Giants<00:03:16.180> walk<00:03:16.330> all<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.600> way<00:03:16.630> around<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.200> in

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
Giants walk all the way around and in

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.199 
Giants walk all the way around and in
this<00:03:17.470> case<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.950> looks<00:03:18.580> like<00:03:18.790> they<00:03:18.970> were<00:03:19.030> able

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
this case it looks like they were able

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.490 
this case it looks like they were able
to<00:03:19.360> take<00:03:19.570> care<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.780> all<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.020> buildings<00:03:20.320> on<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
to take care of all the buildings on the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500 
to take care of all the buildings on the
outside<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.220> after<00:03:21.459> these<00:03:21.730> ones<00:03:21.940> go<00:03:22.090> down<00:03:22.300> we

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
outside and after these ones go down we

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.540 
outside and after these ones go down we
should<00:03:22.690> be<00:03:22.780> good<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.959> go<00:03:23.220> all<00:03:24.220> right<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:24.430> after

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
should be good to go all right so after

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.400 
should be good to go all right so after
we<00:03:24.730> shoot<00:03:24.820> down<00:03:24.880> these<00:03:25.120> final<00:03:25.360> two<00:03:25.390> cannons<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
we shoot down these final two cannons it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.540 
we shoot down these final two cannons it
looks<00:03:26.620> like<00:03:26.770> I<00:03:26.800> guess<00:03:27.040> we're<00:03:27.190> missing<00:03:27.459> a

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
looks like I guess we're missing a

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.040 
looks like I guess we're missing a
builder's<00:03:27.880> Hut<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.450> right-hand<00:03:28.810> side<00:03:29.020> so

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
builder's Hut on the right-hand side so

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.630 
builder's Hut on the right-hand side so
I<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.320> drop<00:03:29.590> my<00:03:29.709> barbarian<00:03:30.160> king<00:03:30.340> for<00:03:30.520> that

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
I can drop my barbarian king for that

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.340 
I can drop my barbarian king for that
but<00:03:31.180> that's<00:03:31.390> gonna<00:03:31.510> do<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:31.900> this<00:03:31.959> raid<00:03:32.170> we

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
looking for another base that was pretty

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.290 
looking for another base that was pretty
weak<00:03:47.800> when<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.160> comes<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.610> air<00:03:48.760> defense<00:03:49.060> and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
weak when it comes to air defense and

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.820 
weak when it comes to air defense and
this<00:03:49.450> guy<00:03:49.600> again<00:03:49.989> he<00:03:50.170> only<00:03:50.410> has<00:03:50.500> two<00:03:50.680> air

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
this guy again he only has two air

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.040 
this guy again he only has two air
defense<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.370> one<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.090> them<00:03:52.239> is<00:03:52.480> in<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.660> center

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
defense and one of them is in the center

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.960 
defense and one of them is in the center
in<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.800> center<00:03:53.830> whereas<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.520> other<00:03:54.670> one<00:03:54.940> is

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
in the center whereas the other one is

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.390 
in the center whereas the other one is
on<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.300> outside<00:03:55.390> so<00:03:56.100> obviously<00:03:57.100> I'm<00:03:57.220> going<00:03:57.310> to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
on the outside so obviously I'm going to

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.770 
on the outside so obviously I'm going to
shoot<00:03:57.550> down<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:57.760> one<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.239> center<00:03:58.600> and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
shoot down that one in the center and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.750 
shoot down that one in the center and
then<00:03:59.020> from<00:03:59.320> here<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.370> just<00:04:00.400> draw<00:04:00.640> my

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.910 
then from here I can just draw my
archers<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.360> start<00:04:01.630> dropping<00:04:02.110> my<00:04:02.350> dragons

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
archers and start dropping my dragons

follow with my dragons alright so it

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.909

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
looks like I dropped those guys in the

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.170 
looks like I dropped those guys in the
bottom<00:04:24.250> looking<00:04:24.520> at<00:04:24.640> where<00:04:24.789> all<00:04:24.820> someone

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
bottom looking at where all someone

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.270 
bottom looking at where all someone
to<00:04:25.210> drop<00:04:25.389> my<00:04:25.509> other<00:04:25.660> two<00:04:25.870> dragons<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.530> usually

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
to drop my other two dragons I usually

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.950 
to drop my other two dragons I usually
look<00:04:27.520> for<00:04:27.580> Archer<00:04:28.090> towers<00:04:28.449> that<00:04:28.630> are<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.840> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
look for Archer towers that are on the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.409 
look for Archer towers that are on the
outside<00:04:29.289> so<00:04:29.710> say<00:04:29.979> you<00:04:30.610> see<00:04:30.759> that<00:04:30.880> elixir<00:04:31.120> pump

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
outside so say you see that elixir pump

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.840 
outside so say you see that elixir pump
on<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.840> far<00:04:32.050> right<00:04:32.289> say<00:04:33.009> if<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.370> was<00:04:33.639> an

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
on the far right say if that was an

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.790 
on the far right say if that was an
archer<00:04:34.330> tower<00:04:34.539> I'd<00:04:34.840> probably<00:04:35.139> drop<00:04:35.440> one<00:04:35.650> of<00:04:35.740> my

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
archer tower I'd probably drop one of my

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.040 
archer tower I'd probably drop one of my
dragons<00:04:36.039> there<00:04:36.460> just<00:04:37.150> because<00:04:37.449> you<00:04:37.840> want<00:04:38.020> to

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
dragons there just because you want to

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.779 
dragons there just because you want to
make<00:04:38.199> sure<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.770> take<00:04:39.070> care<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.490> archer

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
make sure you take care of the archer

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.640 
make sure you take care of the archer
towers<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.270> know<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.110> archer<00:04:41.350> towers

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
towers I know that the archer towers

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.900 
towers I know that the archer towers
take<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.830> long<00:04:42.070> time<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.460> take<00:04:42.580> care<00:04:42.759> of<00:04:42.820> the

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
take a long time to take care of the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.129 
take a long time to take care of the
dragon<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:43.419> if<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.660> leave<00:04:43.870> them<00:04:44.110> just

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
dragon but if you leave them just

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.020 
dragon but if you leave them just
hanging<00:04:44.860> around<00:04:45.100> there<00:04:45.280> usually<00:04:45.490> they<00:04:45.789> can<00:04:45.850> do

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
hanging around there usually they can do

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.879 
hanging around there usually they can do
a<00:04:46.060> pretty<00:04:46.330> good<00:04:46.479> amount<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:46.750> damage<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.229> they

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
a pretty good amount of damage and they

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.800 
a pretty good amount of damage and they
can<00:04:48.070> definitely<00:04:48.520> take<00:04:48.699> down<00:04:48.880> one<00:04:49.300> dragon<00:04:49.690> by

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
can definitely take down one dragon by

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.310 
can definitely take down one dragon by
itself

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
itself

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.110 
itself
all<00:04:51.250> right<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.490> right<00:04:51.610> now<00:04:51.699> we're<00:04:51.850> sitting<00:04:51.940> at

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
all right so right now we're sitting at

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.820 
all right so right now we're sitting at
58%<00:04:52.539> they're<00:04:52.990> shooting<00:04:53.289> for<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.470> Town<00:04:53.650> Hall

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
58% they're shooting for the Town Hall

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.409 
58% they're shooting for the Town Hall
my<00:04:54.039> minions<00:04:54.370> are<00:04:54.460> doing<00:04:54.669> really<00:04:54.880> good<00:04:55.090> damage

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
my minions are doing really good damage

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.960 
my minions are doing really good damage
on<00:04:55.570> that<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:56.100> we're<00:04:57.100> at<00:04:57.220> about<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.460> minute<00:04:57.880> and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
on that and we're at about a minute and

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.670 
on that and we're at about a minute and
fifty<00:04:58.360> five<00:04:58.479> seconds<00:04:58.960> so<00:04:59.020> I'm<00:04:59.110> not<00:04:59.259> really<00:04:59.440> too

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
fifty five seconds so I'm not really too

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.290 
fifty five seconds so I'm not really too
worried<00:04:59.949> about<00:05:00.009> the<00:05:00.220> time<00:05:00.430> especially<00:05:00.910> when

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
worried about the time especially when

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.790 
worried about the time especially when
it<00:05:01.419> comes<00:05:01.539> to<00:05:01.690> like<00:05:01.870> townhall<00:05:02.349> seven<00:05:02.680> and

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
it comes to like townhall seven and

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.790 
it comes to like townhall seven and
below<00:05:03.099> you<00:05:03.160> usually<00:05:03.490> don't<00:05:04.000> run<00:05:04.240> out<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.449> time

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
below you usually don't run out of time

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.779 
below you usually don't run out of time
because<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.009> fact<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.340> there<00:05:06.610> really

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
because of the fact that there really

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.820 
because of the fact that there really
aren't<00:05:07.120> too<00:05:07.419> many<00:05:07.449> defensive<00:05:08.169> buildings<00:05:08.590> and

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
aren't too many defensive buildings and

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.589 
aren't too many defensive buildings and
it<00:05:09.610> looks<00:05:09.759> like<00:05:09.880> we<00:05:10.000> should<00:05:10.030> be<00:05:10.240> able<00:05:10.389> to<00:05:10.479> do

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
it looks like we should be able to do

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.540 
it looks like we should be able to do
this<00:05:10.720> one<00:05:10.900> with<00:05:11.020> ease<00:05:11.259> he's<00:05:11.889> run<00:05:12.130> out<00:05:12.160> of<00:05:12.280> air

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
this one with ease he's run out of air

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.249 
this one with ease he's run out of air
defense<00:05:12.880> he's<00:05:13.210> run<00:05:13.479> out<00:05:13.509> of<00:05:13.630> Archer<00:05:13.960> towers

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
defense he's run out of Archer towers

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.020 
defense he's run out of Archer towers
Tesla's<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.370> this<00:05:15.490> one's<00:05:15.669> going<00:05:15.759> to<00:05:15.820> be<00:05:15.940> an

let's go ahead and move on to the next
one<00:05:26.979> and<00:05:27.220> see<00:05:27.490> if<00:05:27.669> we<00:05:27.789> can<00:05:27.970> do<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.150> same<00:05:28.330> exact

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
archer towers on the top so it'll be

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.180

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:45.119 
sort of a high level rating strategy

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:46.369 
sort of a high level rating strategy

doing a pretty good job you can see the

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:01.669 
doing a pretty good job you can see the
air<00:06:59.969> defense<00:07:00.269> did<00:07:00.659> do<00:07:00.839> a<00:07:00.869> lot<00:07:01.139> of<00:07:01.169> work<00:07:01.439> on<00:07:01.559> my

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:01.679 
air defense did do a lot of work on my

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:03.469 
air defense did do a lot of work on my
dragons<00:07:02.129> it's<00:07:02.279> taking<00:07:02.639> care<00:07:02.819> of<00:07:02.879> pretty<00:07:03.360> much

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
dragons it's taking care of pretty much

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.600 
dragons it's taking care of pretty much
all<00:07:03.839> of<00:07:03.899> them<00:07:04.139> that's<00:07:05.039> why<00:07:05.189> you<00:07:05.249> don't<00:07:05.429> want<00:07:05.550> to

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
all of them that's why you don't want to

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.309 
all of them that's why you don't want to
leave<00:07:05.729> an<00:07:05.819> air<00:07:05.969> defense<00:07:06.119> even<00:07:06.869> if<00:07:07.080> it's<00:07:07.199> only

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 
leave an air defense even if it's only

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.290 
leave an air defense even if it's only
level<00:07:07.589> 4<00:07:07.679> attacking<00:07:08.429> your<00:07:08.550> dragon<00:07:08.939> so<00:07:09.149> it

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
level 4 attacking your dragon so it

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.519 
level 4 attacking your dragon so it
looks<00:07:09.479> like<00:07:09.539> most<00:07:09.749> of<00:07:09.929> those<00:07:10.050> guys<00:07:10.259> are<00:07:10.439> going

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:10.529 
looks like most of those guys are going

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:12.649 
looks like most of those guys are going
to<00:07:10.619> go<00:07:10.739> down<00:07:10.919> but<00:07:11.219> I<00:07:11.279> did<00:07:11.909> drop<00:07:12.089> my<00:07:12.239> king<00:07:12.509> my

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659 
to go down but I did drop my king my

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.259 
to go down but I did drop my king my
queen<00:07:12.929> on<00:07:13.169> the<00:07:13.289> bottom<00:07:13.739> and<00:07:13.949> I<00:07:14.550> think<00:07:15.149> they

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:15.269 
queen on the bottom and I think they

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:16.999 
queen on the bottom and I think they
should<00:07:15.479> be<00:07:15.599> able<00:07:15.689> to<00:07:15.779> wrap<00:07:15.929> this<00:07:16.139> one<00:07:16.289> up<00:07:16.349> even

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:17.009 
should be able to wrap this one up even

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:18.350 
should be able to wrap this one up even
though<00:07:17.129> most<00:07:17.309> of<00:07:17.459> my<00:07:17.519> dragons<00:07:17.939> are<00:07:18.029> going<00:07:18.209> down

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
though most of my dragons are going down

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.790 
though most of my dragons are going down
my<00:07:18.539> king<00:07:18.749> and<00:07:18.809> my<00:07:18.929> queen<00:07:19.229> should<00:07:19.469> be<00:07:19.589> able<00:07:19.739> to

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
my king and my queen should be able to

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.319 
my king and my queen should be able to
break<00:07:19.949> through<00:07:20.099> the<00:07:20.219> walls<00:07:20.399> and<00:07:20.639> that's<00:07:21.179> gonna

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:21.329 
break through the walls and that's gonna

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:22.850 
break through the walls and that's gonna
let<00:07:21.509> us<00:07:21.659> get<00:07:21.869> a<00:07:22.050> hundred<00:07:22.289> percent<00:07:22.499> on<00:07:22.739> this

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
let us get a hundred percent on this

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.279 
let us get a hundred percent on this
rate<00:07:23.069> so<00:07:23.999> in<00:07:24.119> total<00:07:24.269> this<00:07:24.539> guy<00:07:24.689> had<00:07:24.869> a<00:07:24.899> ton<00:07:25.259> of

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.289 
rate so in total this guy had a ton of

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:27.439 
rate so in total this guy had a ton of
trophies<00:07:25.739> he<00:07:25.889> had<00:07:25.979> 34<00:07:26.550> available<00:07:27.059> I<00:07:27.179> think

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449 
trophies he had 34 available I think

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:28.909 
trophies he had 34 available I think
that's<00:07:27.599> like<00:07:27.809> the<00:07:27.929> maximum<00:07:28.319> you<00:07:28.589> can<00:07:28.739> get

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
that's like the maximum you can get

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.549 
that's like the maximum you can get
without<00:07:29.249> revenge<00:07:29.579> someone<00:07:30.119> at<00:07:31.079> least<00:07:31.409> like

00:07:31.549 --> 00:07:31.559 
without revenge someone at least like

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:32.809
