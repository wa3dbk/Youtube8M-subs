you

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.120 

basically<00:00:19.939> what<00:00:20.150> you<00:00:20.329> have<00:00:20.359> is<00:00:20.539> a<00:00:20.800> every<00:00:21.800> every

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
basically what you have is a every every

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.429 
basically what you have is a every every
board<00:00:22.720> normally<00:00:23.720> will<00:00:23.869> have<00:00:23.989> some<00:00:24.199> sort<00:00:24.380> of

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
board normally will have some sort of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.810 
board normally will have some sort of
prominent<00:00:24.859> and<00:00:24.949> some<00:00:25.130> more<00:00:25.279> distinct<00:00:25.730> than

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
prominent and some more distinct than

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.700 
prominent and some more distinct than
others<00:00:26.089> and<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.480> crown<00:00:26.750> is<00:00:26.989> where<00:00:27.259> you<00:00:27.529> have<00:00:27.679> a

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
others and the crown is where you have a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.419 
others and the crown is where you have a
top<00:00:28.989> will<00:00:29.989> actually<00:00:30.380> kind<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:30.710> do<00:00:31.070> kind<00:00:31.279> of<00:00:31.309> a

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
top will actually kind of do kind of a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.209 
top will actually kind of do kind of a
curve<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:32.719> if<00:00:32.809> you<00:00:32.899> can<00:00:33.050> sight<00:00:33.320> down<00:00:33.589> the

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
curve and so if you can sight down the

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.740 
curve and so if you can sight down the
boards<00:00:34.730> what<00:00:34.969> you<00:00:35.120> want<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.360> do<00:00:35.449> is<00:00:35.540> you<00:00:35.600> want

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
boards what you want to do is you want

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.569 
boards what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:35.809> keep<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.110> Crown's<00:00:36.440> all<00:00:36.860> facing<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.460> same

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
to keep the Crown's all facing the same

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.420 
to keep the Crown's all facing the same
direction<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.479> in<00:00:39.470> this<00:00:39.649> case<00:00:39.890> it's<00:00:40.100> best<00:00:40.309> to

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
direction and in this case it's best to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.520 
direction and in this case it's best to
have<00:00:40.519> them<00:00:40.850> on<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.089> floor<00:00:41.600> joist<00:00:41.899> situation

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
have them on a floor joist situation

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.469 
have them on a floor joist situation
it's<00:00:42.649> best<00:00:42.829> to<00:00:42.890> have<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.250> crown<00:00:43.460> up<00:00:43.760> because

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
it's best to have the crown up because

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.780 
it's best to have the crown up because
if<00:00:44.690> they're<00:00:44.870> bellied<00:00:45.199> out<00:00:45.350> then<00:00:46.010> you'll<00:00:46.220> you

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
if they're bellied out then you'll you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.369 
if they're bellied out then you'll you
get<00:00:46.970> water<00:00:47.180> standing<00:00:47.750> on<00:00:47.870> your<00:00:47.989> deck<00:00:48.199> or

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
get water standing on your deck or

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.750 
get water standing on your deck or
whatever<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:48.860> if<00:00:48.949> you<00:00:49.040> just<00:00:49.219> threw<00:00:49.519> them<00:00:49.640> on

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
whatever and if you just threw them on

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.570 
whatever and if you just threw them on
any<00:00:49.969> old<00:00:50.149> way<00:00:50.360> then<00:00:50.659> you<00:00:50.809> would<00:00:50.960> have<00:00:51.280> crown<00:00:52.280> up

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
any old way then you would have crown up

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.060 
any old way then you would have crown up
one<00:00:52.909> down<00:00:53.150> one<00:00:53.720> up<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.049> then<00:00:54.619> you<00:00:54.799> would<00:00:54.949> have

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
one down one up and then you would have

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.160 
one down one up and then you would have
waving<00:00:55.640> but<00:00:56.299> if<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:56.540> have<00:00:56.689> everything<00:00:56.960> from

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
waving but if you have everything from

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.960 
waving but if you have everything from
the<00:00:57.589> same<00:00:57.799> way<00:00:58.009> that's<00:00:58.309> that's<00:00:58.729> a<00:00:58.820> good

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
the same way that's that's a good

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.490 
the same way that's that's a good
building<00:00:59.269> practice<00:00:59.720> because<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.049> means<00:01:00.259> you

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
building practice because that means you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.530 
building practice because that means you
you're<00:01:01.100> going<00:01:01.220> to<00:01:01.309> have<00:01:01.460> your<00:01:02.210> whole<00:01:02.330> deck

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
you're going to have your whole deck

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.439 
you're going to have your whole deck
surface<00:01:03.500> will<00:01:03.890> be<00:01:04.369> consistent<00:01:05.059> on<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.360> way

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
surface will be consistent on the way

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.350 
surface will be consistent on the way
across<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.140> sight<00:01:06.530> down<00:01:06.909> in<00:01:07.909> this<00:01:08.000> case

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
across so you sight down in this case

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.960 
across so you sight down in this case
it's<00:01:08.840> real<00:01:09.020> hard<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.259> see<00:01:09.500> but<00:01:09.790> these<00:01:10.790> are

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
it's real hard to see but these are

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.310 
it's real hard to see but these are
actually<00:01:11.270> pretty<00:01:11.390> straight<00:01:11.780> but<00:01:11.990> this<00:01:12.140> one's

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
actually pretty straight but this one's

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.830 
actually pretty straight but this one's
actually<00:01:12.560> crown<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.670> going<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:14.329> way<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:14.600> it's

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
actually crown is going this way so it's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.710 
actually crown is going this way so it's
balanced<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:15.380> want<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:16.040> crown<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.520> go<00:01:16.720> up

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
balanced so you want the crown to go up

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.320 
balanced so you want the crown to go up
so<00:01:18.079> this<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:19.040> one's<00:01:19.280> up<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:20.570> this<00:01:20.720> one<00:01:22.330> this

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
so this this one's up and this one this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.590 
so this this one's up and this one this
one<00:01:23.570> is<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:24.710> one's<00:01:24.920> off<00:01:25.100> here<00:01:25.370> see<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.360> when

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
one is this one's off here see so when

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.240 
one is this one's off here see so when
we<00:01:26.750> go<00:01:26.870> to<00:01:26.900> put<00:01:27.140> them<00:01:27.229> on<00:01:28.090> go<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.150> set<00:01:29.840> them

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
we go to put them on go to set them

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.170 
we go to put them on go to set them
you'll<00:01:31.250> set<00:01:31.580> them<00:01:31.820> just<00:01:32.720> like<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:34.030> facing<00:01:35.030> up

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
you'll set them just like so facing up

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.160 
you'll set them just like so facing up
this<00:01:35.870> crown<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.229> up<00:01:37.000> what<00:01:38.000> would<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.120> do<00:01:38.240> in<00:01:38.930> some

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
this crown is up what would I do in some

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.260 
this crown is up what would I do in some
construction<00:01:39.770> I<00:01:40.100> don't<00:01:40.700> tend<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.909> do<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.150> in

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
construction I don't tend to do it in

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.490 
construction I don't tend to do it in
decks<00:01:41.510> because<00:01:41.780> you'll<00:01:41.960> see<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.290> from

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
decks because you'll see it from

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.350 
decks because you'll see it from
underneath<00:01:42.799> especially<00:01:43.640> like<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:43.790> high<00:01:44.090> deck

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
underneath especially like a high deck

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.090 
underneath especially like a high deck
or<00:01:44.570> something<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:45.229> on<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.530> low<00:01:45.710> deck<00:01:45.950> you

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
or something but on this low deck you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.130 
or something but on this low deck you
won't<00:01:46.280> see<00:01:46.520> anything<00:01:46.810> but<00:01:47.810> in<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:47.960> lot<00:01:48.110> of

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
won't see anything but in a lot of

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.230 
won't see anything but in a lot of
normal<00:01:48.979> construction<00:01:49.340> with<00:01:49.670> joist

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
normal construction with joist

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.500 
normal construction with joist
I'll<00:01:50.690> put<00:01:51.409> an<00:01:51.500> arrow<00:01:52.060> just<00:01:53.060> make<00:01:53.210> an<00:01:53.330> arrow

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
I'll put an arrow just make an arrow

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.200 
I'll put an arrow just make an arrow
pointing<00:01:54.140> up<00:01:54.260> and<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.890> will<00:01:55.070> be<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:56.030> upside

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
pointing up and that will be the upside

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.880 
pointing up and that will be the upside
of<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.659> crown<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.110> that's<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.500> that's<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
of the crown and that's the that's the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.440 
of the crown and that's the that's the
way<00:01:58.040> we<00:01:58.220> want<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.400> make<00:01:58.549> these<00:01:58.670> boards<00:01:58.729> go

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
way we want to make these boards go

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.330 
way we want to make these boards go
so<00:01:59.750> these<00:02:00.650> boards<00:02:01.010> go<00:02:01.159> up<00:02:01.340> crown<00:02:02.180> goes<00:02:02.479> up

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
so these boards go up crown goes up

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.850 
so these boards go up crown goes up
on<00:02:03.970> every<00:02:04.420> single<00:02:04.630> joist<00:02:04.990> going<00:02:05.320> across<00:02:05.530> so

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
on every single joist going across so

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.430 
on every single joist going across so
everything's<00:02:06.220> consistent
