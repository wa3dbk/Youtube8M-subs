00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
first but yeah and I think that's an

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
first but yeah and I think that's an
important<00:01:08.850> signing<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.330> them<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.540> look<00:01:09.689> at

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
important signing for them you look at

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.810 
important signing for them you look at
what<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.770> terms<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.220> under

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
what they have in terms of under

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.340 
what they have in terms of under
contract<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.420> corner<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:12.930> next<00:01:13.200> year

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
contract that corner back next year

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
contract that corner back next year
obviously<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> three<00:01:14.490> rookies<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:14.939> drafted

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
obviously the three rookies they drafted

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.510 
obviously the three rookies they drafted
last<00:01:15.720> year<00:01:16.020> Ron<00:01:16.320> Barr<00:01:16.530> tell<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> veteran<00:01:17.340> guy

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
last year Ron Barr tell a veteran guy

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.310 
last year Ron Barr tell a veteran guy
you<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.000> Chris<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.540> was<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> big<00:01:18.930> part<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.259> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you know Chris it was a big part of that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
you know Chris it was a big part of that
and<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:19.830> adding<00:01:20.430> Glover<00:01:21.090> Quinn

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and I think now adding Glover Quinn

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
and I think now adding Glover Quinn
that's<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.820> improvement<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> their

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that's just a improvement to their

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.749 
that's just a improvement to their
secondary<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.619> they're<00:01:25.830> instantly<00:01:26.520> better

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
secondary and they're instantly better

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.310 
secondary and they're instantly better
well<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> don't<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.810> changes<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
well I don't know if it changes the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.690 
well I don't know if it changes the
draft<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.710> mean<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.369> wanted<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
draft I mean you think if they wanted a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.010 
draft I mean you think if they wanted a
cornerback<00:01:30.030> let's<00:01:30.390> say<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.600> wanted<00:01:30.810> Dean

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
cornerback let's say they wanted Dean

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.870 
cornerback let's say they wanted Dean
Miller<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.130> nuts<00:01:32.369> we're<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.700> saying

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
Miller just the nuts we're not saying

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880 
Miller just the nuts we're not saying
they<00:01:33.000> did<00:01:33.150> okay<00:01:33.390> hold<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.689> over<00:01:33.990> there<00:01:34.110> don't

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
they did okay hold on over there don't

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.039 
they did okay hold on over there don't
know<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:36.060> suppose<00:01:36.329> they<00:01:36.479> were<00:01:36.540> focused<00:01:36.960> on

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
know but suppose they were focused on

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.390 
know but suppose they were focused on
Milner<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> fifth<00:01:37.860> pick<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.220> who<00:01:38.280> they

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
Milner with the fifth pick and who they

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.740 
Milner with the fifth pick and who they
could<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.729> him<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.479> wouldn't

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
could get him you think they wouldn't

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170 
could get him you think they wouldn't
take<00:01:39.960> him<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.409> they<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:41.850> don't<00:01:42.030> think

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
take him now because they I don't think

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.160 
take him now because they I don't think
so<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:42.810> either

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
so I don't either

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.600 
so I don't either
I'm<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.710> saying<00:01:43.950> that's<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> guy<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I'm not saying that's the guy but I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
I'm not saying that's the guy but I
don't<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.270> wanted<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.049> defensive

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
don't think if they wanted a defensive

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.870 
don't think if they wanted a defensive
end<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.040> Jason<00:01:47.369> Jones<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.729> now

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
end now they got Jason Jones if now

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.069 
end now they got Jason Jones if now
they're<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.119> gonna<00:01:48.240> draft<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.630> defense<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
they're not gonna draft a defense of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.600 
they're not gonna draft a defense of
that<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:49.649> what<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> does<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that but I think what it does is it

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
that but I think what it does is it
gives<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> options<00:01:51.149> yeah<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.840> know<00:01:51.930> now

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
gives you options yeah you know now

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
gives you options yeah you know now
you're<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.619> may<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.920> pigeonholed<00:01:53.610> into

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you're not may be pigeonholed into

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.120 
you're not may be pigeonholed into
taking<00:01:54.360> D<00:01:54.479> Milner<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.799> your

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
taking D Milner because of what you your

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
taking D Milner because of what you your
current<00:01:56.340> situation<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.719> play<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
current situation is so it can play that

not a third down back to he's not a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.580 
not a third down back to he's not a
change<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.210> pace<00:02:30.360> he<00:02:30.540> does<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.080> but<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.500> think

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
change of pace he does that but I think

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.650 
change of pace he does that but I think
he<00:02:31.740> proved<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.190> Miami<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.730> he<00:02:33.240> can<00:02:33.450> carry

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
he proved in Miami that he can carry

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.110 
he proved in Miami that he can carry
someone<00:02:33.990> just<00:02:34.560> too<00:02:34.770> he's<00:02:35.070> not<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.580> their

someone just too he's not just their
dumb<00:02:36.330> back<00:02:36.540> not<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.470> weight<00:02:38.190> element

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
dumb back not just a weight element

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.520 
dumb back not just a weight element
right<00:02:39.000> he<00:02:39.420> could<00:02:39.570> play<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.840> first<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.200> second

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
