00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
minutes of runtime it's hard to really

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.300 
minutes of runtime it's hard to really
get<00:03:21.300> bored<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:21.990> thing<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.800> radio<00:03:23.070> range

showed<00:03:50.070> they<00:03:50.910> like<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.240> spin<00:03:51.510> out<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> bit<00:03:51.960> but

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
showed they like to spin out a bit but

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.050 
showed they like to spin out a bit but
hey<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.100> still<00:03:53.370> looks<00:03:53.640> pretty<00:03:53.790> cool<00:03:56.060> the

futuristic<00:04:02.670> kind<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:02.940> car<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.680> steering

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
futuristic kind of car the steering

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.160 
futuristic kind of car the steering
could<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.340> been<00:04:05.460> a<00:04:05.490> little<00:04:05.760> better<00:04:05.930> was<00:04:06.930> kind

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
could have been a little better was kind

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.620 
could have been a little better was kind
of<00:04:07.520> sloppy<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.850> loose<00:04:09.030> but<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:12.450> got<00:04:12.570> to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
of sloppy and loose but like you got to

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.350 
of sloppy and loose but like you got to
just<00:04:12.900> judge<00:04:13.230> your<00:04:13.470> turns<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.640> actually<00:04:15.060> if

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
you want to do a tighter turn got to

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.610 
you want to do a tighter turn got to
slow<00:04:17.700> down<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:18.270> not<00:04:18.420> use<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.720> turbo<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.230> was

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
slow down and not use the turbo I was

I<00:04:21.420> got<00:04:21.630> well<00:04:22.230> over<00:04:22.500> 10<00:04:22.680> minutes<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:23.040> runtime<00:04:23.220> on

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
I got well over 10 minutes of runtime on

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.390 
I got well over 10 minutes of runtime on
it<00:04:23.840> transmitter<00:04:24.840> it's<00:04:25.530> really<00:04:26.010> great<00:04:26.220> like

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
it transmitter it's really great like

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.950 
it transmitter it's really great like
they<00:04:26.550> just<00:04:26.790> they<00:04:27.060> got<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.300> designed<00:04:27.630> for<00:04:27.810> like

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
they just they got it designed for like

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.700 
they just they got it designed for like
little<00:04:28.290> kid<00:04:28.500> little<00:04:28.710> hands<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.870> does<00:04:31.050> fit<00:04:31.260> an
