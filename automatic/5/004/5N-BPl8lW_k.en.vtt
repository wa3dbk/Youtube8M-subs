00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
what was our core interest that got us

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
what was our core interest that got us
involved<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.360> stuff<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> first

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
involved in this stuff in the first

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.440 
involved in this stuff in the first
place<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.890> also<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.580> we<00:00:47.640> did<00:00:47.880> on<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.150> is<00:00:48.330> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
place and also what we did on this is we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
place and also what we did on this is we
double<00:00:48.810> the<00:00:48.840> magnets<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.620> partnering<00:00:50.160> here

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
double the magnets I'm partnering here

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.110 
double the magnets I'm partnering here
with<00:00:50.670> BTL<00:00:51.240> transparent<00:00:52.200> to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> dcs<00:00:53.160> digital

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
with BTL transparent to the dcs digital

with BTL transparent to the dcs digital
system<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.750> amplifiers<00:00:55.380> has<00:00:55.800> changed<00:00:56.250> quite

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
system this amplifiers has changed quite

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.460 
system this amplifiers has changed quite
a<00:00:56.490> bit<00:00:56.580> sonically<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.900> we've<00:00:58.080> got<00:00:58.260> more

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
a bit sonically I think we've got more

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.040 
a bit sonically I think we've got more
refinement<00:00:59.100> more<00:00:59.640> dynamics<00:01:00.210> i<00:01:00.360> would<00:01:00.510> say<00:01:00.720> at

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
refinement more dynamics i would say at

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
refinement more dynamics i would say at
pence<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> broad<00:01:02.070> broad<00:01:02.579> brushstrokes

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
pence with a broad broad brushstrokes

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.680 
pence with a broad broad brushstrokes
we've<00:01:04.079> got<00:01:04.259> a<00:01:04.290> classic<00:01:05.030> platform<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
we've got a classic platform I like to

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.810 
we've got a classic platform I like to
say<00:01:06.900> we've<00:01:07.620> improved<00:01:07.980> it<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.250> refined<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
say we've improved it and refined it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020 
say we've improved it and refined it
with<00:01:09.420> quieter<00:01:10.200> groans<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.890> board<00:01:11.670> layouts

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
with quieter groans and board layouts

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.410 
with quieter groans and board layouts
and<00:01:12.920> most<00:01:13.920> recently<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.610> came<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and most recently we came up with I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.540 
and most recently we came up with I
think<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.050> unique<00:01:16.380> odor<00:01:16.620> bias<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.280> fault

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
think a unique odor bias and fault

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.020 
think a unique odor bias and fault

to me being connected to those end users
I<00:01:51.530> thought<00:01:51.710> I'd<00:01:51.830> be<00:01:51.920> peppered<00:01:52.220> with<00:01:52.250> questions

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
I thought I'd be peppered with questions

that<00:01:52.850> would<00:01:52.910> exhaust<00:01:53.210> me<00:01:53.480> and<00:01:54.290> wouldn't<00:01:55.220> have

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
that would exhaust me and wouldn't have

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.680 
that would exhaust me and wouldn't have
a<00:01:55.400> lot<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.730> do<00:01:55.820> with<00:01:55.850> explaining<00:01:56.480> what<00:01:56.570> my

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
a lot to do with explaining what my

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.900 
a lot to do with explaining what my
product<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.170> about<00:01:57.460> instead<00:01:58.460> what<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.670> found

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
product is about instead what I found

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.560
