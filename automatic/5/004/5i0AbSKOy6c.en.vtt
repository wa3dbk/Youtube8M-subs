00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 childhood of all i'm natalya nevzorova and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.259
 today as promised and i'm doing a review 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.660
 new 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.509
 eyeliner pencils from the series to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.120
 I'll show you all 4 now 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 colors and we'll see how much they are 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.060
 good for feathering that is how much 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.230
 they stand and it says here that 99 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.859
 percent of women 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.640
 the hardness of the pencil was here 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.580
 twisting rod of pencil 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 which does not require honing ie 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.809
 how do you define pencils by color 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.350
 right here on their tips 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.420
 drawn shades that is when choosing 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 You can even pay attention to it if 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.610
 you take pencils from a consultant 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.770
 Well, and just as the numbers we start with 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.329
 black color 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.219
 traditional black pencil now we 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.960
 we will test them all 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.789
 pushing the rod that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.309
 notably he advances and 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.070
 moves back and we let's now 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.430
 try to draw it and thin 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430
 line 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.890
 if you pay attention then very 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.580
 light touch is very clear 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.370
 contoured line that is which can be 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.750
 to draw 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.740
 that is, if you use for example 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.440
 the pencils 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.970
 like shadows and let's try now 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.520
 I take this special shade 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.770
 brush with so almost 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.060
 like a rubber tip she 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.790
 there is a mini set 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:40.509
 and now let's try to see how 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:42.640
 they hang out i see i 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.540
 would say not very well they 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.540
 shade 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.520
 children still this pencil more 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.800
 belongs to the category of resistant pencils 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.420
 even though he gently draws but not very 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.880
 well shaded that is here 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.820
 note 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.320
 without effort I press 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.039
 but the pencil remains and now we 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.689
 check resistance 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:19.140
 that is, I press hard but 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:21.180
 the pencil remains ie we can 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.720
 really take it to the category 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.560
 persistent pencil whether eyeliner next 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:37.600
 the color that we look at is blue 315 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:41.540
 58 and black 315 57 shade of blue 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.300
 get a shade show midnight 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.330
 blue is very similar to see 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.530
 the next shade khaki common people 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.590
 can be called green turns out 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:59.930
 almost almost under the black 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.010
 there is so dark green here 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.010
 so here it looks 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.849
 so here is 315 59 khaki 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.989
 green is another shade of plum 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.080
 about which 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:21.400
 when you saw the photos taken in 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.500
 my group in contact people said that 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.060
 it is more brown in color 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.760
 but in fact he really 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.780
 100% plum that is, look 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:36.580
 shade so dark plum 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.950
 pretty decent here directory 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.310
 still written arrows or smokey and 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.800
 spectacular look from in you and here 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.380
 Here's a Vita drawn pencil shading 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.340
 but let's see if he does 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.350
 resistant then it is necessary to shade it 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.340
 the first application, that is, when the first 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.590
 once applied, that is, then and 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.930
 shaded 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.330
 here we are now caused him because he is very 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.270
 gently draws very cool quality 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:13.270
 the pencil is just amazing and now 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:16.600
 let's go right now while he is not frozen yet 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.760
 locked we try it 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.360
 shade here pay attention then 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.730
 there is if you apply it and immediately 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.310
 feathered it can be smokey 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:32.110
 effect that is, if you have some 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:35.910
 time is already fixed note 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:41.470
 already smokey effect is obtained 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:44.350
 not good enough here's the difference in 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.270
 how can you get smokey effect 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.120
 here here generally see no longer 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.640
 it is shaded practically I think that 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.860
 you will pick up some of this for yourself 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.830
 I want to draw your attention that now I 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.100
 you have a little hand with soap and i have left 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.580
 from pencils such a line is therefore better 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.340
 Of course, make-up take off somehow 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.410
 waterproof agent 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.870
 that is, see here and so it remains 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.240
 I washed my hand with soap 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.199
