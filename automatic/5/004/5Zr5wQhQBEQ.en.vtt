00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.230
 all the good time of day is short 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:16.070
 construction video report 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:22.679
 the mountain looks like this 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:36.270
 so he there he is a little not put on here 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:41.040
 such is the view from the outside everything is closed 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.160
 metal roof profile also made of metal 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.160
 profile 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.210
 since I already wrote articles 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:06.589
 diagram 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:06.589
 workshop done but here 10 no 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.190
 metal profile will be here too cellular 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.440
 carb in addition to this will be the door here 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:24.420
 the gate here's the garage here the door is the most 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:29.330
 power-saw will speak like that but we speak 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.330
 and so what we have inside 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:42.750
 then Christina will be sheathed 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:44.850
 close now point down here 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:52.370
 we have instead of the foundation 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.370
 stepchildren stepchildren 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.859
 a square pipe runs along the perimeter 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.219
 square tube 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.380
 we have from this at the junction 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.680
 11 one side is welded the other when 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.930
 large so that if that was possible 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:25.860
 disassemble and so here are welded son 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:30.829
 us pipe and also it's all bolted so 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.829
 on top there is a pipe of smaller diameter 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.239
 corners 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.239
 here is such a plan 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.400
 one did wrong daws did 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.989
 the other side wanted rustic 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.690
 skip inside 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:57.889
 but then I thought if water is warming it 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:04.920
 all metal will be like this 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:06.440
 such a plan is all temporary 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.849
 rack 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.000
 which will be removed hang small 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.769
 dry up and because all built 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.530
 in winter, well, if not in winter and spring, but already 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:25.370
 anyway she was sleet in this 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.370
 year there were a lot of such a plan 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.760
 once again and partitions in 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:46.700
 Here at the moment it turned out like that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:51.730
 construction of all what leave 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:59.140
