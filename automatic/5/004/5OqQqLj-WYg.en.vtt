outside of Shelton Washington we're
gonna<00:01:26.390> dig<00:01:26.720> some<00:01:26.930> zeolites<00:01:27.610> actually<00:01:28.610> we're

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
gonna dig some zeolites actually we're

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.039 
gonna dig some zeolites actually we're
gonna<00:01:28.790> pound<00:01:29.210> them<00:01:29.390> out<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.659> wall<00:01:29.840> it's

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
gonna pound them out of the wall it's

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.730 
gonna pound them out of the wall it's
gonna<00:01:30.200> take<00:01:30.500> sledge<00:01:31.159> hammers<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.759> chisels

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
gonna take sledge hammers and chisels

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.520 
gonna take sledge hammers and chisels
it's<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.799> hardhat<00:01:34.160> area<00:01:34.220> I'm<00:01:34.820> ready<00:01:35.290> but<00:01:36.290> let's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
it's a hardhat area I'm ready but let's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.010 
it's a hardhat area I'm ready but let's
see<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:36.860> is<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.370> crescent<00:01:37.880> formation<00:01:38.780> which

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
see this is the crescent formation which

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.290 
see this is the crescent formation which
is<00:01:39.050> underwater<00:01:40.010> basalts<00:01:40.760> that<00:01:40.910> come<00:01:41.060> up<00:01:41.210> in

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
is underwater basalts that come up in

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.110 
is underwater basalts that come up in
pillows<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.050> then<00:01:42.950> they'll<00:01:43.100> have<00:01:43.250> bugs<00:01:43.670> or

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
pillows and then they'll have bugs or

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.670 
pillows and then they'll have bugs or
cavities<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:44.960> that's<00:01:45.110> where<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.409> zeolite

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
cavities and that's where the zeolite

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.980 
cavities and that's where the zeolite
crystals<00:01:46.280> grow<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.610> there<00:01:46.790> they'll<00:01:47.390> be<00:01:47.420> sprays

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
crystals grow in there they'll be sprays

00:01:47.990 --> 00:02:07.630 
crystals grow in there they'll be sprays
needles<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.760> let's<00:01:50.390> go<00:01:50.570> find<00:01:50.810> some<00:01:51.020> zeolites

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.240 

okay<00:02:08.640> here's<00:02:08.850> an<00:02:09.000> example<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.600> some<00:02:09.840> zeolites

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
okay here's an example of some zeolites

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.950 
okay here's an example of some zeolites
you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.580> needle<00:02:11.820> crystals<00:02:12.420> growing

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
you can see the needle crystals growing

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.290 
you can see the needle crystals growing
out<00:02:13.170> they<00:02:13.890> tend<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.220> get<00:02:14.340> brown<00:02:14.700> really<00:02:14.910> fast

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
out they tend to get brown really fast

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.730 
out they tend to get brown really fast
as<00:02:15.570> soon<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.840> they're<00:02:15.990> into<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.320> rain<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
as soon as they're into the rain and the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.520 
as soon as they're into the rain and the
weather<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.700> these<00:02:17.880> are<00:02:18.060> still<00:02:18.300> real<00:02:18.510> fresh<00:02:18.840> so

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
weather so these are still real fresh so

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.130 
weather so these are still real fresh so
see<00:02:19.950> light<00:02:20.190> hunting<00:02:20.490> is<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.610> real<00:02:21.090> side<00:02:21.720> shoot

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
see light hunting is a real side shoot

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.810 
see light hunting is a real side shoot
of<00:02:22.290> keep<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> collecting<00:02:23.130> minerals<00:02:23.370> because

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
of keep it collecting minerals because

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.220 
of keep it collecting minerals because
you<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.300> really<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> good

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
you have to really be a good

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.440 
you have to really be a good
mineralogist<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.250> identify<00:02:26.910> some<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.240> these

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
mineralogist to identify some of these

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
what they were and unfortunately you

later<00:04:24.860> we<00:04:25.130> were<00:04:25.370> studying<00:04:25.669> this<00:04:26.300> material<00:04:26.600> and

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
later we were studying this material and

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.830 
later we were studying this material and
found<00:04:27.410> out<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.830> didn't<00:04:28.100> have<00:04:28.280> any<00:04:28.640> cleavage<00:04:29.180> it

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
found out it didn't have any cleavage it

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.460 
found out it didn't have any cleavage it
didn't<00:04:30.169> break<00:04:30.500> like<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.700> pothole<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.300> should<00:04:32.720> so

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
didn't break like a pothole I should so

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.550 
didn't break like a pothole I should so
I<00:04:33.560> gave<00:04:33.979> it<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.370> someone<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.360> x-ray<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.289> find

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
I gave it to someone to x-ray it to find

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.450 
I gave it to someone to x-ray it to find
out<00:04:36.710> what<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:37.039> is

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
out what it is

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.110 
out what it is
and<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:38.060> turned<00:04:38.300> out<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.510> be<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.810> new<00:04:39.020> specie<00:04:39.620> and

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
and it turned out to be a new specie and

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.670 
and it turned out to be a new specie and
eventually<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.390> was<00:04:41.539> named<00:04:41.780> after<00:04:42.020> me<00:04:42.410> for

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
eventually that was named after me for

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.879 
eventually that was named after me for
the

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
the

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.679 
the

so we're at the we're at a second Z
light<00:06:04.200> pit<00:06:05.200> this<00:06:05.560> is<00:06:05.800> right<00:06:06.220> by<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.540> casino<00:06:07.540> in

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
compared to Robertson's pit it so it's

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.340 
compared to Robertson's pit it so it's
just<00:06:14.710> like<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:15.000> five<00:06:16.000> ten-minute<00:06:16.360> walk<00:06:16.750> up<00:06:17.080> the
