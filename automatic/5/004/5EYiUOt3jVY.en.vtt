00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
to come and try and support is a lie in

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.920 
to come and try and support is a lie in
the<00:01:17.290> center<00:01:17.800> there<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.160> t21<00:01:19.000> was<00:01:19.510> a<00:01:19.570> little

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
the center there that t21 was a little

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.660 
the center there that t21 was a little
bit<00:01:20.020> out<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.140> position<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.770> is<00:01:21.220> about<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.490> be

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
bit out of position and is about to be

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.850 
bit out of position and is about to be
closed<00:01:21.940> in<00:01:22.180> on<00:01:22.300> by<00:01:22.510> a<00:01:22.540> few<00:01:22.960> heavy<00:01:23.170> tanks<00:01:23.619> as<00:01:23.740> you

closed in on by a few heavy tanks as you
can<00:01:24.010> see<00:01:24.220> there<00:01:24.460> so<00:01:24.940> he's<00:01:25.090> really<00:01:25.300> going<00:01:25.510> to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
can see there so he's really going to

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.240

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
and that may come back to bite him in

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.460 
and that may come back to bite him in
the<00:01:36.460> ass<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:38.140> looks<00:01:38.380> like<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.560> t25<00:01:39.220> /<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.240> as<00:01:40.509> now
