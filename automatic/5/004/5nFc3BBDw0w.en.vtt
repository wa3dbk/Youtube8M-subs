00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
demo / project now here we are defusing

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.440 
demo / project now here we are defusing
a<00:01:14.319> dummy<00:01:14.740> bomb<00:01:14.950> with<00:01:15.310> our<00:01:15.549> robotic<00:01:16.119> arm<00:01:16.299> and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
a dummy bomb with our robotic arm and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.149 
a dummy bomb with our robotic arm and
this<00:01:16.959> is<00:01:17.049> controlled<00:01:17.380> by<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.530> mechanical<00:01:18.009> arm

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
this is controlled by the mechanical arm

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.989 
this is controlled by the mechanical arm
that<00:01:18.909> is<00:01:19.090> in<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.209> hands<00:01:19.359> of<00:01:19.479> someone<00:01:19.689> so<00:01:20.499> now

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
that is in the hands of someone so now

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.730 
that is in the hands of someone so now
the<00:01:21.999> bomb<00:01:22.479> has<00:01:22.689> three<00:01:22.929> wives<00:01:23.079> and<00:01:23.259> we<00:01:23.469> are<00:01:23.590> to

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the bomb has three wives and we are to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:36.300 
the bomb has three wives and we are to
cut<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.459> white<00:01:24.609> white<00:01:25.209> wire<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:26.020> he'll<00:01:26.139> do<00:01:26.289> it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.410 

okay<00:01:37.310> now<00:01:37.400> we<00:01:37.520> have<00:01:37.610> successfully<00:01:37.910> cut<00:01:38.300> the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
okay now we have successfully cut the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.380 
okay now we have successfully cut the
wire<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.400> we<00:01:40.400> can<00:01:40.520> use<00:01:40.730> this<00:01:40.850> with<00:01:41.240> that

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
wire so we can use this with that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.150 
wire so we can use this with that
accuracy<00:01:41.870> because<00:01:42.650> there<00:01:42.740> were<00:01:42.800> three<00:01:43.010> wise

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
accuracy because there were three wise

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.610 
accuracy because there were three wise
men<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:43.490> will<00:01:43.870> come<00:01:44.870> o<00:01:44.990> will<00:01:45.140> be<00:01:45.290> building

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
men we will come o will be building

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.980 
men we will come o will be building
blocks<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.910> those<00:01:47.270> are<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.420> two<00:01:47.510> is<00:01:47.870> her

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
blocks so those are the two is her

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.140 
blocks so those are the two is her
mobile<00:01:48.230> blocks<00:01:48.500> now<00:01:48.770> someone<00:01:49.700> will<00:01:49.730> control

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
mobile blocks now someone will control

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:59.820 
mobile blocks now someone will control
the<00:01:50.390> vertical<00:01:50.960> man<00:01:51.440> ill<00:01:51.980> build<00:01:52.250> looks<00:01:52.520> a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
parallel you can see the simulation or

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:45.059 
parallel you can see the simulation or
in<00:02:02.240> blender<00:02:02.600> going<00:02:02.870> on<00:02:03.050> insert

the whole project in Linux and one of
the<00:03:57.800> important<00:03:58.160> achievements<00:03:58.640> of<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.820> project

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
the important achievements of a project

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.030 
the important achievements of a project
is<00:03:59.330> that<00:03:59.390> we<00:03:59.720> have<00:03:59.810> decoded<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.710> string<00:04:00.920> that

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
is that we have decoded the string that

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.260 
is that we have decoded the string that
is<00:04:01.100> used<00:04:01.340> for<00:04:01.430> communication<00:04:01.640> with<00:04:02.180> the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
is used for communication with the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.210 
is used for communication with the
robotic<00:04:02.600> arm<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.290> this<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.740> format<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.070> the

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
robotic arm so this the format of the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.040 
robotic arm so this the format of the
string<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.610> scoliosis<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.570> starts<00:04:05.990> with

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
string is a scoliosis so it starts with

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.350 
string is a scoliosis so it starts with
an<00:04:06.200> ash<00:04:06.320> and<00:04:06.590> then<00:04:06.800> followed<00:04:07.220> by<00:04:07.430> E<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.120> number

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
an ash and then followed by E the number

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.820 
an ash and then followed by E the number
of<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.630> servo<00:04:08.900> motor<00:04:09.080> and<00:04:09.320> then<00:04:09.530> followed

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
of the servo motor and then followed

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.440 
of the servo motor and then followed
with<00:04:09.950> absolute<00:04:10.310> angle<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:10.850> speed<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.360> the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
with absolute angle and speed of the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.810 
with absolute angle and speed of the
motor<00:04:11.570> so<00:04:12.140> using<00:04:12.320> this<00:04:12.590> after<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.490> it's

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
motor so using this after that it's

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.370 
motor so using this after that it's
followed<00:04:14.090> by<00:04:14.120> four<00:04:14.390> stars<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:14.870> using<00:04:15.200> this

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
followed by four stars so using this

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.920 
followed by four stars so using this
format<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.730> robotic<00:04:17.090> arm<00:04:17.180> can<00:04:17.390> be<00:04:17.420> controlled

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
format the robotic arm can be controlled

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.110 
format the robotic arm can be controlled
from<00:04:18.140> any<00:04:18.500> programming<00:04:19.250> language<00:04:19.370> in<00:04:19.880> any

from any programming language in any
operating<00:04:20.750> system<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.799> coming<00:04:21.980> to<00:04:22.130> the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
operating system so coming to the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.040 
operating system so coming to the
enhancements<00:04:22.700> of<00:04:22.790> our<00:04:22.910> project<00:04:23.270> we<00:04:23.810> have

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
enhancements of our project we have

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.440 
enhancements of our project we have
currently<00:04:24.170> a<00:04:24.770> wired<00:04:25.670> connection<00:04:25.910> from<00:04:26.270> the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
currently a wired connection from the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.570 
currently a wired connection from the
laptop<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.560> robotic<00:04:27.920> arm<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.100> can<00:04:28.250> be

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
laptop to the robotic arm that can be

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.240 
laptop to the robotic arm that can be
made<00:04:28.760> wireless<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.420> then<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.800> robotic<00:04:31.160> arm

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
made wireless and then the robotic arm

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.550 
made wireless and then the robotic arm
can<00:04:31.550> be<00:04:31.580> made<00:04:31.940> mobile<00:04:32.300> so<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.290> area<00:04:33.470> of

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
can be made mobile so that it's area of

can be made mobile so that it's area of
contact<00:04:33.890> is<00:04:34.100> increased<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:35.000> mechanical<00:04:35.780> arm

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
contact is increased the mechanical arm

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.170 
contact is increased the mechanical arm
can<00:04:36.140> be<00:04:36.170> remodeled<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:36.980> put<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.370> human<00:04:37.820> arm<00:04:38.000> so

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
can be remodeled to put the human arm so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.330 
can be remodeled to put the human arm so
that<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.750> control<00:04:39.110> is<00:04:39.290> more<00:04:39.740> intuitive<00:04:40.040> and
