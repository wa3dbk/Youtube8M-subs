00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hello and hello at your step petit 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.500
 and so today we see in call of duty 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.190
 ghosts at the start and the promised 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.230
 follow in the memory of which a shield 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 will be quiet today 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.609
 this wishes you again the classes 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.650
 show here poses agility marathon 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.260
 strong despite physical equipment 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.750
 my portion and people i need something 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 branch ice shield idea there is space 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.070
 cats otto vock so i believe if 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.180
 I have some fucking shit for that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 then it is definitely for that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:56.430
 shield the space cats division what 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:59.129
 the fuck is judge so people look 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 but today as I said I had 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.549
 actually taken care of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.070
 certainly gameplay that record and 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.540
 that is, as it were, informally blatant 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.430
 Gameplay looks set to use 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.010
 and book fairs and everything I put into it 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.280
 but I just think so live 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.790
 comes the people and that makes capricious 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.390
 that just makes it fun because yes yes 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.189
 virtually carried out a live of the island 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.259
 people became grotesque 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.150
 Emblem this already full 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.159
 prestige twist and I do not have it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.590
 Somehow, there is more interest 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.700
 is to make it does not matter I play 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.909
 with the people of the simpson family vasco 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:49.770
 racers crooked case cons and paul ilan 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:51.299
 sidi 38 so on the map a video man with 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.850
 attack packages you can choose whether 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.810
 They attack or support their team 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.820
 rather than acting as a lone fighter as should 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 I understand that I stand on everyone 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.509
 case in the background a hotdog that was 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.369
 maybe clawing and I'm in that 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.950
 Team Ghost stuff you promotion 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.280
 about that with the shield if we are more 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.420
 no one believes a profit here 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.900
 yes team deathmatch came strong 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:24.750
 right eye strong so full of motivation 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.959
 it continues this month with videos 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.510
 did not come with last day but he did 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:36.110
 his reasons 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.110

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.300
 well lay have fun gl hf coach also song 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:53.120

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.120
 my 21 ak vibration protection 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.680
 trainer while my dear friends and 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.900
 he has already collected from the body 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.950
 what I wanted to confess but hey 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.950
 could that be so and we can board with it 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.450
 that was missing my money 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:25.670
 I wanted so well as I said in 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.190
 remember one thing I've shield 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:36.920
 seen as two with three in black ops 2 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.600
 and now in the cover with what 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.050
 I still do not make friends 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.590
 it is definitely that the shield yes 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.019
 that with two s2000 that shield that 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.280
 that said no matter laughs me that is 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.080
 Just on the right side 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.510
 I was able to mid 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.519
 I was successful against really goes so 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.980
 Shield with the shepherd left side 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.170
 I can run and we can do it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.049
 I just do it because it's just that 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.650
 right side of the hey that's shit 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.540
 flutes with these arguments 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:17.799
 here is on with what you do with 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:17.799
 the shield here there has just sorry 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.020
 if they have to stop giving other so well 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.850
 I'm doing this and this stupid 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.760
 shield m offered is more evil back often 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.289
 what about strikes on strike do you want me? 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.710
 you look like crazy at the clock 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.710
 it is late 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.250
 you almost know me every second 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.090
 roll 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.070
 I do not see much of it anymore 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.900
 offer your video that's why you realize 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.450
 now to early hour and this 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.890
 action here is indescribable as it is 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.220
 Just go with the incision in 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:03.110
 power set the towering 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.330
 Superiority is of course required and 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.880
 my incredible not hit skills 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.770
 with the book fair gives in every respect 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.110
 compare with mp3 apply hit the 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.210
 here clock update saw there was easy 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.130
 still and wanted to braid and have 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.680
 met 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:39.620
 grass or fern dot deserves that 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:42.230
 really thing is really well deserved 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.260
 Do you get everything and you jiggle me 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:49.280
 zack you can burst over it yet 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.290
 someone that armin sign oh you shit 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.700
 you do not have to stay tuned but with 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.860
 wants to set something was traveling 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.580
 Here you have such a big one 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.710
 attack surface 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.330
 A look on the way is so funny you 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.090
 Can you cry with the cuts 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.080
 are completely for themselves make them permanent 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.990
 and the people yes 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.389
 just as long to meet you 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.120
 because the shield somehow I see 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.569
 at all because the shield is so much space 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.990
 taketh away 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.659
 but hey the memory really 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.289
 Advantages disadvantages in the whole one 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.939
 Our qualifications lead that 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.180
 seen how I did that with 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:29.939
 my fellow man 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:32.639
 Oh shit, it could be this 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:34.560
 extremely cool and outstanding graduations 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.669
 and the steering wheel are used by 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.690
 Just look at the industry like that 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.400
 So money was here with the individual 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.050
 Something can even be able to surface 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.389
 I'm pretty good, that 's it 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:52.080
 maybe it works out too 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:54.120
 ballistics best beautiful 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.900
 so everything is in the series took everything in 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.819
 attacked and now have everything in handy 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:05.719
 would like to take everything much better 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:09.780
 okay for you okay maybe something 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:13.379
 yes from time to time so they reach 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:20.599
 Two degrees ducked counts as a shield 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:20.599
 Just let me know how it works 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:26.520
 somehow, some key will 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.530
 make this 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.180
 we won so thanks to me then mine 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.620
 fight through showed around mine 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.830
 overseen supervise 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.870
 I have the job with the shield 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.860
 my team supports like, and 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.889
 That's why I won exactly 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.360
 so write me your opinion how 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:45.180
 you liked the comments that 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.090
 live and with the seven to seven goes 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.310
 get it out of here and I was caring house 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.659
 in it until the next time and I'll 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.879
 actually liked my welcome 

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:56.819
 that goes as follows servus and 

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:58.830
 hello the pen petit and so it is for 

00:07:56.819 --> 00:07:59.279
 a little bit more understandable than that 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.050
 other 

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:03.750
 but I think one or the other 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:07.319
 Let's have a look 

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:10.560
 Well, how it is and me 

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:13.729
 I would say I'm out of the first 

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.729
 think us in it
