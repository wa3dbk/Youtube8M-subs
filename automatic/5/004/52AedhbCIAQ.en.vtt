that<00:00:40.470> we<00:00:40.710> decided<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.190> spray<00:00:41.400> foam<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that we decided to spray foam the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.960 
that we decided to spray foam the
envelope<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.390> spray<00:00:42.570> foam<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.050> our<00:00:43.140> homes

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
envelope we spray foam all of our homes

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.280 
envelope we spray foam all of our homes
mainly<00:00:44.970> for<00:00:45.120> energy<00:00:45.360> efficiency<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.989> also

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
mainly for energy efficiency and also

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.560 
mainly for energy efficiency and also
for<00:00:46.440> cleanliness<00:00:46.850> we<00:00:47.850> feel<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.420> energy

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
for cleanliness we feel that the energy

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.390 
for cleanliness we feel that the energy
efficiency<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.260> comes<00:00:49.470> along<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.949> the

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
efficiency that comes along with it the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.280 
efficiency that comes along with it the
tightness<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.970> home<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:52.019> hired<00:00:52.170> an

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
tightness of the home we hired an

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.600 
tightness of the home we hired an
independent<00:00:52.440> contractor<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.220> come<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
independent contractor to come in and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.630 
independent contractor to come in and
test<00:00:53.850> our<00:00:54.510> homes<00:00:54.840> after<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.070> installation<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
test our homes after the installation is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.690 
test our homes after the installation is
installed<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:58.050> find<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.410> dust<00:00:59.100> levels<00:00:59.340> are

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
installed we find that dust levels are

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.090 
installed we find that dust levels are
stayed<00:00:59.940> down<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.320> able<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.649> lower<00:01:01.829> the

stayed down we are able to lower the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.370 
stayed down we are able to lower the
sizing<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:02.790> air<00:01:03.180> conditioning<00:01:03.600> units<00:01:03.809> we

sizing of our air conditioning units we

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.740 
sizing of our air conditioning units we
can<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:05.040> add<00:01:05.339> higher<00:01:05.640> efficiency<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.570> our

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
can then add higher efficiency to our

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.680 
can then add higher efficiency to our
systems<00:01:07.410> the<00:01:07.619> power<00:01:07.830> bills<00:01:08.100> or<00:01:08.340> less<00:01:08.690> those
