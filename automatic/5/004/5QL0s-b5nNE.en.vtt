television<00:00:01.020> transmissions<00:00:01.860> expand<00:00:02.460> outward

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
television transmissions expand outward

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.059 
television transmissions expand outward
from<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.360> earth<00:00:03.510> at<00:00:03.780> speed<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.620> light<00:00:04.799> and

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
from the earth at speed of light and

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.460 
from the earth at speed of light and
there's<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.970> trope<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.509> science<00:00:06.870> fiction<00:00:07.290> that

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
there's a trope in science fiction that

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.110 
there's a trope in science fiction that
aliens<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.189> learned<00:00:08.400> everything<00:00:08.880> about

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
aliens have learned everything about

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.839 
aliens have learned everything about
humans<00:00:09.719> by<00:00:09.900> watching<00:00:10.290> our<00:00:10.800> television<00:00:11.610> shows

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
humans by watching our television shows

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.749 
humans by watching our television shows
so<00:00:12.780> if<00:00:12.870> you're<00:00:13.019> four<00:00:13.320> light<00:00:13.590> years<00:00:13.620> away<00:00:13.980> you

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
so if you're four light years away you

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.070 
so if you're four light years away you
see<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> light<00:00:15.269> from<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.599> earth<00:00:15.750> as<00:00:15.990> it

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
see the light from the earth as it

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.460 
see the light from the earth as it
looked

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
looked

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.460 
looked
four<00:00:16.740> years<00:00:16.980> ago<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.460> some<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.150> light

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
four years ago and some of that light

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.840 
four years ago and some of that light
includes<00:00:19.470> television<00:00:19.800> transmissions<00:00:20.670> as

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
includes television transmissions as

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.439 
includes television transmissions as
radio<00:00:21.840> waves<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.680> another<00:00:22.920> form<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
radio waves are just another form of

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.080 
radio waves are just another form of
electromagnetism<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:25.380> all<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.680> light<00:00:26.090> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
electromagnetism it's all just light and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.570 
electromagnetism it's all just light and
humans<00:00:27.570> began<00:00:27.960> serious<00:00:28.680> television<00:00:28.920> service

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
humans began serious television service

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.450 
humans began serious television service
in<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> 1930s<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> modern<00:00:31.710> era<00:00:31.890> there

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
in the 1930s and by the modern era there

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.400 
in the 1930s and by the modern era there
were<00:00:32.579> thousands<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.300> powerful<00:00:33.840> transmitters

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
were thousands of powerful transmitters

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.889 
were thousands of powerful transmitters
pumping<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:35.329> electromagnetic<00:00:36.329> radiation

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

it's all a part of our historical
documents<00:00:46.410> well<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> first<00:00:47.640> radio<00:00:47.969> broadcast

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
documents well the first radio broadcast

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.290 
documents well the first radio broadcast
started<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.079> early<00:00:49.280> 1900s<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.940> at<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
started in the early 1900s so at the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.150 
started in the early 1900s so at the
time<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.719> I'm<00:00:51.809> recording<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.379> video<00:00:52.620> it's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
time that I'm recording this video it's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.119 
time that I'm recording this video it's
late<00:00:53.730> 2014<00:00:54.180> these<00:00:55.020> transmissions<00:00:55.920> have

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
late 2014 these transmissions have

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.869 
late 2014 these transmissions have
escaped<00:00:56.640> into<00:00:57.120> space<00:00:57.829> 114<00:00:58.829> years<00:00:58.980> ago<00:00:59.280> this

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
escaped into space 114 years ago this

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.160 
escaped into space 114 years ago this
means<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.210> our<00:01:00.300> transmissions<00:01:01.020> have

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
means that our transmissions have

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.250 
means that our transmissions have
reached<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.649> sphere<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.430> stars<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> radius

are there other stars in that volume of

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.780 
to alert aliens to our presence should
we<00:03:36.930> get<00:03:37.020> rid<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.320> all<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.950> oxygen<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.700> our
