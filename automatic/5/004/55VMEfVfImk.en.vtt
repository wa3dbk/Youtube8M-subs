with details but he said I'm sure many

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.049 
with details but he said I'm sure many
times<00:00:43.720> before<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.379> I<00:00:44.739> want<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.070> upgrade<00:00:45.280> my

modes<00:00:47.980> were<00:00:48.129> really<00:00:48.370> cool<00:00:48.520> but<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:48.879> weird

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
modes were really cool but that weird

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.590 
modes were really cool but that weird
Cybertronian<00:00:50.019> vehicle<00:00:50.400> mode<00:00:51.400> so<00:00:51.730> wanted<00:00:52.570> to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
Cybertronian vehicle mode so wanted to

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.280 
Cybertronian vehicle mode so wanted to
do<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.530> g1<00:00:54.460> kind<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:54.850> car<00:00:55.150> mode<00:00:55.330> so<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:56.080> one

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
do the g1 kind of car mode so this one

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.979 
do the g1 kind of car mode so this one
rolls<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:58.000> front<00:00:58.210> was<00:00:58.330> a<00:00:58.360> little<00:00:58.780> tighter

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
rolls the front was a little tighter

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.610 
rolls the front was a little tighter
just<00:00:59.350> on<00:00:59.589> me<00:00:59.800> a<00:01:00.010> joint<00:01:00.339> that<00:01:00.430> they're<00:01:00.640> on<00:01:00.760> but

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
just on me a joint that they're on but

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.250 
just on me a joint that they're on but
and<00:01:02.620> generally<00:01:03.309> good<00:01:03.760> playability<00:01:04.150> here<00:01:04.600> so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
and generally good playability here so

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.350 
and generally good playability here so
we'll<00:01:05.830> get<00:01:05.920> right<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.220> transformation<00:01:06.730> here

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
we'll get right to transformation here

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
we'll get right to transformation here
and<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.310> first<00:01:09.550> thing<00:01:09.640> you'll<00:01:09.880> notice<00:01:10.120> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and the first thing you'll notice is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.920 
and the first thing you'll notice is
that<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:15.400> want<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.670> just<00:01:15.850> kind<00:01:16.210> of<00:01:16.300> move<00:01:16.659> out

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
that you want to just kind of move out

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.899 
that you want to just kind of move out
the<00:01:17.229> arm<00:01:17.409> sections<00:01:17.920> or<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.250> top<00:01:18.490> sections

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
the arm sections or the top sections

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.870 
the arm sections or the top sections
like<00:01:19.120> so<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.690> then<00:01:20.500> you'll<00:01:20.680> find<00:01:21.040> in<00:01:21.369> here

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
like so and then you'll find in here

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.780 
like so and then you'll find in here
each<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.360> his<00:01:22.719> guns<00:01:23.350> which<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.430> had<00:01:24.579> on<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
each of his guns which I had on the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.539 
each of his guns which I had on the
older<00:01:25.119> model<00:01:25.509> so<00:01:26.350> they're<00:01:26.860> used<00:01:27.219> again<00:01:27.520> on

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
older model so they're used again on

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.270 
older model so they're used again on
this<00:01:27.969> one<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:29.200> they<00:01:29.320> are<00:01:29.350> stored<00:01:29.799> in<00:01:30.009> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
this one but they are stored in the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.969 
this one but they are stored in the
vehicle<00:01:30.759> mode<00:01:30.909> pop<00:01:31.689> out<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.079> head<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.619> course

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
vehicle mode pop out the head of course

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.609 
vehicle mode pop out the head of course
it's<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.430> same<00:01:33.670> head<00:01:33.939> as<00:01:34.210> before<00:01:34.750> but<00:01:35.439> the

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
it's the same head as before but the

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.249 
it's the same head as before but the
rest<00:01:35.799> of<00:01:35.979> its<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.219> new<00:01:36.340> transformation<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:37.360> next

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
rest of its a new transformation so next

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.200 
rest of its a new transformation so next
thing<00:01:38.409> we<00:01:38.619> want<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.829> do<00:01:38.979> is<00:01:39.310> bring<00:01:39.850> around

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
thing we want to do is bring around

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.770 
thing we want to do is bring around
these<00:01:40.479> arms<00:01:41.280> rotate<00:01:42.420> same<00:01:43.420> on<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.600> other<00:01:43.659> side

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
these arms rotate same on the other side

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.330 
these arms rotate same on the other side
and<00:01:44.320> I'm<00:01:44.380> going<00:01:44.469> to<00:01:44.560> show<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.710> something<00:01:44.920> neat

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
and I'm going to show you something neat

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.340 
and I'm going to show you something neat
in<00:01:45.579> a<00:01:45.700> second<00:01:46.180> with<00:01:46.750> what<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:46.960> did<00:01:47.140> with<00:01:47.259> the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
in a second with what I did with the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.109 
in a second with what I did with the
extra<00:01:47.770> kibble<00:01:48.130> because<00:01:48.579> as<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.850> know<00:01:48.969> the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
extra kibble because as you know the

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.240 
extra kibble because as you know the
original<00:01:49.420> g1<00:01:49.539> had<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.409> lot<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.680> cable<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.100> it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
original g1 had a lot of cable and it

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.410 
original g1 had a lot of cable and it
didn't<00:01:51.520> even<00:01:51.640> look<00:01:51.789> like<00:01:51.850> anything<00:01:52.299> when

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
didn't even look like anything when

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.990 
didn't even look like anything when
transformed<00:01:53.049> so<00:01:53.530> like<00:01:54.189> most<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.789> my<00:01:54.880> other

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
transformed so like most of my other

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.840 
transformed so like most of my other
Transformers<00:01:55.750> car<00:01:56.500> vehicles<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.490> have<00:01:57.520> to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
Transformers car vehicles you have to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.050 
Transformers car vehicles you have to
rotate<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.990> legs<00:01:59.289> down<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.700> we'll<00:02:00.880> do<00:02:01.030> that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
rotate the legs down so we'll do that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.870 
rotate the legs down so we'll do that
and<00:02:02.009> then<00:02:03.009> rotate<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.820> legs<00:02:04.299> out<00:02:05.670> at<00:02:06.670> the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
and then rotate the legs out at the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.490 
and then rotate the legs out at the
bottom

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
bottom

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.090 
bottom
so<00:02:08.640> pretty<00:02:09.640> much<00:02:10.380> we'll<00:02:11.380> just<00:02:11.560> get<00:02:11.770> them<00:02:11.920> all

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
so pretty much we'll just get them all

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.480 
so pretty much we'll just get them all
finished<00:02:12.580> up<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.030> guys<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.480> done<00:02:14.490> rotate

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
finished up for you guys and done rotate

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.890 
finished up for you guys and done rotate
arms<00:02:15.850> around<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.420> hinge<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:19.390> gives<00:02:19.630> us<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
arms around on hinge that gives us a
