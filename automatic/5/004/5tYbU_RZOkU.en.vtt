we have 3d vision with 3d vision which

we have 3d vision with 3d vision which
is<00:00:35.399> magnified<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.899> structures<00:00:37.530> in

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the abdomen or in the pelvis that you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.690 
the abdomen or in the pelvis that you
just<00:00:39.840> can't<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.739> own<00:00:40.890> eyes<00:00:41.160> or

just can't see with your own eyes or

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.840 
just can't see with your own eyes or
with<00:00:42.300> laparoscopic<00:00:42.570> surgery<00:00:43.309> we<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.520> more

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
with laparoscopic surgery we have more

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.220 
with laparoscopic surgery we have more
degrees<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.270> freedom<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> instruments

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
degrees of freedom with the instruments

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.799 
degrees of freedom with the instruments
which<00:00:46.350> means<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> instruments<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.340> move

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
which means the instruments can move

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.630 
which means the instruments can move
more<00:00:48.809> ways<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.410> space<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.070> means<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.489> can

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
more ways in space so that means you can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.580 
more ways in space so that means you can
do<00:00:50.760> things<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.050> can't<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.440> with

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
do things that you just can't do with

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.369 
do things that you just can't do with
straight<00:00:52.949> instruments<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.750> robot

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
straight instruments the robot

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
straight instruments the robot
eliminates<00:00:56.190> any<00:00:56.430> tremor<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> surgeon<00:00:57.360> may

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
eliminates any tremor the surgeon may

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.970 
eliminates any tremor the surgeon may
have<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.079> means<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> movements<00:00:58.890> are

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have so that means the movements are

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.560 
have so that means the movements are
more<00:00:59.100> precise<00:00:59.489> they're<00:00:59.850> more<00:00:59.969> fluid<00:01:00.390> and

more precise they're more fluid and
they're<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.620> less<00:01:01.770> traumatic<00:01:01.980> to

they're going to be less traumatic to

they're going to be less traumatic to

have the most experienced anesthesia
staff<00:01:57.630> during<00:01:58.049> robotic<00:01:58.409> surgery<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
staff during robotic surgery we have the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.070 
staff during robotic surgery we have the
most<00:01:59.610> experienced<00:02:00.119> floor<00:02:00.390> nurses<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.899> know

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
most experienced floor nurses that know

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.389 
most experienced floor nurses that know
what<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.320> look<00:02:01.440> for<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.950> patients<00:02:02.250> who<00:02:02.310> have

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
what to look for in patients who have

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.130 
what to look for in patients who have
robotic<00:02:02.640> surgery<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.780> ultimately

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
robotic surgery what that ultimately

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.570 
robotic surgery what that ultimately
equals<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:04.830> our<00:02:04.920> patients<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.399> better

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
equals for our patients is better

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.950 
equals for our patients is better
patient<00:02:06.030> care<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.360> better<00:02:06.450> patient<00:02:06.869> outcomes

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
patient care and better patient outcomes

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.840 
patient care and better patient outcomes
because<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.429> surgeon<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
because it's not just the surgeon that

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.790 
because it's not just the surgeon that
makes<00:02:09.119> robotic<00:02:09.509> surgery<00:02:09.780> happen<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.500> team

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
makes robotic surgery happen it's a team

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.020 
makes robotic surgery happen it's a team
that<00:02:10.920> we're<00:02:11.069> building<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.519> Swedish<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that we're building here at Swedish and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.150 
that we're building here at Swedish and
our<00:02:12.480> experience<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.290> really<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:13.650> makes<00:02:13.950> that

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
our experience is really what makes that

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.530 
our experience is really what makes that
work<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:20.970> found<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.450> our

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
work what we have found in our

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.090 
work what we have found in our
experience<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.500> experience<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.950> our

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
experience and the experience of our

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.610 
experience and the experience of our
gynecologic<00:02:23.940> oncologist<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.750> patients

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
gynecologic oncologist is that patients

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.920 
gynecologic oncologist is that patients
do<00:02:26.220> better<00:02:26.250> with<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.940> robotic<00:02:27.269> surgery<00:02:27.420> we're

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
do better with the robotic surgery we're

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780 
do better with the robotic surgery we're
able<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.319> see<00:02:28.500> better<00:02:28.709> we're<00:02:29.340> able<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.610> move

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
able to see better we're able to move

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.910 
able to see better we're able to move
better<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.330> if<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.440> better<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
better and if you can see better and you

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
better and if you can see better and you
can<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.340> precise<00:02:32.730> than<00:02:33.000> our<00:02:33.180> patients

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
can be more precise than our patients

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.750 
can be more precise than our patients
have<00:02:33.690> better<00:02:33.840> outcomes

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
have better outcomes

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.300 
have better outcomes
