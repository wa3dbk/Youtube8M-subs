that<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.310> embryo<00:01:28.730> that<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:30.050> what<00:01:30.409> we

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
that is the embryo that is the what we

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.270 
that is the embryo that is the what we
call<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.150> circle<00:01:32.150> of<00:01:32.479> life<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:33.740> see<00:01:33.770> that

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
call the circle of life you see that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.120 
call the circle of life you see that
then<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.729> have<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.909> fertile<00:01:35.180> egg<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.920> what<00:01:37.040> you

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
container that you should have already

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.390 
container that you should have already
ready<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.390> go<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:42.560> dig<00:01:42.830> yourself<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.250> little

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
ready to go you dig yourself a little

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.660 
ready to go you dig yourself a little
space<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.650> make<00:01:45.650> sure<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:45.890> you<00:01:46.220> put<00:01:46.460> those

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
space you make sure that you put those

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.219 
space you make sure that you put those
that<00:01:47.240> circle<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:47.840> life

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
that circle of life

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.610 
that circle of life
aiming<00:01:48.500> upwards<00:01:48.979> because<00:01:50.080> what<00:01:51.080> that<00:01:51.260> is<00:01:51.409> is

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
aiming upwards because what that is is

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.490 
aiming upwards because what that is is
that's<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.400> umbilical<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.090> if<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.840> Dragons

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
that's the umbilical and if the Dragons

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.120 
that's the umbilical and if the Dragons
get<00:01:55.370> tangled<00:01:55.790> up<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:57.409> can<00:01:57.710> cause<00:01:57.920> them

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
get tangled up in it it can cause them

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.000 
get tangled up in it it can cause them
to<00:01:58.310> suffocate<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.270> die<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.530> again<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.890> just
