easy<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.219> end<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.320> it's<00:01:52.320> very<00:01:52.530> important

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
easy in the end so it's very important

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700 
easy in the end so it's very important
to<00:01:53.159> catch<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.780> growth<00:01:54.780> spurt<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> will

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to catch that growth spurt if you will

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.819 
to catch that growth spurt if you will
when<00:01:56.429> the<00:01:56.700> bones<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:57.149> forming<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.869> jaw<00:01:58.140> at

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
when the bones are forming in the jaw at

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.630 
when the bones are forming in the jaw at
a<00:01:58.859> critical<00:01:59.219> point<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.890> think<00:02:02.460> we

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a critical point and we I think we

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.060 
a critical point and we I think we
arrived<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.420> time<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.649> got<00:02:04.799> Georgia

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
arrived just in time so we got Georgia

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.889 
arrived just in time so we got Georgia

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
started with the bio block therapy at

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.619 
started with the bio block therapy at
the<00:02:07.289> right<00:02:07.469> age<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:08.039> we're<00:02:08.789> thrilled<00:02:09.090> with

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the right age and we're thrilled with

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.809 
the right age and we're thrilled with
the<00:02:09.780> results<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.259> far<00:02:10.379> she's<00:02:11.370> been<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.670> bio

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the results so far she's been in bio

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.100 
the results so far she's been in bio
block<00:02:12.090> therapy<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.720> about

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
block therapy for about

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.170 
block therapy for about
here<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.470> we're<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.460> do<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> little<00:02:15.000> bit

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
here and we're going to do a little bit

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.060 
here and we're going to do a little bit
more<00:02:15.330> bio<00:02:15.630> block<00:02:15.870> therapy<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.710> really

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
more bio block therapy just to really

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.670 
more bio block therapy just to really
bring<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.850> final<00:02:18.210> touches<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:18.900> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
bring in the final touches for that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.520 
bring in the final touches for that
profile<00:02:20.430> there<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.840> help<00:02:21.990> develop<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
profile there if we can help develop the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.110 
profile there if we can help develop the
jaws<00:02:22.770> then<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.190> don't<00:02:23.310> have<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.820> align

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
jaws then we don't have to just align

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.510 
jaws then we don't have to just align
the<00:02:24.300> teeth<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:25.290> that's<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.220> what<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
the teeth and that's that's all what it

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.550 
the teeth and that's that's all what it
is<00:02:26.730> about<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.240> buyer<00:02:27.420> block<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.260> timing

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
is about the buyer block is the timing

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.850 
is about the buyer block is the timing
to<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.220> able<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.910> lead<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.300> body<00:02:30.510> grow<00:02:31.290> nuts<00:02:31.650> on

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
to be able to lead the body grow nuts on

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.790 
to be able to lead the body grow nuts on
its<00:02:32.130> own<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.700> fit<00:02:33.240> those<00:02:33.450> teeth<00:02:33.810> without<00:02:34.080> just

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
its own and fit those teeth without just

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.160 
its own and fit those teeth without just
the<00:02:34.980> trying<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:36.150> straighten<00:02:36.480> them<00:02:36.630> up<00:02:36.660> and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the trying to to straighten them up and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.080 
the trying to to straighten them up and
that's<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.860> difference<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.670> too<00:02:38.910> late

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that's the difference if it's too late

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.960 
that's the difference if it's too late
that's<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:40.020> too<00:02:40.260> sad<00:02:40.500> there's<00:02:41.310> structural

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that's just too sad there's structural

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.770 
that's just too sad there's structural
and<00:02:42.320> there's<00:02:43.320> functional<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.850> dr.<00:02:45.450> hang

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
and there's functional so dr. hang

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.410 
and there's functional so dr. hang
really<00:02:46.350> deals<00:02:46.620> with<00:02:46.920> structural<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.030> mean

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
really deals with structural I mean

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420 
really deals with structural I mean
we're<00:02:48.630> talking<00:02:48.840> about<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.350> skeleton<00:02:50.010> with

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
we're talking about the skeleton with

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.699 
we're talking about the skeleton with
dr.<00:02:50.790> hang<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.270> we're<00:02:51.840> talking<00:02:52.020> about<00:02:52.320> getting

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
dr. hang and we're talking about getting

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.949 
dr. hang and we're talking about getting
the<00:02:52.830> bones<00:02:53.070> formed<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.760> right<00:02:54.000> right

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
the bones formed in the right right

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.260 
the bones formed in the right right
location<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:56.280> there's<00:02:56.520> function

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
location then there's function

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.510 
location then there's function
functional<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.470> function<00:02:58.890> really<00:02:59.100> comes<00:02:59.340> in

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
functional the function really comes in

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.370 
functional the function really comes in
with<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.790> teeth<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.090> how<00:03:00.840> they<00:03:01.020> occlude

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
with the teeth and how they occlude

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.150 
with the teeth and how they occlude
together<00:03:02.630> that's<00:03:03.630> actually<00:03:03.930> almost<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.650> that's

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
together that's actually almost a that's

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.130 
together that's actually almost a that's
the<00:03:05.310> easy<00:03:05.489> part<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.120> hard<00:03:06.360> part<00:03:06.630> really<00:03:06.870> and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the easy part the hard part really and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.350 
the easy part the hard part really and
that's<00:03:07.440> actually<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.190> bio<00:03:08.400> block<00:03:08.700> therapy<00:03:08.910> is

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
that's actually the bio block therapy is

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.350 
that's actually the bio block therapy is
the<00:03:09.800> structural<00:03:10.800> part<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.550> then<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
the structural part of it and then the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.360 
the structural part of it and then the
functional<00:03:12.900> part<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.320> well<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.070> put<00:03:14.220> some

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
functional part is well we can put some

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.770 
functional part is well we can put some
braces<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.910> teeth<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.239> just<00:03:15.480> get<00:03:15.660> them

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
braces on the teeth and just get them

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.690 
braces on the teeth and just get them
tipped<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.680> right<00:03:16.830> location<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.670> that

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
tipped in the right location so that

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.820 
tipped in the right location so that
their<00:03:18.000> their<00:03:18.630> functioning<00:03:19.260> up<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.650> down

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
their their functioning up and down

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.090 
their their functioning up and down
together<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.610> then<00:03:21.510> there's<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:22.830> know<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
together and then there's you know the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.220 
together and then there's you know the
aesthetic<00:03:23.750> component<00:03:24.750> where<00:03:24.840> we're<00:03:24.989> really

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
aesthetic component where we're really

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.440 
aesthetic component where we're really
making<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.160> teeth<00:03:26.340> look<00:03:26.549> good<00:03:26.790> that's<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
making the teeth look good that's the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.729 
making the teeth look good that's the
least<00:03:27.630> important<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.320> kind<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.560> goes<00:03:28.680> in

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
least important and it kind of goes in

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.020 
least important and it kind of goes in
that<00:03:28.980> order<00:03:29.190> it's<00:03:29.850> sort<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.709> skeletal

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
that order it's sort of the skeletal

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.449 
that order it's sort of the skeletal
part<00:03:33.030> then<00:03:33.959> there's<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.320> functional<00:03:35.190> part

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
part then there's the functional part

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.550 
part then there's the functional part
and<00:03:35.700> then<00:03:36.239> there's<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.690> aesthetic<00:03:37.140> part<00:03:37.380> and

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
and then there's the aesthetic part and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.039 
and then there's the aesthetic part and
it<00:03:37.860> really<00:03:38.100> has<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.340> go<00:03:38.610> in<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.850> order<00:03:39.090> well<00:03:40.019> I

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
it really has to go in that order well I

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.680 
it really has to go in that order well I
know<00:03:40.230> what<00:03:40.680> happens<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.489> face<00:03:41.700> when<00:03:42.060> it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
know what happens to the face when it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.770 
know what happens to the face when it
was<00:03:43.049> pushed<00:03:43.650> back<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.160> again<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.780> relate

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
was pushed back and again I can relate

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.170 
was pushed back and again I can relate
to<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.440> knowledge<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.310> built<00:03:47.640> up<00:03:47.880> as

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
to to the knowledge that built up as

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.420 
to to the knowledge that built up as
through<00:03:48.600> all<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.140> year<00:03:49.680> knowing<00:03:50.310> what

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
through all that year knowing what

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.220 
through all that year knowing what
happens<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.060> face<00:03:51.269> knowing<00:03:51.600> what<00:03:51.840> happens

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
happens to the face knowing what happens

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.199 
happens to the face knowing what happens
to<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> jaw<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.950> airway<00:03:53.700> it's<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.030> big

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
to the jaw and the airway it's a big

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.360 
to the jaw and the airway it's a big
part<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.600> me<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:54.989> believes<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.739> airway<00:03:56.010> has

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
part of me that believes that airway has

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.580 
part of me that believes that airway has
to<00:03:56.549> be<00:03:56.640> open<00:03:57.090> instead<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.540> clothes<00:03:57.810> just

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
to be open instead of the clothes just

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.009 
to be open instead of the clothes just
the<00:03:58.680> mechanics<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.400> closing<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> garage

can<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.709> can't<00:04:04.920> when<00:04:05.580> teeth<00:04:05.910> don't

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
can do it I just can't when teeth don't

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.870 
can do it I just can't when teeth don't
function<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:07.170> break<00:04:07.440> down<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:08.430> bone<00:04:08.580> breaks

down the tissues not healthy everything
falls<00:04:11.280> apart<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.650> things<00:04:13.650> have<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.010> be

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
falls apart so things have to be

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.670 
falls apart so things have to be
aesthetic<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.570> more<00:04:15.780> importantly<00:04:16.260> they<00:04:16.530> need

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
aesthetic but more importantly they need

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.039 
aesthetic but more importantly they need
to<00:04:16.769> be<00:04:16.890> functional<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.510> that's<00:04:18.690> what<00:04:18.930> my

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
to be functional so and that's what my

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.810 
to be functional so and that's what my
practice<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.560> all<00:04:19.709> about<00:04:19.979> I'm<00:04:20.370> not<00:04:20.669> an

practice is all about I'm not an
orthodontist<00:04:21.359> that's<00:04:21.599> why<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.780> seek<00:04:22.289> an<00:04:22.470> expert

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
orthodontist that's why I seek an expert

that<00:05:25.960> I<00:05:25.990> will<00:05:26.350> do<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:26.950> know<00:05:27.100> it's<00:05:27.730> a<00:05:28.060> lot<00:05:28.210> of

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
that I will do it I know it's a lot of

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.720 
that I will do it I know it's a lot of
fight<00:05:28.540> about<00:05:29.170> it<00:05:29.230> a<00:05:29.530> lot<00:05:29.950> of<00:05:30.100> thoughts<00:05:30.340> and<00:05:30.670> a

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
fight about it a lot of thoughts and a

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.870 
fight about it a lot of thoughts and a
lot<00:05:30.880> of<00:05:31.080> thinking<00:05:32.080> knowledge<00:05:32.950> or<00:05:33.160> not<00:05:33.310> but<00:05:33.730> I

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
lot of thinking knowledge or not but I

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.120 
lot of thinking knowledge or not but I
just<00:05:34.570> feel<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:34.870> that<00:05:35.050> it's<00:05:35.200> not<00:05:35.560> what<00:05:36.040> I'm

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
just feel it that it's not what I'm

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.730 
just feel it that it's not what I'm
going<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.340> do<00:05:36.490> if<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:37.510> if<00:05:37.900> you<00:05:38.050> skip<00:05:38.320> over<00:05:38.470> the

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
going to do if you if you skip over the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.210 
going to do if you if you skip over the
skeletal<00:05:40.320> structural<00:05:41.320> element<00:05:41.920> that<00:05:42.070> we're

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
skeletal structural element that we're

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.500 
skeletal structural element that we're
talking<00:05:42.370> about<00:05:42.840> there<00:05:43.840> are<00:05:44.080> ways<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:45.000> get<00:05:46.000> to

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
talking about there are ways to get to

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.120 
talking about there are ways to get to
that<00:05:46.630> end<00:05:46.840> component<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.710> get<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:48.010> that

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
that end component and get to that

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.600 
that end component and get to that
foundation<00:05:48.640> if<00:05:49.060> you<00:05:49.180> will<00:05:49.890> but<00:05:50.890> it's<00:05:51.040> surgical

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
foundation if you will but it's surgical

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.400 
foundation if you will but it's surgical
so<00:05:52.090> it's<00:05:52.240> really<00:05:52.420> nice<00:05:52.690> when<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:52.990> don't<00:05:53.200> have

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
so it's really nice when you don't have

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.730 
so it's really nice when you don't have
to<00:05:53.590> bring<00:05:53.830> in<00:05:53.950> surgery<00:05:54.630> in<00:05:55.630> my<00:05:56.410> daughter's

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
to bring in surgery in my daughter's

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.710 
to bring in surgery in my daughter's
case<00:05:56.980> because<00:05:57.490> she's<00:05:57.790> at<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.210> age<00:05:58.240> that<00:05:58.660> she

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
case because she's at the age that she

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.140 
case because she's at the age that she
is<00:05:59.020> we<00:05:59.260> didn't<00:05:59.530> have<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.860> do<00:05:59.980> surgery<00:06:00.220> and<00:06:00.700> we

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
is we didn't have to do surgery and we

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.390 
is we didn't have to do surgery and we
can<00:06:01.300> do<00:06:01.450> do<00:06:01.750> it<00:06:01.870> with<00:06:01.900> bio<00:06:02.170> block<00:06:02.410> therapy<00:06:02.620> so

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
can do do it with bio block therapy so

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.430 
can do do it with bio block therapy so
for<00:06:04.000> people<00:06:04.120> who<00:06:04.360> still<00:06:04.600> have<00:06:04.780> that<00:06:04.900> recruited

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
for people who still have that recruited

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.850 
for people who still have that recruited
lower<00:06:05.620> chin<00:06:06.570> we<00:06:07.570> can<00:06:07.750> move<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.200> chin<00:06:08.500> forward

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
lower chin we can move the chin forward

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.080 
lower chin we can move the chin forward
and<00:06:09.810> correct<00:06:10.810> things<00:06:11.620> skeletally<00:06:12.370> with

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
and correct things skeletally with

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.200 
and correct things skeletally with
surgery<00:06:13.870> but<00:06:14.410> it's<00:06:14.560> still<00:06:14.800> not<00:06:15.070> as<00:06:15.280> good<00:06:15.850> and

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
surgery but it's still not as good and

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.750 
surgery but it's still not as good and
the<00:06:16.480> end<00:06:16.840> result<00:06:17.020> can<00:06:17.590> be<00:06:17.620> as<00:06:17.890> good<00:06:18.100> but

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
the end result can be as good but

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.250 
the end result can be as good but
there's<00:06:18.970> still<00:06:19.060> some<00:06:19.390> situations<00:06:19.960> where<00:06:20.170> it's

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
there's still some situations where it's

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.620 
there's still some situations where it's
probably<00:06:20.590> not<00:06:20.770> as<00:06:20.920> good<00:06:21.160> as<00:06:21.340> had<00:06:22.150> we<00:06:22.300> done<00:06:22.450> it

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
probably not as good as had we done it

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.230 
probably not as good as had we done it
at<00:06:22.750> a<00:06:22.810> young<00:06:23.230> age<00:06:23.730> with<00:06:24.730> the<00:06:24.850> bio<00:06:25.000> block
