00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.270
 ah 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.150
 hello very good guys all today hugo 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.849
 of dry dotcom cinema and today we come with 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.219
 a video review of the new without city the 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.980
 return of maxis to the saga after 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.970
 passing ten years since he left 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.220
 without city 4 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 to start the game has a basis 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.250
 playable as in the previous ones without hit and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.710
 especially with the 64 that's pretty 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.449
 sergia and effective we have some 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.070
 novelties of course for example now 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.540
 we can build roads in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.220
 any angle there is even a way 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.650
 free to build roads that is 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.989
 pretty good although they are more 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.989
 supporter of the cities in 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.489
 very neat grids another of the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.220
 news is that now as we 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.600
 the city evolves we will not see ourselves in 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.610
 the obligation to destroy some 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 public buildings to put others with 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.159
 more functions but we can add 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.799
 some modules to add 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.739
 functionalities for example clinics 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.799
 to put them with more ambulances the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.560
 town hall to put them new 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.350
 modules that allow a new management 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.439
 of taxes and new and to build 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.509
 new facilities such as for example 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.860
 energy or treatment 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.700
 waste 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.780
 the interface is very simple we have 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.900
 menus and options to control 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.810
 practically everything from waste to 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.670
 our city the energy the water the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 budgets in order we can control 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.620
 our city at all levels that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 we can imagine we are facing a 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.479
 truly concrete simulator 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.950
 but not everything will be to govern the city 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.229
 we will also have some events 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.920
 quite interesting for example we 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.290
 can attack our sailors 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.090
 and methodological with different 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.010
 there are a couple of superheroes and villains 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
 to liven up our city so 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.630
 we can convert the transitive expo into 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.070
 metropolis there is also something that 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.690
 I personally loved it as a 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.290
 admirer of the zombies and is that 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.759
 we have long zombie vale is a 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.230
 real annoyance that the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.690
 zombies activity and practically 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.820
 pedagogical but taking into account that 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.790
 This game is based on growing and growing 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.430
 many times a part of the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.380
 game in which the city collapses and 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.760
 you have to start over and the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.630
 zombies and the truth is that they come very 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.240
 all right 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.840
 to restructure neighborhoods between new 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.660
 center the city 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.700
 avenging a superior social quality like this 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.440
 spend more money with the most taxes 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.200
 while the city can continue 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.360
 growing 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.140
 one of the things I know most about criticizing 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.269
 max and is that without hit and had to be 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.959
 always connected to the internet 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.060
 personally, it does not seem like a 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.590
 problem I put with the computer and 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.410
 obviously I stop almost practically 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.319
 always connected to the internet but this 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.110
 you have an explanation in play for 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.790
 grow on a larger scale we can play 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.120
 with more friends we can create communities 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.099
 of up to 16 players so we can create 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.440
 some cities just industrial for 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.349
 that others have anxiety only full of 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.170
 skyscraper and technological and so grow 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.599
 all as a community still a lot 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.519
 bigger and much better cities 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.519
 can collaborate with each other by offering 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.920
 resources money workers and even 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.269
 can participate in construction of 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.670
 great infrastructures like 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.860
 international airports or the tower 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.580
 eiffel or even a fusion reactor 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.580
 nuclear 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.640
 finally, talk about the section 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.200
 technical of the game goes that without 7 it is not 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.390
 the most important thing of the graphics but 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.660
 we must recognize that the new engine 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.970
 graphic glass box that is used for the 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.220
 game and artificial intelligence and 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.870
 all animations actions beginnings 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.390
 characters is one of the most complex 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.900
 that Maxis has created and the truth is that 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.670
 the technical requirements for both 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.590
 windows like for mac that by the way 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.830
 I think it's June 12 and they look like 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.140
 quite reasonable enough 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.750
 as a conclusion sim city is a 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.420
 great game waiting for 10 years of 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.760
 maxis and it's been worth it for this 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.160
 great redoubt that takes the best of without 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.420
 city ​​4 and add certain news 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.880
 playable we will have hours and hours and hours 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.570
 to get to master it and more to do 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.630
 the cities as we want 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.220
 and for now this is all for today to give 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.590
 I like it if you liked the video 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.640
 subscribe to the channel and see you in the 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.640
 next video goodbye
