00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello everyone played the nikon nll 3 Ã¨ 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.809
 the wireless remote to the reds for 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.480
 manage remote shooting on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.190
 don cameras obviously and it is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 compatible with many reflexes but 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.410
 also with much and compact and in any case 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.939
 on the official website of nikon su 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.240
 www.unicam.it find the complete list 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.179
 of compatible cameras and how yes 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.130
 simply use we will first of all 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.380
 select the mode and the camera 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.570
 via the dial more in this case or 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.340
 one of 7,000 then beams of the ring nut 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.440
 here on the left we will have to select 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.800
 the little icon of the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.230
 the wireless remote control and then we do not 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.420
 will base nothing but aiming at 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.000
 remote control has an August sensor here 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.969
 this one on the 7,000 this is the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.309
 then infrared wireless receiver 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.850
 all we need is to bet the 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.659
 TV remote 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.049
 at that point then press now stands in 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:09.799
 pocket for a moment then pressing us 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:14.119
 see sicem the light and the camera 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.340
 will take the picture exactly what it can 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.640
 but serve a remote control like this 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.700
 for example for selfies if we 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.429
 we don't want to use the 2 10 timer 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.080
 seconds of the camera will not suffice 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.509
 do nothing but enter the frame 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.130
 and then press the and button 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.530
 camera obviously before shooting 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.440
 the photo will focus 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.130
 we are using the autofocus point 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.679
 in autofocus mode and precisely there 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.649
 we will make a self-timer without having the 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.200
 problem of being another fire or not 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.929
 why use a remote control 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.830
 wireless pop not for a remote control in 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.349
 general also of those flush is for 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.410
 example if we want to take macro pictures 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.209
 while having a tripod by pressing on 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.129
 camera shutter button 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.410
 some vibration inevitably the 

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:08.629
 we will send to the camera and then 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.640
 with such a remote control it will be enough 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.030
 bet 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.890
 that is, earlier as I said before 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.260
 remote control to the camera on the side 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.860
 frontal because it is where the receiver 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.730
 interests and an autograph will put it to me 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.880
 and will take the picture without receiving 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.470
 vibrations of any kind 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.810
 I don't think there's anything else to add 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.370
 this is the simple command 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.380
 unique theme 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.790
