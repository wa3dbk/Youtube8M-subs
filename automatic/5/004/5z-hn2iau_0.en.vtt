00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
of consuming a web part connection we're

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.029 
of consuming a web part connection we're
going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> go<00:00:15.900> ahead<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.350> convert<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.770> one

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039

what<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.820> send<00:00:21.119> more<00:00:21.359> easily<00:00:22.369> now<00:00:23.369> that

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
what it can send more easily now that

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.160 
what it can send more easily now that
we've<00:00:23.640> converted<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.300> list<00:00:24.570> view<00:00:24.779> web<00:00:24.930> part
