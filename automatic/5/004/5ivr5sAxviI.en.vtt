everything<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.269> just<00:01:01.449> goes<00:01:01.780> through<00:01:02.229> my

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
everything that just goes through my

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
during that time so it's really

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.570 
during that time so it's really
important<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.920> keep<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.130> focus<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:10.630> really

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
important to keep the focus it's really

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.149 
important to keep the focus it's really
amazing<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.909> just<00:01:13.240> be<00:01:13.420> here<00:01:13.690> and<00:01:13.899> also<00:01:14.619> get

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
amazing to just be here and also get

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.820 
amazing to just be here and also get
that<00:01:15.190> a<00:01:15.759> lot<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.570> air<00:01:16.720> behind<00:01:16.930> you<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:17.530> that's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
that a lot of air behind you and that's

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.499 
that a lot of air behind you and that's
really<00:01:18.369> important<00:01:18.670> too

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
really important too

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.840 
really important too
I<00:01:19.539> will<00:01:20.140> say<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:20.740> know<00:01:21.069> exactly<00:01:21.220> what<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.729> do

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
I will say just know exactly what to do

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.550 
I will say just know exactly what to do
so<00:01:22.030> it<00:01:22.119> doesn't<00:01:22.360> matter<00:01:22.479> if<00:01:22.569> you<00:01:22.659> claim<00:01:22.840> 6a<00:01:23.319> or

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
so it doesn't matter if you claim 6a or

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.270 
so it doesn't matter if you claim 6a or
7a<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.940> just<00:01:25.149> have<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.479> be<00:01:26.409> in<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.740> moment<00:01:26.920> and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
7a you just have to be in the moment and

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.980 
7a you just have to be in the moment and
I<00:01:27.670> think<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.149> doesn't<00:01:28.390> matter<00:01:28.509> but<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.780> great

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
I think it doesn't matter but the great

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.219 
I think it doesn't matter but the great
it's<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:31.119> keep<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.420> mental<00:01:31.720> strengths

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
it's just to keep the mental strengths

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.830 
it's just to keep the mental strengths
really<00:01:32.649> really<00:01:32.979> tight<00:01:33.190> it's<00:01:33.819> also<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.300> focus

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
really really tight it's also the focus

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.740 
really really tight it's also the focus
during<00:01:35.649> free<00:01:35.979> soloing<00:01:36.340> which<00:01:37.119> pursues<00:01:37.569> you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
during free soloing which pursues you

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.249 
during free soloing which pursues you
around<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:39.250> over<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.030> lots<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.509> metal<00:01:40.720> holders

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
around and over a lots of metal holders

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.740 
around and over a lots of metal holders
and<00:01:41.500> we're<00:01:42.369> really<00:01:42.610> know<00:01:43.060> exactly<00:01:43.509> what's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
and we're really know exactly what's

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.440 
and we're really know exactly what's
happening<00:01:44.110> right<00:01:44.259> now<00:01:44.319> so<00:01:44.470> it's<00:01:44.830> important<00:01:45.310> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
happening right now so it's important to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.620 
happening right now so it's important to
stay<00:01:46.450> focused<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.200> do<00:01:47.619> your<00:01:47.920> thing<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.630> keep

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
that in mind that there's still the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.120 
that in mind that there's still the
potential<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.460> fall<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:53.530> staying<00:01:54.039> in

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
potential to fall so like staying in

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.120 
potential to fall so like staying in
balance<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.640> know

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.190 

you<00:01:58.130> know<00:01:58.280> what's<00:01:58.610> happening<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.210> train<00:01:59.540> you
