00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.740
 will welcome on the top 13:00 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.589
 the cheapest L-series three 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.719
 equipment and have us the lgl 35 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.820
 smartphone what you are here with a 3.2 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.860
 inch display can see that is still 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.299
 A little cheaper is the 11 40 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.060
 that here right now in the picture 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.890
 Both have very late displays that all 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.180
 services 3 5 inches but you can 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 that's why the colors are so unique 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.830
 I have now once in the image 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.109
 is a bit pale than the 11 35 ml 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.090
 40 display is called ten states 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.239
 this is my last pixel resolution 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.670
 here we have 1515 wittenberg 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.680
 are the technical data and look forward 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.620
 us 100 4.4 kitkat I like that and that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.780
 dual sim phone back are you too 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.489
 love to have it on you , of course 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.530
 we do not joke but how 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.870
 said a 3 megapixel camera and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.969
 not switch off in some markets 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.680
 everywhere a tv tuner more in there what 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.690
 Of course it is really cool if we 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.030
 Maybe the football we are looking 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.100
 want 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.729
 Headphone jack volume control 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.729
 micro usb and of course microphone on 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.250
 multi application store possible though 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.850
 you multi settings 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.990
 Excuse me 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.990
 home button 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.310
 show that actually 4 1 34 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.310
 happens by going conceptually 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.670
 she is at the top of the camaraderie 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.670
 also click on it 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.700
 and here is pretty much 44 207 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.190
 important that we have a present here 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.300
 systems with a dual-core processor 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.620
 as do very well in the browser on 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.980
 websites can stand by the 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.970
 speed is wonderful 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.460
 keyboard is really very clear to me 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.160
 try writing something down 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.170
 Halo is still quite good we can 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.150
 of course also turn and with it 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.610
 a little bit bigger and my big one 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.320
 We should also finger him he will be quite 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.720
 good to write here because it should 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.100
 not being smaller , actually, like on 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:19.780
 an iphone os has 3.2 inches for a short time 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.780
 look at the camera for a moment 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.480
 the camera as mentioned from above itself 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.860
 now relatively little on display dennis 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.200
 black but otherwise the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.030
 speed is quite good at 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.450
 you have to stop and that is too 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.900
 right 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.610
 without waiting now even micro sd 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.739
 map also makes sense because we have otherwise 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.750
 really not much memory i 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.550
 say you just missed it would have only 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.550
 to be ready 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 our storage is then unique 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.120
 that we still have two gb 1 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.400
 she made somebody flights available 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.910
 really have that little bit now 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.580
 do not say yet 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.780
