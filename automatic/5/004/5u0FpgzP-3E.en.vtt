00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.160
 Professor Tomás Antonio speaks to you

 animal physiology 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.740
 acoustic qualities of the voice 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.410
 There are three acoustic qualities of the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.180
 voice 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:36.200
 the tone 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.200
 the intensity or volume and the timbre 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.740
 the tone or height of the sound is expressed 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.010
 physically by frequency 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.589
 fundamental voice 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.890
 which represents the number of times 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.120
 the vocal cords open and close by 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.350
 second 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.160
 its unit of measure is the hearst or 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.160
 cycles per second 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.370
 the hard of the voice can be medium sharp 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.220
 serious 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:15.350
 greater amount of vibrations in a 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.250
 lapse results in a sharp tone 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.479
 and the least amount of vibrations 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.479
 correspond to a serious tone 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 in women for example the larynx is 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.970
 smaller the vocal folds are very 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.450
 thin and therefore vibrate faster 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:42.610
 This causes the tone more 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:45.930
 sharp or the female voice and the voices 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.280
 children are acute 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.740
 while in man the larynx 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.490
 regularly the folds are larger 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.650
 vowels are thicker and longer as 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:06.530
 consequence they vibrate more slowly what 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.530
 that generates that his tone is serious 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:18.010
 the intensity or volume of the voice makes 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:23.120
 reference to the power of a sound 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.849
 physically expressed as intensity 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.989
 the intensity is the product of the 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:34.060
 amplitude of the wave and its unit is the 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.060
 decibel or decide 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:46.159
 for that reason it is convenient that when 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:49.849
 we want to indicate to someone that he gives 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:52.670
 the voice to make heard the right thing is 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.959
 tell him to raise the volume of the voice 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.650
 let the intensity rise because that is the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:05.439
 quality that allows your voice to be heard 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.439
 in a larger acoustic space 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.520
 as for the bell this is the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.890
 personality of the voice 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.150
 and it has to do with various parameters 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:25.900
 annexes such as the form and capacity 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:31.299
 of the oral cavity 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:35.319
 and the pharynx the oropharynx 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.650
 nasopharynx the disposition of the 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.019
 teeth the palate the tongue and others 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.970
 characteristics that vary from one 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:50.890
 person to another even in people of 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.359
 the same family including morochos 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.359
 or twins 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.730
 it is important to note that when 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.530
 speak on the phone for example with 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.730
 frequency tends to confuse the voice 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.850
 of one person with that of another over everything 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.000
 As already indicated if it is some 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.370
 Close relative 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.440
 this is because on the way 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.350
 telephone does not propagate well the doorbell 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.080
 we only hear the frequency 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.620
 fundamental of the voice when speaking for 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.620
 phone 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.650
 we've talked about the phonatory system 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.480
 acoustic qualities of the voice 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.330
 measurement parameters 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.900
 Professor Tomás Antonio spoke to them
