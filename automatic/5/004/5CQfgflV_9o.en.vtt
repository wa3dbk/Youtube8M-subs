00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
item here and this is the the macro so

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.970 
item here and this is the the macro so
you<00:04:21.459> push<00:04:21.700> down<00:04:21.730> over<00:04:22.180> here<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:23.650> macro

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
you push down over here and the macro

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.310 
you push down over here and the macro
setting<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:25.300> for<00:04:26.170> close<00:04:26.560> up<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:27.520> get<00:04:27.670> easy<00:04:27.880> to

focus<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.620> close<00:04:29.860> up<00:04:30.010> items<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.580> that's<00:04:30.760> what

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
focus on close up items and that's what

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.830 
focus on close up items and that's what
the<00:04:30.970> macro<00:04:31.270> does<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.850> just<00:04:33.880> kind<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.300> toggle

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
the macro does so just kind of toggle

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.280 
the macro does so just kind of toggle
through<00:04:35.110> those<00:04:35.260> most<00:04:36.070> of<00:04:36.220> us<00:04:36.340> so<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.550> show<00:04:36.970> you

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
through those most of us so you show you

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.880 
through those most of us so you show you
the<00:04:38.640> self-portrait<00:04:39.640> so<00:04:40.600> you<00:04:40.660> could<00:04:42.300> have<00:04:43.300> it

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
the self-portrait so you could have it

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.830 
the self-portrait so you could have it
after<00:04:44.890> so<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.580> pushed<00:04:45.850> a<00:04:45.940> button<00:04:46.060> you'll<00:04:46.810> see

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
after so I pushed a button you'll see

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.840 
after so I pushed a button you'll see
that's<00:04:47.140> counting<00:04:47.560> down<00:04:47.740> we'll<00:04:48.610> turn<00:04:48.790> that

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
that's counting down we'll turn that

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.130 
that's counting down we'll turn that
around<00:04:49.090> have<00:04:49.450> no<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.630> don't<00:04:49.810> have<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:49.960> picture

to see that in the bottom here there is
a<00:05:11.410> slot<00:05:11.890> put<00:05:12.400> this<00:05:12.550> in<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.540> just<00:05:13.690> put<00:05:13.810> it

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
a slot put this in and I just put it

upside down I know I hit right so that

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.810 
upside down I know I hit right so that
goes<00:05:17.410> in<00:05:17.590> like<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:17.920> and<00:05:18.130> then<00:05:18.610> you're<00:05:18.730> going

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
computer and it's going to auto

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.640 
computer and it's going to auto
recognize<00:05:22.270> it<00:05:22.510> you<00:05:22.810> can<00:05:22.930> also<00:05:23.080> hook<00:05:23.290> it<00:05:23.440> up<00:05:23.530> to

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
recognize it you can also hook it up to

recognize it you can also hook it up to
your<00:05:23.680> television<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:24.490> kind<00:05:24.970> of<00:05:25.060> look<00:05:25.390> through

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
it through these cables here if you

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.550 
it through these cables here if you
wanted<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:28.150> unhook<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.380> have<00:05:29.500> to

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560

push down on that button and then
release<00:05:31.300> it<00:05:31.450> if<00:05:31.540> you<00:05:31.600> try<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:31.840> pull<00:05:32.020> it<00:05:32.110> out

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
release it if you try to pull it out

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.780 
release it if you try to pull it out
without<00:05:32.320> pushing<00:05:32.590> down<00:05:32.860> on<00:05:32.890> that<00:05:33.010> could<00:05:33.640> be<00:05:33.760> a

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
without pushing down on that could be a

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.380 
without pushing down on that could be a
problem<00:05:34.030> so<00:05:34.330> be<00:05:34.870> careful<00:05:35.200> that
