00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you can learn a lot of cool techniques

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.080 
you can learn a lot of cool techniques
from<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.710> all<00:00:37.710> right<00:00:37.890> cool<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.309> let's<00:00:38.579> jump

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
from them all right cool so let's jump

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670 
from them all right cool so let's jump
right<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.989> tutorial<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.559> be

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
right in this tutorial is going to be

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.860 
right in this tutorial is going to be
fairly<00:00:40.920> short<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.309> sweet<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.090> outward<00:00:42.420> K<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
fairly short and sweet the outward K is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.049 
fairly short and sweet the outward K is
a<00:00:42.899> pretty<00:00:43.140> simple<00:00:43.500> sound<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.219> learn<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
a pretty simple sound to learn but it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
a pretty simple sound to learn but it
just<00:00:45.210> takes<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.690> lot<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.020> practice<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.680> able

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
just takes a lot of practice to be able

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.360 
just takes a lot of practice to be able
to<00:00:47.100> use<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.700> beat<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:49.190> employ<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> in

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
to use it in a beat and employ it in

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.250 
to use it in a beat and employ it in
different<00:00:50.760> combinations<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.719> make<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.140> sound

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
different combinations to make it sound

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.100 
different combinations to make it sound
really<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.710> cool<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
really really cool so I think the the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470 
really really cool so I think the the
outward<00:00:55.500> K<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:56.039> get<00:00:56.160> broken<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.760> two<00:00:57.090> main

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
outward K can get broken into two main

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
outward K can get broken into two main
steps<00:00:57.870> basically<00:00:58.530> you're<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.010> saying<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
steps basically you're just saying a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.670 
steps basically you're just saying a
word<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> hard<00:01:01.289> case<00:01:01.590> ound<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.219> kite

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
word with a hard case ound like kite

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.980 
word with a hard case ound like kite
you're<00:01:04.680> taking<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.309> K<00:01:05.760> sound<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.479> you're

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you're taking that K sound and you're

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.899 
you're taking that K sound and you're
just<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.500> accenting<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> you're<00:01:08.729> putting

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
just really accenting it you're putting

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
just really accenting it you're putting
a<00:01:09.060> lot<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.330> air<00:01:09.570> behind<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.960> building<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
a lot of air behind it building a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.190 
a lot of air behind it building a
pressure<00:01:11.090> in<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.810> mouth<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
pressure in the back of your mouth and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.070 
pressure in the back of your mouth and
then<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:14.010> projecting<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> K<00:01:15.000> sound<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.900> if

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
then really projecting the K sound so if

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020 
then really projecting the K sound so if
you're<00:01:16.200> saying<00:01:16.500> kite<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.520> aggressively

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you're saying kite really aggressively

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.350 
you're saying kite really aggressively
you'd<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.049> kite<00:01:19.619> kite<00:01:20.520> kite<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you'd be like kite kite kite so that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.310 
you'd be like kite kite kite so that
brings<00:01:24.509> us<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.780> step<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.409> step<00:01:26.070> two<00:01:26.430> is

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
brings us to step two step two is

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
brings us to step two step two is
removing<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> vocalization<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.430> I've<00:01:29.640> talked

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
removing the vocalization as I've talked

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
removing the vocalization as I've talked
about<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.329> previous<00:01:30.450> tutorials<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.350> just

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
about in previous tutorials and just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.030 
about in previous tutorials and just
reducing<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.790> word<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.049> hard<00:01:34.439> K<00:01:34.710> sound

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
reducing the word to that hard K sound

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.440 
reducing the word to that hard K sound
like<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:39.530> my<00:01:40.530> case<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.979> feel<00:01:41.310> air<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.180> both

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
like in my case I feel air going on both

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.490 
like in my case I feel air going on both
sides<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.990> my<00:01:43.110> mouth<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.229> as<00:01:46.229> an<00:01:46.350> aside

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
sides of my mouth and just as an aside

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370 
sides of my mouth and just as an aside
the<00:01:47.159> outward<00:01:47.549> K<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.090> me<00:01:48.329> also<00:01:48.869> turns<00:01:49.170> into

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the outward K for me also turns into

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.859 
the outward K for me also turns into
kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.399> quacks<00:01:50.700> scratch<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
kind of the the quacks scratch and the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
kind of the the quacks scratch and the
the<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.100> hard

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the the really hard

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.780 
the the really hard
duck<00:01:53.790> snare<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.470> Kenny<00:01:55.740> uses<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> uses

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
duck snare I think Kenny uses it it uses

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.929 
duck snare I think Kenny uses it it uses
it<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.270> well<00:01:57.600> but<00:02:00.829> that's<00:02:01.829> all<00:02:02.040> outward<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it as well but that's all outward and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.560 
it as well but that's all outward and
I'm<00:02:03.119> basically<00:02:03.600> making<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.579> really

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
I'm basically making it and then really

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.910 
I'm basically making it and then really
pushing<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> air<00:02:07.320> out<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
pushing the air out it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.020 
pushing the air out it
with<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.160> hard<00:02:08.460> case<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
with a hard case so it's like a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.360 
with a hard case so it's like a
combination<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.690> quack<00:02:10.380> scratch<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
combination the quack scratch and the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.690 
combination the quack scratch and the
hard<00:02:11.580> cape<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.680> once<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.190> those<00:02:14.430> two

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
hard cape but once you have those two

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.150 
hard cape but once you have those two
steps<00:02:14.880> down<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.410> hard<00:02:16.650> K<00:02:16.860> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
steps down you have the the hard K and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.640 
steps down you have the the hard K and
you<00:02:17.430> remove<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.880> vocalization<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:19.350> can

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you remove the vocalization you can

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.570 
you remove the vocalization you can
isolate<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.819> dow<00:02:21.120> word<00:02:21.360> k<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:22.220> then<00:02:23.220> put<00:02:23.459> it

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
isolate the dow word k and then put it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.770 
isolate the dow word k and then put it
in<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:24.030> B<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.940> takes<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.240> while<00:02:30.270> to

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
in a B so like it just takes a while to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.190 
in a B so like it just takes a while to
build<00:02:30.990> up<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.130> force<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.870> build<00:02:33.870> up<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
build up the the force and build up the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.050 
build up the the force and build up the
power<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:34.980> word<00:02:35.310> K<00:02:35.489> but<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.030> a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
power in that word K but it can be a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.590 
power in that word K but it can be a
really<00:02:36.420> really<00:02:36.989> strong<00:02:37.350> sound<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.069> use<00:02:38.220> in

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
really really strong sound to use in

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.150 
really really strong sound to use in
combinations<00:02:40.220> one<00:02:41.220> example<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:42.770> using<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
combinations one example is using the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.820 
combinations one example is using the
out<00:02:44.310> word<00:02:44.580> K<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:45.060> rapid<00:02:45.690> succession<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.380> like

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
out word K in rapid succession like like

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.509 
out word K in rapid succession like like
I<00:02:46.950> did<00:02:47.130> earlier<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:48.560> kind<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.769> fill<00:02:50.130> or

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
I did earlier as kind of like a fill or

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.509 
I did earlier as kind of like a fill or
a<00:02:50.550> transition<00:02:51.030> between<00:02:51.300> beats<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.370> an

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
a transition between beats so as an

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:00.680 
a transition between beats so as an
example<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.880> kind<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.330> cool<00:03:00.540> little

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
example like so kind of a cool little

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.590 
example like so kind of a cool little
combination<00:03:01.080> but<00:03:01.950> yeah<00:03:02.100> there's<00:03:02.580> not<00:03:03.150> much<00:03:03.330> to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
combination but yeah there's not much to

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.380 
combination but yeah there's not much to
that<00:03:03.810> technique<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.670> practice<00:03:06.120> really

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
that technique just just practice really

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.680 
that technique just just practice really
hard<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.900> try<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.140> try<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.120> speed<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.150> up<00:03:09.360> over

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
hard and try to try to speed it up over

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.380 
hard and try to try to speed it up over
time<00:03:10.070> eventually<00:03:11.070> you'll<00:03:11.220> be<00:03:11.370> able<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.730> do

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
time eventually you'll be able to do

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.630 
time eventually you'll be able to do
some<00:03:12.540> really<00:03:12.660> cool<00:03:12.840> stuff<00:03:12.900> with<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.489> so<00:03:14.489> yeah

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
some really cool stuff with it so yeah

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.370 
some really cool stuff with it so yeah
as<00:03:14.820> always<00:03:15.269> take<00:03:15.510> care<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.989> hopefully<00:03:16.170> you

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
as always take care and hopefully you

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.289 
as always take care and hopefully you
guys<00:03:16.530> learn<00:03:16.769> something<00:03:19.910> hmm

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
guys learn something hmm

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.049 
guys learn something hmm
80<00:03:21.540> fits<00:03:21.870> out
