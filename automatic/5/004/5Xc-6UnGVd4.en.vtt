valve<00:00:05.450> basically<00:00:06.450> they<00:00:06.569> designed<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.109> for

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
valve basically they designed this for

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.560 
valve basically they designed this for
the<00:00:07.880> Volkswagen<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:08.970> Audi<00:00:09.090> 1.8<00:00:09.719> turbos<00:00:11.570> it's

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
the Volkswagen and Audi 1.8 turbos it's

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.930 
the Volkswagen and Audi 1.8 turbos it's
set<00:00:12.750> up<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.080> can<00:00:13.320> adjust<00:00:13.679> what<00:00:14.519> percentage

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
set up so you can adjust what percentage

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.240 
set up so you can adjust what percentage
you<00:00:15.690> want<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:16.199> back<00:00:16.379> towards<00:00:16.770> your<00:00:16.949> turbo

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
you want going back towards your turbo

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.130 
you want going back towards your turbo
or<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:18.060> percentage<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.869> to

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
or what percentage you want going to

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.599 
or what percentage you want going to
your<00:00:19.320> go<00:00:20.220> into<00:00:20.400> atmosphere<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.390> take<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.779> top

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
your go into atmosphere you take the top

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.340 
your go into atmosphere you take the top
twist<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> top<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.150> close<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.840> little<00:00:25.050> valve

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
twist the top to close this little valve

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.009 
twist the top to close this little valve
on<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> inside<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.460> okay<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.660> tells<00:00:27.900> you

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
on the inside there okay so it tells you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.089 
on the inside there okay so it tells you
basically<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.769> shows<00:00:29.750> how<00:00:30.750> much<00:00:30.929> actual<00:00:31.920> air

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
basically it shows how much actual air

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.700 
basically it shows how much actual air
pressure<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.850> through<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.329> valve

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
pressure is going through that valve

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.080 
pressure is going through that valve
okay<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.329> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.510> change<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:38.670> set<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> up

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
okay and you can change it to set it up

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
okay and you can change it to set it up
so<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.510> beat<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.020> straight<00:00:40.440> diverter

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
so that it can beat a straight diverter

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.569 
so that it can beat a straight diverter
valve<00:00:41.520> by<00:00:42.180> taking<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:43.280> block<00:00:44.280> plate

got to take it off with the vice grips

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.490 
got to take it off with the vice grips
or<00:00:55.829> something<00:00:56.190> pretty<00:00:57.000> tight<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.350> can

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
or something pretty tight and you can

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.020 
or something pretty tight and you can
block<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.890> off<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.250> way<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.520> make<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.850> a

diverter valve if you keep that little
out<00:01:18.240> holes<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.150> change<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.689> that

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
out holes you know change it so that

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.550 
out holes you know change it so that
closes<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.400> hole<00:01:23.790> off<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> little<00:01:24.360> better

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.810 

basically<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> don't<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
basically I don't know if you can see it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.539 
basically I don't know if you can see it
very<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:32.750> there's<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.840> whole<00:01:34.189> turn<00:01:35.189> though

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.230 

turn<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> dial<00:01:38.850> counterclockwise

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
and close it opposite direction opens it

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:58.469 
and close it opposite direction opens it
back<00:01:49.929> up<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.799> side<00:01:57.299> all<00:01:58.299> right

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
back up this is a side all right

back up this is a side all right
they<00:01:59.289> open<00:02:00.219> up<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.459> hole<00:02:00.640> for<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:00.969> diverter

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
they open up the hole for the diverter

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.289 
they open up the hole for the diverter
valve<00:02:01.539> as<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.409> can<00:02:02.590> see<00:02:02.799> on<00:02:03.069> this<00:02:03.520> side<00:02:03.819> it's<00:02:04.179> a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
valve as you can see on this side it's a

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.870 
valve as you can see on this side it's a
lot<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.630> further<00:02:05.560> open<00:02:05.979> than<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.549> other<00:02:06.700> side
