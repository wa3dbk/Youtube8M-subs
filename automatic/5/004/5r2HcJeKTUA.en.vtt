00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:09.840
 and hello everyone with you a40 today we 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.500
 let's play in such an unusual mug as 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.110
 dota 2 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.420
 I think at least one of you has heard of 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.520
 she might even have someone play well 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.850
 did not play play abdomen standing 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.580
 I recommend it so today I start 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 the transfer which I will 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.300
 inspect unusual sets of items 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.460
 not the usual practice of playing for quite 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 ordinary heroes well or 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.489
 interesting and ambiguous let's 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.159
 let's start today in the release of i tactics with 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.859
 using dagon and characters 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.469
 bounty hunter and laundry 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.420
 I think you all know these characters 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.139
 you think never let program 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.799
 let's see let's start with the spider hunter 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:54.510
 and since you know it is magical 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.629
 wand which is at the maximum level 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.229
 pumping can cause 600 damage to one 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.339
 touch and this item is very useful and 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.439
 I will probably start with my bounty hunter 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.780
 bounty hunter can bring to come 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.750
 the enemy let Len and so here 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.340
 just you midas 600 damage from on and 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.869
 kretov beat out an opponent if he is all 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.170
 still survived can use 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.569
 Africa say so and go to 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.689
 the next character is our next 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.149
 characters and become lone druid and to 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.289
 we will have to implement our tactics with 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.179
 1 level park forest go to the forest and 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.369
 starting to farm actually but instead 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.829
 let's buy the original items 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.649
 100 goal pass this but do not rush to buy 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.689
 we will need the following dagon items 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.819
 what are you palestrina memory about anri jim 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.219
 the master who we will eventually put 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.219
 bear and which is its time of course 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.049
 add a bear can 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.659
 initially our mage bears are not with 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.530
 energy booster he will have 250 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.259
 mana to implement dogon and now we can 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.259
 their bear and send the hero to the fountain 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.099
 he won't need you anymore 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.139
 spawn point exception 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.670
 Now imagine such a situation 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:14.870
 quietly standing hero is not a video 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.120
 farm well low hp and here comes the bear 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.209
 well, what does the bear do that bring them back 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 far away and so here he is again bang 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.780
 over the opponent and all the opponents feel 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.889
 pain and humiliation burning chairs blaze 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.260
 already adjacent rooms 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:32.840
 I think you understand what the hell 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.940
 tactics I advise you to use it extremely 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.239
 accurately and we finish 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.220
 opponents involved participating command 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.099
 battles and finish off the remaining 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.109
 opponents coupons sweat time from 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.760
 play time these contracts and we can 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.669
 buy though more precisely and necessarily 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.980
 buy bags arcana to regenerate 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:55.340
 manu just on the spot so what 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.889
 we are upgrading after we buy arcane 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.720
 the very beginning in pairs to the forest and it will be 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.609
 the easiest victory in your life so 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.160
 how to kill our hero slicing and who doesn't 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.710
 you can 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.190
 but notice 2 achievement up to five minutes 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.280
 fk 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.430
 server with throw out for not participating in the game and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.060
 you get iliev which is very bad 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.670
 so I advise you not to buy arcane 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.600
 at least occasionally, and not using the first 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.220
 skill by 3 teleport hero then you are not 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.940
 you will be lost then you will not be banned 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:32.030
 for the fish and thanks for watching 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.030
 you were asuras and good luck everyone
