want those things that we can do them

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.919 
want those things that we can do them
safely<00:01:49.729> then<00:01:50.090> absolutely<00:01:50.539> there<00:01:50.749> are<00:01:50.779> a<00:01:50.840> lot

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
safely then absolutely there are a lot

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.019 
safely then absolutely there are a lot
of<00:01:50.959> really<00:01:51.289> nice<00:01:51.439> options<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.520> plastic

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:53.029 
of really nice options is plastic

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:54.899 
of really nice options is plastic
surgery<00:01:53.240> being<00:01:53.599> overdone<00:01:53.929> in<00:01:54.109> this<00:01:54.229> country<00:01:54.590> I

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
surgery being overdone in this country I

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.249 
surgery being overdone in this country I
think<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.270> think<00:01:56.389> it's<00:01:56.659> again<00:01:56.840> as<00:01:56.959> part<00:01:57.139> of

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
think so I think it's again as part of

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.409 
think so I think it's again as part of
our<00:01:57.439> media<00:01:57.619> it's<00:01:57.979> part<00:01:58.279> of<00:01:58.340> our<00:01:58.520> culture<00:01:59.179> that

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
our media it's part of our culture that

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.690 
our media it's part of our culture that
people<00:02:00.049> seem<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.739> want<00:02:00.919> to<00:02:00.979> overdo<00:02:01.340> things<00:02:01.579> but

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
people seem to want to overdo things but

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.629 
people seem to want to overdo things but
I<00:02:01.729> think<00:02:01.819> it's<00:02:02.209> mostly<00:02:02.739> in<00:02:03.739> a<00:02:03.919> select<00:02:04.310> group<00:02:04.369> of

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
I think it's mostly in a select group of

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.069 
I think it's mostly in a select group of
people<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:05.060> think<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.299> average<00:02:05.479> person<00:02:05.989> that

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
people I think the average person that

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.929 
people I think the average person that
comes<00:02:06.319> to<00:02:06.469> my<00:02:06.590> office<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.159> not<00:02:07.310> looking<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.849> be

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
comes to my office is not looking to be

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.490 
comes to my office is not looking to be
overdone<00:02:08.330> for<00:02:08.479> anything<00:02:08.690> that's<00:02:09.350> what

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
overdone for anything that's what

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.240 
overdone for anything that's what
they're<00:02:09.649> afraid<00:02:09.740> of

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
they're afraid of

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.560 
they're afraid of
they're<00:02:10.580> thinking<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:10.940> know<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.090> don't<00:02:11.420> want

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
they're thinking you know I don't want

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.390 
they're thinking you know I don't want
to<00:02:11.630> look<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.140> person<00:02:12.380> on<00:02:12.650> TV<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:13.040> want<00:02:13.340> to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
to look like that person on TV I want to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.890 
to look like that person on TV I want to
do<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.880> nice<00:02:14.090> way<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.540> very<00:02:14.570> natural

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
do this in a nice way in a very natural

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.620 
do this in a nice way in a very natural
way<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.710> think<00:02:15.950> we're<00:02:16.610> seeing<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.210> overdone

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
you don't see them but could they blend

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.170 
you don't see them but could they blend
in<00:02:21.200> they<00:02:21.350> look<00:02:21.560> nice<00:02:21.860> they<00:02:22.100> look<00:02:22.280> natural<00:02:22.460> what

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
in they look nice they look natural what

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
oh absolutely I think too many people

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.300 
oh absolutely I think too many people
want<00:03:30.020> to<00:03:30.140> come<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.530> have<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.950> done<00:03:31.130> and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
want to come in have it done and

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.950 
want to come in have it done and
relieved<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:31.910> have<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.270> be<00:03:32.390> perfect<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:32.870> think

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
relieved and have it be perfect I think

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.260 
relieved and have it be perfect I think
that's<00:03:33.290> too<00:03:34.220> quick<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:34.700> it's<00:03:34.850> not<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.090> right

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
that's too quick and it's not the right

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.059 
that's too quick and it's not the right
way<00:03:35.420> if<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.660> do<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.960> the<00:03:36.080> right<00:03:36.260> way<00:03:36.319> you<00:03:36.890> give

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
way if you do it the right way you give

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.800 
way if you do it the right way you give
it<00:03:37.160> some<00:03:37.370> time<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.940> prep<00:03:38.420> yourself

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
it some time you prep yourself

at<00:04:12.740> this<00:04:12.860> with<00:04:13.010> real<00:04:13.130> ly<00:04:13.250> this<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.520> not<00:04:13.700> normal

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
at this with real ly this is not normal

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.300 
at this with real ly this is not normal
so<00:04:14.630> we<00:04:14.750> took<00:04:14.930> her<00:04:15.110> and<00:04:15.380> basically<00:04:16.009> took<00:04:16.160> the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
so we took her and basically took the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.009 
so we took her and basically took the
implants<00:04:16.669> back<00:04:16.819> out<00:04:17.060> put<00:04:17.359> them<00:04:17.749> in<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.900> right

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
down the good plastic surgeon cannot

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.379 
down the good plastic surgeon cannot
only<00:04:35.520> do<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.729> procedure<00:04:36.090> with<00:04:36.210> less

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
only do the procedure with less

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.390 
only do the procedure with less
complications<00:04:37.199> but<00:04:37.590> also<00:04:37.770> fix<00:04:38.220> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
complications but also fix the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.770 
complications but also fix the
complication<00:04:38.940> if<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.150> have<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.569> and<00:04:39.690> this

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
complication if you have that and this

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.390 
complication if you have that and this
is<00:04:39.900> an<00:04:39.990> example<00:04:40.319> of<00:04:40.409> that<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.710> then<00:04:40.949> the<00:04:41.159> next

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
is an example of that and then the next

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.180 
is an example of that and then the next
one<00:04:41.520> we<00:04:41.669> have<00:04:41.699> is<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.210> picture<00:04:42.659> of<00:04:42.840> lips<00:04:43.560> lips<00:04:44.069> I
