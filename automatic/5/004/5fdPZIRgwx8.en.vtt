 Register Security Bureau Ma was why this time of drivers fuse songs I mean Tsu frame also Attanda 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.460
 But from now on Then something two both 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:10.170
 By and now Yes variously studded with things that are common Asmodian immediately this kneaded theme is still 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.390
 It may be different , but it is the momentum that I'm giving out that Ray Zeon , or strength from friends 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.280
 say 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:19.000
 Those Tteyuu you strength for the game that boy has also met do it but how etc. 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:24.159
 If you are up, you have something else 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.790
 It would be nice if I could express something that was a very delicate member 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.110
 Also what 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.409
 Where Tteyuu Yeah I did wanted to let anything or really Mello because there was as theme 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.679
 Well 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.840
 I watched the opening video 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.770
 It was super school etc 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.070
 I will color 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.440
 That 's because it is said that this video was hard 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.240
 Oh 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:49.820
 On the other care a little different work from apparently Hanashiani in Super Tsu Na wonder these strange 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.540
 Is that Mr. Ishida who became a part of the Kanekai boundary 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.200
 There was also a piece of work that I raised last year , but that also 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.920
 I was was the Kyoto Animation's Yaro if even that of the director's 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.420
 It's a great all star for me if I'm participating 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.330
 Something was also asked to lift the song I mean frame stuffy with rear softening degree up this 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.840
 Softening its Naa It also became key, such as 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.260
 That they submitted 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.870
 I would say that it is very good for the song 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.170
 I am very happy that I felt like I received some kind of return in a form that I could put out my best 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.959
 The 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.170
 Though it was great, I was not able to match the song because I had a match with Toei. 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.830
 Although the audience is female you jumper I saw 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.690
 I do not know something 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:41.020
 Synergies also respect each other in the form of training 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:44.550
 So the contents of the lyrics, Bellows and of course the impressions are also perfect or that's great safely 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.770
 Yeah it becomes a thing of the on which partnered 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.600
 That is 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:53.270
 It's amazing how many times you want to watch it 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.510
 I wonder how the ending will be 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.800
 We still do not sell water that seems to be only the opening 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.540
 The production in real ne other people Gane Ijikitanaku in neon city Sokoiji is in just bad people 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.180
 Please show me your color 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.870
 Hey you 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.680
 But it is so far this time that so-called 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.640
 That kind of solidarity desert like the example desert 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.140
 Is it a genius that has never before been shown to the director's genius? 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:27.380
 One year old five years old Toka described and Kasae described Reprinted not it have Isa'm a genius 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:31.819
 By do seems to become all behalf summer at all Yes eccentric weirdo No Yay A'iya ending 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.000
 It is more than saying that the song 10,000 yen is so trendy and I am looking forward to it 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.000
