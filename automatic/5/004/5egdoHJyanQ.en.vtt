computer-assisted coding first of all
what<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.620> it

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
what is it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.920 
what is it
why<00:00:15.120> do<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.540> need<00:00:15.930> it<00:00:16.610> okay<00:00:17.610> as<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.810> is

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
why do I need it okay as to what it is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.490 
why do I need it okay as to what it is
this<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.950> ahima<00:00:20.369> definition<00:00:21.349> it<00:00:22.349> is

this is in ahima definition it is

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.609 
this is in ahima definition it is

review in validation by a human coder
now<00:00:34.430> in<00:00:35.430> Florida<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.750> told<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.440> stop

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
now in Florida I was told to stop

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.680 
now in Florida I was told to stop
talking<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> human<00:00:38.730> coder<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
talking about a human coder because it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.100 
talking about a human coder because it
makes<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.079> sound<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.350> robots<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.840> say

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
makes it sound like robots so if I say

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
makes it sound like robots so if I say
Jane<00:00:43.590> I'm<00:00:43.920> talking<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.940> human<00:00:45.149> coder

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
Jane I'm talking about the human coder

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.680 
Jane I'm talking about the human coder

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
if it's if if it's alright very straight

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.760 
if it's if if it's alright very straight
forwards<00:00:50.000> standard<00:00:51.000> coding<00:00:51.510> process<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.560> no

computer-assisted<00:00:53.430> coding<00:00:53.840> you<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:54.990> an<00:00:55.110> EMR

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
computer-assisted coding you have an EMR

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.710 
computer-assisted coding you have an EMR
or<00:00:55.680> electronic<00:00:56.400> records<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> some<00:00:57.150> sort<00:00:57.510> are

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
or electronic records of some sort are

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.770 
or electronic records of some sort are
reviewed<00:00:58.260> by<00:00:58.290> Jane<00:00:58.800> who<00:00:59.489> puts<00:00:59.760> codes<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:00.480> an

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
reviewed by Jane who puts codes into an

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.050 
reviewed by Jane who puts codes into an
encoder<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.470> they<00:01:02.100> flow<00:01:02.370> through<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.790> billing

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
encoder and they flow through to billing

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.820 
encoder and they flow through to billing
so<00:01:03.680> fairly<00:01:04.680> standard

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
so fairly standard

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.690 
so fairly standard
if<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:08.570> add<00:01:08.810> CAC<00:01:09.410> there's<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.310> little<00:01:10.550> bit<00:01:10.670> of

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
if you add CAC there's a little bit of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.670 
if you add CAC there's a little bit of
complexity<00:01:11.390> down<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.900> bottom<00:01:12.230> left<00:01:12.530> corner

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
complexity down the bottom left corner

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.280 
complexity down the bottom left corner
but<00:01:13.310> basically<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.240> same<00:01:14.510> process

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
but basically it's the same process

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.400 
but basically it's the same process
the<00:01:15.560> codes<00:01:15.860> flow<00:01:16.580> from<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.030> system<00:01:17.720> Jane

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
the codes flow from the system Jane

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.190 
the codes flow from the system Jane
reviews<00:01:18.830> them<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.670> only<00:01:19.790> difference<00:01:20.270> now<00:01:20.360> is

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
reviews them the only difference now is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.890 
reviews them the only difference now is
that<00:01:21.260> it's<00:01:22.220> as<00:01:22.430> if<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.730> junior<00:01:23.120> coder<00:01:23.390> has<00:01:23.660> been

that it's as if a junior coder has been

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.870 
that it's as if a junior coder has been
through<00:01:24.230> and<00:01:24.470> has<00:01:24.560> pre<00:01:24.860> coded<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.370> chat<00:01:25.610> for

not the understand image you're getting
then<00:01:50.330> I<00:01:50.420> would<00:01:50.540> ask<00:01:50.660> why<00:01:51.010> you<00:01:52.010> know<00:01:52.130> what<00:01:52.400> is

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
then I would ask why you know what is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.520 
then I would ask why you know what is
the<00:01:52.670> improvement<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.510> justifies<00:01:54.260> a<00:01:54.290> big

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
the improvement it justifies a big

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.350 
the improvement it justifies a big
change<00:01:56.200> now<00:01:57.200> why<00:01:57.980> am<00:01:58.130> i<00:01:58.190> doing<00:01:58.490> CSC<00:01:59.090> well

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
change now why am i doing CSC well

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.910 
change now why am i doing CSC well

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.300 
you'll find the electronic chat
somewhere<00:02:26.900> sometimes<00:02:27.739> on<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.100> left

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
somewhere sometimes on the left

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.000 
somewhere sometimes on the left
sometimes<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.239> right<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:30.530> there's<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.770> set

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
sometimes on the right and there's a set

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.949 
sometimes on the right and there's a set
of<00:02:31.130> codes<00:02:31.430> which<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.120> case<00:02:32.360> are<00:02:32.600> on<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
of codes which in this case are on the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.800 
of codes which in this case are on the
top<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.470> basically<00:02:34.390> what<00:02:35.390> I'm<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.570> going<00:02:35.750> to

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
top and basically what I'm just going to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.960 
top and basically what I'm just going to
do<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.080> if<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.260> click<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:36.770> button<00:02:37.100> there<00:02:37.459> what

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
do is if I click that button there what

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.610 
do is if I click that button there what
then<00:02:38.209> happens<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.230> computer

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
then happens is that the computer

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.920 
then happens is that the computer
analyzes<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.489> available<00:02:40.970> documentation<00:02:41.540> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
analyzes the available documentation and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.340 
analyzes the available documentation and
produces<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.950> set<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.370> codes<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:44.660> now<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.930> job

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
produces a set of codes so now the job

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.620 
produces a set of codes so now the job
for<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.650> human<00:02:46.010> coder<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.209> look<00:02:47.390> through

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
for the human coder is to look through

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.800 
for the human coder is to look through
those<00:02:47.750> codes<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.530> just<00:02:49.130> satisfy<00:02:49.810> herself

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
those codes and just satisfy herself

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.990 
those codes and just satisfy herself
that<00:02:51.620> she<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.040> content<00:02:52.489> with<00:02:52.670> what<00:02:52.820> they're

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
that she is content with what they're

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.970 
that she is content with what they're
showing<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.630> if<00:02:54.500> she<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.830> she<00:02:55.640> moves<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.980> so

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
showing and if she is she moves on so

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.690 
showing and if she is she moves on so
I'm<00:02:58.730> sure<00:02:59.330> that<00:03:00.080> most<00:03:00.980> people<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:01.640> not

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
I'm sure that most people if not

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.340 
I'm sure that most people if not
everybody<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:02.750> audience<00:03:02.900> will

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
everybody in this audience will

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.650 
everybody in this audience will
immediately<00:03:03.739> see<00:03:04.340> how<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.940> could<00:03:05.269> be<00:03:05.300> making

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
immediately see how this could be making

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.759 
immediately see how this could be making
a<00:03:06.160> difference<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.340> any<00:03:07.519> organization<00:03:08.769> and

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
a difference in any organization and

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.190 
a difference in any organization and
these<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.940> course<00:03:11.090> are<00:03:11.330> radiology<00:03:12.910> but

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
these of course are radiology but

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.010 
these of course are radiology but
I<00:03:15.260> mean<00:03:15.879> I'm<00:03:16.879> sure<00:03:17.180> I'm<00:03:17.330> not<00:03:17.480> as<00:03:17.569> good<00:03:17.720> as<00:03:17.840> your

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
I mean I'm sure I'm not as good as your

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.630 
I mean I'm sure I'm not as good as your
coders<00:03:18.470> but<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:18.830> can<00:03:19.099> work<00:03:19.280> my<00:03:19.310> way<00:03:19.610> through

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
coders but I can work my way through

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.729 
coders but I can work my way through
these<00:03:20.410> relatively<00:03:21.410> quickly<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:22.849> I<00:03:23.420> guess<00:03:23.739> the

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
these relatively quickly and I guess the

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.440 
these relatively quickly and I guess the
other<00:03:24.920> point<00:03:25.160> for<00:03:25.430> me<00:03:25.580> is<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.940> don't<00:03:26.120> get<00:03:26.300> as

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
other point for me is I don't get as

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.990 
other point for me is I don't get as
tired<00:03:26.750> when<00:03:27.560> you're<00:03:27.739> trying<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.400> code<00:03:28.700> quickly

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
tired when you're trying to code quickly

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.620 
tired when you're trying to code quickly
there's<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:29.599> wash<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.709> detail<00:03:31.239> comes<00:03:32.239> over

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
there's this wash of detail comes over

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.660 
there's this wash of detail comes over
you<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.110> after<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> while<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:33.739> get<00:03:33.920> weary<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
you and after a while you get weary and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.130 
you and after a while you get weary and
you<00:03:34.730> start<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.180> maybe<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.660> start<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:35.959> make

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
you start to maybe you start to make

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.900 
you start to maybe you start to make
more<00:03:36.290> mistakes<00:03:36.440> than<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.010> might<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.610> or<00:03:37.819> you

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
more mistakes than you might like or you

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.330 
more mistakes than you might like or you
start<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.209> slow<00:03:38.480> down<00:03:38.769> this<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:39.890> not<00:03:40.040> tiring

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
start to slow down this is not tiring

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.670 
start to slow down this is not tiring
and<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:41.330> efficiency<00:03:41.810> improvements<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.530> can

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
and the efficiency improvements you can

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.830 
and the efficiency improvements you can
expect<00:03:43.130> are<00:03:43.400> such<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.239> can<00:03:44.390> encourage

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
expect are such that you can encourage

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.050 
expect are such that you can encourage
coders<00:03:45.379> to<00:03:45.410> take<00:03:45.650> breaks<00:03:45.950> what<00:03:46.580> we<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.819> here

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
coders to take breaks what we have here

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.640 
coders to take breaks what we have here
is<00:03:47.150> what<00:03:47.299> we<00:03:47.420> call<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:47.750> case<00:03:48.049> master

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
is what we call the case master

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.830 
is what we call the case master
application<00:03:48.799> which<00:03:49.519> is<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> wide-ranging<00:03:50.540> tool

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
application which is a wide-ranging tool

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.140 
application which is a wide-ranging tool
which<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.380> bringing<00:03:51.739> together<00:03:52.069> some<00:03:52.910> of<00:03:52.970> the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
which is bringing together some of the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.420 
which is bringing together some of the
information<00:03:53.810> which<00:03:54.110> has<00:03:54.410> been<00:03:54.470> available<00:03:55.220> all

information which has been available all

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.819 
information which has been available all
along<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:56.720> which<00:03:56.930> we're<00:03:57.110> now<00:03:57.260> starting<00:03:57.530> to

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
along in which we're now starting to

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.280 
along in which we're now starting to
harness<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:59.390> first<00:03:59.660> thing<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.019> like<00:04:00.170> to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
harness and the first thing that like to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.030 
harness and the first thing that like to
share<00:04:00.530> with<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:01.160> hid<00:04:01.670> in<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.060> game<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
share with you is hid in the game and

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.160 
share with you is hid in the game and
what<00:04:04.280> hid<00:04:04.549> in<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> game<00:04:04.970> is<00:04:05.239> is<00:04:05.450> what<00:04:05.630> Susan

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
what hid in the game is is what Susan

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.589 
what hid in the game is is what Susan
referred<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.680> earlier<00:04:07.160> which<00:04:07.730> is<00:04:07.970> if<00:04:08.360> I'm

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
referred to earlier which is if I'm

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.259 
referred to earlier which is if I'm
doing<00:04:08.630> cholecystectomy<00:04:09.470> x'<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:10.040> there's<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.120> a

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
doing cholecystectomy x' and there's a a

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.990 
doing cholecystectomy x' and there's a a
batch<00:04:11.599> of<00:04:11.840> them<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.340> get<00:04:13.340> pretty<00:04:13.519> good<00:04:13.610> at<00:04:13.790> those

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
batch of them I get pretty good at those

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.460 
batch of them I get pretty good at those
you<00:04:14.269> know<00:04:14.360> I'm<00:04:14.450> starting<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.930> move<00:04:15.079> through

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
you know I'm starting to move through

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.110 
you know I'm starting to move through
them<00:04:15.620> very<00:04:15.650> quickly<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.370> my<00:04:16.579> head's<00:04:16.850> in<00:04:17.090> the

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
them very quickly and my head's in the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.180 
them very quickly and my head's in the
game<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.780> know<00:04:17.840> what<00:04:18.200> I'm<00:04:18.320> looking<00:04:18.739> for<00:04:19.040> on

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
game and I know what I'm looking for on

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.819 
game and I know what I'm looking for on
the<00:04:19.310> codes<00:04:19.639> are<00:04:19.970> familiar<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.200> start<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.650> get

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
the codes are familiar so I start to get

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.279 
the codes are familiar so I start to get
very<00:04:22.430> very<00:04:22.669> quick<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.830> if<00:04:24.830> we<00:04:25.460> can<00:04:25.669> group<00:04:26.289> the

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
very very quick and if we can group the

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.129 
very very quick and if we can group the
cases<00:04:27.740> together<00:04:27.919> in<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.669> fashion<00:04:28.970> we<00:04:29.840> start

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
cases together in that fashion we start

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.140 
cases together in that fashion we start
to<00:04:30.289> multiply<00:04:30.530> our<00:04:31.130> efficiencies<00:04:31.789> and<00:04:32.030> we

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
to multiply our efficiencies and we

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150 
to multiply our efficiencies and we
start<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.570> reduce<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:33.260> tiredness<00:04:33.680> which<00:04:34.010> the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
start to reduce the tiredness which the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.219 
start to reduce the tiredness which the
coder<00:04:34.400> feels<00:04:34.729> when<00:04:35.570> she's<00:04:35.720> working<00:04:36.080> quickly

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
coder feels when she's working quickly

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.290 
coder feels when she's working quickly
I'm<00:04:36.950> gonna<00:04:37.160> choose<00:04:37.460> normal<00:04:37.760> mammogram

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
I'm gonna choose normal mammogram

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.969 
I'm gonna choose normal mammogram
because<00:04:38.570> there<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.020> one<00:04:39.169> that's<00:04:39.320> often<00:04:39.710> chosen

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
because there is one that's often chosen

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.360 
because there is one that's often chosen
and<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:41.450> system<00:04:41.780> goes<00:04:41.990> out<00:04:42.229> and<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:42.710> grabs<00:04:42.979> a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
and the system goes out and it grabs a

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.909 
and the system goes out and it grabs a
seat<00:04:43.729> of<00:04:43.970> uncoded<00:04:44.720> normal<00:04:45.020> mammograms<00:04:45.530> and

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
seat of uncoded normal mammograms and

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.430 
seat of uncoded normal mammograms and
what<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:46.130> do<00:04:46.220> now<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:47.120> my<00:04:47.479> head's<00:04:47.720> in<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.930> game<00:04:48.020> I

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
what I do now is my head's in the game I

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.330 
what I do now is my head's in the game I
know<00:04:49.600> from<00:04:50.600> past<00:04:50.900> experience<00:04:51.169> what<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.070> codes

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
know from past experience what the codes

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.940 
know from past experience what the codes
are<00:04:52.820> for<00:04:53.210> normal<00:04:53.600> mammograms<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.380> basically

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
are for normal mammograms and basically

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.610 
are for normal mammograms and basically
all<00:04:55.130> I'm<00:04:55.400> doing<00:04:55.729> as<00:04:56.539> I'm<00:04:56.840> checking<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.440> see<00:04:57.590> a

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
all I'm doing as I'm checking I see a

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.980 
all I'm doing as I'm checking I see a
bio<00:04:57.919> reads<00:04:58.190> one<00:04:58.460> there<00:04:58.669> I<00:04:58.940> can<00:04:59.510> see<00:04:59.720> it<00:04:59.840> as<00:04:59.960> a

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
bio reads one there I can see it as a

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.640 
bio reads one there I can see it as a
screening<00:05:00.380> mammogram<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.510> over<00:05:02.510> here<00:05:02.960> that

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
screening mammogram and over here that

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.620 
screening mammogram and over here that
little<00:05:03.830> star<00:05:04.220> is<00:05:04.580> actually<00:05:04.970> telling<00:05:05.210> me<00:05:05.450> that

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
little star is actually telling me that

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.960 
little star is actually telling me that
this<00:05:05.780> meets<00:05:06.050> medical<00:05:06.530> necessity<00:05:07.099> so<00:05:07.849> I'm<00:05:07.970> done

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
this meets medical necessity so I'm done

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.960 
this meets medical necessity so I'm done
and<00:05:10.970> I'm<00:05:11.930> done

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
and I'm done

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.860 
and I'm done
and<00:05:14.970> I'm<00:05:15.300> done<00:05:16.069> so<00:05:17.069> you<00:05:17.759> you<00:05:18.030> know<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.720> can

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
and I'm done so you you know you can

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.050 
and I'm done so you you know you can
imagine<00:05:18.990> how<00:05:19.650> quickly<00:05:20.069> you<00:05:20.460> can<00:05:20.639> work<00:05:20.879> your

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
imagine how quickly you can work your

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.279 
imagine how quickly you can work your
way<00:05:21.240> through<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.810> without<00:05:21.990> getting

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
way through that without getting

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.899 
way through that without getting
exhausted<00:05:23.569> now<00:05:24.569> that's<00:05:25.169> really<00:05:25.650> good<00:05:26.099> and<00:05:26.370> to

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
exhausted now that's really good and to

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.730 
exhausted now that's really good and to
my<00:05:27.000> own<00:05:27.030> disadvantage<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:28.020> would<00:05:28.229> say<00:05:28.439> to<00:05:28.500> you

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
my own disadvantage I would say to you

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.920 
my own disadvantage I would say to you
make<00:05:29.639> sure<00:05:29.669> you've<00:05:30.120> got<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.330> problem<00:05:30.629> with

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
make sure you've got a problem with

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.439 
make sure you've got a problem with
screening<00:05:31.409> mammograms<00:05:31.889> before<00:05:32.699> you<00:05:33.090> start

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
screening mammograms before you start

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:34.850 
screening mammograms before you start
using<00:05:33.659> something<00:05:34.050> like<00:05:34.199> that<00:05:34.530> in<00:05:34.740> your

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
using something like that in your

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.830 
using something like that in your
decision-making<00:05:35.310> because<00:05:35.909> unless<00:05:36.659> you've

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
decision-making because unless you've

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.990 
decision-making because unless you've
got<00:05:37.020> huge<00:05:37.319> amounts<00:05:37.560> of<00:05:37.949> them<00:05:38.129> you're<00:05:38.849> not

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
got huge amounts of them you're not

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.999 
got huge amounts of them you're not
going<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.360> experience<00:05:39.780> this<00:05:40.229> kind<00:05:40.500> of<00:05:40.590> benefit

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
going to experience this kind of benefit

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.010 
going to experience this kind of benefit
what's<00:05:41.550> happened<00:05:41.969> is<00:05:42.120> that<00:05:42.659> as<00:05:42.840> you've<00:05:42.990> been

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
what's happened is that as you've been

doing<00:05:43.199> all<00:05:43.680> of<00:05:43.710> us<00:05:43.919> work<00:05:44.189> we<00:05:44.580> suddenly

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:44.879 
doing all of us work we suddenly

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.760 
doing all of us work we suddenly
realized<00:05:45.509> there's<00:05:45.810> a<00:05:45.870> huge<00:05:46.349> amount<00:05:46.650> of

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
realized there's a huge amount of

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.709 
realized there's a huge amount of

the data is the year you start looking
at<00:07:10.939> efficiency<00:07:11.629> and<00:07:11.930> accuracy<00:07:12.379> and<00:07:12.949> then<00:07:13.129> you

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:13.279 
at efficiency and accuracy and then you

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.670 
at efficiency and accuracy and then you
start<00:07:13.550> looking<00:07:13.610> at<00:07:13.939> head<00:07:14.209> in<00:07:14.360> the<00:07:14.479> game

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
start looking at head in the game

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.110 
start looking at head in the game
opportunities<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:15.889> then<00:07:16.610> you<00:07:16.759> start<00:07:17.060> looking

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
opportunities and then you start looking

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.070 
opportunities and then you start looking
at<00:07:17.449> workforce<00:07:18.129> opportunities<00:07:19.539> this<00:07:20.539> is<00:07:20.719> big

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
at workforce opportunities this is big

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.619 
at workforce opportunities this is big
this<00:07:21.409> is<00:07:21.589> Sam<00:07:21.949> this<00:07:22.459> is<00:07:22.639> it's<00:07:23.209> even<00:07:23.360> bigger

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:23.629 
this is Sam this is it's even bigger

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:26.379 
this is Sam this is it's even bigger
than<00:07:23.749> I<00:07:23.930> thought<00:07:24.669> and<00:07:25.669> you<00:07:26.029> know<00:07:26.120> which<00:07:26.240> is

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389 
than I thought and you know which is

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.559 
than I thought and you know which is
great<00:07:26.979> I'm<00:07:27.979> really<00:07:28.639> excited<00:07:28.969> about<00:07:29.209> it

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:29.569 
great I'm really excited about it

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:31.420 
great I'm really excited about it
hopefully<00:07:30.409> you'll<00:07:30.589> agree<00:07:30.830> that<00:07:30.919> we're<00:07:31.219> on<00:07:31.309> the

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.430 
hopefully you'll agree that we're on the

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.929 
hopefully you'll agree that we're on the
right<00:07:31.580> path

00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:31.939 
right path

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:33.549 
right path
and<00:07:32.360> that<00:07:32.629> this<00:07:32.839> is<00:07:32.899> the<00:07:33.050> sort<00:07:33.379> of<00:07:33.439> stuff

00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:33.559 
and that this is the sort of stuff

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:42.570 
and that this is the sort of stuff
that's<00:07:33.919> going<00:07:34.039> to<00:07:34.159> make<00:07:34.249> a<00:07:34.279> big<00:07:34.550> difference

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.639
