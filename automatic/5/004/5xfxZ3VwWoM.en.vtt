00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.690
 everyone expected good evening 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.000
 change in circulation 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.449
 atmospheric is now a reality 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 currents no longer come from the north since 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.570
 Northern Europe and North Atlantic but from 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.769
 west then from the ocean of ours 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.190
 latitudes 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.860
 therefore they are mild and humid and not 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.070
 there are strong contrasts between the air that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.840
 arrives and the air is resistant and therefore 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.050
 no longer happens as before 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.600
 when the cold air arrived 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.489
 surely one was in conflict 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.770
 once entry of the Mediterranean and the 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.140
 time was very unstable now time is 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.780
 much calmer is certainly not always 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.830
 peaceful but there are large areas of the evening 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.560
 of clear with some thickening and with 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.570
 some episodic precipitation almost 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.650
 weather characteristics also for i
