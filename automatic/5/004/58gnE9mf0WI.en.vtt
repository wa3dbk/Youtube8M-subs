 attractive sound image 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.730
 that is why 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.550
 moving objects irritate the retina 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.860

 rule 3 reminders developed 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.420
 American presentation masters 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.200
 the most important information should 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.330
 to sound 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 several times so in the beginning 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.370
 presentations briefly say what will be 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.030
 talk in the course of speaking more

 current in public speaking act 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.850
 same laws as in show business

 before giving the main information 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.160

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.820
 fact 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.160
 Of course you need to prepare such an impromptu 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.290
 it is known in advance that there are more chances 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.500

 each stage of your speech

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.390
