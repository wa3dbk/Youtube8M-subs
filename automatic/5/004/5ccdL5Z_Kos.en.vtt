00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.970
 alternating blue hedgehog all 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.859
 fans were uneasy is that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.810
 being sincere there are too many 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.460
 thorns of this character that have 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.560
 remained to owe the concern was 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 quickly became a nuisance to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.849
 to know that such a game would be racing 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.700
 which made us remember the lousy 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.100
 sony card of this great although the work 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.170
 the sumo study seemed impossible 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.719
 digital managed to surprise own and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.850
 strangers sony cancer or stars racing 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.710
 had some factors that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 they became a worthy exponent of the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.910
 gender was so the table was left 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.620
 put so that added it will improve the formula 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.930
 in the sequel we are pleased to be able 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 confirm that they have done it 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.160
 truly this sequel 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.809
 elevates the concept of traditional 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.210
 kart racing creating a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.980
 unique experience in several aspects already 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.750
 before we could run in vehicles 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.670
 different in a game but the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.510
 Transformers concept goes much more 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 there 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.120
 the vehicles become fast 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 powerful cars motorized boats or 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.330
 spectacular aircraft but the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.310
 environment itself can change while 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.710
 develops the career like this is while 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.780
 you drive a part of the highway you can 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.600
 be destroyed to give way to an intense 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.880
 aerial pursuit the different tracks 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 that we visit are based again 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 in recognized levels of titles 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.490
 Classics of the company is inevitable 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.040
 let nostalgia take over us 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
 constantly, especially when traveling 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.940
 the streets of the tribe already reflected in 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.910
 jets was lost or the slopes of a 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.370
 super monkey ball temple in case 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.080
 little also popular note franchises 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.360
 or of worship have the opportunity to 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.320
 shine again such is the case of sky 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 so crap 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.790
 ginobili after burner go the next and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.860
 several more the best thing about this is to see them 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.770
 come alive in high definition like 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.690
 before we could only have imagined just 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.490
 like the previous stars version of 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.960
 various sega franchises form 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.800
 part of the character roster 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.470
 available 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.179
 sonic do not cause vitola are some of 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.890
 the icons that we can initially 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.840
 control as we go completing 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.599
 challenges we will unlock 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.540
 So many among them I like Julius or 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.730
 bait we even have some 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.069
 invited personalities we refer 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.390
 no less than the rap fortachÃ³n 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.910
 demolisher next to danica patrick 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.560
 recognized nascar driver according to 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.660
 what we expected browse driving 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.099
 peculiar demolition vehicle while 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.379
 that is unique take the wheel of a 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.510
 brand new professional car in style 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.760
 similar to one of formula one despite 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.590
 these additions we regret that certain 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.379
 members of the previous installment have 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.120
 stayed out of this edition when playing 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.040
 on our own we have the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.380
 modalities that are already a standard of 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.329
 grand prix and soul genre and single 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.250
 beige on this occasion the missions or 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.290
 major challenges that will be part of the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.620
 previous release were integrated into a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 category called world tour now is not 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.280
 necessary to complete each one for 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.110
 finish the game as they are divided into 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.360
 chapters within which there 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.549
 alternate routes to avoid one another 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.620
 mission in this respect we are presented 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.599
 several challenges go through hoops 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.000
 bright or avoid crashing by the way 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.890
 time against other cars this by 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.380
 name some of them 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.450
 the multiplayer is composed of two 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.610
 main categories the first of 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.860
 they are the inevitable way for four 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.600
 players locally this is a 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.490
 alternative that so far follows 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.140
 being for many the only way to 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.670
 enjoy racing karts 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.860
 virtual in addition to the races 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.660
 they included combat arenas where the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.610
 participants cast endless 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.110
 objects to eliminate the rivals can 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.030
 mention that when playing on screen 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.000
 divided the quality of the graphics is 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.130
 reduces a little bit on the other hand the option 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.260
 of multiplayer online is pretty 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.030
 complete we can participate in simple 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.160
 racing against opponents from around the 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.110
 world but it is also possible to create a 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.090
 game with personalized rules in 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.040
 against our friends at the end 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.660
 every competition in our place in the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.120
 international ranking will change 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.769
 depending on our performance in 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.450
 regarding the technical aspects 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.400
 we have three points to highlight 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.530
 visually the game is usually 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.330
 spectacular because the gigantic 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.100
 scenarios boast endless 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.200
 details or events that occur while 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.000
 we run in them in the same way 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.850
 soundtrack presents remixes of 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.169
 classic melodies of that saga 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.610
 We consider that most of the topics 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.680
 they are worthy of being heard 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.659
 attentively by the fans of the 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.610
 company finally we love that the 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.349
 characteristics of the characters can 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.599
 be modified once we win 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.400
 experience using those in this way 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.379
 At last we will enjoy our corridor 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.879
 favorite forgetting to have to 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.909
 select another with better 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.830
 statistics however you have to write down 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.409
 that the experience is not free of 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.300
 failures approximately three times 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.280
 the game did not change our way 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.990
 vehicle in the indicated area causing 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.150
 that we could not complete the event 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.539
 likewise from time to time the action in 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.560
 suddenly begins to be encouraged 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.750
 Normally when one of the players 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.849
 activates its special power these errors 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.830
 they are not enough to stop 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.259
 catalog ashton and can stars racing 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.150
 transform as one of the best games 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.340
 of the genre of all time though 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.719
 do not be fanatical about the properties of 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.189
 sega or karts 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:17.630
 it's worthwhile that you experience the 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:20.300
 transformation of virtual careers 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.920
