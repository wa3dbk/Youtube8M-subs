here is that if I wanted to change the

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.990 
here is that if I wanted to change the
you<00:01:34.810> park<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.409> something<00:01:35.770> else<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.220> would<00:01:36.820> just

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
you park to something else I would just

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.780 
you park to something else I would just
long<00:01:37.240> press<00:01:37.439> go<00:01:38.439> through<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.460> let<00:01:39.610> go

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
- you've for example um and then the

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.039 
- you've for example um and then the

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
cool thing is that you can pretty

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.690 
cool thing is that you can pretty
quickly<00:01:53.380> change<00:01:53.829> between<00:01:53.890> what<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.670> happening

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
quickly change between what is happening

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.420 
quickly change between what is happening
and<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.630> quick<00:01:56.380> text<00:01:56.680> as<00:01:56.920> they<00:01:57.040> call<00:01:57.280> it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
and and quick text as they call it

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.850 
and and quick text as they call it
it's<00:01:57.640> basically<00:01:58.180> with<00:01:58.869> dictionary<00:01:59.649> and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
it's basically with dictionary and

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.160 
it's basically with dictionary and
without<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.939> that's<00:02:01.299> that's<00:02:01.630> pretty<00:02:01.780> nice<00:02:02.020> as

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
