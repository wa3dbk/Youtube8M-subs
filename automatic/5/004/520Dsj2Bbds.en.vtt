00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that's that's when the easiest ways to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.819 
that's that's when the easiest ways to
get<00:00:53.250> kills<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.870> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.140> figuring<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
get kills so I was kind of figuring I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.520 
get kills so I was kind of figuring I
was<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.550> well<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.239> can't<00:00:58.170> remember<00:00:58.410> how<00:00:58.500> many

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
was like well I can't remember how many

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
was like well I can't remember how many
cuz<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:58.920> got<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> game<00:00:59.309> before<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> was<00:00:59.850> like

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
cuz i got the game before but I was like

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.119 
cuz i got the game before but I was like
you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:00.840> it'd<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.680> cool

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you know I think it'd be kind of a cool

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
you know I think it'd be kind of a cool
i<00:01:02.190> did<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> run<00:01:03.329> care<00:01:03.570> packages<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> my

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
i did to run care packages one of my

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.440 
i did to run care packages one of my
killstreaks<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.920> use<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.400> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.060> camford

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
killstreaks and use and kind of camford

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.070 
killstreaks and use and kind of camford
to<00:01:06.540> build<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:06.869> kill<00:01:07.080> streak<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.470> higher<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.010> uh

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
to build my kill streak up higher and uh

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.609 
to build my kill streak up higher and uh
maybe<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:12.299> thought<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.930> something<00:01:13.290> really

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
maybe and I thought be something really

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.730 
maybe and I thought be something really
kinda<00:01:13.950> unique<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:16.259> thinking<00:01:16.320> things

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
kinda unique so I was thinking things

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
kinda unique so I was thinking things
around<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:17.759> run<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
around like you know what I'll run the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.840 
around like you know what I'll run the
nuke<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.250> but<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:20.700> not

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
nuke with it but really I'm not

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520 
nuke with it but really I'm not
confident<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.479> ability<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> kill

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
confident in my ability to get a kill

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
confident in my ability to get a kill
streak<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.890> new<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.790> new<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.810> one

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
streak this new that's new for one

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
streak this new that's new for one
getting<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.650> new<00:01:25.770> control<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.520> extremely<00:01:27.090> hard

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
getting a new control is extremely hard

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.880 
getting a new control is extremely hard
unless<00:01:27.479> you're<00:01:27.780> boosting<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.560> really

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
unless you're boosting then it's really

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.120 
unless you're boosting then it's really
really<00:01:29.130> easy<00:01:29.360> but<00:01:30.439> actually<00:01:31.439> getting<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> legit

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
really easy but actually getting a legit

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
really easy but actually getting a legit
nuke<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.549> free<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.909> all<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.630> one

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
nuke and free for all I think it's one

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.090 
nuke and free for all I think it's one
of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> hardest<00:01:34.079> things<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
of the hardest things to do and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950 
of the hardest things to do and
especially<00:01:35.520> running<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.420> without<00:01:36.630> kill

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
especially running it without kill

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.010 
especially running it without kill
streaks<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> count<00:01:38.400> towards<00:01:38.790> your

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
streaks that a count towards your

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.240 
streaks that a count towards your
current<00:01:40.020> kill<00:01:40.229> streak<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.100> even

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
current kill streak I think it's even

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.179 
current kill streak I think it's even
harder<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.990> decided<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> run<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> pave<00:01:43.979> low

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
harder so I decided to run the pave low

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.760 
harder so I decided to run the pave low
in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> middle<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> didn't<00:01:46.740> want

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
in the middle just because I didn't want

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.859 
in the middle just because I didn't want
to<00:01:46.890> run<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> AC<00:01:47.520> 130<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.180> chopper<00:01:48.600> gunner<00:01:48.780> I

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to run like a AC 130 or chopper gunner I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.139 
to run like a AC 130 or chopper gunner I
think<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.200> those<00:01:49.409> kick<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> soil<00:01:50.670> nukes

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
think that those kick on the soil nukes

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
think that those kick on the soil nukes
at<00:01:51.360> times<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
at times just because they you can get a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.950 
at times just because they you can get a
ridiculous<00:01:53.880> amount<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.270> kills<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
ridiculous amount of kills for that the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.389 
ridiculous amount of kills for that the
most<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:55.350> paid<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.710> gonna<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.070> like

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
most you're paid was gonna get you like

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.780 
most you're paid was gonna get you like
I<00:01:56.670> mean<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:58.040> anywhere<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.100> four<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.549> seven

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
I mean like anywhere from four to seven

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.219 
I mean like anywhere from four to seven
kills<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.210> actually<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.540> he<00:02:00.659> gets<00:02:00.840> before

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
kills I actually think he gets before

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.649 
kills I actually think he gets before
and<00:02:01.770> I've<00:02:01.890> grid<00:02:02.310> sneak<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.030> me<00:02:03.180> right<00:02:03.390> there

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and I've grid sneak up on me right there

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.749 
and I've grid sneak up on me right there
but<00:02:03.899> he<00:02:04.049> misses<00:02:04.469> his<00:02:04.619> quick<00:02:04.920> scope<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.430> uh<00:02:05.579> I'm

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
but he misses his quick scope and uh I'm

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.320 
but he misses his quick scope and uh I'm
actually<00:02:06.420> able<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.489> spray<00:02:08.489> him<00:02:08.610> down<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.090> kid

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
actually able to spray him down this kid

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.040 
actually able to spray him down this kid
gets<00:02:09.569> his<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.129> it's<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.360> Harrier<00:02:12.360> rather<00:02:12.660> quickly

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
gets his a it's a Harrier rather quickly

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.460 
gets his a it's a Harrier rather quickly
because<00:02:13.319> I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
because I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380 
because I

I'm able to sneak out and out behind

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.870 
I'm able to sneak out and out behind

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
up but I know that since I just killed

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
up but I know that since I just killed
in<00:03:47.489> there<00:03:47.610> probably<00:03:47.880> move<00:03:48.060> into<00:03:48.269> another

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
in there probably move into another

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.990 
in there probably move into another
booster<00:03:49.049> spot<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.890> check<00:03:50.519> right<00:03:50.820> there

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
booster spot so I check right there

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.060 
booster spot so I check right there
behind<00:03:51.150> between<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.290> shed<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.799> fence

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
behind between that shed and the fence

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.890 
behind between that shed and the fence
there's<00:03:53.430> somebody<00:03:53.790> usually<00:03:54.030> there<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.750> then

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
there's somebody usually there and then

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.199 
there's somebody usually there and then
I<00:03:55.140> checked<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.920> most<00:03:56.100> obvious<00:03:56.310> spot<00:03:56.760> which<00:03:57.000> is

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
I checked the most obvious spot which is

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.630 
I checked the most obvious spot which is
the<00:03:57.480> gas<00:03:57.690> station<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.440> lo<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.100> behold<00:03:59.220> there

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
the gas station and lo and behold there

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.170 
the gas station and lo and behold there
in<00:03:59.760> here<00:03:59.910> boosting<00:04:00.390> which<00:04:01.350> kind<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:02.060> kind<00:04:03.060> of

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
in here boosting which kind of kind of

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.550 
in here boosting which kind of kind of
makes<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.450> think<00:04:03.600> who's<00:04:03.840> really<00:04:04.170> boosting

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
makes you think who's really boosting

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.140 
makes you think who's really boosting
here<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.709> mean<00:04:04.890> that's<00:04:04.980> six<00:04:05.400> kills<00:04:05.700> I've<00:04:05.880> gotten

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
here I mean that's six kills I've gotten

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.050 
here I mean that's six kills I've gotten
off<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.269> Boosters<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.519> there's<00:04:08.519> six<00:04:08.760> kills

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
off the Boosters and there's six kills

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.970 
off the Boosters and there's six kills
that<00:04:09.180> count<00:04:09.420> towards<00:04:09.720> my<00:04:09.780> kill<00:04:10.080> streak<00:04:10.380> which

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
that count towards my kill streak which

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.039 
that count towards my kill streak which
makes<00:04:11.250> me<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> happy<00:04:11.850> camper<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.660> was<00:04:12.840> not

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
makes me a happy camper but was not

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.720 
makes me a happy camper but was not
making<00:04:13.350> me<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.590> happy<00:04:13.950> camper<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.340> how<00:04:14.519> high<00:04:14.700> a

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
making me a happy camper is how high a

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.460 
making me a happy camper is how high a
heady<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.450> mean<00:04:15.600> he<00:04:15.690> said<00:04:15.870> he<00:04:16.019> has<00:04:16.140> three

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
heady is I mean he said he has three

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.219 
heady is I mean he said he has three
kills<00:04:16.739> on<00:04:16.979> me<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:18.330> know<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.660> saw<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.959> little

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
kills on me and I know that saw a little

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.589 
kills on me and I know that saw a little
bit<00:04:19.440> i<00:04:19.650> think<00:04:20.280> i<00:04:20.340> saw<00:04:20.519> three<00:04:20.880> kills<00:04:21.180> before<00:04:21.570> i

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
bit i think i saw three kills before i

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.409 
bit i think i saw three kills before i
get<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.049> nuke<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:23.000> start<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.090> get<00:04:24.240> really

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
get to the nuke and start to get really

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.120 
get to the nuke and start to get really
nervous<00:04:24.720> because<00:04:25.110> i<00:04:25.349> really<00:04:25.710> don't<00:04:25.919> want<00:04:26.070> to

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
nervous because i really don't want to

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.540 
nervous because i really don't want to
lose

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
lose

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.210 
lose
game<00:04:26.699> I<00:04:27.150> mean<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.259> this<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.919> kind<00:04:29.129> of

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
game I mean this is this is the kind of

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.619 
game I mean this is this is the kind of
game<00:04:29.370> that'll<00:04:29.639> make<00:04:29.789> you<00:04:29.940> break<00:04:30.240> one<00:04:30.479> who

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
game that'll make you break one who

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.029 
game that'll make you break one who
warfare<00:04:30.990> two<00:04:31.139> or<00:04:31.199> at<00:04:31.289> least<00:04:31.440> in<00:04:31.560> my<00:04:31.650> case<00:04:31.680> it

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
warfare two or at least in my case it

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.950 
warfare two or at least in my case it
will<00:04:32.190> because<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:33.180> know<00:04:33.270> I<00:04:33.300> don't<00:04:33.389> do<00:04:33.690> things

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
will because you know I don't do things

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.140 
will because you know I don't do things
like<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.139> often<00:04:34.590> but<00:04:35.099> when<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.460> do<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:36.030> they

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
like this often but when I do and they

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.300 
like this often but when I do and they
start<00:04:36.479> and<00:04:36.720> they're<00:04:36.900> going<00:04:37.319> good<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.770> just

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
start and they're going good it just

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.390 
start and they're going good it just
pisses<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.849> off<00:04:38.879> that<00:04:39.800> infinity<00:04:40.800> ward<00:04:41.039> hasn't

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
pisses you off that infinity ward hasn't

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.249 
pisses you off that infinity ward hasn't
done<00:04:41.520> anything<00:04:41.699> about<00:04:42.030> like<00:04:42.599> stupid<00:04:42.930> things

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
done anything about like stupid things

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.129 
done anything about like stupid things
like<00:04:43.349> boosting<00:04:44.009> which<00:04:45.000> I<00:04:45.300> guess<00:04:45.599> they're<00:04:45.960> kind

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
like boosting which I guess they're kind

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.180 
like boosting which I guess they're kind
of<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.349> blame<00:04:46.590> for<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.830> boosting

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
of the blame for the boosting

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.589 
of the blame for the boosting
free-for-all<00:04:47.669> too<00:04:47.849> because<00:04:48.150> they<00:04:48.240> took<00:04:48.389> out

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
free-for-all too because they took out

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.100 
free-for-all too because they took out
third<00:04:49.319> person<00:04:49.770> cage<00:04:50.009> match<00:04:50.780> even<00:04:51.780> though<00:04:51.990> you

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
third person cage match even though you

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.899 
third person cage match even though you
still<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.650> should<00:04:52.860> be<00:04:53.039> boosting<00:04:53.490> this<00:04:53.610> late

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
still you should be boosting this late

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.820 
still you should be boosting this late
into<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.120> game<00:04:54.389> like<00:04:54.659> it's<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:55.020> there's<00:04:55.770> no

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
into the game like it's just there's no

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.610 
into the game like it's just there's no
point<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:57.020> games<00:04:58.020> but<00:04:58.169> not<00:04:58.259> like<00:04:58.440> I

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
point to this games but not like I
