00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
I do is I pinch that last little bit of

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.919 
I do is I pinch that last little bit of
hair<00:01:26.319> between<00:01:26.920> my<00:01:27.069> fingers<00:01:27.429> and<00:01:27.700> as<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:28.630> pull<00:01:28.899> my

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
hair between my fingers and as I pull my

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.899 
hair between my fingers and as I pull my
fingers<00:01:29.560> out<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:29.950> pull<00:01:30.219> that<00:01:30.340> last<00:01:30.579> little<00:01:30.789> bit

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
fingers out I pull that last little bit

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.330 
fingers out I pull that last little bit
of<00:01:31.090> hair<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.600> middle<00:01:31.959> so<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.889> it<00:01:33.009> can<00:01:33.219> get

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
of hair to the middle so that it can get

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.919 
of hair to the middle so that it can get
curled<00:01:33.700> too<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.029> doesn't<00:01:34.299> end<00:01:34.420> up<00:01:34.539> straight

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
curled too and doesn't end up straight

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.690 
curled too and doesn't end up straight
because<00:01:35.679> I<00:01:35.799> think<00:01:35.889> that's<00:01:36.310> going<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.609> be

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
because I think that's going to be

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.120 
because I think that's going to be
people's<00:01:37.469> hardest<00:01:38.469> thing<00:01:38.649> is<00:01:38.799> making<00:01:38.979> sure

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
people's hardest thing is making sure

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.399 
people's hardest thing is making sure
that<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.639> ends<00:01:40.029> end<00:01:40.209> up<00:01:40.329> curly<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:40.899> see

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
that the ends end up curly and see

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.010 
that the ends end up curly and see
because<00:01:41.679> it's<00:01:41.859> in<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.039> middle<00:01:42.069> it's<00:01:42.459> still

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
because it's in the middle it's still

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.059 
because it's in the middle it's still
wrapping<00:01:44.020> with<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.349> and<00:01:44.469> I<00:01:44.499> have<00:01:44.649> this<00:01:44.799> nice

wrapping with it and I have this nice

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.179 
wrapping with it and I have this nice
curl<00:01:45.520> that's<00:01:46.179> going<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.479> be<00:01:46.569> curly<00:01:46.929> okay<00:01:47.229> so

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
curl that's going to be curly okay so

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.109 
curl that's going to be curly okay so
then<00:01:48.369> what<00:01:48.490> you're<00:01:48.609> going<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.759> do<00:01:48.909> is<00:01:49.029> you're

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
we're going to take the fold to the curl

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.160 
we're going to take the fold to the curl
and<00:01:59.920> give<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.950> nice<00:02:01.190> pinch<00:02:01.780> pull<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> little<00:02:03.050> bit

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
what you're going to do if you turn just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.449 
what you're going to do if you turn just
a<00:02:23.240> tiny<00:02:23.450> bit<00:02:23.720> you're<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.890> heat<00:02:25.070> this<00:02:25.250> up

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
a tiny bit you're going to heat this up

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.430 
a tiny bit you're going to heat this up
now<00:02:26.300> because<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:26.900> foil<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:27.350> a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
now because this is foil it's a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.720 
now because this is foil it's a
conductor<00:02:27.770> it's<00:02:28.070> going<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.280> get<00:02:28.370> nice<00:02:28.700> and

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
conductor it's going to get nice and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.910 
conductor it's going to get nice and
it's<00:02:29.090> going<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.270> get<00:02:29.390> warm<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.530> top<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
it's going to get warm so on top of the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.229 
it's going to get warm so on top of the
head<00:02:31.040> it's<00:02:31.220> not<00:02:31.280> as<00:02:31.489> big<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.790> deal<00:02:31.970> but<00:02:32.090> where

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
head it's not as big of a deal but where

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.060 
head it's not as big of a deal but where
you're<00:02:32.390> right<00:02:32.600> next<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.050> ears<00:02:33.230> you're

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
you're right next to the ears you're

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.340 
you're right next to the ears you're
going<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.250> want<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.720> hold<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.140> kind<00:02:36.260> of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
going to want to hold on to it kind of

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.510 
going to want to hold on to it kind of
bounce<00:02:36.530> around<00:02:36.680> it's<00:02:36.980> even<00:02:37.160> hot<00:02:37.280> on<00:02:37.430> my

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
bounce around it's even hot on my

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.710 
bounce around it's even hot on my
fingers<00:02:37.850> but<00:02:38.030> putting<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.300> right<00:02:38.480> on<00:02:38.630> her

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
nice thing to do so let it cool down

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.100 
nice thing to do so let it cool down
before<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.580> release<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:44.000> onto<00:02:44.390> her<00:02:44.540> face<00:02:44.720> okay

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
before you release it onto her face okay

and<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:46.310> like<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.790> heat<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:47.840> once<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:49.459> then

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
and I like to heat it up once and then

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.740 
and I like to heat it up once and then
go<00:02:49.700> over<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.910> one<00:02:50.000> more<00:02:50.030> time<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.510> it's<00:02:50.630> gonna

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
go over it one more time and it's gonna

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.410 
go over it one more time and it's gonna
be<00:02:50.900> warm<00:02:51.080> for<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.320> while<00:02:52.030> it's<00:02:53.030> gonna<00:02:53.120> be<00:02:53.269> one

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420

for a while so that's why we're kind of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
for a while so that's why we're kind of
leaving<00:02:57.350> them<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.530> we're<00:02:57.739> letting<00:02:57.920> them<00:02:58.010> cool

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
leaving them in we're letting them cool

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.460 
leaving them in we're letting them cool
down<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:58.940> make<00:02:59.269> sure<00:02:59.600> that<00:02:59.810> this<00:02:59.930> one<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.320> by
