this hardware and software and the
experiment<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.680> first<00:01:36.890> chance<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.310> really

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
experiment is the first chance to really

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.820 
experiment is the first chance to really
employ<00:01:38.450> those<00:01:38.659> systems<00:01:39.110> somewhere<00:01:39.680> outside

use<00:02:16.959> these<00:02:17.230> systems<00:02:17.739> in<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.280> real<00:02:18.640> world<00:02:18.910> we

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
use these systems in the real world we

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.800 
use these systems in the real world we
now<00:02:19.870> put<00:02:20.250> designers<00:02:21.250> software<00:02:22.239> engineers

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
now put designers software engineers

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.680 
now put designers software engineers
working<00:02:23.709> directly<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.880> soldiers<00:02:25.300> the

the<00:02:28.150> process<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.140> incorporate<00:02:29.709> that

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the process and then incorporate that

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.250 
the process and then incorporate that
into<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.280> design<00:02:30.610> that's<00:02:31.260> tremendously

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
into the design that's tremendously

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.840 
into the design that's tremendously
valuable<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.980> engineer<00:02:33.370> was<00:02:33.519> feverishly

valuable the engineer was feverishly

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.490 
valuable the engineer was feverishly
taking<00:02:34.300> notes<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.600> realizing<00:02:35.080> again<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.380> know

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
taking notes and realizing again I know

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.020 
taking notes and realizing again I know
what<00:02:35.800> I'm<00:02:35.890> doing<00:02:36.190> here<00:02:36.370> when<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.519> design<00:02:36.850> this

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
what I'm doing here when I design this

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.729 
what I'm doing here when I design this
piece<00:02:37.300> now<00:02:37.750> I've<00:02:37.959> got<00:02:38.140> some<00:02:38.380> guy<00:02:38.500> who's

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
piece now I've got some guy who's

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.990 
piece now I've got some guy who's
actually<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.370> using<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.790> then<00:02:39.910> they

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
actually going to be using it then they

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.610 
actually going to be using it then they
say<00:02:40.180> they<00:02:40.300> coming<00:02:40.600> up<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> better<00:02:41.080> system

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
say they coming up with a better system

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.199

so<00:03:17.320> my<00:03:17.500> job<00:03:18.040> was<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.340> secure<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> foothold<00:03:19.390> and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
so my job was to secure a foothold and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.140 
so my job was to secure a foothold and
we<00:03:21.200> push<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.500> sub<00:03:21.680> downtown<00:03:22.100> for<00:03:22.250> two<00:03:22.400> as<00:03:23.000> soon

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
we push the sub downtown for two as soon

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.060 
we push the sub downtown for two as soon
as<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.330> one<00:03:23.420> in<00:03:23.450> output<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.870> we<00:03:23.990> got<00:03:24.140> hit<00:03:24.320> so

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
as the one in output to we got hit so

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.500 
as the one in output to we got hit so
right<00:03:25.400> away<00:03:25.490> we<00:03:25.580> do<00:03:25.730> those<00:03:25.850> enemy<00:03:26.120> an<00:03:26.180> alpha<00:03:26.360> 2

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
right away we do those enemy an alpha 2

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.510 
right away we do those enemy an alpha 2

it<00:03:34.220> helps<00:03:34.370> my<00:03:34.490> guys<00:03:34.670> confidence<00:03:35.180> because<00:03:35.390> I

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
it helps my guys confidence because I

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.020 
it helps my guys confidence because I
