simple tip but honestly it does help a
lot<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> second<00:01:39.270> thing<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> try

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
lot but the second thing to do is to try

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289 
lot but the second thing to do is to try
and<00:01:40.500> move<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:40.950> sensitivity<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:42.030> high<00:01:42.270> as

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and move your sensitivity up as high as

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.960 
and move your sensitivity up as high as
possible<00:01:42.689> I'll<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:43.740> play<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.070> 14<00:01:44.729> now

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
possible I'll actually play on 14 now

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.420 
possible I'll actually play on 14 now
within<00:01:45.540> black<00:01:45.899> ops<00:01:46.140> 2<00:01:46.350> multiplayer<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
within black ops 2 multiplayer but I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
within black ops 2 multiplayer but I
actually<00:01:47.610> started<00:01:48.149> off<00:01:48.329> only<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.840> 10<00:01:49.170> when<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
actually started off only on 10 when the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.109 
actually started off only on 10 when the
game<00:01:49.619> first<00:01:49.649> came<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.579> gradually<00:01:50.729> moving

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
game first came out and gradually moving

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.639 
game first came out and gradually moving
up<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.500> imagine

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
up and up and up because if you imagine

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.440 
up and up and up because if you imagine
two<00:01:53.220> players<00:01:53.549> getting<00:01:53.850> into<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> gunfight

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
two players getting into a gunfight

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.149 
two players getting into a gunfight
where<00:01:54.780> they're<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:55.200> looking<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.740> each<00:01:55.860> other

others playing on 14 assuming they're

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.020 
others playing on 14 assuming they're
both<00:02:01.079> deadly<00:02:01.680> accurate<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.549> player<00:02:02.820> that's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
both deadly accurate the player that's

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.569 
both deadly accurate the player that's
on<00:02:03.149> 14<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.899> always<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.619> win<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.159> he

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
on 14 is always going to win because he

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.910 
on 14 is always going to win because he
can<00:02:05.790> lock<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.479> enemy<00:02:06.600> quicker<00:02:07.350> than

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
can lock on to the enemy quicker than

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.619 
can lock on to the enemy quicker than
the<00:02:08.069> player<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.789> 10<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the player that's on 10 now that of

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.080 
the player that's on 10 now that of
course<00:02:09.660> that's<00:02:09.989> just

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
course that's just

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.540 
course that's just
sort<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.450> made-up<00:02:11.810> scenario<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.920> idea<00:02:13.340> is

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
sort of made-up scenario but the idea is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.309 
sort of made-up scenario but the idea is
if<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.300> highest<00:02:14.450> sensitivity<00:02:14.840> and

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
if you on the highest sensitivity and

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.410 
if you on the highest sensitivity and
you<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.620> master<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.250> sensitivity<00:02:16.819> you're

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
you can master that sensitivity you're

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.479 
you can master that sensitivity you're
going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:17.989> winning<00:02:18.290> more<00:02:18.500> gunfights<00:02:19.040> but

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
going to be winning more gunfights but

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.910 
going to be winning more gunfights but
there's<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.060> disadvantage<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.900> using<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.739> higher

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
there's a disadvantage to using a higher

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.100 
there's a disadvantage to using a higher
sensitivity<00:02:22.310> in<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.690> fact<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.020> you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
sensitivity in that the fact that you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.110 
sensitivity in that the fact that you
lose<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.739> ability<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:25.220> make<00:02:25.459> slight

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
lose the ability to make slight

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.180 
lose the ability to make slight
adjustments<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.110> especially<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.920> close

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
adjustments and especially in close

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.550 
adjustments and especially in close
gunfights<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.030> becomes<00:02:29.569> harder<00:02:30.140> because

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
gunfights it becomes harder because

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.680 
gunfights it becomes harder because
you're<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> very<00:02:31.519> high<00:02:31.700> sensitivity<00:02:32.120> if<00:02:32.569> you

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
you're on a very high sensitivity if you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.030 
you're on a very high sensitivity if you
move<00:02:32.900> your<00:02:33.050> control<00:02:33.410> stick<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.680> little<00:02:33.800> bit<00:02:33.920> to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
move your control stick a little bit to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.040 
move your control stick a little bit to
the<00:02:34.099> left<00:02:34.130> or<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.640> right<00:02:34.730> you're<00:02:35.450> actually

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the left or to the right you're actually

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.620 
the left or to the right you're actually
moving<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.160> lot<00:02:37.370> more<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.030> left<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.599> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
moving a lot more to the left and to the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.850 
moving a lot more to the left and to the
right<00:02:38.750> than<00:02:39.080> if<00:02:39.200> you're<00:02:39.380> on<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.530> lower

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
right than if you're on a lower

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.380 
right than if you're on a lower
sensitivity<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:40.849> is<00:02:41.030> where<00:02:41.150> my<00:02:41.269> little

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
sensitivity and this is where my little

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.660 
sensitivity and this is where my little
secret<00:02:42.019> comes<00:02:42.680> into<00:02:43.010> play<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.519> actually

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
secret comes into play and I actually

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.789 
secret comes into play and I actually
use<00:02:43.970> these<00:02:44.150> little<00:02:44.360> add-ons<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.140> my<00:02:45.319> control

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
use these little add-ons to my control

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.979 
use these little add-ons to my control
sticks<00:02:46.130> cool<00:02:46.670> control<00:02:47.239> freaks<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.780> as<00:02:47.900> you

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
sticks cool control freaks and as you

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.559 
sticks cool control freaks and as you
can<00:02:48.170> see<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.530> screen<00:02:48.680> here<00:02:49.100> I've<00:02:49.459> got<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.970> row<00:02:50.540> of

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
can see on screen here I've got a row of

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.240 
can see on screen here I've got a row of
four<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.019> them<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.319> actually<00:02:51.560> use<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.950> green

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
four of them I actually use the green

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.280 
four of them I actually use the green
one<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.670> left<00:02:52.910> but<00:02:53.360> they<00:02:53.480> vary<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:54.049> height

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
one on the left but they vary in height

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.350 
one on the left but they vary in height
they<00:02:54.530> vary<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:54.920> design<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.970> way<00:02:56.150> that

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
they vary in design and the way that

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.910 
they vary in design and the way that
they<00:02:56.420> work<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.019> they<00:02:57.140> essentially<00:02:57.769> add

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
they work is that they essentially add

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.070 
they work is that they essentially add
length<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.730> eye<00:02:58.760> height<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.599> your<00:02:59.660> normal

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
length and the eye height to your normal

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.140 
length and the eye height to your normal
control<00:03:00.709> stick<00:03:00.980> length<00:03:01.250> allowing<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.000> to

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
control stick length allowing you to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.330 
control stick length allowing you to
have<00:03:02.269> more<00:03:02.599> subtle<00:03:02.870> movement<00:03:03.590> when<00:03:04.250> you're

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
have more subtle movement when you're

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.370 
have more subtle movement when you're
going<00:03:04.580> left<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.090> right<00:03:05.209> up<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.630> down<00:03:05.750> what

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
going left and right up and down what

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.960 
going left and right up and down what
I'll<00:03:06.530> keeping<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.010> ability<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.400> move<00:03:07.700> really

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
I'll keeping the ability to move really

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.820 
I'll keeping the ability to move really
quickly<00:03:08.450> on<00:03:08.569> those<00:03:08.720> high<00:03:08.930> sensitivity<00:03:09.709> to

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
quickly on those high sensitivity to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.460 
quickly on those high sensitivity to
essentially<00:03:10.459> negate<00:03:11.330> all<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.750> negativities

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470
