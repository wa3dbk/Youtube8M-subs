00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.980

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.520
 of course there is angels to it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.280

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.649
 pww 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.730

 barrel and for grip but I want to do you 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.510
 making wool so strong of course 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.190
 and also to a bad me ASAP 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.630
 in case it is used it does ex girlfriend 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.680
 is mine and yes in addition is per use 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.180
 scan times to walk uprooting and yes 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.020
 coolsingel to tackle goals and 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.180
 of course for the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 yes for the grace have ahead really 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.640
 flack jacket 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.140
 and I also use coast and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.790
 choices by super convenient that as in us 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 children keep walking around 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.720
 the yes continues here much overlap 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.960
 then see you are not visible yet 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.700
 and it's just really nice and me 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.590
 many people also care about that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.200
 to use, of course , if 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.909
 Russians are a hockey when you sit still 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 the gabe one is not common 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.079
 completely aimless is very good 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.560
 of course that seeing this game is because the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.780
 yes guys of course always way too 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.420
 Overpowerd and yes I use I chose 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.619
 just human being able to be hefty and then again 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 do that and that is actually pretty good 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.620
 as we know yes I already have 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.040
 idea that if you like two three four man 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 if you stand then yes then lose 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.950
 you almost always have me 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.850
 just use goals to be able to 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.560
 big one 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.150
 and after that you can do pretty well on this folder 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.350
 of course normally yes that goes 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.030
 i damn doing that doesn't 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.430
 this match then but you can too 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.560
 down along and of course through the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.630
 sides substantial there was one 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.580
 care we can say over 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.230
 walk and it is also great if you like 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.750
 people of flame quartz people go 18 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.030
 tons of tare creature and walk 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.630
 and acquaintances yes and that is not the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.610
 intention 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.160
 so there it usually on the outside 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.320
 ron quite and or to go down then you can 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.990
 you just back year or 7 of course 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.390
 Jan liter really super convenient choose tasty 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.310
 good chilling and yes today 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.450
 almost always go well on this one 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.800
 folder 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.230
 say well to the few fluttering 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.050
 I almost always get along well with it 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.040
 sorry with it 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.690
 yes if the the size contest say 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.420
 but the shepherd goal, what I 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.209
 actually I did not want you 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.170
 neat that fourth just run a rank 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.750
 decently 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.360
 no i play here and ran loam and yes 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.160
 people phase grid sometimes loos what is ran 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.870
 bene league b is a choice I can 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.170
 make crops just like an audience with 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.489
 I look up you and ran with search and 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.830
 The advantage of replay is actually that you 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.540
 always in a beginning and the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.880
 First it is a trap you become 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.310
 always start the match in the beginning 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.350
 say thrown because there the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.570
 competitive sport starting pass sucked up all 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.310
 persons present who of course 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.380
 super handy that did not do that 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.060
 you get all kinds of bullshit that normally 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.060
 in a game play 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.040
 the in the in a game hey well I a 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.310
 little read my throat sorry go it 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.140
 treaty want in any case is the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.519
 so you staple things in the match 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.290
 for the throw diary one thing that fine 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.570
 is but all that is fine 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.709
 You are already thrown at people who like 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.239
 be your own level so say so 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.220
 the intention is for such as 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.440
 you must play online for the first time 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.380
 you play it five times then you have 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.540
 a ball the rank and with that rank you come 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.440
 so against persons who are equivalent 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.110
 are up to you 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.660
 only this case was for me yes me 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.910
 I've done five games for you and am 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.950
 becoming silver is just an average 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.400
 player will be us I would become him 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.380
 head 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.690
 so more than average player and you can 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.430
 my promotion and relegation say 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.900
 you still pair that were dirty like bronze 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.780
 and also that it typically higher or 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.670
 scale platinum in the master so you can 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.230
 you can say your own on a list 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.360
 just work your own up them 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.300
 very nice which is even nicer to 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.340
 this game format is that you can do everything 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.160
 use what the game sees so it is 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.790
 no need to rock everything 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.830
 you can just do all the kills a lot 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.090
 bark that region sorry everything course 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.490
 tricks natural that word you can 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.410
 all use but also all 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.080
 touches on all weapons 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.510
 you can use all puppies that is the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.040
 super handy that you also have one 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.350
 bit of learning combinations 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.930
 hence I order here also with three and 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.840
 play cashman and yes after that I am too 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.210
 actually haha done online at pharmacy 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.610
 because that you'll get some XP with your 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.930
 I really get less xp from it 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.850
 then it becomes b I doubt a bit 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.530
 but for me it is home by 2000 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.660
 you get court of profit party but I have 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.790
 then still double xp 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.290
 so it certainly weighs for me 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.500
 a thousand points in the hall before a competition 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.030
 to win it and 500 points for one if 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.070
 you lose a match I know 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.330
 then not quite a teacher, but then 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.530
 see your example that it is there 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.900
 of course and you can just be full here 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.169
 nice all combinations from testing and yes 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.940
 that's why you came up with me 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.919
 anyone from b &amp; b can still recommend you 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.870
 not so very good at the game i would like this 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.860
 yes go for a consultation here 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.280
 becomes and your own level 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.960
 And yes the fact that not for you 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.850
 the chest of his om frank matches 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.460
 that is of course super handy 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.260
 and you can learn here just so much 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.760
 Yes 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.380
 sulk that so we want players again 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.090
 search well on julyplay 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.740

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.910
 Well as you can see the dress you 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.060
 a bit towards the end of the 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.060
 to go 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.669
