00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 [Music] 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.059
 the girl here is oven video I apologize if 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.800
 you will see reflected above all by hyenas 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.780
 the glasses that only are today 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.790
 very tired and therefore needs on the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.410
 mind of repose because they make me 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.810
 very bad eyes as we come to us 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.580
 so take this video this video 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500
 you will be very happy as a product 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 I tried a new passion product 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.949
 nails that is the boom of the moment that 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.910
 I love it so much I had so many 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.920
 requests 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.940
 the product tested in particular the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.140
 fight ultra ultra gloss that is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 exactly what you are seeing 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.580
 in the image and is a top then a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 elastic finish without dispersion you 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.460
 you know that I hate those without 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.280
 dispersion because in most 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.930
 some cases are crackling so they are annoying 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.339
 they are more lucid than others with dis 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.860
 pressure but still generally 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.269
 they crack even if I refer you anyway 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
 the video on the sealants I already had 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.229
 done because also the fact that those 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 with dispersions and more parts remain 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.530
 are a series of reasons therefore vi 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.900
 I refer to that video that I put here 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 below in the information box we come to 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.430
 this product has been suggested has 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.280
 so decided to test it and right it will be 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.130
 promoted in the sense that I respect 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.900
 respectful of what I had 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.550
 before the lysis gloss I had 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.540
 completely rejected, however, I liked it 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.970
 that political side 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 I promote this which are the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.790
 features of this product 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 then this product is most of all 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 here dense so it's in my opinion it's more 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.940
 obviously easy to roll out is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.180
 subjective because I should dense then 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.160
 I like most systems with ease yes 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.290
 covers is the surface remains anyway 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.000
 polished and remains shiny for three weeks e 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.750
 the particular thing that does not crack does not crack 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.190
 crack 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.080
 I gave myself to myself I found it on 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.580
 crisis gone well I found sugellando 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.680
 well the team has found the ferment is something 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.950
 went well so if you want to buy 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.870
 some good gloss and in any case that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.400
 have good features 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.330
 use passion nails this is here 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.270
 in top ten 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.680
 I only tell you a display case that has me 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 bothered that after a series of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.180
 applications this product the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.760
 brush wait for hours 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.630
 I wanted to see see how the brush 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.900
 that this part has a part here that is 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.790
 off we say a little open here is this 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.280
 it's annoying because it also happened to me 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.920
 with other products that rank there if me 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.680
 allow gerishk that some steles do 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.270
 then detach from the central body 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.190
 this is annoying because if it is not 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.750
 If you settle you will not be able to spread it 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.770
 very well what you have to do it for 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.390
 fix 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.940
 very well then I recommend 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.860
 take some clean fine brush 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.890
 then with the scissors cut to the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.150
 root lucchi that moves a thing less 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.580
 then when you go to lay it down 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.680
 you will be able to spread it easily is a 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.570
 little touches that I do very often 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.150
 especially when the brushes of these 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.450
 bartolini begin to move use 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.770
 this trick as it is a 15 ml the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.570
 price I honestly don't remember 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.860
 because I had also bought other things 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.770
 so I put myself in the box anyway 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.410
 information the price itself as you 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.480
 I was saying I was promoted and therefore already a good one 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.870
 what in the net asked for in so many ifs 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.580
 should they not be the top one 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.500
 is according to my point of view of 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.830
 crystals if for now that I think is 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.630
 absolutely polished at least for me and at least 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.459
 it is very subjective but ambon 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.019
 competitor seen really finding 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.120
 well i hope so much this mini 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.190
 review from all of you 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.180
