00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
just a small part of it but it's a very

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.930 
just a small part of it but it's a very

we're doing I hope that they maybe take

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.590 
we're doing I hope that they maybe take
a<00:01:37.400> little<00:01:37.670> piece<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:37.910> what<00:01:38.120> we're<00:01:38.240> doing<00:01:38.360> and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
a little piece of what we're doing and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.710 
a little piece of what we're doing and
apply<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:38.900> themselves<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:41.150> relationship

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
apply it themselves the relationship

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.960 
apply it themselves the relationship
with<00:01:41.930> Bobcat<00:01:42.380> actually<00:01:42.800> started<00:01:43.280> several

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
with Bobcat actually started several

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.740 
with Bobcat actually started several
years<00:01:44.270> ago<00:01:44.740> all<00:01:45.740> with<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.640> mindset<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:47.390> a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
years ago all with the mindset of a

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.870 
years ago all with the mindset of a
conservation<00:01:48.470> effort<00:01:48.800> at<00:01:48.920> some<00:01:49.130> point<00:01:49.430> we

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
conservation effort at some point we

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.690 
conservation effort at some point we
decided<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.480> this<00:01:50.780> was<00:01:50.990> something<00:01:51.230> that

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
decided that this was something that

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.310 
decided that this was something that
together<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:53.210> could<00:01:53.420> do<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.990> would<00:01:54.140> be<00:01:54.290> a

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
together we could do that would be a

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.810 
together we could do that would be a
positive<00:01:54.650> message<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.430> would<00:01:55.520> be<00:01:55.580> something

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
positive message that would be something

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.500 
positive message that would be something
that<00:01:56.120> would<00:01:56.270> make<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.750> ground<00:01:56.990> better

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
that would make the ground better

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.540 
that would make the ground better
and<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.660> think<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:59.040> me<00:01:59.070> that's

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
and I think that's what to me that's

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.520 
and I think that's what to me that's
what<00:01:59.700> Bob<00:01:59.880> Katter<00:02:00.180> stood<00:02:00.510> for<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> long

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
what Bob Katter stood for for a long

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
what Bob Katter stood for for a long
time<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.370> a<00:02:02.520> big<00:02:02.700> surprise<00:02:02.850> when<00:02:03.420> our

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
time it was a big surprise when our

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.060 
time it was a big surprise when our
property<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.170> chosen<00:02:04.410> as<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
property was chosen as one of the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.580 
property was chosen as one of the
finalists<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.760> then<00:02:05.910> inevitably<00:02:06.510> we<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:07.410> won

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
finalists and then inevitably we we won

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.950 
finalists and then inevitably we we won
the<00:02:07.800> contest<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.600> was<00:02:09.780> in

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
the contest because it really was in

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.740 
the contest because it really was in
line<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.979> had<00:02:11.610> already<00:02:11.820> begun<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
line with what we had already begun and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.390 
line with what we had already begun and
what<00:02:12.990> we<00:02:13.110> wanted<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.440> continue<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.190> but

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
what we wanted to continue to do but

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.540 
what we wanted to continue to do but
would<00:02:14.520> really<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.660> two<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.870> us

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
would really just the two of us

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.830 
would really just the two of us
sometimes<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.820> progress<00:02:18.270> can<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.570> kind<00:02:18.780> of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
sometimes the progress can be kind of

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.390 
sometimes the progress can be kind of
slow<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.380> lot<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.620> handwork<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.220> don't

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
slow it's a lot of handwork we don't

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.640 
slow it's a lot of handwork we don't

showed how the team came together and
gave<00:03:23.070> their<00:03:23.280> input<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.790> what<00:03:24.000> they<00:03:24.150> thought

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
gave their input on what they thought

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.430 
gave their input on what they thought
would<00:03:24.480> work<00:03:24.660> what<00:03:24.900> they<00:03:25.019> didn't<00:03:25.200> think<00:03:25.350> could

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
would work what they didn't think could

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.259 
would work what they didn't think could
work<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.400> was<00:03:26.489> definitely<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.910> team<00:03:27.090> effort

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
work and it was definitely a team effort

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.229 
work and it was definitely a team effort
on<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.600> pond<00:03:28.550> with<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.670> plot<00:03:29.880> we're<00:03:30.120> gonna

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
on the pond with the plot we're gonna

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.150 
on the pond with the plot we're gonna
put<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.840> perennial<00:03:31.260> that'll<00:03:31.769> come<00:03:31.950> back

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
put in a perennial that'll come back

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.940 
put in a perennial that'll come back
year<00:03:32.400> after<00:03:32.430> year<00:03:33.140> we'll<00:03:34.140> mix<00:03:34.350> in<00:03:34.500> some<00:03:34.560> oats

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
year after year we'll mix in some oats

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.500 
year after year we'll mix in some oats
and<00:03:35.190> stuff<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.610> there's<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.850> good<00:03:36.060> food<00:03:36.269> source
