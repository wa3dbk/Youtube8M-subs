was<00:04:31.230> just<00:04:31.410> automatically<00:04:32.070> through<00:04:32.370> scale<00:04:32.820> so

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
was just automatically through scale so

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.630 
was just automatically through scale so
a<00:04:33.510> knife<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.390> far<00:04:36.690> what<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.490> would<00:04:38.490> actually

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
a knife and so far what I would actually

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.760 
a knife and so far what I would actually
notice<00:04:39.360> as<00:04:39.510> well<00:04:39.690> is<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.410> know<00:04:40.530> lack

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
just like shooting at me and then I just

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.130 
just like shooting at me and then I just
like<00:04:53.430> run<00:04:53.850> away<00:04:54.090> through<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.419> left<00:04:54.660> side<00:04:54.780> and

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
like run away through the left side and

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.930 
like run away through the left side and
turn<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.440> corner<00:04:55.830> it's<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.130> lean<00:04:56.310> man<00:04:56.520> then<00:04:56.910> I

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
turn the corner it's a lean man then I

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.520
