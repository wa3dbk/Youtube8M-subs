00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
okay so where we at on my last video I

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.160 
okay so where we at on my last video I
posted<00:00:09.170> just<00:00:10.429> revised<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.880> ed<00:00:12.150> Lea<00:00:12.480> Scallon

z--<00:00:13.370> flywheel<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.700> wanted<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> try<00:00:15.450> different

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.759 

just<00:00:19.529> different<00:00:19.770> scenarios<00:00:21.410> so<00:00:22.410> we'll<00:00:22.650> be

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
just different scenarios so we'll be

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.950 
just different scenarios so we'll be
changing<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.369> more<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.730> more<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.660> any<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
changing it more and more and if any of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
changing it more and more and if any of
you<00:00:25.109> guys<00:00:25.260> want<00:00:25.680> me<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.920> any<00:00:26.070> studies<00:00:26.550> or

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you guys want me to do any studies or

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.140 
you guys want me to do any studies or
any<00:00:27.570> kind<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.990> tests<00:00:28.230> or<00:00:28.439> anything<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:29.150> just

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
any kind of tests or anything just just

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
any kind of tests or anything just just
comment<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.949> maybe<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.340> something

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
comment and maybe we can get something

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.319 
comment and maybe we can get something
going<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> here's<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.940> ed<00:00:35.940> leeet's

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
what you guys can actually see it I got

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.870 
what you guys can actually see it I got
the<00:01:10.350> yellow<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.270> hooked<00:01:13.260> up

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
the yellow you see up there is hooked up

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.840 
the yellow you see up there is hooked up
to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:16.970> pmh<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.799> blue<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:21.720> hooked<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
to the pmh and the blue is hooked up to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.440 
to the pmh and the blue is hooked up to
the<00:01:24.560> inside<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:26.869> magnets<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.770> coil

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
the inside here magnets to this coil

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.050 
the inside here magnets to this coil
that<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.900> four<00:01:31.680> different<00:01:31.860> poles<00:01:32.400> going

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that I have four different poles going

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.359 
that I have four different poles going
here<00:01:33.270> four<00:01:33.570> different<00:01:36.770> poles<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.130> four

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
here four different poles but four

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.760 
here four different poles but four
different<00:01:40.460> avenues<00:01:41.460> basically<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:43.619> one

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
different avenues basically the one

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.359 
different avenues basically the one
thing<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.979> noticed<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.899> bottom<00:01:46.770> layer

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
thing I noticed here is the bottom layer

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.789 
thing I noticed here is the bottom layer
of<00:01:47.930> magnets<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.140> facing<00:01:49.649> out

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
of magnets that are facing out

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.880 
of magnets that are facing out
north-south<00:01:50.729> north-south<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.619> top

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
north-south north-south and the top

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.300 
north-south north-south and the top
layer<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.329> magnets<00:01:54.780> facing<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.409> are

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
layer of the magnets facing in are

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.639 
layer of the magnets facing in are
separated<00:01:57.149> from<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.659> paper<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.380> they're<00:01:58.530> not

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
separated from this paper so they're not

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.120 
separated from this paper so they're not
touching<00:01:59.659> but<00:02:00.659> these<00:02:01.110> magnets<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.829> touching

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
touching but these magnets are touching

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.300 
touching but these magnets are touching
the<00:02:02.340> ring<00:02:02.670> which<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.630> ring<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.990> touching<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the ring which the ring is touching the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.740 
the ring which the ring is touching the
bolt<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.390> bolt<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.869> touching<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> flywheel

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
bolt the bolt is touching the flywheel

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.630 
bolt the bolt is touching the flywheel
flywheels<00:02:09.750> touching<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.649> center<00:02:10.920> base<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
flywheels touching the center base the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.010 
flywheels touching the center base the
center<00:02:11.940> base<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.360> touch<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
center base of touch of the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.740 
center base of touch of the
the<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:16.320> motor<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:20.160> metal<00:02:21.090> block<00:02:21.270> itself

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the the motor and the metal block itself

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.580 
the the motor and the metal block itself
so<00:02:22.340> these<00:02:23.340> magnets<00:02:24.330> are<00:02:24.510> pop<00:02:24.810> here<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
so these magnets are pop here with the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.270 
so these magnets are pop here with the
coil<00:02:26.300> have<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> lot<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.930> iron<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.590> go<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
coil have a lot of iron to go to the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.580 
coil have a lot of iron to go to the
store<00:02:29.580> magnets<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:32.960> there's<00:02:33.960> something<00:02:34.380> there

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
store magnets so there's something there

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.680 
store magnets so there's something there
about<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.730> anyway<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.240> wanted<00:02:36.600> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
about that but anyway I just wanted to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.190 
about that but anyway I just wanted to
show<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.930> look<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.070> screen<00:02:38.850> here<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.810> I

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
show you look at this screen here and I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.860 
show you look at this screen here and I
am<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.950> slowly<00:02:41.370> turn<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.660> wheel

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
am just going to slowly turn the wheel

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.500 
am just going to slowly turn the wheel
to<00:02:42.900> slightly<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.970> said<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.210> want<00:02:45.390> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
to slightly and like I said I want you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.460 
to slightly and like I said I want you
to<00:02:45.600> look<00:02:45.840> at<00:02:46.080> what's<00:02:46.470> going<00:02:46.800> on<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:48.350> look<00:02:49.350> at

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
to look at what's going on here look at

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.980 
to look at what's going on here look at
these<00:02:49.590> readings<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.250> are<00:02:50.400> coming<00:02:50.700> down<00:02:50.990> you

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
these readings that are coming down you

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.580 
these readings that are coming down you
can<00:02:52.230> see<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.400> spikes<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> I'm<00:02:55.230> just

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
can see it's the spikes and I'm just

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.290 
can see it's the spikes and I'm just
turning<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.040> wheel<00:02:56.220> back<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.820> forth<00:02:57.060> like

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
turning the wheel back and forth like

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.840 
turning the wheel back and forth like
this<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.780> all<00:02:57.990> I'm<00:02:58.170> doing<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.680> Center<00:02:59.610> hook

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
this is all I'm doing that Center hook

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.790 
this is all I'm doing that Center hook
up<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.300> kind<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.630> screwing<00:03:01.050> me<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.260> because

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
up here kind of screwing me up because

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.050 
up here kind of screwing me up because
you<00:03:02.670> don't<00:03:02.700> hook<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.270> center<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.790> can't

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
you don't hook to the center so I can't

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.720 
you don't hook to the center so I can't
really<00:03:06.180> give<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.570> spin<00:03:07.160> but<00:03:08.160> look<00:03:08.370> at<00:03:08.550> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
really give it a spin but look at the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.140 
really give it a spin but look at the
spikes<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:10.650> see<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:12.320> now<00:03:13.320> if<00:03:14.280> anybody<00:03:14.640> oh

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
spikes you see there now if anybody oh

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.190 
spikes you see there now if anybody oh
okay<00:03:15.960> now<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:16.770> can<00:03:17.100> spin<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.520> because<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.930> thing

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
okay now I can spin it because the thing

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
okay now I can spin it because the thing
fell<00:03:19.440> off<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.860> center<00:03:20.190> but<00:03:20.370> I'm<00:03:20.460> gonna<00:03:20.580> get<00:03:20.760> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
fell off the center but I'm gonna get a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.070 
fell off the center but I'm gonna get a
nice<00:03:21.000> little<00:03:21.680> little<00:03:22.680> spin<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:23.130> going<00:03:23.610> here

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
nice little little spin on going here

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:32.330 
nice little little spin on going here
and<00:03:28.670> it's<00:03:29.670> doing<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.480> lot<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.050> pmh<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.220> then

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and it's doing a lot to the pmh and then

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.540 
and it's doing a lot to the pmh and then
power<00:03:32.550> back<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.120> forth<00:03:33.390> changing<00:03:34.140> everything

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
power back and forth changing everything

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.750 
power back and forth changing everything
and<00:03:35.720> there's<00:03:36.720> your<00:03:37.020> yellow<00:03:37.440> which<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.610> hooked

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
and there's your yellow which is hooked

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.620 
and there's your yellow which is hooked
up<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.330> pmh<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.560> here<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.890> can<00:03:41.070> just<00:03:41.250> see

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
up to the pmh and here you can just see

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.280 
up to the pmh and here you can just see
just<00:03:42.630> moving<00:03:43.050> slow<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.740> it's<00:03:44.430> spiking<00:03:44.910> and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.740 

just<00:03:49.290> going<00:03:49.590> nuts<00:03:49.740> and<00:03:50.400> then<00:03:50.580> also<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:51.270> coil

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
just going nuts and then also this coil

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.970 
just going nuts and then also this coil
have<00:03:52.140> in<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.470> middle<00:03:52.800> here<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:54.720> know<00:03:54.980> nobody

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
have in the middle here you know nobody

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.040 
have in the middle here you know nobody
knows<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> vent<00:03:56.640> has<00:03:56.790> anything<00:03:57.210> inside<00:03:57.870> the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
knows the vent has anything inside the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.460 
knows the vent has anything inside the
concrete<00:03:58.290> on<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.830> wheel<00:03:59.070> and<00:04:00.080> that's<00:04:01.080> what

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
concrete on this wheel and that's what

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.890 
concrete on this wheel and that's what
left<00:04:01.860> me<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> lot<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.250> questions<00:04:03.800> so<00:04:05.450> like<00:04:06.450> is

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
left me a lot of questions so like is

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.410 
left me a lot of questions so like is
there<00:04:07.290> wire<00:04:07.500> inside<00:04:07.980> if<00:04:08.250> there<00:04:08.460> is<00:04:08.610> why<00:04:09.060> and

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
there wire inside if there is why and

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.990 
there wire inside if there is why and
then<00:04:09.990> like<00:04:10.260> those<00:04:10.500> four<00:04:10.860> main<00:04:11.130> round<00:04:11.520> bolts

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
then like those four main round bolts

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.020 
then like those four main round bolts
that<00:04:12.090> are<00:04:12.150> up<00:04:12.270> top<00:04:12.480> there<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:13.050> think<00:04:13.709> there<00:04:14.190> are

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
that are up top there I think there are

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.250 
that are up top there I think there are
just<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.660> spark<00:04:16.170> gap<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.549> center<00:04:17.970> stator<00:04:18.570> so

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
just a spark gap to the center stator so

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.610 
just a spark gap to the center stator so
I'm<00:04:19.739> gonna<00:04:19.859> recreate<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.730> and<00:04:21.109> hook<00:04:22.109> them<00:04:22.320> up

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
I'm gonna recreate that and hook them up

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.760 
I'm gonna recreate that and hook them up
to<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.760> think<00:04:23.790> I'm<00:04:23.940> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.150> separate

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
to this I think I'm going to separate

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.870 
to this I think I'm going to separate
this<00:04:25.770> ring

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
this ring

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.640 
this ring
sitting<00:04:27.510> on<00:04:27.570> these<00:04:27.750> magnets<00:04:28.320> I'm<00:04:28.440> going<00:04:28.560> to

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
sitting on these magnets I'm going to

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.450 
sitting on these magnets I'm going to
insulate<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.770> centerpiece<00:04:31.770> along

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
insulate it so this centerpiece along

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.650 
insulate it so this centerpiece along
with<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:33.120> clove<00:04:34.110> on<00:04:34.410> top<00:04:34.970> will<00:04:35.970> be<00:04:36.210> hooked<00:04:36.480> up

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
with the clove on top will be hooked up

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.240 
with the clove on top will be hooked up
to<00:04:36.900> these<00:04:37.050> four<00:04:37.670> round<00:04:41.120> spar<00:04:42.120> caps<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:43.250> the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
to these four round spar caps and the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.490 
to these four round spar caps and the
spar<00:04:44.610> caps<00:04:45.200> when<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.380> block<00:04:46.590> builds<00:04:47.040> up<00:04:48.500> with

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
spar caps when the block builds up with

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.160 
spar caps when the block builds up with
enough<00:04:50.190> magnets

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
enough magnets

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.270 
enough magnets
once<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:53.810> implode<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:55.140> system<00:04:55.650> sort<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.160> in

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
once I implode the system sort of in

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.880 
once I implode the system sort of in
this<00:04:56.400> in<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.730> sense<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.330> where<00:04:57.540> it<00:04:57.900> collapses

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
this in a sense to where it collapses

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.460 
this in a sense to where it collapses
and<00:04:59.160> sends<00:05:00.030> out<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.180> high<00:05:00.420> voltage<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.990> when<00:05:01.320> it

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
and sends out a high voltage and when it

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.860 
and sends out a high voltage and when it
does<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.680> that's<00:05:02.100> when<00:05:02.340> spark<00:05:02.640> out<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:02.870> spark

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
does that that's when spark out a spark

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.960 
does that that's when spark out a spark
Akal<00:05:04.200> come<00:05:04.530> in<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:04.920> it'll<00:05:05.070> make<00:05:05.760> its

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
Akal come in and it'll make its

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.540 
Akal come in and it'll make its
connection<00:05:06.540> then<00:05:06.690> it<00:05:06.810> will<00:05:06.900> come<00:05:07.110> up<00:05:07.140> and

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
connection then it will come up and

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.420 
connection then it will come up and
shoot<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.790> the<00:05:09.410> wire<00:05:10.410> that<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.710> have<00:05:10.800> up<00:05:11.160> here

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
shoot to the wire that I have up here

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.910 
shoot to the wire that I have up here
off<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.910> handle<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:13.050> put<00:05:13.290> it<00:05:13.350> but<00:05:13.470> anyway

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
off the handle that I put it but anyway

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.440 
off the handle that I put it but anyway
just<00:05:14.220> back<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:16.680> know<00:05:16.800> it's<00:05:17.450> just

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
just back to this you know it's just

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.330 
just back to this you know it's just
turn<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.840> wheel<00:05:18.960> just<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.680> little<00:05:19.950> bit<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.100> guess

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
turn the wheel just a little bit I guess

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.070 
turn the wheel just a little bit I guess
I<00:05:20.460> could<00:05:20.610> spend<00:05:20.880> a<00:05:20.970> little<00:05:21.150> bit<00:05:21.270> because<00:05:21.390> you

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
I could spend a little bit because you

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.040 
I could spend a little bit because you
got<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.320> blue<00:05:22.500> disconnected<00:05:23.660> so<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:24.720> just

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
got the blue disconnected so you just

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
wires put to the coil and the coil is is

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.040 
wires put to the coil and the coil is is
to<00:05:34.950> the<00:05:35.040> bolt<00:05:35.280> which<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.360> connected<00:05:36.840> to<00:05:36.870> the

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
to the bolt which is connected to the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.030 
to the bolt which is connected to the
block<00:05:37.290> so<00:05:37.650> it's<00:05:37.860> using<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:39.320> all<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.560> magnets
