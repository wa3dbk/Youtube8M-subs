00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.930
 hello everyone in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.740
 teach how to make a bracelet with rubber bands 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.920
 desktop for this craft I'm going to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 use the following materials 7 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.499
 Gummies in red 7 in green 7 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.119
 in blue and 7 in yellow are 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.999
 gummies that can be found 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.019
 in a stationary or anywhere 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.019
 that sell office items 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.150
 The first thing I'm going to do is take 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.870
 example the green 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.650
 pick up the green 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.650
 I'm going to catch the red one 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.610
 and I'm going to pass the red inside the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.770
 green 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.770
 and I'm going to get it folded in this way 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.700
 next I will get it right 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.019
 I'm going to pass it between the two 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.379
 holes have been left here from the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.379
 red 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.290
 holding I'll go through here 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.100
 double 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.100
 so go well being 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 next I'm going to take the yellow 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.850
 and I'm going to pass it inside the blue and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.780
 I'm going to fold 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.780
 well in this way 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.340
 now I will follow the order of the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.340
 colors all the same time 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.160
 and we're going to put the colors in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.080
 order all the time I'm going to put the green 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.890
 in the same way 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.890
 again and now I would touch the red 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.269
 and how another time is the same for the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.500
 video when you have finished putting 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.680
 but this one of the gummies has 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.480
 explaining what we are going to do 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.880
 once we have finished putting 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.700
 all the tires in order 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.480
 let's do the following we're going to catch 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 the last yellow that I have put 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.590
 if I take 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.319
 on the other hand in green he had here 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.530
 and I'm going to put the green between the two 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.950
 yellow the only two of the rubber band 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.950
 yellow 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.300
 inside the yellow and now I'm going to 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.300
 simply make a knot 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.190
 beware that this is a little more 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.730
 complicated 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.730
 something like that 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.990
 once out there that's not normal what 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.190
 it costs a little 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.900
 it's a knot just like that he squeezed 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.150
 well this is not going to be undone 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.340
 It is a very fast bracelet to do very 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.709
 easy to explain does not have many steps 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.510
 and I hope you liked it for 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.850
 put it let's leave where the knot is 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.420
 down here that does not look 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.420
 down here 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.950
 and we would stay like this 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.549
 I hope you enjoyed a greeting and 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.549
 until next time
