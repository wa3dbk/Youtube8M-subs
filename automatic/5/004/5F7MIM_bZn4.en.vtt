right<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> beginning<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> episode

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
right at the beginning of the episode

right at the beginning of the episode
that<00:00:45.000> kahlúa<00:00:45.960> definitely<00:00:46.649> took<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.070> god

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that kahlúa definitely took what god

knows<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.879> God<00:00:51.360> didn't<00:00:51.719> mean<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> because

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
knows that God didn't mean it because

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
knows that God didn't mean it because
obviously<00:00:52.500> guns<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.100> himself<00:00:53.280> he's<00:00:53.699> just

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
just dips um but towards the end of the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.330 
just dips um but towards the end of the
episode<00:04:46.870> he<00:04:47.259> finds<00:04:47.620> like<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.770> little<00:04:48.129> a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
episode he finds like a little a

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.429 
episode he finds like a little a
loophole<00:04:48.639> if<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.090> will<00:04:49.270> in<00:04:49.509> you<00:04:49.990> peace<00:04:50.199> power

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 
loophole if you will in you peace power

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.589 
loophole if you will in you peace power
he's<00:04:50.830> like<00:04:51.039> okay<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.520> explosion<00:04:51.969> just<00:04:52.270> gives

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
he's like okay that explosion just gives

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.270 
he's like okay that explosion just gives
off<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.780> lot<00:04:53.080> of<00:04:53.199> energy<00:04:53.439> so<00:04:53.919> I<00:04:53.949> guess<00:04:54.250> he's

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
off a lot of energy so I guess he's

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.480 
off a lot of energy so I guess he's
gonna<00:04:54.550> try<00:04:54.879> to<00:04:54.909> coincide<00:04:55.569> that<00:04:55.900> with<00:04:56.650> his<00:04:56.979> APR

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
gonna try to coincide that with his APR

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.490 
gonna try to coincide that with his APR
ability<00:04:57.909> to<00:04:58.090> make<00:04:58.240> him<00:04:58.389> bankrupt<00:04:58.599> his<00:04:58.990> men<00:04:59.199> of

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
ability to make him bankrupt his men of

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.490 
ability to make him bankrupt his men of
