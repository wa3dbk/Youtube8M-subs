00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.839
 I got back to ellenco, I got it in my hand. 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:13.410
 I do not need or force myself as it is 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.809
 which is the third canvas she is like 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.900
 if it were a triangle when she turns 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.900
 very fast there it expands the sides 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:32.009
 there when she's inside that dome here 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.310
 very fast word and can both sides and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.830
 this area that they embrace what the 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:46.080
 dome where you go where you turn this part 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:51.330
 which will come toothed chain is the high shaft 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:55.020
 boxing that're just loose enough powder is 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.550
 normal because it's new so because it's new 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.080
 and she's only good, right? 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.060
 but here inside have nothing 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:09.899
 to pass a cloth here it quickly took 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:14.299
 a cloth here just to see a pass 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.299
 here but finally 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.490
 both the student loose loose poc 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.490
 pretty dust 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.990
 Halo does not even have to open the engine 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.990
 can make a deal 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.290
 It is interesting to note that this is the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:55.840
 motor 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:58.340
 Do not have a slack in the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.439
 this piece that she will fit here 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.439
 side with 4 screw plus I told you 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.100
 I'm curious to start the engine without 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.860
 clutch just to see and hear the noise 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.870
 for you, the noise is the same 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.220
 but I think the noise is not going to be the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.209
 same thing because how are you? 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.209
 clutch 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:28.480
 will be a very clean noise is not 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:33.310
 try to pick up even faster and almost 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.310
 caught 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.079
 liked without clutch motor powder 4 inside is 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.799
 the clutch 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:53.579
 photo max Haack thigh ok I'll try 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:59.040
 sort it out for talked look that 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:01.189
 interesting but no noise no league at all 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.189
 digital no 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.189
 OK 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.730
 and 7 is not 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.020
 pressure is good and low wedding 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.020
 the time is another category 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.630
 for the rector here รณ the church did not 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.230
 nothing you put there is that he is mine 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:31.600
 brown perfect to get oil from 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.600
 engine is perfect is not leaking anything 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.190
 I Tried 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.840
 Let's get here. 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.590
 to stop the deal here we will not go back 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.590
 to go to the canvas 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.860
 a student is arrested 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.080
 I think that this whole part separate from the 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.870
 axis in this here is the triangle 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.700
 and these parts are docked. 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.520
 screws and underneath it 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.580
 bolt has a spring that pushes the canvas 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.769
 pushing down the tarpaulin down 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:21.630
 the three in high rotation it expands 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:25.389
 she at three spands and embraces the dome 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:29.610
 by which the dome will come and will come 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:34.540
 timing belt motoquatro time here 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:37.360
 very interesting but for what I am 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.940
 seeing here there is such a gap in these 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.300
 pieces they are 6 they are socks 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.510
 even if there is a 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.820
 there is some respite in them by which they can 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.350
 misfitting and may cause 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.720
 scraping the dome when the engine is 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.830
 off and get all that 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:02.440
 work to make it work to do 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:05.590
 Spring work did not but no 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.180
 of them is loose is the same engine pattern 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.870
 there is a small gap is not much 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.870
 a little slack 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.060
 there is a pine under which keeps 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.820
 the student always in the right place 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.960
 perhaps this thorn akiko that the 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:35.200
 Sometimes it fits the place it stays out and 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.210
 causes them to lock in the engine or 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.130
 then she may have a burr 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:44.800
 The way I feel about what I'm feeling 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.940
 here it has a few variations of 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.930
 size 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.150
 here it is thicker it is thinner 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.919
 here it is thicker that it is finer to z 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:06:00.490
 sometimes these details that end there 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:03.250
 generating those crashes when the 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:07.660
 engine or when we do it 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.070
 pick up and sing that lock but I think 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.940
 that with time this is decreasing 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:18.400
 because this canvas she is spending it 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.470
 loses the condition as it has been 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.890
 losing the infection to a few small pieces 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.890
 here taking the bread inside the engine 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:43.110
 I'll try to pull it out here. 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:45.210
 to see if I can pear 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.000
 there really is a certain limit to 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:53.729
 you pull her she does not come to you 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.460
 get out of the hole not only that the springs springs 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:59.880
 are very sensitive even though she is a 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.650
 small acceleration she has not opened the 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.830
 to exchange these spring for a few springs 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.810
 stronger here because only there to have 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.430
 which speed up her gait more 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.380
 slow right 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.800
 if one of the springs was placed harder than 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:17.550
 in these bolts here underneath them I 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.440
 I think I'd give it a go one more time 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.180
 safer ride only that it would have to 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.120
 accelerate more to walk this is the 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.310
 problem, because in the last shine these 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.870
 balls here that hold them down 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.190
 they are very hard, you can not do it 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.009
 That with the hand I'm doing here. 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.139
 Can you see I'm doing it ? 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:35.940
 I'm pushing with my hand, but it's 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:40.800
 this a low spin it already starts to 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:44.389
 get the march starts that locked 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.759
 I was seeing your engine in mine too. 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:51.870
 only you have to know the level of strength 

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:53.969
 who puts the ball here if it does not put you 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.590
 a very strong ball and you accelerate the 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:08:00.719
 engine at maximum and not idle 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:04.099
 this is it too, I will, I will 

00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:04.099
 I'll be right back.
