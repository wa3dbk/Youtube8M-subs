out of this palette is the yellow and
the<00:00:51.840> green<00:00:52.370> when<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.399> did<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> demo<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.539> that

white one as a highlighter I don't know

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.599

I guess I need to play a little bit more
with<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.940> white<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> most<00:01:04.320> part

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470

it out so when it gets on your skin it
kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.149> turns<00:01:51.420> into<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
kind of turns into like this like a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.840 
kind of turns into like this like a
powder<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.409> why<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
powder and so that's why it really it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.789 
powder and so that's why it really it
really<00:01:57.119> sticks<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.619> your

foundation or BB cream or whatever that
you<00:02:00.899> use<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.490> go<00:02:02.759> ahead<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you use and then I go ahead and I go and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.170 
you use and then I go ahead and I go and
I<00:02:04.079> set<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.740> my<00:02:04.979> ELF<00:02:05.250> under<00:02:06.000> eye<00:02:06.030> setting

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
I set it with my ELF under eye setting

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.510 
I set it with my ELF under eye setting
powder<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.459> for<00:02:08.459> me<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.000> doesn't<00:02:09.450> crease<00:02:10.520> it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
powder and for me it doesn't crease it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.340 
powder and for me it doesn't crease it
does<00:02:11.790> give<00:02:12.120> me<00:02:12.150> good<00:02:12.599> coverage

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
does give me good coverage

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.890 
does give me good coverage
under<00:02:13.590> my<00:02:13.710> undereye<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.610> kind<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.510> gets<00:02:15.750> rid

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
under my undereye and kind of gets rid

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.510 
under my undereye and kind of gets rid
of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.290> dark<00:02:16.500> circles<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:18.360> not<00:02:18.930> that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
of the dark circles it's not that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.280 
of the dark circles it's not that
long-lasting<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.360> will<00:02:21.600> tell<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.140> I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
long-lasting that I will tell you I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.070 
long-lasting that I will tell you I
think<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:23.040> around<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.640> five<00:02:23.970> hour<00:02:24.300> mark<00:02:24.840> I

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
think like around the five hour mark I

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.130 
think like around the five hour mark I
was<00:02:25.290> kind<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.680> noticing<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:27.390> was<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.870> kind

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
was kind of noticing that it was it kind

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.140 
was kind of noticing that it was it kind
of<00:02:28.200> disappeared<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.490> hard<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:29.940> me<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
of disappeared and it's hard for me to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.870 
of disappeared and it's hard for me to
say<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.660> but<00:02:30.960> I'm<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.740> what<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.280> I

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
say that but I'm like what what I

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.200 
say that but I'm like what what I
thought<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.630> concealed<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.880> isn't

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
thought I concealed that so this isn't

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.110 
thought I concealed that so this isn't
that<00:02:36.600> long-lasting<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.130> does<00:02:38.430> cover<00:02:38.970> up

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
that long-lasting but it does cover up

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.140 
that long-lasting but it does cover up
what<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.660> needs<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.050> cover<00:02:40.260> up<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.580> green<00:02:41.880> one

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
what it needs to cover up the green one

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
what it needs to cover up the green one
not<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.230> much<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.860> was<00:02:44.550> using<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.180> over<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:45.960> on

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
not so much I was using it over here on

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.280 
not so much I was using it over here on
these<00:02:46.470> kind<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.300> scarring<00:02:48.300> blemishes

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
these kind of like scarring blemishes

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.060 
these kind of like scarring blemishes
that<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.560> have<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.540> looked<00:02:51.810> weird<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.740> I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
that I have and it looked weird like I

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.910 
that I have and it looked weird like I
was<00:02:53.430> using<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.150> green<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:55.770> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
was using the green and this is what the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.030 
was using the green and this is what the
green<00:02:56.220> looks<00:02:56.520> like<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.150> then<00:02:57.480> when<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.140> put

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
green looks like and then when you I put

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.520 
green looks like and then when you I put
like<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.460> lightest<00:03:00.030> layer<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.050> then<00:03:01.440> I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
like the lightest layer of it and then I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.860 
like the lightest layer of it and then I
could<00:03:01.740> still<00:03:02.040> see<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.370> blemish<00:03:03.270> underneath

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
could still see the blemish underneath

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.050 
could still see the blemish underneath
so<00:03:04.470> then<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.680> went<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.100> with<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.340> little<00:03:05.670> bit<00:03:05.790> more

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
so then I went in with a little bit more

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.170 
so then I went in with a little bit more
and<00:03:06.330> kind<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.530> double<00:03:08.070> layered<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.580> and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
and kind of like a double layered it and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.880 
and kind of like a double layered it and
it<00:03:09.510> looked<00:03:09.720> alright<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.320> then<00:03:10.530> when<00:03:10.770> you

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
it looked alright but then when you

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.270 
it looked alright but then when you
start<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.430> pounce<00:03:11.960> your<00:03:12.960> Beautyblender<00:03:13.530> or

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
start to pounce your Beautyblender or

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.330 
start to pounce your Beautyblender or
whatever<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.360> use<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.890> kind<00:03:17.250> of

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
whatever that you use on it it kind of

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.910 
whatever that you use on it it kind of
takes<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.850> green<00:03:18.120> away<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.900> really<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.650> green

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
takes the green away so really the green

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.750 
takes the green away so really the green
didn't<00:03:20.310> too<00:03:20.760> much<00:03:20.970> work<00:03:21.300> for<00:03:21.690> me<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.920> I'm<00:03:23.550> gonna

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
didn't too much work for me so I'm gonna

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.380 
didn't too much work for me so I'm gonna
still<00:03:24.090> play<00:03:24.330> around<00:03:24.600> with<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.050> but<00:03:26.390> honestly

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
still play around with it but honestly

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.770 
still play around with it but honestly
for<00:03:27.810> me<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.610> if<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.730> still<00:03:30.060> had<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:30.360> receipt<00:03:30.750> I

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
for me if if I still had the receipt I

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.290 
for me if if I still had the receipt I
would<00:03:31.020> take<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.410> back<00:03:31.460> but<00:03:32.460> I<00:03:32.520> think<00:03:32.610> this<00:03:33.120> is

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
would take it back but I think this is

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.820 
would take it back but I think this is
something<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.990> I<00:03:34.020> still<00:03:34.440> want<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> continue

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
something that I still want to continue

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.860 
something that I still want to continue
to<00:03:35.280> play<00:03:35.490> with<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.940> don't<00:03:36.060> really<00:03:36.390> have<00:03:36.720> any

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870

yellow spots on my face to use the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.630 
yellow spots on my face to use the
purple<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.440> I've<00:03:40.560> heard<00:03:40.770> some<00:03:40.830> people<00:03:41.220> say

that<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.000> purple<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.510> good<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.960> like<00:03:43.140> brighten

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
that the purple is good to like brighten

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.580 
that the purple is good to like brighten
your<00:03:44.190> under-eye<00:03:44.520> area<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.720> want<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.410> keep

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590

playing<00:03:46.950> with<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.610> think<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.300> fun

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
playing with this I think this is fun

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.660 
playing with this I think this is fun
and<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.810> as<00:03:51.930> far<00:03:52.230> as<00:03:52.260> like<00:03:52.530> worth<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.160> money<00:03:53.370> I

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
and but as far as like worth the money I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.480 
and but as far as like worth the money I
don't<00:03:53.970> know<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:55.230> would<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.650> passed<00:03:55.920> on<00:03:56.280> this

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
don't know I I would have passed on this

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.970 
don't know I I would have passed on this
but<00:03:57.240> I<00:03:57.270> think<00:03:57.360> if<00:03:57.720> you're<00:03:57.930> new<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.770> want

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
but I think if you're new and you want

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.070 
but I think if you're new and you want
