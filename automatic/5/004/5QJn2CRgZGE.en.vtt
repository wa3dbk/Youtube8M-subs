jungle with the g11 where I managed to

jungle with the g11 where I managed to
start<00:00:08.790> off<00:00:08.940> quite<00:00:09.240> well<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.660> then<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.440> all

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
start off quite well and then it all

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.770 
start off quite well and then it all
seems<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.010> fall<00:00:11.190> apart<00:00:11.490> as<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.150> get<00:00:12.330> towards<00:00:12.660> the

seems to fall apart as I get towards the

seems to fall apart as I get towards the
end<00:00:12.929> which<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.679> something<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.160> tends<00:00:14.610> to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
end which is something that tends to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.609 
end which is something that tends to
happen<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.089> me<00:00:15.179> quite<00:00:15.450> often<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.289> I'll

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the Lakers due to their iPhone

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.220 
the Lakers due to their iPhone
malfunctions<00:00:53.129> overslept<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.510> didn't<00:00:55.079> make

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
malfunctions overslept and didn't make

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
malfunctions overslept and didn't make
it<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> their<00:00:56.340> games<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.850> time<00:00:57.120> against

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it to one of their games on time against

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.099 
it to one of their games on time against
the<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.079> Grizzlies<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:59.300> just<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.719> got<00:01:00.930> me

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the the Grizzlies and just it got me

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.319 
the the Grizzlies and just it got me
thinking<00:01:01.530> about<00:01:01.770> our<00:01:02.550> reliance<00:01:03.000> on

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
thinking about our reliance on

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.420 
thinking about our reliance on
technology<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.500> some<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.220> may<00:01:05.400> have

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
technology and some of you may have

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
technology and some of you may have
heard<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:06.420> an<00:01:06.570> earlier<00:01:06.840> story<00:01:07.229> i<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> was

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
heard in an earlier story i think it was

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
heard in an earlier story i think it was
on<00:01:07.890> january<00:01:08.549> first<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> went<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.390> that's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
on january first that it went up that's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.500 
on january first that it went up that's
just<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> mass<00:01:11.270> oversleep<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
just there was a mass oversleep of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
just there was a mass oversleep of
people<00:01:13.170> who<00:01:13.350> rely<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.920> their<00:01:14.040> iphones<00:01:14.460> as

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
people who rely on their iphones as

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
people who rely on their iphones as
their<00:01:15.030> alarms<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.840> apparently<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> lakers

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
their alarms and apparently the lakers

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
their alarms and apparently the lakers
deserve<00:01:17.580> their<00:01:17.880> own<00:01:17.960> segment<00:01:18.960> because

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
deserve their own segment because

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
deserve their own segment because
they're<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.920> important<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
they're very important more so than the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.219 
they're very important more so than the
rest<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.110> us<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.740> makes<00:01:23.009> sense<00:01:23.310> ah<00:01:24.229> that's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
rest of us which makes sense ah that's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.410 
rest of us which makes sense ah that's
how<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> world<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.920> um<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> may<00:01:27.390> have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
how the world is um so you may have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.690 
how the world is um so you may have
heard<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.869> before<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.490> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
heard of this before but this one I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.249 
heard of this before but this one I
don't<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.420> me<00:01:30.540> thinking<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.020> our

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't know it got me thinking of our

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
don't know it got me thinking of our
reliance<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.860> technology<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.659> said

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
reliance on technology as I just said

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.410 
reliance on technology as I just said
and<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.680> what<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.400> would<00:01:35.520> happen<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.150> there

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and just what what would happen if there

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.590 
and just what what would happen if there
was<00:01:36.659> some<00:01:36.930> mass<00:01:37.280> apocalypse<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
was some mass apocalypse of all the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.120 
was some mass apocalypse of all the
electronic<00:01:40.380> devices<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> world<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.110> or

electronic devices in the world and or

type situation suddenly our technology

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.590 
type situation suddenly our technology
began<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.189> outsmart<00:01:50.700> us<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.979> enslaved<00:01:52.979> us<00:01:53.220> and

minute<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.739> force<00:03:52.739> myself<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.459> put<00:03:53.610> up<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.820> video

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
minute I force myself to put up a video

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.630 
minute I force myself to put up a video
because<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.750> need<00:03:55.200> money<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.070> order<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.459> survive

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
because I need money in order to survive

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.570 
because I need money in order to survive
is<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.540> minute<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.989> should<00:03:58.290> probably<00:03:58.620> focus<00:03:59.190> my

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
is the minute I should probably focus my

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.520 
is the minute I should probably focus my
attention<00:04:00.030> wholeheartedly<00:04:00.570> elsewhere

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
attention wholeheartedly elsewhere

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.910 
attention wholeheartedly elsewhere
because<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:02.640> just<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.570> don't<00:04:04.140> know<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.590> can't

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
because it just I don't know I can't

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.759 
because it just I don't know I can't
wrap<00:04:05.070> my<00:04:05.130> head<00:04:05.310> around<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.230> may<00:04:07.230> seem<00:04:07.530> like

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
wrap my head around it and may seem like

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.370 
wrap my head around it and may seem like
I<00:04:07.950> am<00:04:08.160> being<00:04:08.190> pessimistic<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.690> guess<00:04:10.230> I'm

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
I am being pessimistic but I guess I'm

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.229 
I am being pessimistic but I guess I'm
just<00:04:10.500> being<00:04:10.769> realistic<00:04:11.130> like<00:04:11.489> put<00:04:11.910> yourself

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
just being realistic like put yourself

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.690 
just being realistic like put yourself
in<00:04:12.360> my<00:04:12.390> position<00:04:12.660> could<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.350> really<00:04:14.250> imagine

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
in my position could you really imagine

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.140 
in my position could you really imagine
yourself<00:04:15.420> making<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.470> living<00:04:16.620> on<00:04:16.979> into<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.729> I

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
yourself making a living on into your I

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.510 
yourself making a living on into your I
don't<00:04:18.419> know<00:04:18.540> 30<00:04:19.440> years<00:04:19.739> from<00:04:19.890> now<00:04:19.979> doing<00:04:20.310> this

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
don't know 30 years from now doing this

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.060 
don't know 30 years from now doing this
I<00:04:20.700> just<00:04:20.940> think<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.239> either<00:04:21.870> YouTube<00:04:22.680> will

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
I just think that either YouTube will

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.140 
I just think that either YouTube will
some

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
some

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.689 
some
something<00:04:24.660> either<00:04:25.100> attention<00:04:26.100> will<00:04:26.250> ship<00:04:26.520> to

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
something either attention will ship to

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.270 
something either attention will ship to
some<00:04:26.940> other<00:04:27.090> subject<00:04:27.660> matter<00:04:27.930> or<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:29.009> site

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
some other subject matter or the site

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.480 
some other subject matter or the site
will<00:04:29.580> fail<00:04:30.090> or<00:04:30.419> something<00:04:31.290> or<00:04:31.830> just<00:04:31.889> something

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
will fail or something or just something

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.180 
will fail or something or just something
will<00:04:32.820> happen<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.660> well<00:04:33.900> it's<00:04:34.259> like<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.740> said

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
will happen that well it's like I said

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.060 
will happen that well it's like I said
it<00:04:36.000> before<00:04:36.120> but<00:04:36.389> it's<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:37.740> good<00:04:38.039> it's

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
it before but it's it's so good it's

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.610 
it before but it's it's so good it's
like<00:04:38.370> too<00:04:38.639> good<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.910> be<00:04:39.030> true<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.570> as<00:04:40.350> I've

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
like too good to be true and as I've

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.129 
like too good to be true and as I've
said<00:04:40.650> many<00:04:40.919> times<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.270> think<00:04:42.509> it<00:04:42.630> was<00:04:42.780> the

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
said many times and I think it was the

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.600 
said many times and I think it was the
last<00:04:43.289> time<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.560> said<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.800> was<00:04:43.919> in<00:04:44.039> two<00:04:44.250> videos

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
last time I said it was in two videos

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.830 
last time I said it was in two videos
ago<00:04:45.590> that<00:04:46.590> when<00:04:47.220> something<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.300> try<00:04:48.780> to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
ago that when something is so I try to

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.870 
ago that when something is so I try to
assume<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.650> worst<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.460> when<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.699> best

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
assume the worst so that when the best

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.420 
assume the worst so that when the best
comes<00:04:51.150> out<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.539> it<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:52.410> can<00:04:52.889> be<00:04:53.009> pleasantly

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
comes out of it I can be pleasantly

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.279 
comes out of it I can be pleasantly
surprised<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.210> this<00:04:54.300> case<00:04:54.479> I<00:04:54.660> guess<00:04:54.840> I'm

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
surprised so in this case I guess I'm

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.219 
surprised so in this case I guess I'm
assuming<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:55.889> this<00:04:56.009> will<00:04:56.430> not<00:04:56.580> last<00:04:56.639> um<00:04:57.389> so

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
assuming that this will not last um so

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.260 
assuming that this will not last um so
that<00:04:58.380> if<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.590> does<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:59.039> can<00:04:59.760> be<00:04:59.940> awestruck<00:05:00.720> at<00:05:01.139> it

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
that if it does I can be awestruck at it

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.080 
that if it does I can be awestruck at it
so<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.300> don't<00:05:03.510> know<00:05:03.600> all<00:05:04.500> this<00:05:04.710> stuff<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.970> makes

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
so I don't know all this stuff it makes

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.640 
so I don't know all this stuff it makes
me<00:05:06.300> happy<00:05:06.630> but<00:05:07.500> at<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.680> same<00:05:07.889> time<00:05:08.270> school<00:05:09.270> is

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
school is where the focus should be

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.200
