let's<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.940> something<00:00:57.440> more<00:00:58.440> advanced<00:00:59.399> we're

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
let's do something more advanced we're

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.020 
let's do something more advanced we're
going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.840> implant<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.399> we're

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
going to do a implant here and we're

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.399 
going to do a implant here and we're
going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.180> follow<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.870> flashing

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
going to follow the flashing

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.830 
going to follow the flashing
instructions<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> top<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.090> tell<00:01:06.360> us<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
instructions at the top that tell us to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.090 
instructions at the top that tell us to
just<00:01:07.670> outline<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.380> opposing<00:01:10.380> matching<00:01:10.860> teeth

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
just outline the opposing matching teeth

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.080 
just outline the opposing matching teeth
roughly<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:13.650> automatically<00:01:14.369> makes<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.820> mirror

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
roughly it automatically makes a mirror

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.120 
roughly it automatically makes a mirror
copy<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.659> those<00:01:15.869> teeth<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.979> then

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
copy of those teeth so that you can then

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
copy of those teeth so that you can then
move<00:01:17.340> them<00:01:17.580> over<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:18.150> place<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.080> turns

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
move them over into place and it turns

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.289 
move them over into place and it turns
them<00:01:19.560> into<00:01:19.680> rubber<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.460> makes<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.119> very

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
them into rubber it makes them very

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.340 
them into rubber it makes them very
pliable<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.130> adjust<00:01:23.250> them<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
pliable so that you can adjust them and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.990 
pliable so that you can adjust them and
at<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> point<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.310> person<00:01:26.820> now

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
at this point this person now

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
at this point this person now
understands<00:01:27.960> how<00:01:28.110> much<00:01:28.290> better<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:28.799> would

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
understands how much better they would

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.980 
understands how much better they would
look<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:29.970> had<00:01:30.240> those<00:01:30.420> two<00:01:30.720> teeth

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
look if they had those two teeth

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.340 
look if they had those two teeth
replaced<00:01:32.540> we're<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.320> and

replaced we're going to go in here and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.640 
replaced we're going to go in here and
do<00:01:34.590> something<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> much<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.729> complex

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650

done on a lot of systems this would be

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.980 
done on a lot of systems this would be
step<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.770> 12<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.640> with<00:02:02.820> snap<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.780> are
