 what to do to cook a good one 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.779
 flat what we answer is the expense 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.370
 remember that the ingredients that 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.410
 used are the most important thing 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.820
 if they are in season they are fresher than most 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.380

 citrus fish cooking tuna al 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.420
 sesame with a piece of oranges usually 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.550
 we use oranges to make us juices 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.399
 or jams today instead we will make them 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.489
 pesto ingredients for 2 people 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.520
 tuna fillets sesame seeds 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.110
 an orange basil almond pine nuts oil 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.250
 extra virgin olive oil salt and pepper 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.590
 wet the tuna fillets in oil 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.550
 abundant and let them marinate some 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.440
 in the meantime , peel the orange 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.880
 in vivo eliminating together with the peel 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:26.250
 also the bitter white part cut it 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:30.030
 pieces wash the basil and put it 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.650
 about thirty leaves when 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.450
 choose oranges and always check 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.909
 a dimension does not have to be too much 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.680
 large the fruit must be whole 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.080
 without dents with the skin well 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.939
 colored and adherent the pulp the petiole 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.270
 green and intense aroma 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.740
 avoid soft and dull oranges 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.869
 put the orange in the mixer the leaves 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.150
 of basil a dozen almonds e 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.369
 some pine nuts the amount of fruit 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.060
 dried can vary according to your taste 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.680
 add a little oil, salt and pepper 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.310
 we whisk everything very well in a cream 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.439
 homogeneous 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.310
 if it is too thick, add 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.810
 other oil or orange juice le 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.640
 oranges can be stored in 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.920
 refrigerator in the fruit drawer 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.660
 for 45 days but must be kept in 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.670
 paper bags to protect them 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.650
 from humidity to room temperature 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.570
 instead they last three or four days 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.610
 be careful not to keep in environments 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.590
 hot and dry because they dehydrate and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.590
 the pulp loses on that b dezza 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.130
 we remove the tuna fillets from the oil e 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.220
 we learn there on both sides with 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.350
 abundant sesame seeds then settle down 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.510
 in a pan heated without oil and 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.570
 let them brown well on both 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.570
 sides 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.440
 the tuna is very fast here 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.360
 only seared so the time that the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.640
 sesame takes color is more than that 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.800
 enough to have the fish cooked now 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.880
 we go up both sides and serve on 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.770
 based pesto most 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.720
 vitamin c contained in the rancia yes 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.970
 find in the tree that the white part is 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.830
 the spongy juice contains it 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.660
 only 25 percent 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.070
 a tip before squeezing 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.800

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.820
