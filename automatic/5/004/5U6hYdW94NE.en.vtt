00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.420 

don't<00:05:53.020> think<00:05:53.230> I<00:05:53.290> got<00:05:53.530> many<00:05:53.740> books<00:05:53.980> last<00:05:54.250> year

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
don't think I got many books last year

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.740 
don't think I got many books last year
so<00:05:54.670> I<00:05:54.730> think<00:05:54.790> that's<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.240> biggest<00:05:55.450> part<00:05:55.660> of

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
so I think that's the biggest part of

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.140 
so I think that's the biggest part of
this<00:05:56.080> now<00:05:56.310> I'm<00:05:57.310> just<00:05:57.490> getting<00:05:57.760> up<00:05:57.850> then<00:05:58.090> I

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
this now I'm just getting up then I

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:06.150 
this now I'm just getting up then I
think<00:05:58.330> I<00:05:58.420> can<00:05:58.540> put<00:05:58.690> on<00:06:04.800> what<00:06:05.800> does<00:06:05.860> it<00:06:05.920> mean<00:06:06.070> to

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
think I can put on what does it mean to

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:22.549 
think I can put on what does it mean to
get<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.370> do<00:06:06.460> something<00:06:06.700> like<00:06:06.760> this

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:22.559
