 it is one of the just 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.339
 kawasaki his name is a classic 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.530
 within the brand since it takes more than 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.140
 30 years rolling on the road 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.409
 this 2014 version in a matt black color 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.960
 makes her very attractive is a motorcycle mate 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.120
 very nice and easy to confuse about 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.339
 all on roads with wide curves or 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.979
 average and cruise speeds in between 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.789

 in v of 45 degrees of 903 centimeters 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.710
 cubic enough silent to be a 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.690
 custom electronic injection and 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.060
 water cooling 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.280
 the propeller has a nice 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.800
 for engine 78 minutes meters of a 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.660
 power of 48 horses somewhat scarce 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.060
 to achieve optimal top speed 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.730
 the five-speed gearbox 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.920
 allows for smooth shifts and 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.140
 with a good exchange ratio the 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.660
 power is transmitted by strap what 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.180
 which improves comfort the cycle part 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.280
 equips a single front brake 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.920
 300 mm disc and one rear disc 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.000
 270 millimeters enough to slow down 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.630
 even accompanied his weight round the 280 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.080
 kilos which penalizes in city and 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.000
 Corpulent pilots favors them since 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.820
 its position of the center of gravity is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.310
 pretty low we have a fork 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.720
 front of 41 mm enough 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.570
 for the work required this kind of 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.420
 motorcycle and a multitrack rear suspension 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.610
 that simulate rigid suspensions what 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.800
 first to highlight is the comfort that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 a custom is supposed to emphasize its handlebar 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.650
 something curved that together with a position 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.959
 from the feet 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.689

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:22.340
 comfortable and allows you to do enough 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.170
 kilometers without failing
