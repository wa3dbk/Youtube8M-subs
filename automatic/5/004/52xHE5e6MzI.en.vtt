00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.050
 hello is not the first letter that you 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.150
 I write but these are different from those 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.860
 before I recounted I found what it does 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.629
 I lost my temper so much that you do not 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.450
 You were in my everything and you will always be my 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.280
 nothing I feel better and something I do not like 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.920
 that I think without thinking it was not 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.960
 wrong looking back he took me all 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.330
 ahead I stayed in the time that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 a while ago you overcame you left a lot 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.009
 more than an illusion wound leave you is what 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 that I least wanted but I have a 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.330
 way to avoid farewells I sing to 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.399
 your memories to chat more often 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.140
 so much to ask you but I do not know very 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.329
 well if the possible answers me 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.100
 I would like to know, I knew it was 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.890
 dangerous to follow his footprint 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.050
 changed the path if it was not her that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 is what happens if a certainty is doubtful 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 I do not see myself erasing I hope I saw you 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.079
 blurred between things and things that the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.269
 wind took ' cups until you become 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.489
 in what the hurricane left if sadly 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.320
 I count my seconds without a voice I know that for 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.239
 I'm too late without looking at the clock 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.489
 although I wait for twelve maybe 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.610
 I can see you but my hope goes down as 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.680
 the needle until 6 I have your image as 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.010
 map and a compass pointing my north 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.680
 in case it escapes without 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.990
 that is the floor decide if I want to 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.850
 to seek I seek your whereabouts 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.160
 I am like a pirate sailing to infinity 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.740
 but so they searched for it just that it's 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.600
 damn today the confusion talks to me and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.340
 It tells me that I loved you like nobody 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.710
 like nobody wanted so many 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.720
 situations and just a testimony by 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.880
 much water does not bloom in autumn 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.320
 so that those flowers that defoliated where 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.720
 Fueres for not doing is the answer 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.970
 I do not want to wake up 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.310
 realize that a dream escapes that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.530
 we had but I'm really afraid that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.210
 I do not worry about what could happen to him if 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.790
 I do not understand if I feel bad or if I 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.010
 I feel good nor am I being asked to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.870
 took a risk of your bitter drink with the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.820
 that you once offered, although I do not have 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.500
 plans back by this time I deny that 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.210
 Your name is very good and I do not know if you are going to 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.600
 call you 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.920
 yeah 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 If the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.009
 technical margin when the best is not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:12.390
 It only remains to wish him the best 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.390
 wherever you are 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.959
 I know you're listening
