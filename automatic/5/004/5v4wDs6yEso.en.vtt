00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
that way if you do lose control they're

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.280 
that way if you do lose control they're
not<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.660> have<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.870> ball<00:03:20.019> it's<00:03:20.110> going<00:03:20.170> to

not going to have the ball it's going to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.539

be<00:03:20.350> top<00:03:20.530> center<00:03:20.829> again<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.250> can<00:03:21.370> try<00:03:21.489> to

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
be top center again and you can try to

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.400 
be top center again and you can try to
stop<00:03:21.820> them<00:03:21.970> from<00:03:22.030> getting<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:23.260> if<00:03:23.380> you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
stop them from getting it but if you
