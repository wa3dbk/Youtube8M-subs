00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
them I want I want it to be their

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.230 

my<00:01:15.110> teaching<00:01:15.530> philosophy<00:01:15.759> essentially<00:01:16.790> with

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
my teaching philosophy essentially with

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.510 
my teaching philosophy essentially with
electronics<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:18.799> could<00:01:18.950> do<00:01:19.070> whatever<00:01:19.250> you

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
electronics is you could do whatever you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.289 
electronics is you could do whatever you
want<00:01:19.790> but<00:01:20.329> make<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.380> real<00:01:21.649> they<00:01:22.369> don't<00:01:22.580> have<00:01:23.090> to

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
want but make it real they don't have to

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.160 
want but make it real they don't have to
be<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.780> sone<00:01:24.110> you've<00:01:24.259> heard<00:01:24.649> before<00:01:25.030> but<00:01:26.170> they

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
be a sone you've heard before but they

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.170 
be a sone you've heard before but they
need<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.590> have<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:27.979> same<00:01:28.220> characteristics<00:01:29.030> as

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
need to have the same characteristics as

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.889 
need to have the same characteristics as
an<00:01:29.329> acoustic<00:01:29.780> instrument<00:01:31.509> one<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.720> great

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
an acoustic instrument one of the great

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.690 
an acoustic instrument one of the great
things<00:01:33.110> about<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.500> mandala<00:01:34.130> drum<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.549> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
things about the mandala drum is the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.090 
things about the mandala drum is the
fact<00:01:34.939> that<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:36.110> have<00:01:36.380> all<00:01:36.679> of<00:01:36.920> those

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
fact that you you have all of those

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.880 
fact that you you have all of those
concentric<00:01:38.000> rings<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:38.929> you're<00:01:39.500> able<00:01:39.860> to

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
concentric rings and you're able to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.179 
concentric rings and you're able to
recreate<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:41.110> acoustic<00:01:42.110> phenomena

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
recreate that acoustic phenomena

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.730 
recreate that acoustic phenomena
with<00:01:43.429> whatever<00:01:44.000> sound<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:45.020> would<00:01:45.229> put<00:01:45.470> into

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
with whatever sound you would put into

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.639 
with whatever sound you would put into
it<00:01:45.890> it's<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.369> pretty<00:01:46.580> open-ended<00:01:47.000> tool<00:01:50.409> it's<00:01:51.409> so

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
it it's a pretty open-ended tool it's so

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.740 
it it's a pretty open-ended tool it's so
easy<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.039> walk<00:01:52.159> up<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.520> something<00:01:53.270> electronic

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
easy to walk up to something electronic

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.249 
easy to walk up to something electronic
and<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.330> know<00:01:56.360> if<00:01:56.569> there<00:01:56.780> yeah<00:01:56.959> and<00:01:57.110> you

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
and just you know if there yeah and you

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.180 
and just you know if there yeah and you
like<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:58.459> know<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:59.750> want<00:02:00.289> you'd<00:02:00.709> play<00:02:01.009> all

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
like it you know I want you'd play all

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.529 
like it you know I want you'd play all
that<00:02:01.459> I<00:02:01.520> want<00:02:01.880> my<00:02:02.060> students<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:04.360> create<00:02:05.360> their

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
that I want my students to create their

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:16.530 
that I want my students to create their
own<00:02:05.780> instruments<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:07.179> with<00:02:08.179> electronics

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.280 

you
