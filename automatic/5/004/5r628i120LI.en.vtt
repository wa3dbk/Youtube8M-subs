00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
counter strike I remember going to a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.230 
counter strike I remember going to a
friend's<00:00:16.320> house<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.830> he<00:00:17.520> had<00:00:17.610> this<00:00:17.759> compact

friend's house and he had this compact

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.769 
friend's house and he had this compact
computer<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.930> was<00:00:19.200> his<00:00:19.529> moms<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.570> he<00:00:21.570> had<00:00:21.750> I

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
think of Voodoo 3 at the time and we

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.220 
think of Voodoo 3 at the time and we
were<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:23.970> SAT<00:00:24.390> there<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.779> hours<00:00:24.840> just

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
were just SAT there for hours just

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.810 
were just SAT there for hours just
switching<00:00:25.949> off<00:00:26.099> every<00:00:26.400> couple<00:00:26.580> rounds

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
switching off every couple rounds

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.759 
switching off every couple rounds
playing<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:28.170> was<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.590> was

in<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> betas<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.429> soon<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.090> started

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
in the betas and soon as I started

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.030 
in the betas and soon as I started
playing<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.170> was<00:00:31.320> hooked<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.710> counter

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
playing I was I was hooked on counter

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
playing I was I was hooked on counter

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
strike I played you know 1.0 1.1 1.3 1.5

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
strike I played you know 1.0 1.1 1.3 1.5
1.6<00:00:38.000> started<00:00:39.000> playing<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.420> know<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
1.6 started playing you know the you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.869 
1.6 started playing you know the you
know<00:00:40.589> our<00:00:40.710> counter-strike<00:00:41.100> guys<00:00:41.400> never<00:00:41.640> talk

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
know our counter-strike guys never talk

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.729 
know our counter-strike guys never talk
about<00:00:42.000> condition<00:00:42.510> zero<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.199> played<00:00:43.409> that<00:00:43.589> for

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
about condition zero so played that for

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.829 
about condition zero so played that for
like<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> day<00:00:44.159> and<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.460> tossed<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.119> play

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
like a day and then tossed it out play

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.630 
like a day and then tossed it out play
it<00:00:45.900> a<00:00:45.960> lot<00:00:46.080> played<00:00:46.589> a<00:00:46.619> lot<00:00:46.799> of<00:00:46.830> source<00:00:47.159> as<00:00:47.460> well

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it a lot played a lot of source as well

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.340 
it a lot played a lot of source as well
and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.600> course<00:00:48.629> i'm<00:00:48.989> playing<00:00:49.229> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and then of course i'm playing a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.930 
and then of course i'm playing a
counter-strike<00:00:49.949> go<00:00:50.129> right<00:00:50.369> now<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.909> think

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
counter-strike go right now and I think

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880 
counter-strike go right now and I think
counter-strike<00:00:51.720> go<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> nice<00:00:52.470> evolution

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
counter-strike go was a nice evolution

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.939 
counter-strike go was a nice evolution
of<00:00:53.400> 1.6<00:00:54.260> source<00:00:55.260> didn't<00:00:55.589> really<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.830> a<00:00:55.860> whole

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
of 1.6 source didn't really do a whole

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.340 
of 1.6 source didn't really do a whole
lot<00:00:56.339> for<00:00:56.729> me<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.180> counter-strike<00:00:58.019> Oh<00:00:58.199> has

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
lot for me but counter-strike Oh has

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
lot for me but counter-strike Oh has
been<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.769> a<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.280> solid<00:00:59.610> version<00:01:00.510> it's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
been I think a really solid version it's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
been I think a really solid version it's
probably<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:00.960> best<00:01:01.220> updated<00:01:02.220> version<00:01:02.610> from

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
probably the best updated version from

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.969 
probably the best updated version from
1.6<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.720> they've<00:01:03.869> ever<00:01:04.019> done<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.470> used<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
1.6 that they've ever done I used to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
1.6 that they've ever done I used to
play<00:01:05.309> tournaments<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.000> used<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> travel<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.869> up

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
play tournaments I used to travel all up

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.230 
play tournaments I used to travel all up
and<00:01:07.350> down<00:01:07.439> California<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> when

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and down California and this is when

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.810 
and down California and this is when
like<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> land<00:01:10.020> cafe<00:01:10.290> scene<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.039> huge<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
like the land cafe scene was huge and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
like the land cafe scene was huge and
every<00:01:12.630> single<00:01:12.929> weekend<00:01:13.320> there'd<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.649> a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
every single weekend there'd be a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.109 
every single weekend there'd be a
different<00:01:14.100> tournament<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.759> different
