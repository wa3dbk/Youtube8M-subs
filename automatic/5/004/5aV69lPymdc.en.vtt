00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
here in the bottom of the unit

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.449 
here in the bottom of the unit
you<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.079> insert<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.349> right<00:02:42.709> there<00:02:45.459> take

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
you just insert that right there take

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.300 
you just insert that right there take
the<00:02:46.579> card<00:02:46.760> again<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.890> right<00:02:49.069> there<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.250> the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
middle pops right open yeah so then you

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.449 
middle pops right open yeah so then you
got<00:02:57.440> access<00:02:57.769> again<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.099> if<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.250> do<00:02:58.340> have

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
something in there you're not gonna have

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.330 
something in there you're not gonna have
to<00:02:59.959> worry<00:03:00.079> about<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.319> batteries<00:03:00.709> shutting

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
to worry about the batteries shutting

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.650 
to worry about the batteries shutting
down<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:01.879> your<00:03:02.030> stuffs<00:03:02.269> locked<00:03:02.480> inside

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
down and then your stuffs locked inside

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.170 
down and then your stuffs locked inside
forever<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.280> you're<00:03:04.579> gonna<00:03:04.670> have<00:03:04.849> access
