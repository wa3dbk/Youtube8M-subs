I'm sorry but I had to include this okay
by<00:07:00.060> the<00:07:00.120> way<00:07:00.300> guys<00:07:00.509> um<00:07:00.990> just<00:07:01.830> to<00:07:01.919> add<00:07:02.100> again<00:07:02.370> I

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
by the way guys um just to add again I

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.840 
by the way guys um just to add again I
have<00:07:03.210> to<00:07:03.389> add<00:07:03.479> this<00:07:03.690> the<00:07:04.470> trick<00:07:04.830> to<00:07:05.220> doing<00:07:05.250> this

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
have to add this the trick to doing this

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.510 
have to add this the trick to doing this
I<00:07:05.910> guess<00:07:06.389> is<00:07:06.690> power<00:07:07.620> sliding<00:07:08.009> when<00:07:08.190> you're<00:07:08.370> on

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
I guess is power sliding when you're on

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.580 
I guess is power sliding when you're on
this<00:07:08.759> Beanstalk<00:07:09.030> meaning<00:07:09.750> tapping<00:07:10.110> be<00:07:10.259> during

this Beanstalk meaning tapping be during
your<00:07:10.740> turn<00:07:10.949> it<00:07:11.160> really<00:07:11.580> helps<00:07:12.030> it<00:07:12.630> really

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289
