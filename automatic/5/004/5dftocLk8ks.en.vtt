can see the presets change with that so

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.600 
can see the presets change with that so
we're<00:02:51.170> going<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.319> say<00:02:51.530> beef<00:02:51.980> well-done<00:02:52.549> and

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
we're going to say beef well-done and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.509 
we're going to say beef well-done and
say<00:02:52.970> set<00:02:53.410> that's<00:02:54.410> locked<00:02:54.769> in<00:02:54.980> probe<00:02:55.310> number

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
say set that's locked in probe number

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.630 
say set that's locked in probe number
one<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:55.970> set<00:02:56.150> at<00:02:56.299> meat<00:02:56.840> beef<00:02:57.379> well<00:02:58.099> done

one is set at meat beef well done

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.140 
one is set at meat beef well done
this<00:02:59.629> is<00:02:59.870> flashing<00:03:00.349> now<00:03:00.500> because<00:03:00.950> we<00:03:01.579> have<00:03:01.790> we

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
this is flashing now because we have we

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.840 
this is flashing now because we have we
have<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.450> turn<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.950> alert<00:03:03.950> off<00:03:04.160> hi<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:04.609> can

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
have to turn the alert off hi you can

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.699 
have to turn the alert off hi you can
see<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.209> both<00:03:05.329> probes<00:03:05.690> are<00:03:05.930> reading<00:03:06.200> 79

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
see that both probes are reading 79

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.410 
see that both probes are reading 79
degrees<00:03:07.010> it's<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.310> little<00:03:07.519> warm<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.850> here

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
degrees it's a little warm in here

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.240 
degrees it's a little warm in here
this<00:03:08.810> they've<00:03:09.049> been<00:03:09.260> plugged<00:03:09.739> into<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.100> back

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
this they've been plugged into the back

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.710 
this they've been plugged into the back
of<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.489> transmitter<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.150> again<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:11.540> is

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
of the transmitter and again this is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.280 
of the transmitter and again this is
good<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.019> 300<00:03:12.500> feet<00:03:15.130> for<00:03:16.130> probe<00:03:16.340> 2<00:03:16.639> we<00:03:17.329> can<00:03:17.630> I'll

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
good to 300 feet for probe 2 we can I'll

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.930 
good to 300 feet for probe 2 we can I'll
show<00:03:18.500> you<00:03:18.560> how<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.799> set<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.370> now<00:03:19.579> so<00:03:19.790> you're

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
show you how to set that now so you're

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.460 
show you how to set that now so you're
going<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.120> hit<00:03:20.380> set<00:03:23.019> now<00:03:24.019> it's<00:03:24.139> saying<00:03:24.290> what

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
going to hit set now it's saying what

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.620 
going to hit set now it's saying what
probe<00:03:24.769> we've<00:03:25.489> already<00:03:25.639> done<00:03:25.910> one<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.389> we<00:03:26.480> want

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
probe we've already done one so we want

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.559 
probe we've already done one so we want
to<00:03:26.720> go<00:03:26.780> probe<00:03:27.049> 2<00:03:27.290> we're<00:03:28.130> going<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.310> hit<00:03:28.400> set<00:03:28.760> we

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
to go probe 2 we're going to hit set we

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.270 
to go probe 2 we're going to hit set we
want<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.840> do<00:03:29.959> barbecue<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:30.709> here<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.130> could

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
want to do barbecue but here you could

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.870 
want to do barbecue but here you could
change<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.609> again<00:03:31.760> by<00:03:32.569> pressing<00:03:32.959> mode<00:03:33.880> we're

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
change it again by pressing mode we're

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.280 
change it again by pressing mode we're
going<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.060> say<00:03:35.150> barbecue<00:03:35.690> we're<00:03:35.959> going<00:03:36.079> to<00:03:36.139> say

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
going to say barbecue we're going to say

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.020 
going to say barbecue we're going to say
set<00:03:36.620> now<00:03:37.340> we're<00:03:37.430> going<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.579> set<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.880> high

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
set now we're going to set the high

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.740 
set now we're going to set the high
temperature<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.870> we<00:03:39.019> can<00:03:39.200> lower<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:41.599> we

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
temperature and we can lower it and we

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.449 
temperature and we can lower it and we
can<00:03:41.930> raise<00:03:42.169> it<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:42.530> this<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.709> going<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:43.040> monitor

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
can raise it so this is going to monitor

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.780 
can raise it so this is going to monitor
your<00:03:43.579> BBQ<00:03:44.060> temperature<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:46.250> we<00:03:46.430> set<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:46.669> for

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
your BBQ temperature so we set it for

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.379 
your BBQ temperature so we set it for
200<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.569> actually<00:03:48.530> we'll<00:03:48.650> go<00:03:48.739> lower<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:50.239> I

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
200 and actually we'll go lower and I

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.420 
200 and actually we'll go lower and I
believe<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.019> low<00:03:51.230> one<00:03:51.470> will<00:03:51.709> go<00:03:53.980> will<00:03:54.980> default

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
believe the low one will go will default

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.860 
believe the low one will go will default
to<00:03:55.549> like<00:03:56.030> 3<00:03:56.299> degrees<00:03:56.630> below<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.079> highest<00:03:57.500> one

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
to like 3 degrees below the highest one

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.960 
to like 3 degrees below the highest one
so<00:03:59.870> when<00:04:00.019> we<00:04:00.169> it's<00:04:00.290> set<00:04:00.560> C<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.400> automatically

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
so when we it's set C it automatically

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.909 
so when we it's set C it automatically
set<00:04:02.329> it<00:04:02.480> used<00:04:03.169> to<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.440> problem<00:04:03.739> with<00:04:03.829> the

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
set it used to have a problem with the

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.979 
set it used to have a problem with the
other<00:04:04.010> one<00:04:04.220> with<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:05.180> right<00:04:05.449> now<00:04:05.660> it's

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
other one with that so right now it's

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.680 
other one with that so right now it's
set<00:04:06.229> at<00:04:06.350> a<00:04:06.440> silly<00:04:06.889> range<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.340> 198<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.090> 190

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
set at a silly range of 198 to 190

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.860 
set at a silly range of 198 to 190
but<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:08.990> is<00:04:09.140> all<00:04:09.320> set<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.650> go<00:04:09.770> now<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:11.360> then

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
but this is all set to go now and then

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.930 
but this is all set to go now and then
you<00:04:12.050> can<00:04:12.260> put<00:04:12.620> your<00:04:12.650> alerts<00:04:13.040> on<00:04:13.250> by<00:04:13.550> pressing

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
you can put your alerts on by pressing

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
this last alert button and now the icon

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.460 
this last alert button and now the icon
has<00:04:16.820> come<00:04:17.060> on<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.420> it<00:04:17.540> shows<00:04:17.780> this<00:04:18.170> one<00:04:18.350> is

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
has come on and it shows this one is

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.860 
has come on and it shows this one is
flashing<00:04:18.880> because<00:04:19.880> it's<00:04:20.090> not<00:04:20.269> in<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.600> range

flashing because it's not in the range

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.440 
flashing because it's not in the range
if<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:22.250> had<00:04:22.460> been<00:04:22.670> in<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.850> range<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.300> then

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
if it had been in the range and then

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.240 
if it had been in the range and then
gone<00:04:23.660> out<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.960> range<00:04:24.260> it<00:04:24.560> would<00:04:24.830> have<00:04:24.950> actually

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250

to hit the alarm and it should

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.909 
to hit the alarm and it should
beep<00:05:56.979> when<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:57.789> temperatures<00:05:58.449> reach<00:05:58.770> 198<00:05:59.770> or

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
beep when the temperatures reach 198 or

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.629 
beep when the temperatures reach 198 or
190<00:06:00.279> 198<00:06:00.939> for<00:06:01.120> B<00:06:01.240> for<00:06:01.509> 195<00:06:01.930> for<00:06:02.289> pork<00:06:02.529> I'm<00:06:03.400> going

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
190 198 for B for 195 for pork I'm going

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.989 
190 198 for B for 195 for pork I'm going
to<00:06:03.699> normally<00:06:04.090> set<00:06:04.300> this<00:06:04.419> up<00:06:04.629> right<00:06:04.719> here<00:06:05.999> but

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:06.999 
to normally set this up right here but

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.739 
to normally set this up right here but
it<00:06:07.120> can<00:06:07.240> go<00:06:07.330> anywhere

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:07.749 
it can go anywhere

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:09.600 
it can go anywhere
this<00:06:07.990> can<00:06:08.169> go<00:06:08.289> with<00:06:08.469> us<00:06:08.590> up<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.889> 300<00:06:09.340> feet<00:06:09.370> away

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
this can go with us up to 300 feet away

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.930 
this can go with us up to 300 feet away
so<00:06:09.759> we<00:06:10.060> concluded<00:06:10.509> over<00:06:10.659> here
