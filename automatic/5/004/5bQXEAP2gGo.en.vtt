00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.620 
applications as well so I want to start
with<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:33.329> 200<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> new<00:00:36.120> IBO

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
with the the 200 so this is the new IBO

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.200 
with the the 200 so this is the new IBO
a<00:00:36.690> design<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:38.570> one<00:00:39.570> fit<00:00:39.840> Arbor<00:00:41.210> designed

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
a design it's the one fit Arbor designed

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.020 
a design it's the one fit Arbor designed
to<00:00:42.480> fit<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.430> Dremel<00:00:44.430> quick<00:00:44.670> release<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to fit the Dremel quick release and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.190 
to fit the Dremel quick release and
Rockwell<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.850> essentially<00:00:47.850> all<00:00:48.200> multi-tools

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.290 
hardwood see it's a more aggressive
tooth<00:02:40.520> it's<00:02:41.520> almost<00:02:42.320> conical<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.470> shape<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
tooth it's almost conical in shape and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.000 
tooth it's almost conical in shape and
they<00:02:45.300> are<00:02:45.570> staggered<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.470> don't<00:02:46.740> know<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:46.920> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
they are staggered I don't know if you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.630 
they are staggered I don't know if you
can<00:02:47.190> let's<00:02:48.120> see<00:02:48.270> if<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.630> see<00:02:49.070> ya<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.460> can

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
can let's see if we can see ya you can

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.290 
can let's see if we can see ya you can
see<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.970> staggering<00:02:51.690> they're<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.970> nice<00:02:53.970> blade

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
see the staggering they're so nice blade

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.540 
see the staggering they're so nice blade
for<00:02:54.690> for<00:02:55.140> harder<00:02:55.500> wood<00:02:55.650> applications<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.520> well

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
for for harder wood applications as well

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.110 
for for harder wood applications as well
and<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:58.500> thing<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:58.800> like<00:02:58.980> about<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.940> J

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
and the thing I like about the the J

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.810 
and the thing I like about the the J
tooth<00:03:00.330> design<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.370> not<00:03:02.370> only<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.790> it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
tooth design is that not only is it

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.180 
tooth design is that not only is it
accurate<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.810> does<00:03:04.050> cut<00:03:04.290> very<00:03:04.590> very<00:03:04.890> fast

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
accurate but it does cut very very fast

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.050 
accurate but it does cut very very fast
one<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.240> our<00:03:06.330> clients<00:03:06.780> even<00:03:07.680> said<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.430> he

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
one of our clients even said that he

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.630 
one of our clients even said that he
uses<00:03:09.270> his<00:03:09.570> J<00:03:09.780> tooth<00:03:09.990> design<00:03:10.380> he<00:03:11.310> slashes

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
uses his J tooth design he slashes

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.310 
uses his J tooth design he slashes
through<00:03:11.850> two<00:03:12.150> by<00:03:12.270> fours<00:03:12.570> with<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.170> two

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
through two by fours with the the two

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.350 
through two by fours with the the two
and<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> half<00:03:13.650> inch<00:03:13.890> which<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:16.190> right<00:03:17.190> here<00:03:17.460> but

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
and a half inch which is right here but

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.180 
and a half inch which is right here but
we'll<00:03:19.020> get<00:03:19.110> into<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.440> one<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.770> little<00:03:19.920> later

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
we'll get into that one a little later

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.750 
we'll get into that one a little later
but<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.870> will<00:03:22.110> go<00:03:22.290> through<00:03:22.620> all<00:03:23.160> types<00:03:23.520> of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
but it will go through all types of

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.480 
but it will go through all types of
softwood<00:03:24.390> applications<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.340> really

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
softwood applications this is really

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.800 
softwood applications this is really
nice<00:03:26.730> for<00:03:27.000> cutting<00:03:27.980> outlet<00:03:28.980> holes<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:30.330> other

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
nice for cutting outlet holes and other
