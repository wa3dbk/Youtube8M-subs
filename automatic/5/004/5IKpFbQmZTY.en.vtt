00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.780
 last week we were touring the colony blue water covering the 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.279
 celebrations for the founding anniversary of this place 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.060
 and touring the fields watching the production of livestock agriculture 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.289
 the cooperative organization we also find an alternative to 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.979
 traditional production in this place 15 embassy production 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:35.379
 let's see what it's about because mainly turkey in them the 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.379
 profitability of this product 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.450
 the macadamia 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.110
 it is a new production item of the country 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.100
 It has an important commercial and nutritional value 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.830
 for containing healthy fats with different vitamins and minerals suitable 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.450
 for feeding 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.750
 apart from the federal income, the fruits of macadamia are also 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.040
 used in the manufacture of cosmetic products 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.450
 This item constitutes an economically and ecologically viable alternative 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.070
 the somewhat frightened cooperative has a plantation of 180 hectares to kill 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.640
 amia 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.920
 having as objectives the mitigation of environmental impacts and 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.530
 economic benefits 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.900
 a representative of this cooperative 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 The export of this item is not explained in more detail 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.780
 the idea 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.590
 of the macadamia item in the junk cooperative 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.260
 g the following 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.789
 It's a little bit 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.260
 consolidate it with the environment 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
 I will try to mitigate 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.540
 i 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.759
 with this 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.030
 achieve 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.290
 than the direct seeding system that what we get agriculture 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.840
 has also been supported by the mitigation measures is 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.940
 tree plantations 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.140
 especially in the reservoirs of the lake guasu 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.520
 so 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.450
 the pri in food the importance d of this species 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.929
 the macadamia because it also generates a hugo gresca 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:16.300
 to the producer and the cooperative itself to be able to get a little bit 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.680
 covering the expenses unfulfilled 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.310
 in the facilities of the macadamia or another crop 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.699
 in one hectare 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.599
 percent is very important this item 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.200
 we stand out because we are venturing into very important business niches 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.449
 especially in export we already have business starter with japan 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.959
 and also today for everything and we are doomed to venture into the market 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.099
 Brazilian 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.690
 where this product is very desirable 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.549
 especially in the business niches called pastry 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.620
 per cent is used in cake in ice cream to flavor and so on 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.870
 in a lot of applications per hundred in culinary 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.659
 then it is a line 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:01.770
 important 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.379
 for I said at the beginning to mitigate 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.069
 in the environment 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.139
 and considering these utilities 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.219
 that's why the prospects or expectations for a future only in terms of 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.259
 profitability on this product 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.860
 we started the first export to japan efe 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.970
 It also has a good application on the pit 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.219
 not only be used 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:29.430
 almond is used but also the stone where it served as it is very 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.199
 common to each other serves as a producer by showing heat energy 100 thousand as 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.129
 an ugly that including firewood 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.250
 it has a very important value added price 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.310
 I do not remember at the moment but yes, percent is an interesting item since 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.719
 formal point of view 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.199
 the interior ortigoza 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.489
 He also provided some recommendations for producers in regards to 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.809
 as plantation techniques of this item 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:04:01.279
 the truth that the macadamia has to do or if it did the mother plant has to 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:02.760
 be one that produces 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.729
 large amount of fruits 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:10.519
 i if it is produced by means of spies or clones 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.479
 is in the uncertain task for this axis to accompany the mother plant 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.009
 you will achieve and high production 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.620
 yield per hectare pse 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.460
 if it is an ordinary plant a 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.280
 muna macadamia there is no certain 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.409
 normally it does not produce 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.979
 hong does not produce good amount of grain is to say that the macadamia yes or yes 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.749
 it has to be different given to be able to produce 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.840
 large amount of fruits 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.819
 and then where these wrongs work 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.729
 if we have a small nursery 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.370
 the Japanese team has one and another state in the technology center it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.770
 cover and also the cooperative has a bottle where the prÃ³simo the dumb 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.240
 for the person concerned
