light now the u.s. cluster has the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.460 
light now the u.s. cluster has the
cruise<00:04:30.030> light<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:30.660> for<00:04:30.780> some<00:04:30.960> reason<00:04:31.320> it's

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
cruise light but for some reason it's

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.650 
cruise light but for some reason it's
not<00:04:31.530> enabled<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:35.090> there<00:04:36.090> was<00:04:36.210> something<00:04:36.540> else

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
not enabled and there was something else

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.420 
not enabled and there was something else
that<00:04:36.780> was<00:04:36.930> neat<00:04:37.260> but<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.620> don't<00:04:37.830> remember<00:04:38.010> what

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
that was neat but I don't remember what

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.180 
that was neat but I don't remember what
it<00:04:38.520> was<00:04:38.550> so<00:04:39.000> if<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.210> remember<00:04:39.479> I<00:04:40.190> will

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
it was so if I remember I will

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.500 
it was so if I remember I will
definitely<00:04:42.000> post<00:04:42.240> about<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:44.460> think<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.419> was

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
definitely post about it I think it was

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.210 
definitely post about it I think it was
just<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.530> has<00:04:46.710> all<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.660> European

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.909 
just that it has all of the European
icons<00:04:50.240> instead<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.600> United<00:04:52.200> States<00:04:52.229> text

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
icons instead of the United States text

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.940 
icons instead of the United States text
words<00:04:53.390> which<00:04:54.390> is<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.600> pretty<00:04:55.350> cool<00:04:55.560> I<00:04:55.620> thought

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
words which is a pretty cool I thought

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.469 
words which is a pretty cool I thought
so<00:04:56.850> yeah<00:04:57.030> that's<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.510> euro<00:04:58.440> cluster<00:04:59.479> with

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
so yeah that's the euro cluster with

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.220
