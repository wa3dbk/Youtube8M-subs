00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.460
 the massive sightings 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.089
 has multiplied throughout the world and presented yoel of 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.780
 back in Korea now he presented him this month he looked in St. Petersburg before 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.919
 leningrad 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:19.829
 occurred just on August 20 in the heart of the city between 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:25.839
 the expectation of admiration of all those who were there spectacular 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.819
 It gets closer every time 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.509
 It is clear that this is a strategy 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.199
 this is a change of attitude this is a warning a warning adrian moscoso 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.330
 look at these images 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.910
 They are impressive 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.150
 the city 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
 Saint Petersburg in Russia 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.350
 a massive sighting of strange objects that truly look 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.280
 invaded that country 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.329
 these impressive images 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.620
 they took the night of August 20 of this 2011 by a person who until the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.520
 moment remains unknown 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.750
 in this material we can see in the background 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.180
 the case of literally a dozen objects that burst into space 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.070
 Russian 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.210
 this video with a duration of more than two minutes and that apparently was recorded 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.009
 with a mobile phone explained in details since as we can see 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.120
 is almost finished in the middle of the city of St. Petersburg on a night 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.110
 with a lot of city traffic 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.469
 look like a witness 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.830
 he notices that at the bottom right over those buildings 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.410
 they begin to pass a series of white objects if they are well fixed 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.620
 it has to do with stealing stars 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.820
 Other manifestations of known objects observe 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.359
 is witnessed followed one hundred 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.439
 to the massive sighting that occurred in those moments in the middle of the city 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.539
 he even tries to follow the trajectory of the objects and by incredible that 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.409
 look like 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.700
 the cars that circulate around the place 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.579
 as well as the pedestrians themselves 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.959
 They seem not to notice the spectacle that happens just above their heads 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.869
 look as witness recorded objects passing just above the people 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.120
 and the cars seem to be that everyday life 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.120
 prevents people from looking at the sky 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.729
 I observed how with this approach the witness makes in one shot 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.870
 we manage to count up to ten objects, some funnier than others 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.529
 just very strange 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.999
 almost at the end of the video the witness love of the collective transport while 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.429
 continue recording 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:51.629
 giving more authenticity to this material since at no time 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.029
 observe an edit in the video there was some cut in the shot 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:58.230
 the author of the material 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.430
 in favor of transportation and continues even trying key for objects 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.430
 from inside 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:11.109
 as we mentioned this material esri with references as it is high 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:11.919
 in the middle of the night 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.879
 we can appreciate all the buildings that frame the scene besides the 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.930
 hundreds of people who are seen walking the streets of san 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.980
 petesburg and of course cars even the witness pans 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.070
 several times 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.690
 to show all these details while the objects 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.690
 they fly over the place 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.979
 this massive sighting becomes without one of the most impressive 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.979
 happened in that country in this year 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.649
 in the duration of this material we can count more than 60 objects 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:00.239
 and although this video stands out for the clarity with which it was recorded and the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.859
 elements that already seems 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.540
 so far the top is still anonymous 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.269
 It is worth mentioning that there are people who on the internet claim that 20 of 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.270
 August in that part of Russia 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.149
 paper lamps known as Chinese lamps were released 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.819
 However, this fact has not been confirmed since this work team 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.209
 He tried to inquire more about this detail looking for some event 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.259
 extraordinary confech and some important celebration 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.160
 I could in St. Petersburg and until the closing of this report it is known that 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.760
 nothing extraordinary is celebrated on August 20 on the Russian calendar until 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.510
 the moment 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.300
 this massive sighting is still 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.360
 inexplicable
