let's<00:02:03.210> get<00:02:03.360> her<00:02:03.540> brain<00:02:03.869> hanging<00:02:04.350> out<00:02:04.530> because

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
let's get her brain hanging out because

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.100 
let's get her brain hanging out because
that's<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> nice<00:02:06.090> thing<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.329> do<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.600> Omi's

a big bite out of her head and in this
place<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:19.379> with<00:02:20.160> bending<00:02:20.700> lines<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.720> can

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
place here with bending lines we can

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.960 
place here with bending lines we can
have<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:21.989> whole<00:02:22.230> bunch<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.650> brain<00:02:23.430> kind<00:02:23.879> of
