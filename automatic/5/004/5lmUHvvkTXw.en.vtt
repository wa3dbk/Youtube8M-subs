thinking<00:02:42.019> if<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.349> will<00:02:43.060> I'm<00:02:44.060> playing<00:02:44.299> on

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
thinking if you will I'm playing on

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.009 
thinking if you will I'm playing on
level<00:02:44.720> one<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:46.359> it's<00:02:49.629> probably<00:02:50.629> going<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.900> get

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
level one so it's probably going to get

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.420 
level one so it's probably going to get
checkmated<00:02:51.650> here<00:02:51.799> in<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.950> second<00:02:52.310> I'm<00:02:52.400> not

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
checkmated here in a second I'm not

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.220 
checkmated here in a second I'm not
really<00:02:52.790> paying<00:02:53.359> much<00:02:53.480> attention<00:02:53.569> but<00:02:56.230> it's

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
really paying much attention but it's

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.680 
really paying much attention but it's
just<00:02:57.650> something<00:02:58.459> different<00:02:58.670> kind<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.599> a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
just something different kind of in a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
just something different kind of in a
way<00:02:59.870> just<00:03:01.329> makes<00:03:02.329> you<00:03:02.510> want<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.790> know<00:03:04.940> try

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
way just makes you want to you know try

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.789 
way just makes you want to you know try
basically<00:03:07.040> just<00:03:08.290> experiment<00:03:09.290> with<00:03:09.379> your

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
basically just experiment with your

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.039 
basically just experiment with your
existing<00:03:10.190> strategies<00:03:10.940> strategies<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.900> so

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
existing strategies strategies and so

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.399 
existing strategies strategies and so
forth<00:03:12.379> so<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:14.299> i'm<00:03:14.569> going<00:03:14.659> to<00:03:14.750> just<00:03:14.900> quit<00:03:15.140> here

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
forth so and i'm going to just quit here

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.800 
forth so and i'm going to just quit here
so<00:03:15.590> i<00:03:15.650> can<00:03:15.709> talk<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.459> can<00:03:16.639> do<00:03:17.209> 10<00:03:17.480> things<00:03:17.510> at

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
so i can talk it can do 10 things at

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.640 
so i can talk it can do 10 things at
once<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:19.870> think<00:03:20.870> you're<00:03:21.019> going<00:03:21.139> to<00:03:21.200> find<00:03:21.290> it

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
once I think you're going to find it

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.229 
once I think you're going to find it
neat<00:03:21.799> there<00:03:22.010> aren't<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.370> many<00:03:22.430> chest<00:03:22.970> vans

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
neat there aren't that many chest vans

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.460 
neat there aren't that many chest vans
in<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.109> app<00:03:24.560> store<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:26.319> think<00:03:27.319> there's

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
in the app store and I think there's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.960 
in the app store and I think there's
only<00:03:27.620> one<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.989> two<00:03:30.410> more<00:03:30.739> but<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:31.790> found

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
only one or two more but I really found

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.670 
only one or two more but I really found
chest<00:03:32.359> Queens<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.870> be<00:03:33.459> just<00:03:34.459> very<00:03:35.000> interesting

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
chest Queens to be just very interesting

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.080 
chest Queens to be just very interesting
