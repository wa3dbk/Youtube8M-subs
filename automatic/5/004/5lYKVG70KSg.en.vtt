looks<00:01:48.490> good<00:01:49.859> next<00:01:50.859> I'll<00:01:51.159> stir<00:01:51.399> this<00:01:51.609> up<00:01:51.819> and

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
looks good next I'll stir this up and

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.760 
looks good next I'll stir this up and
then<00:01:52.420> I'll<00:01:52.539> put<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.109> side<00:01:53.319> for<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.679> few

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
then I'll put it to the side for a few

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.649 
then I'll put it to the side for a few
hours<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.399> let<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.090> shellac<00:01:55.420> flakes

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
hours and let the shellac flakes

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.929 
hours and let the shellac flakes
dissolve<00:01:56.259> I<00:01:59.009> mixed<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.100> little<00:02:00.310> up<00:02:00.459> yesterday

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
dissolve I mixed a little up yesterday

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.929 
dissolve I mixed a little up yesterday
so<00:02:00.999> I<00:02:01.179> can<00:02:01.359> keep<00:02:01.539> working<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.350> I<00:02:03.279> guess<00:02:03.819> an

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
so I can keep working and I guess an

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.489 
so I can keep working and I guess an
important<00:02:04.420> thing<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.600> talk<00:02:04.659> about<00:02:05.139> is<00:02:05.350> the

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
important thing to talk about is the

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.949 
important thing to talk about is the
different<00:02:05.920> applicators<00:02:06.459> that<00:02:06.639> you'll<00:02:06.999> use<00:02:07.209> to

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
different applicators that you'll use to

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.070 
different applicators that you'll use to
apply<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.410> shellac<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:09.369> have<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.300> brush<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:11.020> I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
apply the shellac I have a brush that I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.990 
apply the shellac I have a brush that I
use<00:02:11.409> and<00:02:11.769> I<00:02:12.370> keep<00:02:12.640> this

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
use and I keep this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.660 
use and I keep this
brush<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:13.570> a<00:02:13.750> plastic<00:02:14.260> container<00:02:14.650> with<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:15.580> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
brush in a plastic container with just a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.180 
brush in a plastic container with just a
little<00:02:16.000> bit<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.360> denatured<00:02:17.260> alcohol<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:18.100> it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
little bit of denatured alcohol in it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.150 
little bit of denatured alcohol in it
and<00:02:18.400> I'll<00:02:18.970> use<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.570> until<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.650> NAP<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
and I'll use this until the NAP of the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.660 
and I'll use this until the NAP of the
brush<00:02:21.430> gets<00:02:21.460> kind<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.240> nasty<00:02:22.660> looking<00:02:23.640> then<00:02:24.640> I

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
brush gets kind of nasty looking then I

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.170 
brush gets kind of nasty looking then I
have<00:02:25.030> an<00:02:25.360> applicator<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.110> I've<00:02:26.350> made<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
have an applicator that I've made and I

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.000 
have an applicator that I've made and I
keep<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.140> plastic<00:02:29.320> container<00:02:29.680> with

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
keep this in a plastic container with

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.600 
keep this in a plastic container with
the<00:02:30.190> lid<00:02:30.430> on

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the lid on

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.930 
the lid on
with<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.570> little<00:02:32.040> alcohol<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.580> container

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
with a little alcohol in the container

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.320 
with a little alcohol in the container
and<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:34.270> makes<00:02:35.050> this<00:02:35.470> usable<00:02:36.220> for<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.820> really

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
and that makes this usable for a really

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.020 
and that makes this usable for a really
long<00:02:37.450> time<00:02:37.750> I've<00:02:37.930> used<00:02:37.959> these<00:02:38.440> for<00:02:38.880> more<00:02:39.880> than

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
long time I've used these for more than

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.930 
long time I've used these for more than
a<00:02:40.090> year<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.390> some<00:02:40.900> cases<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> before<00:02:42.700> we<00:02:42.790> go<00:02:42.910> any

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
a year in some cases so before we go any

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.820 
a year in some cases so before we go any
further<00:02:43.240> let's<00:02:43.840> go<00:02:44.050> ahead<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.380> make<00:02:44.500> one<00:02:44.530> of

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
further let's go ahead and make one of

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.949 
further let's go ahead and make one of
these<00:02:44.920> applicators<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.810> you'll

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
these applicators and for this you'll

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.940 
these applicators and for this you'll
need<00:02:47.050> an<00:02:47.170> old<00:02:47.320> t-shirt<00:02:49.709> take<00:02:50.709> your<00:02:50.860> old

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.520 
of shellac
and<00:04:44.490> then<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:44.940> quickly<00:04:45.210> followed<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> with<00:04:46.350> the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
and then I quickly followed it with the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.430 
and then I quickly followed it with the
applicator<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.700> make<00:04:47.910> sure<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:48.840> was<00:04:49.260> able

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
applicator to make sure that I was able

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.700 
applicator to make sure that I was able
to<00:04:49.590> blend<00:04:50.070> in<00:04:50.310> any<00:04:50.610> runs<00:04:51.060> our<00:04:51.389> high<00:04:51.990> spots<00:04:52.440> of

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
to blend in any runs our high spots of

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.110 
to blend in any runs our high spots of
the<00:04:53.070> shellac<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.490> that's<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.940> good<00:04:54.060> thing

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
the shellac and that's the good thing

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.780 
the shellac and that's the good thing
about<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.630> applicator<00:04:55.140> it<00:04:55.410> has<00:04:55.890> alcohol<00:04:56.610> and

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
about the applicator it has alcohol and

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.969 
about the applicator it has alcohol and
shellac<00:04:57.120> on<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.750> alcohol<00:04:58.290> is

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
shellac on it so the alcohol is

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.310 
shellac on it so the alcohol is
dissolving<00:04:59.610> any<00:05:00.060> of<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.510> high<00:05:00.660> spots<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.260> I

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
dissolving any of the high spots and I

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.140 
dissolving any of the high spots and I
continue<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.919> use<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.370> applicator<00:05:02.880> just

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
continue to use the applicator just

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.620 
continue to use the applicator just
blending<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.200> shellac<00:05:04.530> in<00:05:04.830> for<00:05:05.729> maybe<00:05:06.300> five

blending the shellac in for maybe five

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.350 
blending the shellac in for maybe five
minutes<00:05:06.770> till<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.860> feel<00:05:08.610> like<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.880> looks<00:05:09.120> good

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360
