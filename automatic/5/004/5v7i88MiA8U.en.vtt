00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.000
 the differences that I noticed is the story the story is another new the 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 spirit is the one that brings out mind the same as in the first part 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.550
 percent and then abc that the traps and natalia 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.509
 it's a difference 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.060
 per cent but they are pillar this light that she is verónica with which of the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.759
 kilo more this does not matter that it's the same I mean I have to totally 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.140
 convinced 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.690
 that people are going to leave with the same feeling that came out after seeing the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 first part the inner sensation is exactly the same 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.450
 and that we were more prepared those who have repented because we already knew what 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.760
 that we were doing or we had already faced musical 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.830
 before and makes connect with him the same choreographer you know then of 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.870
 Suddenly, we had been instructed in the first part and in this second 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.980
 We were like a little calmer nervous always but a little more 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.280
 quiet 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.410
 it's not me I think no no no cost nothing percent 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.830
 man elías the one that yes they played with a little advantage not in the sense 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.380
 who had already danced had already sung 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.690
 but she 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.590
 I have felt very well very well 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.840
 in productivity very well all phenomenal which also counts that ticket and the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.000
 the time 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.060
 comes from many years of a working relationship 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.760
 villa of week of the 16 500 million dollars and nobody has given nothing more 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.550
 what to lose 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.730
 secondary education 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.110
 in the goal 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.790
 with animal and although it was a group that is already if it did not enter new 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.590
 luxury stars we must now work for it but it is true that there is a 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.990
 environment per hundred of making a movie music and art 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.600
 quarry work was intermittent 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.990
 arbeloa and lass 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.410
 that is a little more serious I felt the sensation before us at least 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.130
 manny the ones that repeated the most 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.130
 they were not of people who entered new threats veiled Alice Ines and not me 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.030
 It was like the group was already pre-established that we all know each other and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.000
 that there 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.820
 there is good vibes there is fellowship there 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.840
 iy no it was not needed adapted to the people more than it came because from the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.840
 principle was integrated around the world 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.329
 and it's not worth it we've been with a team of amazing dancers 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.040
 this interest is so that some have come by today we are using shades of 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.969
 blue on Saturdays and Sundays we had to go to the mall 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:31.769
 this 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.679
 at that age there 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.169
 many hours 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.299
 and later 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.939
 is even rolling the film to astronomers we have had health 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.769
 but I can not is a word that does not exist in our vocabulary especially 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.540
 when they have trusted you to do something that they can not or not that is not 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.819
 I can yes I can, what happens is that you have to work 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.659
 do not have to sacrifice things that scare 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.540
 but everything with effort and with work in the end you get it so much because 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.779
 if there are people and more than one person 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.409
 that you have seen that you are going to do the idea is to do it well 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.040
 sometimes sometimes more your promise unit what of the only way that solves 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.849
 sexy 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.739
 therefore the batteries and working hard I think that the current situation there is 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.479
 all 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:19.119
 haiti qashqai and takes the reins agents to important that carries the 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.999
 reins 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.089
 that 's why I think that in this film the characters are more likely to be in 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.099
 another place 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.529
 i can only the freeways and 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.629
 of strangeness because it does not surpass 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.900
 but 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.900
 but I believe that normal life although still 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.919
 was so effectively agreement is the story 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.430
 Sara history leads now that women are 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.869
 those who take the reins of the situation 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:50.169
 like here that they are sung in the first part part in some way 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.849
 they were the ones who had the low the whip for us we come with the 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.079
 whip there alberto pointed the first part the girls are warriors 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.010
 and here I came directly with the weapons 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.909
 Roberto Maria Angels font of the fourth bird 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.290
 thank goodness there is an age I think there are others is not only a 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.969
 feeling so imposing like the first one because I think it's more romantic 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:13.179
 this movie 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:17.400
 me before when there was no electricity through girls and teenagers 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.849
 in it there will be tickets 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.419
 It was leaving with a good taste in the mouth but many things happen that people suffer 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.979
 much in this movie cheese towards that cause the laughter 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.159
 but it is a 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.059
 Adam movie that good 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:34.159
 you do not have your happy moments sad moments and above what yes 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.059
 that they will come out with the first part because it is right dylan owen spend 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:39.499
 millions of things 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:43.309
 but the environment the way to tell them the spirit of the movie I think that 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.139
 it's the same station saez 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.270
 it happens to me many times when I go to the cinema I go out and for half an hour or 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.819
 A) Yes 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.840
 it's time with another face 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.490
 and yet there are movies 7 you do not want to go home they encourage you to take yourself 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.689
 a little girl will speak 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:00.910
 this collective 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.479
 the movie cyclist is that way they know that effect is like the first 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.819
 because everything is about traca with that entity of humor and with a 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.020
 naturalness 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.379
 at 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.039
 that there is no sign stimulates drastic situations left totally the 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.819
 grammar no rafael díaz understands everything apart from that when they deliver us
