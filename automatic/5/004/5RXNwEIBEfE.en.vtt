our plants without any chemical

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.450 
our plants without any chemical
fertilizers<00:00:33.450> they're<00:00:34.170> grown<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.980> natural

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
fertilizers they're grown in a natural

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.690 
fertilizers they're grown in a natural
pH<00:00:35.730> balance<00:00:36.360> soil<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:37.559> makes<00:00:37.590> them<00:00:38.070> easier

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
pH balance soil which makes them easier

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.139 
pH balance soil which makes them easier
to<00:00:38.730> grow<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.870> roots<00:00:40.079> form<00:00:40.770> naturally<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to grow the roots form naturally and you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.299 
to grow the roots form naturally and you
get<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> more<00:00:42.660> natural<00:00:43.290> looking<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.100> would

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
get a more natural looking and I would

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.920 
get a more natural looking and I would
think<00:00:44.580> that<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.970> that<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> environment

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
think that in that in that environment

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.690 
think that in that in that environment
there<00:00:46.350> would<00:00:46.470> be<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.590> much<00:00:46.830> better<00:00:46.860> transplant

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
there would be a much better transplant

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.790 
there would be a much better transplant
into<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.630> people<00:00:48.900> that<00:00:48.930> are<00:00:49.110> purchasing<00:00:49.560> them

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
into the people that are purchasing them

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.530 
into the people that are purchasing them
chard<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.490> there's<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.240> bunch<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
chard because there's not a bunch of

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.330 
chard because there's not a bunch of
chemicals<00:00:51.930> forcing<00:00:52.650> them<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.950> that<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
chemicals forcing them up that is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.990 
chemicals forcing them up that is
correct

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
correct

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 
correct
yeah<00:00:54.150> they<00:00:54.300> don't<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.690> into<00:00:55.100> any<00:00:56.100> type<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.400> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
yeah they don't go into any type of a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.600 
yeah they don't go into any type of a
shock<00:00:56.910> situation<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.220> they<00:00:59.220> just<00:00:59.400> look

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
shock situation and they just look

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.580 
shock situation and they just look
healthier<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.690> roots<00:01:00.900> seem<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.410> go

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
healthier and the roots seem to go

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.650 
healthier and the roots seem to go
deeper<00:01:02.160> into<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> ground<00:01:02.910> without<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:03.540> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
deeper into the ground without and it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899 
deeper into the ground without and it
makes<00:01:03.870> perfect<00:01:04.290> sense<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:05.040> awesome<00:01:05.399> now

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
makes perfect sense that was awesome now

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.819 
makes perfect sense that was awesome now
when<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.420> were<00:01:06.509> talking<00:01:06.840> earlier<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.649> you
