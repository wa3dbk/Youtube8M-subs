00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
on so I know that for an 8 channel

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.670 
on so I know that for an 8 channel
receiver<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:38.030> 7<00:02:38.420> channel<00:02:38.750> receiver<00:02:39.020> you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
receiver and a 7 channel receiver you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.770 
receiver and a 7 channel receiver you
have<00:02:39.890> aux<00:02:40.220> 1<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.790> aux<00:02:41.090> -<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:43.420> what<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.540> want<00:02:44.720> to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
have aux 1 and aux - so what you want to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.060 
have aux 1 and aux - so what you want to
do<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.200> want<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.500> go<00:02:46.360> into<00:02:47.360> like<00:02:48.050> aux<00:02:48.470> 2<00:02:48.800> and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
do you want to go into like aux 2 and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:57.370 
do you want to go into like aux 2 and
set<00:02:49.790> aux<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.840> left<00:02:55.840> elevator<00:02:56.840> like

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
set aux to as the left elevator like

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.250 
set aux to as the left elevator like
this<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:59.080> then<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.290> can<00:03:00.560> just<00:03:01.660> put<00:03:02.660> aux<00:03:02.930> for

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
this and then you can just put aux for

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.210 
this and then you can just put aux for
as<00:03:03.610> inhibits<00:03:04.610> because<00:03:05.510> if<00:03:06.110> you're<00:03:06.410> using<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.890> 7

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
as inhibits because if you're using a 7

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.220 
as inhibits because if you're using a 7
channel<00:03:07.550> receiver<00:03:07.850> or<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.240> channel<00:03:08.870> receiver

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
channel receiver or a channel receiver

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.690 
channel receiver or a channel receiver
you<00:03:10.100> will<00:03:10.250> have<00:03:10.430> only<00:03:10.760> ops<00:03:11.630> 2<00:03:12.080> on<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.770> 7

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
you will have only ops 2 on the 7

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.220 
you will have only ops 2 on the 7
channel<00:03:13.940> receiver<00:03:14.180> than<00:03:14.480> aux<00:03:14.720> tree<00:03:14.930> on<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
channel receiver than aux tree on the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.480 
channel receiver than aux tree on the
eighth<00:03:15.380> one<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.370> need<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.730> move<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:19.100> left

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
eighth one so you need to move the left

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.690 
eighth one so you need to move the left
elevator<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:21.380> another<00:03:21.890> channel<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.580> you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
elevator to another channel that you

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.970 
elevator to another channel that you
know<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:22.940> have<00:03:23.300> because<00:03:23.780> if<00:03:24.260> you're<00:03:24.560> setting

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
know you have because if you're setting

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.110 
know you have because if you're setting
dual<00:03:25.250> elevator<00:03:26.030> or<00:03:27.100> 7<00:03:28.100> channel<00:03:28.490> receiver<00:03:28.760> you

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
dual elevator or 7 channel receiver you

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.760 
dual elevator or 7 channel receiver you
won't<00:03:29.420> get<00:03:29.690> one<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.530> them<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.890> work<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:31.610> and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
won't get one of them to work so and

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.300 
won't get one of them to work so and
when<00:03:33.770> you<00:03:33.800> done<00:03:34.100> with<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:36.350> just<00:03:36.380> go<00:03:37.130> into

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
when you done with this you just go into

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.040 
when you done with this you just go into
the<00:03:37.550> same<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.650> setup<00:03:40.459> menu<00:03:40.550> or<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.450> function

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
the one of the elevator goes down and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.250 
the one of the elevator goes down and
the<00:03:58.730> other<00:03:58.880> one<00:03:59.090> goes<00:03:59.300> up<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.690> can<00:03:59.870> reverse

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
the other one goes up you can reverse

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.630 
the other one goes up you can reverse
them<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:01.459> see<00:04:01.730> here<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.540> have<00:04:03.430> right<00:04:04.430> a

wrong right elevator and you have left

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.280 
wrong right elevator and you have left
aileron<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:09.080> left<00:04:10.010> elevator<00:04:10.520> so<00:04:11.000> no<00:04:11.810> problem

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
aileron and left elevator so no problem

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.949 
aileron and left elevator so no problem
oh<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:13.100> hope<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.209> learned<00:04:14.390> something<00:04:14.630> about
