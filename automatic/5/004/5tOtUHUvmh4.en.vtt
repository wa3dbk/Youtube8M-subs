back<00:01:08.090> into<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.600> ponytail<00:01:08.840> because<00:01:09.440> it's<00:01:09.710> so

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
back into a ponytail because it's so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.800 
back into a ponytail because it's so
short<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.400> I<00:01:10.610> just<00:01:10.790> put<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.060> satin<00:01:11.240> ramp<00:01:11.600> on

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
short and I just put the satin ramp on

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.750 
short and I just put the satin ramp on
top<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.440> because<00:01:13.190> that's<00:01:13.370> what<00:01:13.580> works

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
top of it because that's what works

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.760 
top of it because that's what works
better<00:01:13.970> some<00:01:14.300> people<00:01:14.600> actually<00:01:14.870> part<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:15.620> and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
better some people actually part it and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.100 
better some people actually part it and
do<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.980> whole<00:01:16.100> wraparound<00:01:16.520> thing<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:17.960> I'm

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
do the whole wraparound thing but I'm

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.510 
do the whole wraparound thing but I'm
not<00:01:18.229> going<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.470> do<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.649> because<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.310> hair

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
not going to do that because this hair

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.310 
not going to do that because this hair
is<00:01:19.670> almost<00:01:20.360> a<00:01:20.780> little<00:01:20.899> too<00:01:21.020> short<00:01:21.320> for<00:01:21.439> that<00:01:21.670> so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
is almost a little too short for that so

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.660 
is almost a little too short for that so
the<00:01:24.320> wrapping<00:01:24.740> with<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:24.979> satin<00:01:25.250> wrap<00:01:25.369> is<00:01:25.549> what

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
the wrapping with the satin wrap is what

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.920 
the wrapping with the satin wrap is what
i'm<00:01:25.759> going<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.939> do<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:26.299> that's<00:01:26.390> usually<00:01:26.630> what

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
i'm going to do and that's usually what

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.700 
i'm going to do and that's usually what
works<00:01:27.110> for<00:01:27.350> me<00:01:27.579> also<00:01:28.579> i<00:01:28.610> use<00:01:29.030> this<00:01:29.360> comb<00:01:29.899> why

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.490 
works for me also i use this comb why
two<00:01:30.770> combs<00:01:31.310> instead<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.540> little<00:01:32.810> fine<00:01:33.079> too

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500

actually put that in my weave in and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.210 
actually put that in my weave in and
actually<00:02:48.020> work<00:02:48.350> really<00:02:48.410> well<00:02:48.680> because<00:02:48.950> i<00:02:49.069> had

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
actually work really well because i had

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.400 
actually work really well because i had
this<00:02:49.370> weave<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.850> always<00:02:50.330> tangled<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.319> it

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
this weave that always tangled and it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.570 
this weave that always tangled and it
was<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.650> irritating<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:53.390> put<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.580> Dove

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
was so irritating and I put the Dove

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.040 
was so irritating and I put the Dove
moisturizer<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.480> helped<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.870> lot<00:02:56.989> with

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
moisturizer and it helped a lot with

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.110 
moisturizer and it helped a lot with
those<00:02:57.350> tangles<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.100> had<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.730> grew<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.910> good

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
those tangles and had a grew a good

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.240 
those tangles and had a grew a good
effect<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.510> was<00:02:59.630> really<00:02:59.810> happy<00:02:59.989> with<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:02.200> also

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
effect I was really happy with it also

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.120 
effect I was really happy with it also
when<00:03:04.250> you're<00:03:04.370> drying<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.810> pat<00:03:06.440> dry<00:03:06.620> towel

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
when you're drying it just pat dry towel

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.580 
when you're drying it just pat dry towel
dry<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.519> hair<00:03:08.060> if<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:08.959> want<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.200> use<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.320> blow

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
dry the hair if you want to use a blow

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.160 
dry the hair if you want to use a blow
dryer<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:10.190> can<00:03:10.220> do<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.540> make<00:03:11.870> sure<00:03:11.900> you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
dryer you can do that but make sure you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.640 
dryer you can do that but make sure you
use<00:03:12.350> like<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.830> diffusion<00:03:13.790> blow<00:03:14.000> dryer<00:03:14.269> or<00:03:14.650> you

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
use like the diffusion blow dryer or you

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.380 
use like the diffusion blow dryer or you
can<00:03:15.860> just<00:03:16.040> use<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.430> one<00:03:16.580> with<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.790> comb<00:03:17.120> so

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
can just use the one with the comb so

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.330 
can just use the one with the comb so
that<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.780> heat<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:18.440> not<00:03:18.709> necessarily

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
that the heat is not necessarily

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.460 
that the heat is not necessarily
directly<00:03:19.940> on<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.390> hair<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.170> it's<00:03:21.290> more

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
directly on the hair and it's more

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.570 
directly on the hair and it's more
distributed<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.400> way<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:23.530> because<00:03:24.530> T<00:03:25.340> is

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
distributed that way and because T is

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.490 
distributed that way and because T is
really<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.690> don't<00:03:26.840> want<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.019> use<00:03:27.170> too<00:03:27.380> much

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
really you don't want to use too much

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.780 
really you don't want to use too much
heat<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.950> like<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.220> wouldn't<00:03:31.400> want<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.640> put

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
heat just like you wouldn't want to put

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.770 
heat just like you wouldn't want to put
excess<00:03:32.269> heat<00:03:32.420> on<00:03:32.630> your<00:03:32.780> own<00:03:32.989> hair<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.780> it's

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
excess heat on your own hair so it's

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.860 
excess heat on your own hair so it's
been<00:03:36.019> almost<00:03:36.769> about<00:03:37.459> it's<00:03:38.450> been<00:03:38.600> three<00:03:38.840> weeks

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
been almost about it's been three weeks

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.789 
been almost about it's been three weeks
I<00:03:39.170> think<00:03:39.410> since<00:03:40.130> I've<00:03:40.340> had<00:03:40.549> this<00:03:40.700> in<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.799> I'll

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
I think since I've had this in and I'll

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.199 
I think since I've had this in and I'll
probably<00:03:42.980> will<00:03:43.220> leave<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.519> in<00:03:43.640> for<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:44.030> little

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
probably will leave it in for a little

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.400 
probably will leave it in for a little
longer<00:03:44.450> because<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:46.340> still<00:03:46.610> looks<00:03:46.760> great<00:03:47.410> if

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
longer because it still looks great if

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.949 
longer because it still looks great if
you<00:03:48.560> have<00:03:48.709> any<00:03:48.920> questions<00:03:49.760> or<00:03:50.180> comments<00:03:50.480> or
