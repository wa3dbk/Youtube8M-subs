00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.030
 greetings chameleon friends here and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 video today I come here with some 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.550
 news about the pokémon world that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.920
 rolled this week but this week 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.279
 we did not have any great news we had 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.800
 some very interesting and mysterious 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.779
 as usual it's better to know 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 before bedtime 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.800
 You can not sleep without knowing that it was 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 revealed the date of the next 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.290
 saga of pokémon in the anime she starts day 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 October 17 and continues to be the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.460
 protagonist of the series 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.129
 besides the change of clothes we can perceive 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.350
 Yes, and he's still the same. 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 sixteen years have passed and it seems 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.789
 he refuses to grow 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.010
 still talking about anime you can not 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.989
 to sleep without knowing that some rest 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.750
 The next episodes in Japan were 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.199
 revealed, including the episode in which 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.360
 bride and will appear now talking about 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.670
 We have not had a few pips of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.740
 news but you can not sleep without 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.710
 know that this week we had an event 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.170
 where some people played xy pokémon 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 for the first time but it was something else 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.549
 limited only by showing some 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.520
 initial 11 battles between some others 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.990
 pokémons in this image we can see 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.869
 some of the battles that were 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 made highlighting charizard 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 and Olavo speaking at the xará age there is a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.670
 rumor that possibly in certain 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.610
 background of the game someone will give us a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.250
 field may explain why 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.960
 age sharing has been showing up 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.229
 often this is true as 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.149
 would you like to have 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.689
 You can not sleep without knowing that you are. 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.759
 week a rumor at least curious came up 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.909
 it seems that two more special versions 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.250
 of the 3 10 are coming out of the oven 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.320
 it would seem that this would be 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.430
 in celebration of the launch of pokémon 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.849
 x and y in their covers would be exhérnias 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.390
 and here comes the colors blue and red in 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.220
 some forums some people 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.010
 are commenting that this would be part of 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.160
 a combo between 3ds and the game itself 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.370
 pokémon type y but not yet known 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.440
 if this is true then it's just rumors 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.020
 You can not sleep without knowing that you are not. 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.600
 Official twitter of mysterious pokémon 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.390
 x and y pokémon ad is being 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.780
 engraved by Lord jhony tithe gives 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.250
 exactly but what will be new pokémons 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.440
 stay connected 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.840
 now speaking of the manga it seems that a 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.900
 new stage will start there 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.970
 at least that is what this image indicates 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.010
 now that the pokémon black white manga 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.050
 Wind and was finalized 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.380
 it seems that we will have a new saga visa 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.420
 exactly in it we will have the protagonists 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.640
 of black in haiti two possibly 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.760
 will only be one volume until the launch 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.920
 of Pokémon Xingu and you can not sleep 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.110
 unaware that this weekend fans 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.450

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.519

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.620
