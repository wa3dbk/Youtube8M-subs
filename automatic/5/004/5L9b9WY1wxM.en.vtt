00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello everyone thanks for being here and 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.879
 we continue with root exercises 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.440
 square fixes on the screen we have 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.179
 than calculate the numerical value of the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.300
 square root formed by minus 2 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.610
 raised to 5 multiplied in turn x 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 minus 2 raised to the power minus 1 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.560
 for that we have to apply certain 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.240
 properties of empowerment I hope 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.449
 that is didactic to all 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.029
 we started the first thing that we will have to 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.269
 perform will be the multiplication of two 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.669
 Powers that have the same base below 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.040
 I have written the property of the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.630
 empowerment that is right for 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.879
 to be able to solve this multiplication 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 notice that to solve this 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.850
 multiplication will only have to add the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.899
 exponents of the two bases in this case 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.270
 m will correspond to the power 5 and the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.739
 power minus 1 and we will also have to 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.170
 take into account all the signs 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.760
 positive and negative of the exponents 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.879
 let's do it for our 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.270
 exercise therefore minus 2 raised to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.390
 power 5 x minus 2 raised to the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.930
 power minus 1 will be the same as 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.870
 two 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.730
 ^ 5 + minus 1 at least 1 we will locate it 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.010
 in parentheses for below 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.740
 apply the law of the signs of adding and 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.710
 subtract in the exponent therefore 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.850
 finally the final result will be less 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.740
 2 raised to 4 once obtained this 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.830
 result we can transform our 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.420
 square root in the following expression 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.660
 arithmetic that is square root minus 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.119
 2 raised to 4 then the only thing 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.640
 what we will have to do is solve the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.670
 power of a negative number raised to 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.920
 a couple power remember guys that a 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.070
 negative number raised to a power 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.410
 pair always results in a number 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.920
 positive therefore minus 2 raised to 4 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.259
 we already know initially that it's going to be a 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.710
 positive number and the definition of 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.140
 power tells us clearly that the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.550
 power is calculated by multiplying so many 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.369
 times the base as indicated by its 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.510
 exponent therefore it will be 2 x 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.620
 by 2 and by 2 if we calculate this 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.200
 multiplication we will get more 16 like this 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.909
 that the value or numerical expression of the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.239
 square root that we must calculate 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:30.489
 will be the square root of plus 16 16 is a 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.010
 perfect square so we will get 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.900
 two results one positive and another 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.450
 negative remember that we wrote it 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.209
 as indicated below in the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.910
 screen a positive sign on top of a 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.290
 negative sign and the final result in 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.569
 this case will be plus minus 4 until here has 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.010
 been everything this time we have seen 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.989
 besides the property of the establishment 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.180
 some properties of empowerment 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.819
 In this way we have reviewed some of 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.010
 these properties I have clear that I am going to 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.870
 continue doing exercises 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.209
 empowerment but place them in the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.150
 Exercise section in a list of 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.180
 reproduction that I have on my channel that 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.980
 it's basically exercises without content 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.409
 theory 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.409
 I hope to see you soon greetings
