00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.070
 very well 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.020
 hello that such friends as they are in this 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.330
 I bring you an application 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.520
 unintentionally call that will allow us 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.520
 change the name of the kernel and the banner 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.650
 at our whim, the one who runs in the 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.300
 where it says ipad iphone or ipod and the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.329
 banner in the part where the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.829
 now we open the application and we have a 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.590
 white box that is to insert the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.329
 text and in the top right e 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.390
 left we will find the option of 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.480
 that river and banner can see that 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.530
 I have written 2 mb in which I and what 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.170
 what they have to do is simply 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.630
 write what they want in my case 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 I will write 8 delete me sil but as it is 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.440
 for the banner they have to leave a 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.240
 space before writing something if not 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.400
 leave this space the word will not be seen 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.260
 well then once we have 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.940
 selected what we are going to put you 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.909
 we give in sell and automatically 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.070
 change the time by the text in the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.939
 Carriel's case will only allow us 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.170
 place seven letters i will write tokyo 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.930
 to give you a better design they can 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.460
 rely on the use of emoticons to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.009
 this can download from the app store the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.060
 moggi free application and once 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.119
 installed we will go to settings 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.270
 international keyboards add a new 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.979
 keyboard and we choose emoji and ready now 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.950
 will have the option to add emoticons 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.899
 inside your normal keyboard and good for 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.289
 install this application we 're going to go 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.869
 to Syria later on sources and we get 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.189
 in the beatbox repository there 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.500
 we look in the letters 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.480
 chen we already give tap 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.850
 and then we select the option of 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.160
 install to me I appear to modify 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.870
 because I already have it and after about 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.690
 seconds will be installed this 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.880
 application 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.560
 the truth is that this app is very good 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.540
 since we can improve the design of 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.030
 device adding any word 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.550
 with the help of the emoticons so that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.260
 do not look so simple I hope they work 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.430
 just like me thank you very much 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.430
 we see goodbye
