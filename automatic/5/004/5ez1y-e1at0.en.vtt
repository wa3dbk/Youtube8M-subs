okay<00:00:11.790> welcome<00:00:12.059> back<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.809> started<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
okay welcome back so I started to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.650 
okay welcome back so I started to
install<00:00:14.340> some<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.969> tortoise<00:00:15.269> machines

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
install some of the tortoise machines

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.200 
install some of the tortoise machines
and<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:17.039> thinking<00:00:17.369> about<00:00:17.490> how<00:00:17.880> I'm<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and I'm thinking about how I'm going to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.230 
and I'm thinking about how I'm going to
be<00:00:18.300> whirring<00:00:18.779> these<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.250> let's<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.090> take

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
be whirring these up so let's just take

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.519 
be whirring these up so let's just take
a<00:00:21.300> closer<00:00:21.630> look<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:21.990> how<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> do

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a closer look at how I'm going to do

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.630 
a closer look at how I'm going to do
that<00:00:24.260> okay<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.320> around<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> back<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
that okay so around the back of the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.599 
that okay so around the back of the
machine<00:00:26.970> now<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:28.859> tortoise<00:00:29.250> machine

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
machine now and the tortoise machine

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.510 
machine now and the tortoise machine
actually<00:00:29.910> has<00:00:30.090> eight<00:00:30.859> contacts<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
actually has eight contacts here at the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.069 
actually has eight contacts here at the
top<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> two<00:00:33.090> outside<00:00:33.450> ones<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
top the two outside ones are for the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
top the two outside ones are for the
power<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:35.100> there<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> one

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
power and then there are three for a one

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.119 
power and then there are three for a one
internal<00:00:36.960> switch<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.469> three<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:37.890> another

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
internal switch and three for another

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.500 
internal switch and three for another
internal<00:00:38.460> switch<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:41.120> what<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> do

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
internal switch so what I'm going to do

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.040 
internal switch so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:42.719> try<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.500> wire<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.160> all<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.850> contacts<00:00:45.750> all

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
is try and wire up all the contacts all

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.080 
is try and wire up all the contacts all
eight<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> them<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.129> only<00:00:47.460> really<00:00:47.789> need<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
eight of them so I only really need the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.299 
eight of them so I only really need the
two<00:00:48.239> outside<00:00:48.660> ones<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> point<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.100> time

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
two outside ones for this point in time

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.430 
two outside ones for this point in time
but<00:00:50.670> later<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.510> decide<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
but later on if I decide to use to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.110 
but later on if I decide to use to
internal<00:00:52.890> switches<00:00:53.280> they'll<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.090> ready<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> go

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
internal switches they'll be ready to go

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.020 
internal switches they'll be ready to go
so<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.149> found<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.510> cable<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:59.030> cat5

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so I found this cable this is a cat5

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.110 
so I found this cable this is a cat5
data<00:01:00.480> cable<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:01.550> eight<00:01:02.550> strands

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
data cable and there are eight strands

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.660 
data cable and there are eight strands
of<00:01:03.239> wire<00:01:04.430> which<00:01:05.430> works<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.970> perfectly<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
of wire which works out perfectly and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.600 
of wire which works out perfectly and
also<00:01:08.670> got<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.060> barrier<00:01:09.750> strip<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> I'll<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.520> just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
also got a barrier strip so I'll be just

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.990 
also got a barrier strip so I'll be just
be<00:01:11.820> mounting<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.659> somewhere<00:01:14.000> taking

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
be mounting that there somewhere taking

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.770 
be mounting that there somewhere taking
this<00:01:15.240> wire<00:01:15.540> stripping<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.350> off<00:01:17.030> soldering<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
this wire stripping it off soldering the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
this wire stripping it off soldering the
eight<00:01:18.900> contacts<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.369> running

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
eight contacts to there and then running

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.749 
eight contacts to there and then running
the<00:01:20.820> wire<00:01:21.000> down<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.310> running<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the wire down and running it out to the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.550 
the wire down and running it out to the
eight<00:01:23.880> points<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.240> after<00:01:27.570> offers<00:01:28.140> white<00:01:28.350> up

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
eight points so so after offers white up

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.109 
eight points so so after offers white up
it's<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> simple<00:01:29.430> matter<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it's going to be a simple matter now of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
it's going to be a simple matter now of
just<00:01:30.150> running<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:30.990> power<00:01:31.229> cables<00:01:31.650> on

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
just running in the two power cables on

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
just running in the two power cables on
the<00:01:31.829> outside<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.479> later<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.140> need

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the outside and then later on if I need

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
the outside and then later on if I need
to<00:01:34.470> use<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> switches<00:01:35.150> it<00:01:36.150> should<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
to use the switches it should be a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.700 
to use the switches it should be a
pretty<00:01:36.689> easy<00:01:36.900> thing<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> do

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.210 

okay<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.360> going<00:01:42.360> ahead<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.990> soldered<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
okay so going ahead and soldered the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.980 
okay so going ahead and soldered the
eight<00:01:44.430> wires<00:01:44.700> onto<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.259> contact<00:01:47.040> pad<00:01:47.250> here

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
eight wires onto the contact pad here

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.289 
eight wires onto the contact pad here
run<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> down<00:01:49.290> strip<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> wires<00:01:50.119> put<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.210> in

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
run it down strip the wires put them in

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.020 
run it down strip the wires put them in
there<00:01:51.979> I've<00:01:52.979> got<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.340> sticky<00:01:53.670> tape<00:01:53.700> just

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
there I've got some sticky tape just

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.520 
there I've got some sticky tape just
holding<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.869> moment<00:01:55.020> onto<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
holding it for the moment onto the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.499 
holding it for the moment onto the
machine<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.130> Oh<00:01:56.159> better<00:01:56.880> think<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.210> some<00:01:57.360> way

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
machine here Oh better think of some way

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.149 
machine here Oh better think of some way
better<00:01:57.780> way<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> doing<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.710> sure<00:01:58.950> yet

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
better way of doing that not sure yet

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459 
better way of doing that not sure yet
how<00:01:59.460> old<00:01:59.670> maybe<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.780> clip<00:02:01.049> or<00:02:01.200> something

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
how old maybe a little clip or something

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.020 
how old maybe a little clip or something
that<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.770> put<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:04.040> it's<00:02:05.040> taken<00:02:05.520> me

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that I can put on there so it's taken me

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.719 
that I can put on there so it's taken me
probably<00:02:06.390> 20<00:02:07.140> minutes<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.829> I'm

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
probably 20 minutes to do this I'm

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.240 
probably 20 minutes to do this I'm
thinking<00:02:09.599> about<00:02:09.840> maybe<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.619> won't<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.009> all

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
thinking about maybe I won't do it all

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.900 
thinking about maybe I won't do it all
the<00:02:11.340> machines<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.760> might<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.660> try

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
the machines I might just just try

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.060 
the machines I might just just try
I would<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.180> want<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.450> see<00:02:13.570> how<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.810> works

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
I would this want to see how it works

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.260 
I would this want to see how it works
I'm<00:02:15.070> going<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.340> get<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.460> battery<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.180> we're

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
I'm going to get a battery now and we're

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.520 
I'm going to get a battery now and we're
just<00:02:16.330> going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.600> give<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:16.840> thing<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:17.110> test<00:02:17.320> run

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
just going to give this thing a test run

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.070 
just going to give this thing a test run
see<00:02:17.740> if<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.920> works

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
see if it works

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.290 
see if it works
all<00:02:20.080> right<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.320> got<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.590> 7.2<00:02:21.580> volt<00:02:21.880> battery

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
all right so I got this 7.2 volt battery

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.930 
all right so I got this 7.2 volt battery
it's<00:02:22.510> not<00:02:22.720> quite<00:02:23.310> 12<00:02:24.310> volts<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.880> will

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
it's not quite 12 volts but it will

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.390 
it's not quite 12 volts but it will
still<00:02:25.210> be<00:02:25.240> enough<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.720> drive<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.590> tourist

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
still be enough to drive the tourist

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.350 
still be enough to drive the tourist
machine<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:29.550> I'm<00:02:30.550> hoping<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.970> don't<00:02:31.030> interfere

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
machine and I'm hoping I don't interfere

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.000 
machine and I'm hoping I don't interfere
with<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.690> shotty<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.200> all<00:02:32.320> Thrones<00:02:32.710> were<00:02:35.010> so

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
with the shotty of all Thrones were so

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.830 
with the shotty of all Thrones were so
if<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.340> kicked<00:02:36.940> off<00:02:37.500> why<00:02:39.480> got<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.600> run<00:02:40.750> away

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
if I just kicked off why got it run away

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.860 
if I just kicked off why got it run away
so<00:02:41.350> we<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:41.620> connect<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.160> Y's<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.640> top

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.600 

now<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.930> can<00:02:47.140> hear<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.410> moving<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.870> all<00:02:49.990> works

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
now you can hear it moving it all works

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.100 
now you can hear it moving it all works
I<00:02:52.410> think<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.830> great<00:02:54.070> way<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.690> neaten<00:02:56.020> up

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
I think it's a great way to to neaten up

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.040 
I think it's a great way to to neaten up
your<00:02:56.290> wiring<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.710> little<00:02:56.890> bit<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:59.020> a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
your wiring a little bit and just have a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.330 
your wiring a little bit and just have a
little<00:02:59.230> bit<00:02:59.350> hem<00:02:59.530> neater<00:02:59.770> and<00:02:59.890> more

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
little bit hem neater and more

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.400 
little bit hem neater and more
accessible<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:00.970> like<00:03:01.480> later<00:03:01.720> on<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.050> do<00:03:02.110> need

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
accessible so like later on if I do need

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.080 
accessible so like later on if I do need
to<00:03:02.560> use<00:03:02.770> those<00:03:02.920> switches<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.520> makes<00:03:03.790> life<00:03:04.060> a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
to use those switches this makes life a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.710 
to use those switches this makes life a
lot<00:03:04.270> easier<00:03:06.000> okay<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.060> that's<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.510> end<00:03:07.630> of

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
lot easier okay so that's the end of

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.570 
lot easier okay so that's the end of
this<00:03:07.840> video<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.560> was<00:03:09.070> just<00:03:09.250> going<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.550> a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
this video it was just going to be a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.400 
this video it was just going to be a
quick<00:03:09.850> video<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.210> how<00:03:10.450> wiring<00:03:11.260> up<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
quick video on how wiring up the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.840 
quick video on how wiring up the
tortoises<00:03:12.750> only<00:03:13.750> got<00:03:13.870> around<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.170> doing<00:03:14.200> one

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
tortoises only got around to doing one

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.400 
tortoises only got around to doing one
I'll<00:03:15.850> probably<00:03:16.330> do<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> rest<00:03:16.870> I'm<00:03:17.080> not<00:03:17.230> sure

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
I'll probably do the rest I'm not sure

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.260 
I'll probably do the rest I'm not sure
yet<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.800> steamed<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.459> get<00:03:18.580> I<00:03:18.730> need<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.000> get<00:03:19.090> some

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
yet I steamed to get I need to get some

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.840 
yet I steamed to get I need to get some
more<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.540> these<00:03:19.630> barrier<00:03:20.050> strips<00:03:20.320> and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
more of these barrier strips and

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.120 
more of these barrier strips and
probably<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.880> little<00:03:21.940> bit<00:03:22.120> more<00:03:22.300> of<00:03:22.390> this<00:03:22.450> wire

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
probably a little bit more of this wire

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.430 
probably a little bit more of this wire
you<00:03:24.130> there<00:03:24.940> are<00:03:25.090> some<00:03:25.330> advantages<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:25.990> see<00:03:26.230> some

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
you there are some advantages I see some

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.050 
you there are some advantages I see some
great<00:03:26.650> advantage<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.130> doing<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.520> way<00:03:27.850> it's

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
great advantage of doing this way it's

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.400 
great advantage of doing this way it's
going<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.240> save<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.570> lot<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.780> effort<00:03:29.050> later

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
going to save you a lot of effort later

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.560 
going to save you a lot of effort later
on<00:03:29.680> if<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.430> needed<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.850> use<00:03:31.030> those<00:03:31.270> internal

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
on if you needed to use those internal

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.130 
on if you needed to use those internal
switches<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.550> great<00:03:33.790> way<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.140> wiring

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
switches so it's a great way of wiring

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.930 
switches so it's a great way of wiring
up<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.500> little<00:03:35.650> bit<00:03:35.800> more<00:03:35.980> neater<00:03:36.280> than<00:03:36.400> usual

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
up a little bit more neater than usual

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.350 
up a little bit more neater than usual
so<00:03:37.209> yeah<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.690> worked<00:03:37.900> out<00:03:38.080> okay
