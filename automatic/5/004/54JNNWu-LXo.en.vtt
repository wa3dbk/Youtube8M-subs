00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.880
 this sector is tips and tricks that is about increasing the quality of life 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.259
 of signature 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.239
 the using it 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.369
 of the correct line thickness that increases the legibility of your drawing in venlo 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.019
 do not use line thickness and a sign is not placed, you use too much 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.559
 line thickness so a drawing not legible use the cows line thickness then you can 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:27.509
 precisely emphasize those parts that are important in the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.989
 arable farming and that makes the drawing readable by a client a 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.640
 better understand the drawing 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.740
 the conditions for using the correct line thickness 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.140
 who set the stock market preferences with the tab with days 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.000
 the I find your season in with line thickness spread and at what depth 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.920
 what is set well I'm going to show what happens if you don't have line thickness 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.230
 used 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.640
 what does this drawing done everything is drawn in the thickness of zero comma 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.640
 zero stand he sat and so you see 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.270
 that no line thickness is known except for a drum computer line that of this one 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.190
 but I can't show which parts are more important than the others 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.180
 see drawing is way too flat in this way 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.360
 do you go line thickness as usual but it is wrong 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.400
 so we can get this result 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.580
 here the emphasis is on those parts in the drawing 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.190
 where the hellmuth accent on or to lay they are windows thick marks the layout 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.390
 to leave thieves from the most important part 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.990
 so then that you get the accent wrong 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.670
 the choice lord I have used appears but this drawing company did not read 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 which makes it even stronger 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.190
 for such a terrible unreadable 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.690
 well to do it right kyodo the good line i use what i do myself 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.660
 wants to come out solid for the outside world 25 this is in it 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.910
 sketch design phase 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.580
 and look to be a cow 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.830
 that also looks two hours 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.340
 You have to subdivide the fact yourself in two subdivisions 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.170
 material 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.570
 I think I also have a limitation 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.670
 a number of small windowsills or from outside sills the technique to zero 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.260
 comma zero 3 so you still have 25 only 13 and zero comma zero 3 in one 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.349
 drawing together that are roughly 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.349
 the three different line thickness that I use 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:23.199
 ap so you can also see the difference between being the desk 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.190
 and the device 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.649
 the interior is also nice to find what took place at the last place 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.739
 and I also drew it on zero comma zero multi the forests draw very much 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.089
 quiet design where you can put the accent on those things in beijing that of 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.939
 interest 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.510
 see it as a kind of construction method you are not going one first either 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.029
 put table week in front of a bank to be them or a building around it 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:45.839
 to build 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.600
 for example, the first is the building 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.859
 and then take place in the direction 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.109
 that is a choice I always use online 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:59.469
 to indicate the importance of my buildings and link them there 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:00.829
 then the correct line thickness
