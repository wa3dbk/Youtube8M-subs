hemp then you might be interested in
using<00:00:09.440> it<00:00:09.620> with<00:00:09.740> PVA<00:00:10.129> I've<00:00:10.730> got<00:00:11.030> a<00:00:11.059> nice<00:00:11.240> little

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
using it with PVA I've got a nice little

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.530 
using it with PVA I've got a nice little
trick<00:00:11.720> for<00:00:11.900> you<00:00:12.050> here<00:00:13.240> to<00:00:14.240> make<00:00:14.590> to<00:00:15.590> use<00:00:16.540> hemp

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
trick for you here to make to use hemp

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.990 
trick for you here to make to use hemp
in<00:00:17.720> PVA<00:00:18.230> what<00:00:18.800> I<00:00:18.830> do<00:00:18.980> here<00:00:19.400> is<00:00:19.490> just<00:00:19.640> get<00:00:19.730> a<00:00:19.789> bait

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
in PVA what I do here is just get a bait

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.320 
in PVA what I do here is just get a bait
lid<00:00:20.240> a<00:00:20.480> little<00:00:21.109> bit<00:00:21.410> of<00:00:21.470> hemp<00:00:21.619> on<00:00:21.830> top

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
lid a little bit of hemp on top

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.790 
lid a little bit of hemp on top
obviously<00:00:23.330> you<00:00:23.449> can<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:24.170> can<00:00:24.320> do<00:00:24.439> more<00:00:24.619> if<00:00:24.710> you

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
obviously you can you can do more if you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.689 
obviously you can you can do more if you
want<00:00:25.010> to<00:00:25.220> just<00:00:25.820> dry<00:00:26.119> off<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:27.310> get<00:00:28.310> rid<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:28.519> that

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
want to just dry off and get rid of that

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.460 
want to just dry off and get rid of that
excess<00:00:29.119> water<00:00:29.390> obviously<00:00:29.660> there's<00:00:30.050> holes<00:00:30.260> in

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
excess water obviously there's holes in

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.720 
excess water obviously there's holes in
the<00:00:30.560> top<00:00:30.769> it's<00:00:30.980> not<00:00:31.099> going<00:00:31.250> to<00:00:31.310> get<00:00:31.430> rid<00:00:31.550> of<00:00:31.609> it

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
the top it's not going to get rid of it

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.920 
the top it's not going to get rid of it
all<00:00:31.880> but<00:00:32.000> it'll<00:00:32.180> get<00:00:32.330> rid<00:00:32.449> of<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.660> majority

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
all but it'll get rid of the majority

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.030 
all but it'll get rid of the majority
and<00:00:33.230> that's<00:00:33.350> all<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:33.620> need

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
and that's all you need

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.220 
and that's all you need
once<00:00:34.489> you've<00:00:34.640> dried<00:00:34.879> it<00:00:35.059> off<00:00:35.150> tip<00:00:35.780> it<00:00:35.899> into<00:00:36.170> a

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
once you've dried it off tip it into a

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.100 
once you've dried it off tip it into a
bait<00:00:36.410> tub<00:00:36.700> or<00:00:37.700> another<00:00:38.030> or<00:00:38.360> on<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.570> bucket<00:00:39.050> or

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
bait tub or another or on a bucket or

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.150 
bait tub or another or on a bucket or
some<00:00:39.590> description<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:42.710> then<00:00:42.800> what<00:00:42.980> you<00:00:43.070> need

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
some description and then what you need

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.150 
some description and then what you need
to<00:00:43.309> do<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.730> if<00:00:44.300> you<00:00:44.390> get<00:00:44.570> some<00:00:45.160> liquid

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
to do is if you get some liquid

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.610 
to do is if you get some liquid
glycerine<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.910> what<00:00:47.540> that<00:00:47.690> does<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.079> it's

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
glycerine and what that does is it's

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.139 
glycerine and what that does is it's
just<00:00:48.680> basically<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:49.250> clear<00:00:49.520> liquid<00:00:49.730> quite

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
just basically a clear liquid quite

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.630 
just basically a clear liquid quite
thick<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.230> it's<00:00:51.500> predominately<00:00:51.920> used<00:00:51.980> to

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
thick and it's predominately used to

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.270 
thick and it's predominately used to
create<00:00:53.210> bait<00:00:53.450> dips<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:53.960> liquids<00:00:54.379> do<00:00:55.070> we<00:00:55.160> get

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
create bait dips and liquids do we get

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.799 
create bait dips and liquids do we get
some<00:00:55.460> of<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:55.610> in<00:00:55.789> there<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.300> what<00:00:56.480> that<00:00:56.629> does

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
some of that in there and what that does

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.959 
some of that in there and what that does
is<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.079> allows<00:00:57.320> all<00:00:57.620> kind<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.100> attractors<00:00:58.699> and

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
is it allows all kind of attractors and

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.329 
is it allows all kind of attractors and
cents<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.620> and<00:01:00.620> everything<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.219> stick<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:03.339> the

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
cents and and everything to stick to the

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.679 
cents and and everything to stick to the
stick<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:07.220> that's<00:01:07.430> in<00:01:07.610> there<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.330> kind<00:01:08.570> of

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
stick so that's in there and it kind of

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.800 
stick so that's in there and it kind of
sort<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:08.990> gives<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.320> nice<00:01:09.470> little<00:01:09.650> sticky

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
sort of gives it a nice little sticky

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.070 
sort of gives it a nice little sticky
kind<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:12.020> lamented<00:01:12.590> look<00:01:12.799> all<00:01:12.979> already<00:01:14.080> then

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
kind of lamented look all already then

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.330 
kind of lamented look all already then
what<00:01:15.170> we<00:01:15.260> do<00:01:15.380> is<00:01:15.500> get<00:01:15.650> our<00:01:15.799> second<00:01:16.159> liquid

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
what we do is get our second liquid

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.370 
what we do is get our second liquid
which<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:16.760> this<00:01:16.850> corn<00:01:17.150> sweet<00:01:17.450> syrup<00:01:17.840> it's<00:01:18.229> a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
which is this corn sweet syrup it's a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.200 
which is this corn sweet syrup it's a
thick<00:01:18.650> syrup<00:01:19.159> which<00:01:19.369> obviously<00:01:19.880> as<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.180> name

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
thick syrup which obviously as the name

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.950 
thick syrup which obviously as the name
suggests<00:01:20.740> high<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.920> soluble<00:01:22.250> sugars<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.299> a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
suggests high in soluble sugars and a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.840 
suggests high in soluble sugars and a
naturally<00:01:24.890> occurring<00:01:25.189> enzyme<00:01:25.369> which

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
naturally occurring enzyme which

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.740 
naturally occurring enzyme which
improves<00:01:26.270> both<00:01:26.509> pleura<00:01:27.259> bility<00:01:27.710> and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
improves both pleura bility and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.330 
improves both pleura bility and
digestibility<00:01:29.750> obviously<00:01:30.439> which<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.799> you

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
digestibility obviously which is you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.429 
digestibility obviously which is you
know<00:01:31.460> going<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.759> help<00:01:32.079> massively<00:01:34.540> with<00:01:35.540> not

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
know going to help massively with not

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.690 
know going to help massively with not
with<00:01:37.430> coating<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.090> seeds<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.579> preventing<00:01:40.579> it

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
with coating the seeds and preventing it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.450 
with coating the seeds and preventing it
from<00:01:40.729> melting<00:01:41.570> our<00:01:41.869> PVA<00:01:42.259> it's<00:01:42.920> getting<00:01:43.189> really

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
from melting our PVA it's getting really

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.730 
from melting our PVA it's getting really
thick<00:01:43.490> now<00:01:43.939> it's<00:01:44.150> almost<00:01:44.390> sort<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:45.619> could

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
thick now it's almost sort of you could

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.060 
thick now it's almost sort of you could
almost<00:01:45.920> stick<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.430> together<00:01:47.079> but<00:01:48.079> it's<00:01:48.259> got

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
almost stick that together but it's got

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.480 
almost stick that together but it's got
a<00:01:49.100> nice<00:01:49.310> coating<00:01:49.810> really<00:01:50.810> oily<00:01:51.189> then<00:01:52.189> what<00:01:52.369> we

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
a nice coating really oily then what we

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.710 
a nice coating really oily then what we
can<00:01:52.610> do<00:01:52.759> if<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:52.939> can<00:01:53.060> get<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.240> little<00:01:53.390> bit<00:01:53.540> more

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
can do if you can get a little bit more

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.450 
can do if you can get a little bit more
interesting<00:01:54.320> obviously<00:01:54.770> but<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.310> now

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
interesting obviously but this is now

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.760 
interesting obviously but this is now
PVA<00:01:55.880> friendly<00:01:56.390> but<00:01:56.780> because<00:01:57.079> we<00:01:57.229> included<00:01:57.649> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
PVA friendly but because we included the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.410 
PVA friendly but because we included the
glycerine<00:01:58.159> as<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.460> said<00:01:58.670> earlier<00:01:59.000> we<00:01:59.149> can<00:01:59.299> now

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
glycerine as I said earlier we can now
