00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 one among the Schalke fans about 25 000 have come despite the miserable 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.200
 Weather the soil naturally deep 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.029
 when height wins and 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.029
 the guests from Karlsruhe in the white jerseys 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.619
 Sound with the Mattsee 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.710
 that was the sixth minute of play there was not much missing 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.999
 the host led with 1 0 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.089
 Hundreds of these 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.739
 that give elephant 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.689
 Renault had his worries 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.090
 not only in these five first six minutes of play in the following hawk 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.710
 constantly happy in the offensive games 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.990
 very fast 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.870
 imaginative Drexler 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.720
 and goalkeeper drove 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.050
 under one roof already seldom suffers 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.900
 counter 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.340
 Dag Harmsen 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.860
 Pilot was on it 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.440
 In the first place, his counterattack should leave the terminally ill for the first time 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
 the u19 happen 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.340
 and again and again 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.290
 Ball deflected and 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.970
 He became the best player in the first 45 minutes alongside Toni Remscheid 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.210
 he with the number 10 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.610
 on that place 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.810
 Lanz parade 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.530
 after another 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.720
 but still 000 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.969
 not exactly gentle bumps of details 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.150
 lock possibility 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.940
 For the guests 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.150
 very strong 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.140
 what made the scene 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 but he shoots 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.060
 again and again coach Holger closer 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.920
 Playing field outline 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 he noticed his team 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.210
 against Kleppinger again and again in duel to see 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.210
 but he fails 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.740
 the cracks comes to his aid very well in the midfield of failure at Appel 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.530
 also there was not much missing 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.060
 As said the Schalke fans were surprised that is still zero to zero 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 stood at this superiority s 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.890
 in this splendid header 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.270
 and again and again figure 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.270
 once again the scene from a different perspective 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.399
 the Karlsruher goalkeeper 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.859
 really outstanding in the defense of the guests completely overburdened Branca 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.609
 do a 30-meter shot to the 3 0 in the third set 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.150
 the 1 0 for Schalke 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.599
 Played for 34 minutes 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.479
 the picture barely changed 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.969
 the Karlsruhe found no means 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.279
 his successful counterattack, however, broke the spring of Junghanns 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.309
 but the ball went by 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.109
 By the way, the Kruse was very well covered on the 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.709
 Benefactor GÃ¼nther von Chip 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.709
 when free again 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.569
 and again the goalkeeper of the KSC 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:04.770
 I thought he had almost blind jump form at halftime today only one to zero 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.730
 for Schalke 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.249
 then the second 45 minutes 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.149
 the little Opel's student 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.959
 but the defense of the Schalke attentive keep the pace high 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.939
 Despite the depth of the ground, Schalke was still playing 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.400
 NATO and the outstanding striker 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.400
 and players at Schalke 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:30.909
 the band from the Schalke LinkScanner also was very optimistic before the game 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.469
 is enabled profits 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.649
 although Simone insisted to have filled boxes 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:36.929
 and do it again and again 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:39.180
 Luckily for the able-bodied drove 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.600
 at the casino resort 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.989
 but the shoulder 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.989
 survive huge 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.150
 one can almost say all the counters played against a man against him 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.229
 Goalkeeper in front 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.089
 Andy Rihs 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:04:00.209
 in the right flank very offensive in the final strong and strong condition 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.709
 and good flanks came 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.539
 once better 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.319
 two to zero by Abel 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.769
 59 play 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.489
 that was practically his replacement 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.760
 for the host 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.189
 but suddenly the KSC came 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:26.879
 he made every bite more 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.129
 aggressive 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.389
 and Le Mans suddenly had to distinguish themselves the Schalke 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.309
 not so strong in the tempo then substitution 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.749
 OLG waved Walzer from Erfurt from the club 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:41.879
 with it 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.729
 fresh power 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.090
 what else should he lose? 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.379
 just under 0 to 2 back 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.330
 Decision maker firmly Schalke tried 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
 draw more from it 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.379
 the tour is 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.809
 big and shoes the midfield of Karlsruhe not as strong as usual 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.749
 but she is pushing 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.409
 that was here 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.120
 the top scorer in the second Bundesliga 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.360
 Show this as I said 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.229
 they were not so superior anymore 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.650
 after the 2 1 2 0 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.629
 Students must pay tribute to their own pace 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.229
 however, it gets worse 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.749
 still in front of the penalty area 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.189
 missing the Karlsruhe 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:34.839
 but referee APA 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.949
 sees it differently 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.110
 he decides on a penalty 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.879
 for the South German guests 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:41.750
 in front of the line 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.620
 over 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.629
 against Junghanns 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.240
 2 2 1 for Schalke 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.240
 seven minutes before the end of the game 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.860
 it was exciting once again 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.050
 the Schalke's strength subsided 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.490
 the KSC put everything on a map maybe 2 to 2 her 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.490
 Desire result in this game 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.119
 Gunnar Nacke still the strength 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:08.220
 on these boats 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.219
 and the last honor 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.749
 occasional counterattack 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:14.629
 the DAX was lying 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:16.550
 now only the lovely could 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.509
 excited 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.819
 Adams the Quarter knocked over 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.619
 David RÃ¶der came in 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:25.619
 a penalty on the other side 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:29.939
 What did he do? He sets the ball where there should not be 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:33.639
 Because it was so beautiful, let's take another look at why 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.240
 Game wardens enter 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.469
 behind shoots Apel but already some wins change 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.909
 2 2 1 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.909
 but deserves and enters the quarter-finals it remained peaceful
