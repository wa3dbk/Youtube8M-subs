die<00:03:41.830> with<00:03:42.100> him<00:03:42.280> essentially<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:43.060> he's<00:03:43.240> like

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
die with him essentially so he's like

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.090 
die with him essentially so he's like
you'll<00:03:43.660> never<00:03:43.840> see<00:03:43.990> Hank<00:03:44.410> again<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.860> know<00:03:44.980> he

you'll never see Hank again you know he
doesn't<00:03:45.280> say<00:03:45.490> that<00:03:45.670> he<00:03:45.700> killed<00:03:46.000> him<00:03:46.240> I<00:03:46.390> but<00:03:46.780> he

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
doesn't say that he killed him I but he

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.780 
doesn't say that he killed him I but he
doesn't<00:03:47.260> want<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.800> know<00:03:47.920> involve<00:03:48.340> anybody

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
doesn't want to you know involve anybody

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.070 
doesn't want to you know involve anybody
else<00:03:48.970> he<00:03:49.150> doesn't<00:03:49.420> want<00:03:49.570> that<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> Todd's

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
else he doesn't want that the Todd's

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.020 
else he doesn't want that the Todd's
naughty<00:03:50.470> uncle's<00:03:51.100> how<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.370> keep<00:03:51.790> referencing

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
naughty uncle's how I keep referencing

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.360 
naughty uncle's how I keep referencing
him<00:03:52.570> as<00:03:52.810> Todd's<00:03:53.050> naughty<00:03:53.350> uncles<00:03:53.800> but<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.190> just

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
him as Todd's naughty uncles but it just

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.310 
him as Todd's naughty uncles but it just
makes<00:03:54.580> sense<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:55.420> know<00:03:55.450> he<00:03:55.630> doesn't<00:03:56.020> want

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
makes sense you know he doesn't want

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.140 
makes sense you know he doesn't want
anything<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.770> connect<00:03:57.100> with<00:03:57.280> his<00:03:57.459> family<00:03:57.940> so

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
anything to connect with his family so

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.780 
anything to connect with his family so
he<00:03:58.180> makes<00:03:58.540> everything<00:03:58.810> go<00:03:59.140> on<00:03:59.290> him<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.459> I

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
he makes everything go on him and I

really liked that I liked that he was

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.650 
really liked that I liked that he was
saying<00:04:02.890> things<00:04:03.130> that<00:04:03.250> he<00:04:03.430> didn't<00:04:03.730> mean<00:04:03.910> he<00:04:04.540> was

because<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:17.049> think<00:04:17.109> everyone<00:04:17.859> who<00:04:18.130> watches

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
because I think everyone who watches

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.390 
because I think everyone who watches
this<00:04:18.730> show<00:04:18.989> at<00:04:19.989> some<00:04:20.320> point<00:04:20.650> was<00:04:20.799> thinking<00:04:21.250> the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
this show at some point was thinking the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.159 
this show at some point was thinking the
same<00:04:21.430> thing<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:22.090> know<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.390> was<00:04:22.720> when<00:04:22.870> he<00:04:22.900> said

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
same thing I know I was when he said

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.440 
same thing I know I was when he said
that<00:04:23.440> even<00:04:24.100> if<00:04:24.190> he<00:04:24.280> didn't<00:04:24.550> completely<00:04:25.090> mean

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
that even if he didn't completely mean

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.980 
that even if he didn't completely mean
it<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.720> was

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
it I was

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.580 
it I was
yes<00:04:26.550> finally<00:04:28.150> Skyler<00:04:28.930> shuts<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.289> hell<00:04:29.440> off

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
yes finally Skyler shuts the hell off

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.200 
yes finally Skyler shuts the hell off
because<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.009> only<00:04:30.130> thing<00:04:30.310> Skyler<00:04:30.759> ever<00:04:30.940> does

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
because the only thing Skyler ever does

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.480 
because the only thing Skyler ever does
in<00:04:31.479> these<00:04:31.870> shows<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.350> make<00:04:32.560> she<00:04:33.069> always<00:04:33.220> makes

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
in these shows is make she always makes

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.010 
in these shows is make she always makes
it<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.729> a<00:04:33.759> bad<00:04:34.060> situation<00:04:34.360> worse

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
it like a bad situation worse

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.320 
it like a bad situation worse
that's<00:04:35.440> what<00:04:35.620> Skyler<00:04:35.979> does<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.460> mean<00:04:36.550> when<00:04:37.210> your

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330

get into to go start his new life but
for<00:05:00.250> some<00:05:00.430> odd<00:05:00.550> reason<00:05:00.580> he<00:05:01.060> felt<00:05:01.240> he<00:05:01.479> had<00:05:01.509> a<00:05:01.599> go

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
for some odd reason he felt he had a go

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.320 
for some odd reason he felt he had a go
over<00:05:01.960> revenge<00:05:02.340> against<00:05:03.340> Walter<00:05:03.759> White<00:05:04.000> rather

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
over revenge against Walter White rather

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.939 
over revenge against Walter White rather
than<00:05:04.570> just<00:05:04.780> run<00:05:05.020> off<00:05:05.139> into<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.380> sunset<00:05:05.680> with

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
than just run off into the sunset with

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.350 
than just run off into the sunset with
the<00:05:06.039> money<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.340> live<00:05:06.460> happily<00:05:06.669> ever<00:05:06.970> after

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
the money and live happily ever after

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.270 
the money and live happily ever after
but<00:05:07.389> now<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.810> think<00:05:08.470> he's<00:05:08.590> kind<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.860> regretting

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
but now I think he's kind of regretting

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.040 
but now I think he's kind of regretting
that<00:05:09.400> as<00:05:09.610> he's<00:05:09.789> chained<00:05:10.090> up<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.419> Todd's<00:05:10.750> a

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
that as he's chained up and Todd's a

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.020 
that as he's chained up and Todd's a
meth<00:05:11.410> lab<00:05:11.440> rhetoric<00:05:12.130> Walter<00:05:12.550> White's<00:05:12.789> gonna

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
meth lab rhetoric Walter White's gonna

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.670 
meth lab rhetoric Walter White's gonna
go<00:05:13.180> on<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.419> low<00:05:13.599> for<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.900> while<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:14.440> know<00:05:14.470> he's

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
go on the low for a while you know he's

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.860 
go on the low for a while you know he's
gonna<00:05:14.770> lay<00:05:15.400> low<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:15.970> I<00:05:16.389> think<00:05:16.599> eventually

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
gonna lay low and I think eventually

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.050 
gonna lay low and I think eventually
something's<00:05:17.560> going<00:05:18.039> to<00:05:18.070> arise<00:05:18.460> where<00:05:18.820> he's

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
something's going to arise where he's

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.480 
something's going to arise where he's
like<00:05:19.389> oh<00:05:19.570> my<00:05:19.960> god<00:05:20.169> I<00:05:20.199> have<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.560> go<00:05:20.740> take<00:05:21.280> out
