this fuel pump job I'm gonna give you a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.089 
this fuel pump job I'm gonna give you a
quick<00:00:05.430> tutorial<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.740> threaded<00:00:07.740> ring

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
quick tutorial is this threaded ring

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.860 
quick tutorial is this threaded ring
that<00:00:08.370> they'll<00:00:08.610> secure<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.300> fuel<00:00:09.510> pump<00:00:09.660> down

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
that they'll secure as a fuel pump down

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.749 
that they'll secure as a fuel pump down
you<00:00:10.440> make<00:00:10.590> your<00:00:10.710> own<00:00:10.769> tool<00:00:11.070> by<00:00:11.280> grabbing<00:00:11.550> one

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
you make your own tool by grabbing one

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.700 
you make your own tool by grabbing one
of<00:00:11.849> these<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> think<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.509> four<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.320> got

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
of these I think it's like a four I got

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.200 
of these I think it's like a four I got
this<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:14.009> from<00:00:14.130> Lowe's<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.759> like<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> four

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
this one from Lowe's it's like a four

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.140 
this one from Lowe's it's like a four
inch<00:00:15.389> end<00:00:15.690> cap<00:00:16.109> but<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.440> see<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.770> has<00:00:16.920> these

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
inch end cap but you see it has these

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.950 
inch end cap but you see it has these
ridges<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.359> I've<00:00:19.939> used<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.090> file<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.689> even

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
ridges and I've used a file and even

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.660 
ridges and I've used a file and even
created<00:00:22.380> more<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.220> does<00:00:23.279> is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
created more because what this does is

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.240 
created more because what this does is
in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.850> top<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.480> threaded<00:00:24.930> ring<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.500> fit

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
in the top of that threaded ring I fit

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.939 
in the top of that threaded ring I fit
this<00:00:26.430> guy<00:00:26.930> have<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> hole<00:00:28.320> put<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> screwdriver

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
this guy have a hole put a screwdriver

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.740 
this guy have a hole put a screwdriver
in<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:29.849> able<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.119> apply<00:00:30.240> consistent

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
in and now I'm able to apply consistent

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.959 
in and now I'm able to apply consistent
pressure<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.439> around<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.920> ring<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.399> unscrew

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
pressure all around that ring to unscrew

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.510 
pressure all around that ring to unscrew
this<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.270> will<00:00:33.390> break<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.829> done<00:00:35.190> in

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
this you will break this if not done in

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.819 
this you will break this if not done in
a<00:00:35.910> manner<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.899> that's<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.590> thirty

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
a manner like this and that's a thirty

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
a manner like this and that's a thirty
dollar<00:00:38.040> part<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.640> also<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> wait

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
dollar part but also you have to wait

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.400 
dollar part but also you have to wait
for<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> part<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.719> come<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.050> don't<00:00:40.110> think

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
for the part to come in I don't think

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.840 
for the part to come in I don't think
they'd<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> local<00:00:41.309> store<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.520> if

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
they'd have it in the local store or if

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.459 
they'd have it in the local store or if
you<00:00:41.910> go<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> dealership<00:00:42.480> they<00:00:43.140> might<00:00:43.320> have

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
you go to the dealership they might have

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
you go to the dealership they might have
that<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.070> anyway<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.700> you're<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> be

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that but anyway what you're going to be

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.360 
that but anyway what you're going to be
then<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.899> holds<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.620> fuel<00:00:46.890> pump<00:00:47.190> down

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
then what that holds the fuel pump down

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.830 
then what that holds the fuel pump down
I<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.700> happen<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.239> these<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:48.690> just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
I just happen to have these so they just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.119 
I just happen to have these so they just
did<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> job<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.410> while<00:00:49.620> ago<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> fuel

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
did a job a little while ago on the fuel

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.560 
did a job a little while ago on the fuel
pump<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.390> careful

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
pump so you really want to be careful

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
pump so you really want to be careful
about<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.079> angle<00:00:52.469> check<00:00:52.710> valves<00:00:53.039> also

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
about the right angle check valves also

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.979 
about the right angle check valves also
careful<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> break<00:00:54.270> them<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.629> real<00:00:54.840> easy

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
careful not to break them be real easy

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
careful not to break them be real easy
prying<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.670> guy<00:00:56.850> will<00:00:57.059> unscrew

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.260 
you'll also want that you'll also want a
short<00:01:32.369> segment<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:35.070> fuel<00:01:35.430> line<00:01:35.759> because

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
short segment of the fuel line because

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.050 
short segment of the fuel line because
this<00:01:36.570> fuel<00:01:36.990> line<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.060> pump

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
this fuel line that's on the pump

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
this fuel line that's on the pump
assembly<00:01:39.299> itself<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.259> hard<00:01:40.650> fuel<00:01:40.920> line

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
assembly itself is a hard fuel line

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.380 
assembly itself is a hard fuel line
you're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> replace<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.000> small

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
segment so this is what the fuel pump

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.230 
segment so this is what the fuel pump
will<00:01:44.399> look<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.670> you're<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.090> to
