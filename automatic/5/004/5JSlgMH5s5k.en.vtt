00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.219
 Now I wanted to say I received the parcel 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:20.170
 this is a cable with a move 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:24.210
 Ayu x such here below this 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:28.180
 tape recorder this ford me transit 6000cd 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.800
 that's why it reads very badly here 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:39.239
 drives a car let's say a little 2007 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:45.250
 I have such a thing, but 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:57.340
 quality is not very happy through 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:01:02.739
 radio bought ebay thing unpack here 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:06.159
 of course it was packed specifically one strongly 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:10.359
 package second package is I already ripped 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.829
 cooked here and here still in each package 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:18.389
 I immediately bought with such here that is 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:24.479
 pullers to take out pull this 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:28.029
 hardware magnet is all in packs 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.849
 It turns out three bags of these bags 

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:34.200
 but this is probably so that if 

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:37.479
 somewhere the ship will sink a couple 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.289

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.799
 Pacific islands in general we will 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:48.009
 try try here and how it will be 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.920
 I think it's okay to play all the same cable 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:56.000
 this cable 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.130

 which is some kind of phone and so 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:10.709
 further yes the cost wanted to say no 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.989
 I remember exactly 10-12 is the dollars cost 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.010
 such well it was a little cheaper there for a couple 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:22.010
 dollars well then I already saw ordered 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:31.769

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.610
 above , you need to have these 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.980

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.230

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.410

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.799
 dollar here and we insert them here there 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:56.200
 we have grooves 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:03:00.550
 like this 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:08.160
 this side bevel we set so that she 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:08.160
 was inside us so there is 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:30.689
 Well, and pull our machine for these 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:33.959

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:37.810
 backlit phone but it's already dark 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:43.209
 here so here so here this plug 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:51.040
 where it is inserted here it is this 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:54.939
 cable ayu x here but I had it here 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:59.139
 such a house that is , he had the top 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:02.650
 such a plastic thing I do not know it 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:04.510
 probably for others some may 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.439
 Lefortovo table some more 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.760
 cars 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:20.049
 here she came to me here is not a coin mod 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:25.229
 here it is quite different therefore he is here 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.840
 pulled out right here because of a crack 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:33.310
 trouble 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.430
 show here but no matter what 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.120
 will understand here the latch is removed and 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.919
 I had to put it like this 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.770
 It turns out without snaps but fits 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.500
 simply inserted and all's well you 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.470
 should check well too from the first 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.040
 times at me 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.020
 but didn't play there with contact 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.780
 because if it were in this building 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.810
 Of course it would be hard to sit so she did not 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.940
 very tough so check before 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.790
 setting so that later not again 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.470
 pull out well in general here and so 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.690
 then naturally from the other side 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.550
 This plug insert here I the fact that 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:21.260
 I tried to insert my phone and 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:24.100
