00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:26.000
 Today we start twentieth of june 2014 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.760
 Distill for the first time today 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.760
 gooders here in my the silent 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.290
 the most important office in the race is the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.030
 perfect recipe for half a year 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.140
 I with different herbs and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.850
 Spices also called botanical 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.210
 experimented until my recipe was perfect 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.059
 was an equally special ingredient 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.250
 our hand-made bodenseewasser it 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 characterized by its purity 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:06.479
 and fresh countless attempts with fire 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.539
 subsequent tastings were great 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.750
 exciting interesting and always ended 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:16.050
 Pretty funny my recipe is made up 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.810
 18 different ingredients half past nine 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.160
 cards are juniper coriander and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.500
 Angelica bring the other ingredients 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.100
 harmonious in smaller quantities 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100
 blasts 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.960
 become part of the flowers and spices 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.770
 in the steam extracted around the fine flavors 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.770
 back 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.729
 for the best possible quality 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.790
 It is very important to reach it slowly 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.540
 and gently while staying the same 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.119
 Distill wood fire 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.810
 this process takes nearly eight 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.810
 hours 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.970
 is 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.970
 all 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.750
 The first glasses were filled immediately 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.000
 infused with different tonics and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.000
 tasted full of tension 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.280
 I already have the first drink in the glass 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.530
 I already have here as in the kettle or 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.020
 as the templates what taken out 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.240
 the flavors that come out nice 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.240
 fruity fresh for good
