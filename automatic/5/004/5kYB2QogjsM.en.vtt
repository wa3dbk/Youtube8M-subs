00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
have one more book on my TBR so I can

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.300 
have one more book on my TBR so I can
hopefully<00:02:43.080> complete<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.770> challenge<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
hopefully complete this challenge and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
hopefully complete this challenge and
that<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.360> sleeper<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.020> spindle<00:02:46.440> by

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
that is the sleeper and the spindle by

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.440 
that is the sleeper and the spindle by
Neil<00:02:46.770> Gaiman<00:02:46.800> illustrated<00:02:47.790> by<00:02:47.850> Chris<00:02:48.090> Radel

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
Neil Gaiman illustrated by Chris Radel

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.330 
Neil Gaiman illustrated by Chris Radel
and<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> really<00:02:49.739> really<00:02:49.890> short

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and this one is a really really short

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.370 
and this one is a really really short
book<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.820> has<00:02:50.970> quite<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.270> few<00:02:51.360> illustrations<00:02:51.660> as

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
book it has quite a few illustrations as

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.930 
book it has quite a few illustrations as
well<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> think<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.430> will<00:02:53.550> be<00:02:53.610> another

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
well so I think this will be another

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.260 
well so I think this will be another
quite<00:02:54.570> fast<00:02:55.200> read<00:02:55.650> perfect<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.550> refund<00:02:56.970> so

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
quite fast read perfect for a refund so

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.400 
quite fast read perfect for a refund so
