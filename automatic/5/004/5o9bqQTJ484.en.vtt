00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
is a bit off and yeah bit off doesn't

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.400 
exactly have the world's highest attack
so<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:47.420> baton<00:00:48.420> pass<00:00:48.600> off<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so I get my baton pass off there and I

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
so I get my baton pass off there and I
go<00:00:49.590> into<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:50.340> ninja<00:00:50.730> ass<00:00:51.980> he's<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.129> switch

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
I'm guessing well it's gonna a stone

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
I'm guessing well it's gonna a stone
edge<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.780> something<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.440> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
edge or something like that is

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.939 
edge or something like that is
definitely<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.430> coming<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.789> way<00:00:59.820> so

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
definitely going to be coming my way so

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.470 
definitely going to be coming my way so
pretty<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.670> wanted<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> get

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
pretty much here I just wanted to get

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.789 
pretty much here I just wanted to get
the<00:01:03.629> hell<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.379> soon<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.680> possible

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the hell out of here as soon as possible

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.640 
the hell out of here as soon as possible
so<00:01:05.280> I'm<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> speed<00:01:06.060> up<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> speeding

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
so I'm going to speed up the speeding

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
so I'm going to speed up the speeding
process<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.430> giving<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> deity<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
process with giving it the deity which I

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
process with giving it the deity which I
never<00:01:09.990> would<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:12.060> did

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
never would actually do but I just did

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.300 
never would actually do but I just did
it<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.020> time<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.530> could<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.830> my<00:01:13.890> speed

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it for this time so I could get my speed

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.550 
it for this time so I could get my speed
boost<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.150> fast<00:01:15.600> okay<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
boost off really really fast okay so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.190 
boost off really really fast okay so
anyway<00:01:17.220> he<00:01:17.790> hits<00:01:18.030> me<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> stone<00:01:18.780> edge<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
anyway he hits me with a stone edge and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.630 
anyway he hits me with a stone edge and
I'm<00:01:19.259> thinking<00:01:19.619> well<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> be

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
I'm thinking well I'm not going to be

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
I'm thinking well I'm not going to be
able<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.850> safely<00:01:21.060> switch<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:22.140> art<00:01:22.470> Biddulph

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
able to safely switch in my art Biddulph

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.820 
able to safely switch in my art Biddulph
so<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.759> avoid<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> attack<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> that's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so I avoid the attack there and that's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
so I avoid the attack there and that's
perfect<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.549> pass<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.030> my<00:01:27.180> sub<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:28.020> my

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
perfect just pass on my sub to my

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.780 
perfect just pass on my sub to my
awesome<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.850 

you
