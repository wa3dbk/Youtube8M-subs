course<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.620> I'd<00:00:56.739> never<00:00:56.950> actually<00:00:57.190> worked

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
course and I'd never actually worked

with<00:00:57.670> wood<00:00:57.970> at<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.080> time<00:00:59.320> and<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.280> was<00:01:00.400> I<00:01:00.430> think

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
with wood at the time and it was I think

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.780 
with wood at the time and it was I think
it<00:01:00.730> was<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:00.910> my<00:01:01.030> third<00:01:01.330> year<00:01:01.360> where<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:01.900> started

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
it was in my third year where I started

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.040 
it was in my third year where I started
messing<00:01:03.790> around<00:01:03.879> with<00:01:04.180> wood<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.630> I<00:01:04.690> found<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
messing around with wood and I found the

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.469 
messing around with wood and I found the
process<00:01:05.410> of<00:01:05.530> steam<00:01:05.770> bending<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:07.180> all<00:01:07.330> the

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
process of steam bending so all the

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.200 
process of steam bending so all the
products<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.229> make<00:01:08.440> made<00:01:09.160> out<00:01:09.369> of<00:01:09.550> steam<00:01:10.000> bed

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
products I make made out of steam bed

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.410 
products I make made out of steam bed
wood<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.800> woods<00:01:12.009> most<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:12.880> its<00:01:13.000> locally

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
wood and the woods most of its locally

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.260 
wood and the woods most of its locally
sourced<00:01:13.869> so<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.590> would<00:01:14.890> initially<00:01:15.400> go<00:01:16.030> and

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
sourced so I would initially go and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.270 
sourced so I would initially go and
speak<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.690> one<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.410> foresters<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.160> our

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
speak to one of the foresters and our

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.060 
speak to one of the foresters and our
source<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.880> tree<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:19.330> was<00:01:19.420> suitable<00:01:19.690> for<00:01:20.140> beam

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
source a tree that was suitable for beam

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.690 
source a tree that was suitable for beam
bending<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.640> I'd<00:01:22.570> get<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:22.869> planked<00:01:23.229> up<00:01:23.410> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
bending and I'd get it planked up and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.150 
bending and I'd get it planked up and
then<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:25.030> would<00:01:25.420> take<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.990> back<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.979> would

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
then I would take it back and I would

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.580 
then I would take it back and I would
steam<00:01:27.490> sections<00:01:28.149> around<00:01:28.420> various<00:01:29.140> bending

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
steam sections around various bending

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.920 
steam sections around various bending
formats<00:01:30.040> or<00:01:30.130> jigs<00:01:30.430> allow<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.330> width<00:01:31.540> to<00:01:31.690> dry

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
formats or jigs allow the width to dry

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.380 
formats or jigs allow the width to dry
and<00:01:32.229> then<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.800> would<00:01:33.040> assemble<00:01:34.110> products<00:01:36.390> this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
and then I would assemble products this

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.090 
and then I would assemble products this
process<00:01:37.869> for<00:01:38.050> steam<00:01:38.259> bending<00:01:38.710> means<00:01:38.920> you're

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
process for steam bending means you're

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.400 
process for steam bending means you're
not<00:01:39.190> using<00:01:39.429> toxic<00:01:40.149> glues

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
not using toxic glues

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.380 
not using toxic glues
you're<00:01:41.890> not<00:01:42.009> having<00:01:42.220> high<00:01:42.490> levels<00:01:42.550> of<00:01:42.850> wastage

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
you're not having high levels of wastage

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.490 
you're not having high levels of wastage
or<00:01:43.539> anything<00:01:43.720> else<00:01:43.899> you're<00:01:44.080> literally<00:01:44.440> just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
or anything else you're literally just

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.260 
or anything else you're literally just
using<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.100> steam<00:01:45.369> like<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.789> steam<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.119> get

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
using the steam like the steam you get

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.810 
using the steam like the steam you get
from<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.479> boiling<00:01:46.899> kettle

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.480 

I<00:01:49.880> think<00:01:50.870> that<00:01:51.110> her<00:01:51.290> relationship<00:01:51.620> with<00:01:52.250> wood

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
I think that her relationship with wood

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.960 
I think that her relationship with wood
is<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.909> main<00:01:53.479> reason<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:54.050> I<00:01:54.640> fell<00:01:55.640> in<00:01:55.670> love

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
is the main reason that I fell in love

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.730 
is the main reason that I fell in love
with<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.270> process<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.720> steam<00:01:56.930> bending<00:01:57.440> I

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
with the process of steam bending I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.740 
with the process of steam bending I
think<00:01:58.400> it's<00:01:58.580> why<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.760> love<00:01:59.000> working<00:01:59.180> with<00:01:59.540> so

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
think it's why I love working with so

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.690 
think it's why I love working with so
much<00:01:59.930> because<00:02:00.140> every<00:02:00.860> piece<00:02:01.190> of<00:02:01.250> wood<00:02:01.520> is

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
much because every piece of wood is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.480 
much because every piece of wood is
different<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:03.100> especially<00:02:04.100> with<00:02:04.220> steam

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
different and especially with steam

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.460 
different and especially with steam
mending<00:02:04.880> if<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.060> don't<00:02:05.270> pick<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.990> right

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
mending if you don't pick the right

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.980 
mending if you don't pick the right
piece<00:02:06.800> for<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.160> job<00:02:07.479> then<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.600> woods<00:02:08.780> gonna

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
piece for the job then the woods gonna

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.080 
piece for the job then the woods gonna
split<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.649> have<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.009> make<00:02:10.250> sure<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:10.789> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
split you have to make sure that the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.330 
split you have to make sure that the
word<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.900> straight<00:02:12.320> grained<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:12.860> not<00:02:13.010> free

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
word is is straight grained and not free

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.850 
word is is straight grained and not free
or<00:02:13.370> at<00:02:13.700> least<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.030> knots<00:02:14.240> are<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.570> well<00:02:15.560> not<00:02:15.709> in

the places where the really tight Bend
is<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.920> be<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:20.540> most<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.080> all<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.410> you

is going to be but most of all it's you

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.250 
is going to be but most of all it's you

know it's a natural material every piece
is<00:02:24.410> different<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.830> can't<00:02:25.070> quite<00:02:25.220> explain<00:02:25.430> it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
is different I can't quite explain it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.460 
is different I can't quite explain it
but<00:02:25.910> when<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.180> finish<00:02:26.390> when<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.170> finish<00:02:27.440> a
