actually signal component let me show
you<00:00:20.169> in<00:00:20.259> a<00:00:20.349> bit<00:00:20.380> more<00:00:20.590> detail<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.820> one<00:00:22.090> who

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
you in a bit more detail this one who

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.229 
you in a bit more detail this one who
basically<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.430> only<00:00:24.610> thing<00:00:24.759> you<00:00:24.880> do<00:00:25.029> is

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239 
basically the only thing you do is

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.019 
basically the only thing you do is
connect<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.770> wireless<00:00:26.770> charging<00:00:27.040> coil<00:00:27.399> crank

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
connect the wireless charging coil crank

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.999 
connect the wireless charging coil crank
power<00:00:28.270> at<00:00:28.450> the<00:00:28.540> input<00:00:28.809> and<00:00:29.290> as<00:00:29.410> a<00:00:29.439> single<00:00:29.860> ship

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
power at the input and as a single ship

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.920 
power at the input and as a single ship
solution<00:00:30.520> that<00:00:30.700> it<00:00:30.880> gets<00:00:31.180> everything<00:00:31.450> to<00:00:31.750> make

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
solution that it gets everything to make

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.729 
solution that it gets everything to make
a<00:00:31.960> no<00:00:32.829> powerful<00:00:33.670> shot<00:00:34.239> so<00:00:34.989> he's<00:00:35.199> saying<00:00:35.379> in

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
a no powerful shot so he's saying in

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.459 
a no powerful shot so he's saying in
there<00:00:36.100> is<00:00:36.280> this<00:00:36.489> well<00:00:37.269> actually<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.660> there<00:00:37.840> we

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
there is this well actually is there we

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:39.900 
there is this well actually is there we
have<00:00:38.829> just<00:00:39.070> made<00:00:39.219> it<00:00:39.399> as<00:00:39.489> small<00:00:39.699> as<00:00:39.760> possible

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
have just made it as small as possible

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.569 
have just made it as small as possible
so<00:00:40.570> this<00:00:40.989> fits<00:00:41.199> on<00:00:41.440> one<00:00:41.980> point<00:00:42.250> five

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
so this fits on one point five

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.840 
so this fits on one point five
centimeter<00:00:43.329> square<00:00:43.660> in<00:00:44.620> total<00:00:45.100> there<00:00:45.579> are<00:00:45.730> no

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
centimeter square in total there are no

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.819 
centimeter square in total there are no
components<00:00:46.329> on<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.480> backside<00:00:46.839> actually<00:00:47.739> you

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
components on the backside actually you

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.560 
components on the backside actually you
make<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.010> wireless<00:00:48.429> charger<00:00:48.910> which<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.239> adding

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
make a wireless charger which is adding

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.979 
make a wireless charger which is adding
by<00:00:49.690> 10<00:00:50.620> external<00:00:50.859> components<00:00:51.429> and<00:00:51.519> that's<00:00:51.579> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
by 10 external components and that's it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.569 
by 10 external components and that's it
basically<00:00:52.989> this<00:00:53.469> is<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.769> one<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.280> we<00:00:54.460> need

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
basically this is the one that we need

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.849 
basically this is the one that we need
also<00:00:54.940> this<00:00:55.570> is<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:55.780> coil<00:00:56.079> which<00:00:56.499> actually

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
also this is the coil which actually

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.290 
also this is the coil which actually
transmit<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.460> wireless<00:00:57.699> charging<00:00:57.940> field

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
transmit the wireless charging field

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.169 
transmit the wireless charging field
there<00:00:58.929> is<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.079> receiving<00:00:59.559> coil<00:00:59.769> also<00:01:00.010> in<00:01:00.999> the

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
there is a receiving coil also in the

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.809 
there is a receiving coil also in the
handset<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:02.140> if<00:01:02.260> you<00:01:02.440> put<00:01:02.620> these<00:01:02.769> files<00:01:03.100> on<00:01:03.609> top

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
handset so if you put these files on top

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.600 
handset so if you put these files on top
of<00:01:03.940> each<00:01:04.030> other

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
of each other

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.690 
of each other
there<00:01:06.120> will<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> link<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.900> established<00:01:07.700> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
there will be a link in established and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.150 
there will be a link in established and
then<00:01:08.880> dischargeable<00:01:09.420> sorry<00:01:09.860> alright<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:13.160> can

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
then dischargeable sorry alright so can

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.590 
then dischargeable sorry alright so can
you<00:01:14.250> split<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.610> little<00:01:14.700> bit<00:01:14.880> more<00:01:15.060> what's<00:01:15.480> in

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you split a little bit more what's in

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.000 
you split a little bit more what's in
there<00:01:15.750> what's<00:01:16.260> in<00:01:16.380> there

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
there what's in there

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.570 
there what's in there
so<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.410> ship<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so in the in it in the ship what you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.330 
so in the in it in the ship what you
actually<00:01:20.760> have<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> five-fold<00:01:22.500> input

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
actually have as a five-fold input

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
actually have as a five-fold input
supply<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.300> also<00:01:24.540> has<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> controller<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.560> make

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
supply it also has a controller to make

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
supply it also has a controller to make
sure<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.190> communicates<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:27.330> wireless

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
sure that it communicates the wireless

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
sure that it communicates the wireless
charging<00:01:27.960> coil<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.160> handset<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:30.120> make

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
charging coil with the handset to make

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.340 
charging coil with the handset to make
sure<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:30.600> handset<00:01:30.870> can<00:01:31.020> tell<00:01:31.200> them<00:01:31.320> how

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
sure that the handset can tell them how

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
sure that the handset can tell them how
much<00:01:31.560> power<00:01:31.800> at<00:01:32.040> least<00:01:32.160> and<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.240> very

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
much power at least and what is very

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.570 
much power at least and what is very
important<00:01:34.050> there<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.200> an<00:01:34.350> output<00:01:34.530> stage<00:01:34.950> that

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
important there is an output stage that

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.210 
important there is an output stage that
derives<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.270> gone<00:01:36.480> up<00:01:36.690> to<00:01:36.840> 7<00:01:37.200> watts<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:38.010> all

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
derives the gone up to 7 watts and all

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.240 
derives the gone up to 7 watts and all
of<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:39.090> very<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:39.570> small<00:01:40.350> peg<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.160> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
of this in a very very small peg so you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.920 
of this in a very very small peg so you
minimize<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> size<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.690> wireless

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
minimize really the size of the wireless

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
minimize really the size of the wireless
traffic<00:01:43.880> all<00:01:44.880> right<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:46.650> shapes<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
traffic all right so the shapes of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.880 
traffic all right so the shapes of
wireless<00:01:47.610> charges<00:01:48.150> can<00:01:48.300> be<00:01:48.330> all<00:01:48.540> kinds<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
wireless charges can be all kinds and of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.920 
wireless charges can be all kinds and of
course<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> smaller<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.910> electronics<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
course the smaller the electronics the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.210 
course the smaller the electronics the
more<00:01:52.110> design<00:01:52.410> freedom<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.830> have<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.160> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
more design freedom you have for the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.430 
more design freedom you have for the
wireless<00:01:53.369> charger<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.180> imagine<00:01:54.570> normally

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
wireless charger just imagine normally

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.230 
wireless charger just imagine normally
what<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.680> would<00:01:55.710> need<00:01:56.010> is<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.850> wireless

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
what you would need is in a wireless

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
what you would need is in a wireless
charger<00:01:57.750> electronics<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.410> would<00:01:58.560> need<00:01:58.650> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
charger electronics you would need a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.920 
charger electronics you would need a
controller<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.340> would<00:01:59.610> need<00:01:59.780> drivers<00:02:00.780> who

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
controller you would need drivers who

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.420 
controller you would need drivers who
need<00:02:00.990> quite<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.440> lot<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> external<00:02:01.920> circuits

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
need quite a lot of external circuits

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.400 
need quite a lot of external circuits
you're<00:02:02.850> talking<00:02:03.300> easily<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:04.229> an

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
you're talking easily about an

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.890 
you're talking easily about an
application<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.040> takes<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.520> 5200<00:02:06.360> components

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
application that takes a 5200 components

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.320 
application that takes a 5200 components
also<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.650> this<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.580> now<00:02:08.820> we<00:02:08.880> suddenly

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
also for this and now we suddenly

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.020 
also for this and now we suddenly
reduced<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.110> only<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.830> ten<00:02:11.370> commands

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
reduced it to only like ten commands

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.510 
reduced it to only like ten commands
and<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.840> smaller<00:02:14.140> form<00:02:14.590> factor<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.370> more

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
and the smaller form factor the more

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.550 
and the smaller form factor the more
freedom<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.910> have<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.510> course<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> design<00:02:17.290> or

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
freedom you have of course to design or

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.540 
freedom you have of course to design or
one<00:02:17.710> started<00:02:18.190> at<00:02:18.310> school<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:19.420> education<00:02:20.550> so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
one started at school and education so

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.550 
one started at school and education so
you<00:02:21.610> put<00:02:21.850> all<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.240> in<00:02:22.480> here<00:02:22.720> yeah<00:02:23.080> well<00:02:23.440> this

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
you put all this in here yeah well this

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.160 
you put all this in here yeah well this
is<00:02:23.710> a<00:02:23.740> three<00:02:23.980> car<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:24.790> say<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.630> this

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
is a three car one but say this this

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.060 
is a three car one but say this this
whole<00:02:26.470> chain<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.160> control<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.240> driver<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
whole chain of control of driver and the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.430 
whole chain of control of driver and the
end<00:02:30.220> stages<00:02:30.490> all<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.990> put<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.290> there

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
end stages all of this is put in there

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.250 
end stages all of this is put in there
and<00:02:33.340> if<00:02:33.700> we<00:02:33.760> put<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.330> there<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.080> we<00:02:35.230> can

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
and if we put it in there and we can

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.949 
and if we put it in there and we can
also<00:02:35.500> reach<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:36.540> less<00:02:37.540> than<00:02:37.750> two<00:02:37.870> minutes

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
also reach is less than two minutes

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.800 
also reach is less than two minutes
because<00:02:38.890> what<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.310> don't<00:02:39.490> want<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:40.630> this

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
because what you don't want if this

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.570 
because what you don't want if this
thing<00:02:41.050> is<00:02:41.560> transmitting<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.160> field<00:02:42.370> and

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
thing is transmitting a field and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.060 
thing is transmitting a field and
there's<00:02:42.850> no<00:02:43.060> Hansard<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.680> don't<00:02:44.890> want

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
there's no Hansard on it you don't want

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.449 
there's no Hansard on it you don't want
to<00:02:45.280> consume<00:02:45.610> any<00:02:45.700> power<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:47.080> 2<00:02:47.709> milli<00:02:48.040> watt<00:02:48.250> is

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
to consume any power so 2 milli watt is

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.010 
to consume any power so 2 milli watt is
to<00:02:48.610> go<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> gym<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.270> that's<00:02:49.420> much<00:02:49.810> lower

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
to go to the gym but that's much lower

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.220 
to go to the gym but that's much lower
than<00:02:50.260> before<00:02:50.380> well<00:02:51.310> what<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.660> solution<00:02:52.660> will<00:02:53.200> be

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
than before well what a solution will be

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.440 
than before well what a solution will be
it's<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.800> 50<00:02:54.190> 200<00:02:54.340> milli<00:02:54.910> watts

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
it's a 50 200 milli watts

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.330 
it's a 50 200 milli watts
if<00:02:55.780> there<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.110> no<00:02:56.350> device<00:02:56.739> based<00:02:57.100> on<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
if there is no device based on the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.240 
if there is no device based on the
charge<00:02:57.550> that's<00:02:57.760> what<00:02:57.970> other<00:02:58.480> competitors<00:02:59.080> do

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
charge that's what other competitors do

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.680 
charge that's what other competitors do
yeah<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.370> have<00:03:00.489> too<00:03:00.640> many<00:03:00.790> ways<00:03:01.030> well<00:03:01.510> that's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
yeah you have too many ways well that's

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.140 
yeah you have too many ways well that's
a<00:03:01.810> 2<00:03:01.930> meter<00:03:02.080> or<00:03:02.230> less<00:03:02.290> than<00:03:02.590> 2<00:03:02.739> yeah<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
a 2 meter or less than 2 yeah so the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.240 
a 2 meter or less than 2 yeah so the
idea<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.410> people<00:03:05.470> need<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.130> have

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
idea is that people need to have

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.460 
idea is that people need to have
wireless<00:03:06.820> chargers<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.780> living<00:03:08.050> room<00:03:08.260> and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
wireless chargers in the living room and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.500 
wireless chargers in the living room and
the<00:03:08.560> bedroom<00:03:08.770> and<00:03:09.280> everywhere<00:03:09.670> right<00:03:09.850> yeah

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
the bedroom and everywhere right yeah

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.750 
the bedroom and everywhere right yeah
yeah<00:03:10.720> that's<00:03:10.870> gonna<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.140> affordable<00:03:12.010> yeah

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
yeah that's gonna be affordable yeah

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760 
yeah that's gonna be affordable yeah
yeah<00:03:13.120> because<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.690> really<00:03:14.170> want<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.470> drive

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
yeah because you really want to drive

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.729 
yeah because you really want to drive
down<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.640> application<00:03:15.760> cost<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.200> by

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
down the application cost of this by

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.560 
down the application cost of this by
doing<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:18.070> high<00:03:18.220> level<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.580> integration<00:03:18.820> but

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
doing a high level of integration but

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.660 
doing a high level of integration but
also<00:03:19.630> provide<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> very<00:03:20.920> good<00:03:21.040> functionality

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
also provide a very good functionality

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.370 
also provide a very good functionality
you<00:03:21.820> don't<00:03:22.060> want<00:03:22.360> all<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.989> these<00:03:23.140> charges

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
you don't want all of these charges

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.180 
you don't want all of these charges
lying<00:03:23.739> around

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190

so<00:03:41.560> still<00:03:41.829> in<00:03:42.100> those<00:03:42.360> million

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
so still in those million

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.930 
so still in those million
what<00:03:44.270> is<00:03:44.420> included<00:03:45.050> is<00:03:45.680> actually<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.160> two

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
what is included is actually the two

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.699 
what is included is actually the two
detector<00:03:47.540> laws<00:03:47.750> if<00:03:48.110> there<00:03:48.319> is<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.440> device

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
detector laws if there is a device

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.259 
detector laws if there is a device
placed<00:03:48.950> on<00:03:49.129> there<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.640> thing<00:03:49.849> is<00:03:50.030> fully

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
placed on there so the thing is fully

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.570 
placed on there so the thing is fully
operational<00:03:50.739> detect<00:03:51.739> any<00:03:51.890> events<00:03:52.250> at<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.400> space

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
operational detect any events at a space

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.550 
operational detect any events at a space
on<00:03:52.760> day<00:03:52.879> and<00:03:53.030> start<00:03:53.239> charging<00:03:53.629> high<00:03:54.080> are<00:03:54.500> you

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
on day and start charging high are you

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.440 
on day and start charging high are you
thinking<00:03:55.459> about<00:03:55.519> maybe<00:03:55.849> somebody's<00:03:56.269> in<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
thinking about maybe somebody's in the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.030 
thinking about maybe somebody's in the
future<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.870> even<00:03:57.110> get<00:03:57.230> at<00:03:57.349> that<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.709> down<00:03:57.920> to

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
future to even get at that to down to

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.000 
future to even get at that to down to
really<00:03:58.340> zero<00:03:58.550> zero<00:03:58.849> somehow<00:03:59.480> yeah<00:03:59.780> yeah<00:04:00.170> here

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
really zero zero somehow yeah yeah here

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.680 
really zero zero somehow yeah yeah here
you<00:04:01.160> have<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.310> navigation<00:04:01.580> which<00:04:02.239> actually

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
you have a navigation which actually

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.420 
you have a navigation which actually
already<00:04:03.319> brings<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.739> down<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.890> zero<00:04:04.250> because

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
already brings it down to zero because

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.660 
already brings it down to zero because
here<00:04:04.910> we<00:04:05.480> had<00:04:05.599> an<00:04:05.780> acetal<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:07.250> nice<00:04:07.430> thing

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
here we had an acetal and the nice thing

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.420 
here we had an acetal and the nice thing
about<00:04:07.730> adding<00:04:08.150> an<00:04:08.330> a/c<00:04:08.630> is<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.830> handset

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
about adding an a/c is that a handset

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.729 
about adding an a/c is that a handset
which<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.760> equipped<00:04:11.120> with<00:04:11.390> ever<00:04:11.690> seen<00:04:11.930> we<00:04:12.560> can

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
which is equipped with ever seen we can

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.309 
which is equipped with ever seen we can
place<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.129> on<00:04:13.250> there<00:04:13.400> just<00:04:13.819> look<00:04:13.970> at<00:04:14.090> here

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
place it on there just look at here

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.150 
place it on there just look at here
there's<00:04:15.319> really<00:04:15.590> zero<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.590> if<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.889> put<00:04:19.070> the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
there's really zero so if you put the

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.300 
there's really zero so if you put the
handset<00:04:19.579> on<00:04:19.790> there<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:23.740> instead<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.860> first<00:04:25.160> of

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
handset on there and instead it first of

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.240 
handset on there and instead it first of
all<00:04:25.400> selects<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.970> coil<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.040> South

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
all selects the coil and the South

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.580 
all selects the coil and the South
Pacific<00:04:28.430> Power

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
Pacific Power

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.290 
Pacific Power
if<00:04:30.590> we<00:04:30.740> move<00:04:30.919> around<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.760> will<00:04:31.970> select<00:04:32.210> a

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
if we move around it will select a

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.670 
if we move around it will select a
different<00:04:32.450> point<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:33.229> will<00:04:33.350> see<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.560> light

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
different point you will see the light

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.350 
different point you will see the light
going<00:04:33.889> there<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:34.460> yes<00:04:34.610> some<00:04:34.850> more<00:04:35.000> position

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
going there so yes some more position

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.490 
going there so yes some more position
freedom<00:04:37.150> but<00:04:38.150> by<00:04:38.270> adding<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:38.630> NFC<00:04:39.080> actually

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
freedom but by adding the NFC actually

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.530 
freedom but by adding the NFC actually
the<00:04:39.620> NFC<00:04:40.040> component<00:04:40.580> which<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.850> very<00:04:41.210> tiny

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
the NFC component which is a very tiny

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.450 
the NFC component which is a very tiny
chip<00:04:41.900> on<00:04:42.080> their<00:04:42.260> wakes<00:04:42.950> up<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.340> application

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
chip on their wakes up the application

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.810 
chip on their wakes up the application
and<00:04:44.180> then<00:04:44.479> it<00:04:44.600> starts<00:04:44.870> traveling<00:04:45.460> so<00:04:46.460> actually

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
and then it starts traveling so actually

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.480 
and then it starts traveling so actually
the<00:04:46.910> handset<00:04:47.500> will<00:04:48.500> activate<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.130> charge<00:04:49.340> of

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
the handset will activate the charge of

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.159 
the handset will activate the charge of
the<00:04:49.550> service<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.330> will<00:04:50.360> be<00:04:50.539> totally<00:04:51.080> off

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
the service and it will be totally off

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.080 
the service and it will be totally off
otherwise<00:04:51.560> look<00:04:52.250> at<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:55.430> this<00:04:55.760> solution

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
otherwise look at it is this solution

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.460 
otherwise look at it is this solution
something<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:56.630> can<00:04:56.780> do<00:04:56.870> in<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:57.020> small<00:04:57.110> one<00:04:57.350> also

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
something you can do in a small one also

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.120 
something you can do in a small one also
yeah<00:04:58.300> adding<00:04:59.300> adding<00:04:59.539> NFC<00:05:00.080> can<00:05:00.620> be<00:05:00.770> done<00:05:00.919> with

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
yeah adding adding NFC can be done with

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.920 
yeah adding adding NFC can be done with
oh<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.520> XP<00:05:01.729> water<00:05:01.910> shortages<00:05:02.479> but<00:05:02.690> then<00:05:02.840> you

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
oh and XP water shortages but then you

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.580 
oh and XP water shortages but then you
just<00:05:03.110> need<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.350> add<00:05:03.530> something<00:05:04.100> yeah<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.970> is

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
just need to add something yeah it is

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.840 
just need to add something yeah it is
right<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.710> zoom<00:05:06.860> in<00:05:07.010> pricing<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.580> see<00:05:07.760> if

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
right to zoom in pricing to see if

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.550 
right to zoom in pricing to see if
that's<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.450> animation<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.139> don't<00:05:09.320> think<00:05:09.470> my

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
that's the animation I don't think my

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.520 
that's the animation I don't think my
camera<00:05:09.740> can<00:05:10.039> focus<00:05:10.190> and
