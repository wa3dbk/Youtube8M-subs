off-camera<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.430> soon<00:03:15.709> girls<00:03:16.709> have<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.010> look

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
off-camera but soon girls have to look

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.089 
off-camera but soon girls have to look
our<00:03:17.340> best<00:03:17.629> is<00:03:18.629> that<00:03:18.900> why<00:03:19.049> she's<00:03:19.349> dressed<00:03:19.950> up

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
our best is that why she's dressed up

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:29.820 
our best is that why she's dressed up
that<00:03:20.310> way<00:03:25.670> hmm

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.980 

my<00:03:30.370> mother<00:03:30.610> it's<00:03:31.390> kind<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.750> obvious<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:34.690> this

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
my mother it's kind of obvious in this

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.510 
my mother it's kind of obvious in this
but<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.590> made<00:03:35.740> for<00:03:35.770> good<00:03:36.160> trailer<00:03:36.880> footage

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
but it made for good trailer footage

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.770 
but it made for good trailer footage
you'll<00:03:39.520> often<00:03:39.730> see<00:03:39.910> these<00:03:40.180> sort<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.480> things

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.220 

man<00:03:43.780> your<00:03:43.990> alarm<00:03:44.200> fuck<00:03:44.440> fuck<00:03:44.800> oh<00:03:46.050> by<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.080> way

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
man your alarm fuck fuck oh by the way

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.960 
man your alarm fuck fuck oh by the way
that's<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.530> gecko<00:03:47.800> alarm<00:03:48.400> clock<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:49.090> believe

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
that's a gecko alarm clock I believe

00:03:50.970 --> 00:04:02.640 
that's a gecko alarm clock I believe
they're<00:03:52.650> done<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:59.560> course<00:04:00.570> we<00:04:01.570> did<00:04:01.990> a<00:04:02.020> great
