conditioner<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.160> really<00:00:26.550> runny<00:00:27.119> sort<00:00:27.599> of

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
conditioner it's a really runny sort of

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.620 
conditioner it's a really runny sort of
consistency<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.890> didn't<00:00:29.880> find<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> gave

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
consistency I didn't find that it gave

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.139 
consistency I didn't find that it gave
me<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> lot<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> slip<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> did<00:00:32.579> soften<00:00:32.880> my

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
hair on contact so I guess that's why

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.639 
hair on contact so I guess that's why
it's<00:00:35.340> considered<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:36.030> detangler<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> went

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it's considered a detangler so I went

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
it's considered a detangler so I went
ahead<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.890> used<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> moisturize<00:00:39.030> my

as you can see I sort of followed like a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.780

my head and branching out
so<00:03:32.069> I<00:03:32.130> used<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.819> satin<00:03:33.540> scarf<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.190> tied<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.310> up

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980
