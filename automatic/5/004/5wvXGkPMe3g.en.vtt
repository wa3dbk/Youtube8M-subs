00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.230 
closure procedure by compa site first we
have<00:00:14.630> to<00:00:15.630> measure<00:00:16.100> or<00:00:17.100> determine<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.060> width

have to measure or determine the width
of<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> teeth<00:00:18.869> then<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.250> make

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
of the teeth then we have to make

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.160 
of the teeth then we have to make
polishing<00:00:22.199> very<00:00:22.500> well<00:00:23.449> to<00:00:24.449> use<00:00:24.689> shade

many patients are seeking a conservative

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.880 
many patients are seeking a conservative
way<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.800> closing<00:00:44.550> their<00:00:44.910> diastema<00:00:45.800> that's<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
way and closing their diastema that's a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.850 
way and closing their diastema that's a
good<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:49.820> then<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:50.970> wash<00:00:51.180> thoroughly<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.500> air

dry<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.300> check<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:55.260> teeth<00:00:55.650> are

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
dry we have to check that the teeth are

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.020 
dry we have to check that the teeth are
or<00:00:56.820> having<00:00:57.510> chalky<00:00:58.019> appearance<00:00:58.640> then<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.850> are

scalpel to adjust the impatiens and then

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.630 
scalpel to adjust the impatiens and then
using<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.390> abrasive<00:02:29.020> vapors<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.400> course

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
using the abrasive vapors to the course

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.640 
using the abrasive vapors to the course
identifying<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:33.060> adjust<00:02:34.060> their<00:02:34.420> tooth<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
identifying to adjust their tooth the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.070 
identifying to adjust their tooth the
the<00:02:35.920> same<00:02:36.160> will<00:02:36.340> be<00:02:36.670> done<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.210> same<00:02:37.450> but

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the same will be done in the same but

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.190 
the same will be done in the same but
not<00:02:38.530> as<00:02:38.650> something<00:02:38.890> we<00:02:39.610> use<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> clear<00:02:40.480> band<00:02:40.750> to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
not as something we use a clear band to

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.220 
not as something we use a clear band to
separate<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.980> say<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.820> two<00:02:43.000> teeth

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
separate the say that the two teeth

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.160 
separate the say that the two teeth
finally<00:02:44.230> we<00:02:44.350> check<00:02:44.380> for<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.220> bite<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:46.170> we

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
finally we check for the bite and we

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.480 
finally we check for the bite and we
have<00:02:47.320> final<00:02:47.680> check<00:02:47.980> on<00:02:48.190> contour<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:50.490> shape

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
have final check on contour and shape

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.790 
have final check on contour and shape
and<00:02:52.470> that's<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:54.460> teeth<00:02:54.820> after<00:02:55.470> clothing<00:02:56.470> that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
and that's the teeth after clothing that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.870 
and that's the teeth after clothing that
I<00:02:56.950> estimate

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.350 

actually<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> don't<00:03:04.990> like<00:03:05.230> using<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:06.070> rubber<00:03:07.000> Dam

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
actually I don't like using a rubber Dam

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.360 
actually I don't like using a rubber Dam
and<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.810> such<00:03:08.050> case

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.160 

isolation<00:03:12.370> was<00:03:14.880> cotton<00:03:15.880> rolls<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.420> prefer<00:03:16.990> it

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
isolation was cotton rolls I prefer it

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.820 
isolation was cotton rolls I prefer it
actually<00:03:18.780> flossing<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:20.140> check<00:03:20.380> for<00:03:20.590> any

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
actually flossing to check for any

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.730 
actually flossing to check for any
roughness<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:23.550> mandatory

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
roughness is mandatory

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.040 
roughness is mandatory
checking<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.830> bite
