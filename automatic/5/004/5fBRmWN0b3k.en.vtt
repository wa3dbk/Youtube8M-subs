00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello everyone connected to Dmitry Balakin 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.170
 This short video I will tell you how 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.389
 get rid of ad viruses 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.219
 yesterday i ran into this problem and i 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.110
 quickly got rid of advertising 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.360
 viruses because more than once 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 had to deal with this I decided 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.060
 why not record a video for your 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.710
 dear subscribers so let me 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.699
 I'll show you how they look 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.590
 this is how ad viruses look like 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:37.200
 which site we would not go to this 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.969
 In case I made a screenshot on Yandex 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.360
 I jumped out on Yandex like this 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.940
 rubbish 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.250
 I'll show you how to get rid of it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.680
 if you have this problem if not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.690
 such a problem then when it arises you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.360
 can always refer to this video 1 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.640
 way i will show you 5 ways first 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.340
 way this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 removal of these parasites using 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 ATF Cleaner version 41 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 the latest version is such an anti worm 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.470
 the program does not require installation all that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 you need to double click on 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.740
 program and run and here we see 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.200
 loading database interface given 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.350
 the program is intuitive all that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.030
 you need to click on the button to scan 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.540
 wait for the scan to complete and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 press the clear button after this 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.829
 You will be prompted to restart the program. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.470
 computer you restart the computer 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.640
 if the program did not offer you 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.270
 restart the computer you 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.200
 reboot it manually start 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 restart the computer and so on 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.430
 close the program the second way if 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.259
 suddenly somehow problems are not 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.770
 Then it means the matter in plugins 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.070
 Browser I'll show you all three 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.290
 browsers how to remove these malicious 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.740
 plugins in this case I had 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.409
 such a problem on the firefox model in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.030
 top right click here on 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.500
 badge 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.080
 tab add-ons open and here 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.180
 look we remove the harm from here but 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.540
 on and plugins that we did not install 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.880
 and do not know what it is in this case 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.900
 here are two default plugins and 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.970
 my one which I installed and how with 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.370
 I happened here stood 2 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.710
 installed plugin which i am not 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.690
 installed this malicious plugins they 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.790
 can be set automatically when 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.950
 go to some website left and so 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.850
 further, that is, you know this of course not 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.970
 you can but if such a problem arises 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.690
 disable these plugins by disabling 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.400
 remove if you suddenly doubt 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.620
 malicious summer plugin or not just 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.700
 check first click off 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.490
 plugin and if the problem is solved then it means 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.740
 this is malicious plugins if not 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.630
 if viruses are advertising 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.410
 viral ad viruses will 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.600
 show up until then that means it is not 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.040
 the one plugin you disabled is looking for 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.860
 further on the example of google chrome exactly 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.180
 also upper right corner 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.610
 go to the settings in the extension and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.239
 also disable the plugin that we do not 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:31.500
 need a tick remove check and 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.150
 we delete on an example an opera browser here 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.769
 in the upper left corner we click on 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.050
 badge 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:42.330
 opera on the logo tab extension 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.820
 open and in the same way 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.060
 remove all extensions all plugins 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.870
 which are malicious in my case here 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.220
 no plugins installed 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.750
 next way last 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.200
 it if suddenly the program is installed on 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.790
 your computer is certainly well on 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.160
 for some reason the spot worm does not 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.410
 discovered and this you manually watch 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.110
 here in the installer uninstall installation 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.230
 programs and delete the program which 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.709
 you personally don't know what it is and you don't 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.290
 installed but do not rush to remove 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.030
 because first check what it is 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.100
 In general, there may be some kind of program. 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.860
 update it or something else you do not 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.020
 you know you donâ€™t always need to delete what 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.909
 don't know better search first in 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.919
 Internet information but always need 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.930
 know what is installed on your 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.599
 computer 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.389
 definitely these are the five ways 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:42.509
 help you get rid of this crap and 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.599
 Lastly, I will give you a simple but very 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.969
 practical advice when you download 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.819
 some software to my computer 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.740
 some programs are free and then 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.349
 firstly know from which sites 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.110
 download and secondly that's actually 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.300
 saying and so this advice after 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.550
 you install the program that is 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.750
 run the installation file 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.990
 installer to 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.259
 you will be prompted to press a button 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.719
 further further further and the installation will go 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.539
 hurry take the time to press the button 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:17.699
 continue to follow and read carefully not 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.909
 installed or somewhere extra 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.610
 ticks and as soon as you clear these 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.349
 additional checkboxes already malicious 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.050
 software will not 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.870
 installed on your computer and 2 5 we 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.889
 just we can not see these ticks 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.129
 set by 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.129
 and thereby letting these viruses into our 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.900
 computer that's all 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:43.800
 be careful I wish you success 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.759
 have a nice day or evening and before communication 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.759
 Thanks for attention
