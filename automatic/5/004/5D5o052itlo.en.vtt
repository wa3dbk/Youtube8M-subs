whether it's on a lookbook video or a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.010 
whether it's on a lookbook video or a
try<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.789> haul<00:00:18.150> video<00:00:18.480> where<00:00:18.630> I'm<00:00:18.690> showing<00:00:18.840> my

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
try on haul video where I'm showing my

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.140 
try on haul video where I'm showing my
body<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.619> people<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.340> always<00:00:20.580> telling<00:00:20.910> me

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
body in it people are always telling me

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.820 
body in it people are always telling me
even<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.480> person<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> should<00:00:22.650> try

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
even in person that I should try

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.849 
even in person that I should try
modeling<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.900> figured<00:00:25.410> let<00:00:25.590> me<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> little

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
modeling so I figured let me do a little

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.920 
modeling so I figured let me do a little
bit<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.130> research<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.699> YouTube<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.539> then<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
bit of research on YouTube and then I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.960 
bit of research on YouTube and then I
came<00:00:28.289> across<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.769> Megan<00:00:29.220> Parkins<00:00:29.580> videos

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
came across one of Megan Parkins videos

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.630 
came across one of Megan Parkins videos
Megan<00:00:30.390> hurts<00:00:30.539> makeup<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.109> she<00:00:31.710> works<00:00:32.309> with

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
Megan hurts makeup and she works with

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.220 
Megan hurts makeup and she works with
like<00:00:32.880> explore<00:00:33.329> modeling<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
like explore modeling and it's like a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.510 
like explore modeling and it's like a
website<00:00:34.770> where<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.160> sign<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.370> for

website where you can sign up for

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
website where you can sign up for
castings<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.390> stuff<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.809> vote<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.079> you

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and you have the chance to be like their

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.869 
and you have the chance to be like their
cover<00:00:39.180> model<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> thought<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.280> could<00:00:41.340> sign

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
cover model so I thought if I could sign

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
cover model so I thought if I could sign
up<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> entered<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.290> guess<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
up for so I entered and I guess what you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.170 
up for so I entered and I guess what you
do<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.219> votes<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
do do is get votes and that's how you

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
do do is get votes and that's how you
determine<00:00:45.570> whether<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.170> win<00:00:46.350> or<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
determine whether you win or not and the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.069 
determine whether you win or not and the
girl<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> number<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.329> position<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
girl that's at the number one position I

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
girl that's at the number one position I
think<00:00:49.860> she<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.840> 1800<00:00:51.840> votes<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.489> 1800<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.640> I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
think she is at 1800 votes so 1800 and I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.760 
think she is at 1800 votes so 1800 and I
have<00:00:53.850> 42,000<00:00:54.690> subscribers<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.559> thought

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
have 42,000 subscribers so I thought

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
have 42,000 subscribers so I thought
about<00:00:55.980> least<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.340> few<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> went<00:00:56.969> over<00:00:57.210> there

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
about least a few of you went over there

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.420 
about least a few of you went over there
and<00:00:57.390> voted<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.410> me<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.770> would<00:00:58.920> definitely

want<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> try<00:01:01.500> modeling<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:02.750> I've<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:04.019> been

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
want to try modeling out I've just been

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.660 
want to try modeling out I've just been
too<00:01:04.379> afraid<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.460> some<00:01:05.610> reason

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
too afraid to do it for some reason

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.310 
too afraid to do it for some reason
because<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.330> felt<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.689> maybe<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.020> wouldn't

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
because I felt like maybe I wouldn't

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.630 
because I felt like maybe I wouldn't
make<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.950> maybe<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.340> wouldn't<00:01:08.549> be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
make it or maybe it wouldn't be

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550 
make it or maybe it wouldn't be
something<00:01:08.850> I'd<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.170> explore

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
something I'd like to do but explore

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.230 
something I'd like to do but explore
modeling<00:01:10.979> gives<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.280> chance<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.640> every<00:01:11.970> single

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
modeling gives a chance to every single

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.660 
modeling gives a chance to every single
girl<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.540> any<00:01:12.750> size<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.920> definitely<00:01:14.490> try

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
girl of any size to definitely try

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
girl of any size to definitely try
modeling<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> thought<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
modeling so I thought this would be a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
modeling so I thought this would be a
cool<00:01:16.259> opportunity<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.430> my<00:01:17.580> foot<00:01:17.790> in

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
cool opportunity just to get my foot in

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.640 
cool opportunity just to get my foot in
the<00:01:18.000> door<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.540> possibly<00:01:19.200> want<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> go

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the door if I do possibly want to go

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170 
the door if I do possibly want to go
through<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.130> modeling<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.729> try<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
through with modeling and try it in the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
through with modeling and try it in the
future<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.470> guys<00:01:22.590> could<00:01:22.799> vote<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.040> me
