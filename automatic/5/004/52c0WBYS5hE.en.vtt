 this game make you more magical night 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.970
 but we are doing a video 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.950
 recovering from youtube videos are 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.990
 a real magician stains a serious game 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.790
 I still don't know why I 'm hot 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.440
 view I take a black house is up to 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.270
 real flowers indeed has number dress 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.270
 look at doing this though 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.790
 it was the right one 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.780
 we will be able to do something so small lot 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.670
 of flowers also what your number is 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.390
 there is no stage in the existing world 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.950
 with this number we take note of 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.560
 flowers that I put in the middle of the bouquet 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.510
 because half of when bachelors fingers 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.130
 all 8 rooms pass through all of them 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.470
 the cards with us 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.050
 certainly all that number maybe written 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.430
 obviously the cards are all different 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.960
 certainties is unique as they all do 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.760
 the voices find ourselves reviewing that comes 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.420
 now the weather is so I put 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.530
 it is not over see careful when snapping 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.500
 passes 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.600
 arrives 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.580
 you can do it too if you want to factory but 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.390
 there is never so it raises mid-March more 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.210
 or less than half of what you want done above 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.510
 parity 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.690
 I got it 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.690
 I 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.610
 now it must be sold in the real one concerns 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.530
 eight of flowers like that 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.530
 pushing it yourself in 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.800

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.410

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.890
 it's this one 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.890
 really 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.700
 let's put it this way 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.230
 3 to 10 flowers 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.779
 runs 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.020
 I am 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.669
 thanks to that fact 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.110
 no nothing was because we are doing a 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.699
 stupid video and therefore have to burn 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.379
 people in a strange way and then do them 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.729
 catch a hot one to see the sentences 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.159
 that works to those that don't work 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.169
 he is recovering from nothing i have to 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.590
 to do before that is that he won the fifth 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.409
 high school 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.919
 so I graduate nothing you see again 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.919
