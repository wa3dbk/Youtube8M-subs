00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 and good to everyone here smells recommending 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 and I'm in the first episode of our 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.050
 map guide we are with the peace of 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.000
 slums and I'll show you where it is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.799
 defeated at the start of the games as 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 get easy casualties how to avoid that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.150
 people lock us in putting 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.859
 singles that are super complicated to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.119
 kill them well all this we can 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.949
 try to solve it in all these 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.420
 episodes of that map but we see more 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 small ones removing the knock down map 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.289
 and good is put under basically 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.269
 look for stress from a private game 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.430
 but just so you can see how it goes 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.140
 to work the thing and for you to see 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.219
 put if you have the letters just to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.960
 the right of this column that you are 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.300
 seeing here we have the grenade and we are going to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.500
 always get easy low to 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.820
 start of each game no longer only 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.950
 search and destroy but in practically 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.329
 any game mode you imagine starting 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.430
 the game let's wait the seconds of 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 principle that we have to wait for 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.610
 just be able to throw our donated 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.160
 and you know that's where all the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
 world is simply as I say low 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.420
 easy if you have not set a game 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 private in search and describe and I went 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.960
 killing Alex there all the time 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.129
 from guinea pig 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.750
 but good just so you can see 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.159
 where they serve the days this is the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.970
 first of all that there is not pulled 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.950
 is for another 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.020
 and just this is what you are seeing 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.660
 there to the left of that lantern 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.280
 we throw and go there just the same 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.350
 site if we go on the right side 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.790
 left or they have already punctured us by side 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.320
 left so today we are going to go try for 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.560
 another side and how are you seeing 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.690
 just throws himself there and bounces and here 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.100
 exactly where the world moves 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.440
 behind these wheels where everything is put 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.580
 the world to wait to see if they get 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.170
 hook someone because we 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.310
 we can also do it later how 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.630
 do it the other way around because we have to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.100
 put by the side of the bell tower game 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.500
 you just take this angle as 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 you are seeing there you are seeing there that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.869
 year is the perfect and right alice of the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.520
 sheet that was out there goes just the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.869
 day if you do not have too much before 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.700
 I've told you before the diet 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.350
 too soon, obviously not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 comes to the people in time still to 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.000
 put yourself there but if you see the grenade 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.490
 revolt behind and everyone who is 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.500
 in that area they practically kill 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.720
 them so good is something that is going to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.759
 come pretty good but then another side 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.259
 it's this that once scenes that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.790
 they were locking up that is 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.860
 always changing to the other side and others 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.390
 well look just throw from there 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.280
 there is no trick just when 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.960
 CALCULASE above cables 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.850
 light a little before 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.120
 above the satellite dish and the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.350
 channel plus and just above you see 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.640
 that will bounce on the wall and everything 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.230
 world that is behind they kill it is and is 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.880
 seek to destroy even better because you can 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.080
 cover the pump if you have raised 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.820
 you can make sure that there is no 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.650
 nobody there nearby even pulling grenades 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.570
 stunners that also works but the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
 best of all that is this grenade 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.110
 imagine this in domain just for 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.300
 the right of what has been the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.190
 satellite dish and where will fall grenade 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.170
 this in domain well this one the doubles 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.760
 triples even get to kill four 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.110
 at the same time in simple land war 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.460
 pulling the frog from here at the moment 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.230
 that change the answer we have for the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.480
 right of the boat for the ball 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.160
 even here in this repetition you see that 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.290
 she stays a little stuck in the texas 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.970
 and it's not just always there and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.130
 you can start the kill in a way 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.790
 exaggerated this is one of the areas of 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.900
 vision where then just kill the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.940
 people who are in the center of the map 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.770
 where they always tend to be 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.240
 about all game modes as a 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.310
 domain where the flag should and should be 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.710
 puts people around this statue os 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.960
 you can put there and click or kill 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.700
 all those who remove and take away 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.000
 remains to all those who are giving 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.260
 we take the backup from another point to 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.580
 all those people 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.349
 camping in the area above 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.730
 just from the square for killing them 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.430
 from here as you are seeing if there is 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.470
 someone we can see also later see 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.700
 from another time it's the other side even 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.829
 just start as you are seeing that 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.180
 a lot of people get there, they play it and 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.769
 others for game moments as you search 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.690
 destroy but mostly for modes of 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.640
 normal game we have that you see that you 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.560
 they kill 2 and 3 and 4 times people who are there 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.360
 up well you have found killed 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.920
 lots of people from above and you see 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.750
 all these sites in which we can 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.970
 even get to kill them without 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.970
 practically he finds out he 's super 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.470
 super good and as I say is the area in 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.989
 which on this map you have to have 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.359
 let's say more controlled from the middle and a 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.260
 of the ways in which we have of 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.150
 catch and take away these people from the middle 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.069
 simply by eliminating people who are 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.440
 just in the area of ​​the statue that 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.659
 is where only the head of 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.099
 netflix and other means of killing 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.599
 also just in his life this 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.400
 oranges orange container points 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.540
 are the key in this game there are also 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.549
 two beige that we can see from the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.169
 sofa but nevertheless if we see ourselves here 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.549
 to the orange container you see 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.160
 we we will be able to see perfectly 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.260
 everyone and we will come super 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.760
 well even with an assault rifle does 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.070
 miss a sniper or anything 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.750
 also when we are in one against one 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.400
 2 against 1 that we are looking for and 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.450
 destroy a lot of people are put in the 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.000
 half simply to see where 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.130
 is about to pass the circulation because 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.800
 half country practically let's say that 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.150
 where it moves because everything moves and 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.830
 we can also see them even from 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150
 here as you are seeing just me 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.010
 despair the barrels that is where 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.210
 I was always waiting for someone 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.250
 we can see him out there 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.840
 hook as solar the head as 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.600
 clerk was watching there justly 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.520
 I fired and they can go out there and more give them 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.780
 a super simple way is going to be 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.040
 always waiting for us to go out for one 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.510
 from the sides next to the tires 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.820
 in the center, because if 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.740
 we can see we can kill him 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.900
 to people from there that comes super super 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.130
 super good because as I say is the area 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.040
 what else you have to have controlled in 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.890
 this map and then and finally it would be 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.330
 this grenade that I found leaving her 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.680
 just to the flag that is there 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.470
 from the middle our same flag 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.850
 there must be a good crack which we can 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.650
 throw it just a hairline that is left 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.270
 between the tree between a building and between 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.710
 another how is it going well here and 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.110
 just if we throw it a little more to 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.150
 the right of the church on the left 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.040
 of the tree we can strain there and avoid 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.170
 catch again so come super 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.520
 well and nothing I think that have resulted 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.530
 useful all tips 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.910
 who likes the video vote next 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.910
 all means
