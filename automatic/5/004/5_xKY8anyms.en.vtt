00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.590
 hi girls and guys welcome to this 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.890
 super one more time and as the title says 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.660
 of my video today I bring you an equal day 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 how to fix your gel eyeliners 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.130
 or in creams and once you have 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 dried them and these people that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 when something is hard for me, I like it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.029
 take advantage of it until the last thing yes I 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.520
 I think that it has no remedy for lemon 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:36.580
 so I have these 2 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.750
 eyeliner in angel does much more good 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.260
 you are watching this video but 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.520
 I really did not have any 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.290
 gel liner that was dry 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.379
 until today that I realized that this and 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.370
 this one was dry here I have a suÃ¡rez 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.309
 of each one the one on the left is the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.330
 mike and the one on the right is theirs 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.360
 so it still looks like the most this to your 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.070
 dry time because I have a lot and the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.690
 mistake that one commits is to open them all 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.040
 at the same time always I say you have to 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.520
 finish one first and then the other 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.520
 but see 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.750
 So what I'm going to do is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 What I do is when I dry this 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.870
 I put them in the microwave for 30 seconds 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.120
 if I see that it is still a bit hard 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.830
 I give it 30 more seconds until it 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.980
 completely melt this one I do not give a 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.770
 full minute like that because 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.140
 I do not like that he did not want me to 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.660
 will hurt so I prefer to do it from 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.980
 little by little to keep it a minute 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:48.190
 full ok so I'm going to put these 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.890
 two in the microwave and return though 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.470
 girls and guys I've already come back this way 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.110
 See that of Huiqui 6 And I made the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.780
 hand what is the switch to show you 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.360
 what is the before and the after and here 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.370
 is the fingers so you can see they look 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 like when they come there is obviously 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:11.410
 to be so that I'm with a 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.350
 tooth stick of this the mobile thing and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.170
 I only told him this 30 seconds to 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.800
 each one so come back to the hand the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.320
 the henna to the bottom 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.720
 the outline of Marc when he was 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:31.140
 dry and on the left side arribita of 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:34.470
 he already once again melted this and 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.170
 he took his what is his pigmentation a 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.720
 weapon and hers if they realize then to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.620
 Despite everything, it did not change much, but 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.480
 if the one on the right below is before me 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.550
 when I was dry sorry and up with 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.030
 thiago once I melted it again and so 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.950
 everything is basically the same this 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.430
 Then I took it out of the microwave 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.430
 let stand for 20 minutes 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.620
 so that he was aware of an environment 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.720
 and then yes 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.390
 that's one of the things that I do 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.310
 when my eyeliners are dried and how 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.220
 right now this I have several 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.810
 eyeliners especially there is one that is 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.670
 the most that I love and because I have 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.519
 these so I was willing to spend 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.110
 these first to later use that this 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.239
 another one of the little things is going to give you a tip 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.500
 more than I do another of the things that 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.750
 I do when I buy the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.110
 gel eyeliners yes I think I have 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.150
 more than one open those who buy new 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.000
 I do not farm them and what I do is the agreement 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.140
 in the fridge so I do it with the 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.910
 nail polish and the little things so 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.280
 they are like I did not make liquids that can be 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.319
 damage then with the temperature that is 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.450
 heat and so on 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.879
 me what not in the fridge because because 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.879
 cold the fridge keeps us so 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.200
 Well, I have several eyeliners in which 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.870
 they are still new but as 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.909
 they are in the fridge have not yet been damaged 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.290
 as I told them, the cold keeps them that way 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.760
 that, well, girls, I hope that I have 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.440
 liked the video any doubt or 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.870
