00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.190
 and so good this time I bring you 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.740
 this video where I show you the routine 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.290
 of makeup that I do for the purpose of 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.109
 week eye girls only is for the 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.970
 weekend because it's very loaded here 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.970
 it was not seen but before putting the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.130
 base I put a first to control my 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.130
 shine during the day or during the night 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.599
 this removes makeup almost always 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.760
 it's for the night that's when I go out 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.520
 what we are going to do is place our 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.370
 makeup and we're going to blur it very 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.440
 well all over our face we let that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.260
 dry our base and then we 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.050
 we put our concealer this 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.539
 will also serve as a separate illuminator 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.699
 to cover all our dark circles and 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.250
 our granites you know that I 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.199
 always blew my concealer with the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.220
 finger because I like the finish that I 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.010
 let 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.740
 then we will find everything very well with a 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.020
 Translucent powder I always use 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.600
 translucent because I love the effect 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.540
 that leaves me after we outline 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.390
 our face this helps us a lot 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.820
 yes that dialogue to take pictures because 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.140
 makes our face look 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.480
 completely different do the test 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.360
 and you will see that they will remember me 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.170
 Obviously the contour can not be missing 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.170
 in my nose 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.939
 now let's move on with something that never 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.189
 we can miss girls and it is to fill 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.799
 our eyebrow do not say that we mark it by 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.200
 complete no girls just follow the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.149
 natural way you have and give it a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.189
 little bit of color a little bit of life 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.020
 girls because I do not know if they come across the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.850
 eyebrows are the frame of our face 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.280
 changes completely when we 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.350
 we fix our eyebrows here only 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.259
 I'm removing a little bit the excess 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.420
 shade and then let's give it a 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.459
 little bit of life to our face I'm 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.590
 using the ticket pallet 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.990

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.430
