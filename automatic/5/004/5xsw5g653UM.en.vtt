hello this is how'd your band's jr. and
I'm<00:00:02.730> gonna<00:00:02.850> show<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.179> my<00:00:03.929> atomic<00:00:04.140> 70

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
I'm gonna show you my atomic 70

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.890 
I'm gonna show you my atomic 70
well<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:07.799> atomic<00:00:08.069> 70<00:00:08.630> as<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.750> can

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
well this is my atomic 70 as you can

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.450 
well this is my atomic 70 as you can
prove<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.170> thing<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.500> been<00:00:10.679> used<00:00:12.320> it's<00:00:13.460> the

prove this thing it's been used it's the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.990 
prove this thing it's been used it's the
camera<00:00:14.610> captures<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:15.540> filthy<00:00:16.049> dirty

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
camera captures it but it's filthy dirty

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.279 
camera captures it but it's filthy dirty
they've<00:00:18.000> had<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.359> clean<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.600> other<00:00:18.930> day<00:00:19.080> but

they've had to clean the other day but

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.420 
they've had to clean the other day but
every<00:00:19.560> night<00:00:19.740> since<00:00:19.949> then<00:00:20.130> um<00:00:22.039> yeah<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.250> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
every night since then um yeah it's a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.519 
every night since then um yeah it's a
nice<00:00:23.939> bike<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.539> sounds<00:00:24.900> good<00:00:25.050> I'll<00:00:25.199> start<00:00:25.470> it

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
nice bike it sounds good I'll start it

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.179 
nice bike it sounds good I'll start it
up<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.830> minute<00:00:27.080> as<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.500> probably<00:00:29.570> say

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
up in a minute as you can probably say

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.889 
up in a minute as you can probably say
yeah<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:34.770> atomic<00:00:35.360> which<00:00:36.360> I'm<00:00:36.570> pretty<00:00:36.719> sure

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
yeah the atomic which I'm pretty sure

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:45.970 
yeah the atomic which I'm pretty sure
it's<00:00:37.050> Japanese<00:00:37.980> bike<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:39.360> 70<00:00:39.899> say<00:00:40.079> stayed

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.619 

here<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:48.739> holds<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.070> fuel<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:51.300> doesn't

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
here the holds a bit of fuel it doesn't

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.500 
here the holds a bit of fuel it doesn't
use<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.739> Azoff<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.510> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
use that much up with Azoff that the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.639 
use that much up with Azoff that the
Penta<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.899> nice<00:00:55.590> easy<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.520> ride<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.699> bike

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
Penta is nice easy to ride like bike

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.950 
Penta is nice easy to ride like bike
there's<00:00:58.649> exhaust<00:00:59.960> sounds<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.579> as<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.789> can

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
there's exhaust sounds good as you can

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
there's exhaust sounds good as you can
point<00:01:03.960> out<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.379> let's<00:01:05.129> kickstart<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
point out to you let's kickstart and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.700 
point out to you let's kickstart and
electric<00:01:06.689> start<00:01:08.270> but<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:10.409> electric

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
electric start but that's how electric

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.710 
electric start but that's how electric
starts<00:01:11.040> easy<00:01:11.189> kickstart<00:01:11.820> works<00:01:12.000> well<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
starts easy kickstart works well when it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.100 
starts easy kickstart works well when it
has<00:01:12.869> been<00:01:13.020> warmed<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.729> um<00:01:16.040> okay<00:01:17.360> well<00:01:18.360> start<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
has been warmed up um okay well start it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
has been warmed up um okay well start it
up<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.350> space<00:01:21.320> oh<00:01:22.320> yeah<00:01:23.280> I'll<00:01:23.369> show<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
up a space oh yeah I'll show you the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.899 
up a space oh yeah I'll show you the
battery<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.619> small<00:01:25.950> filthy<00:01:26.490> battery<00:01:26.850> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
battery is it small filthy battery in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.819 
battery is it small filthy battery in
there<00:01:27.060> cuz<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.650> really

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
there cuz of my it's actually a really

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.160 
there cuz of my it's actually a really
good<00:01:28.950> spot<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.579> head<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> some<00:01:30.180> bikes<00:01:30.390> because

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
good spot can head to some bikes because

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.539 
good spot can head to some bikes because
some<00:01:31.470> bikes<00:01:31.650> put<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.159> room<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
some bikes put that much room there and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
some bikes put that much room there and
it<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:32.970> gets<00:01:33.150> fill<00:01:33.420> feet<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.750> right

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it just gets fill feet up just right

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
it just gets fill feet up just right
there<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.950> smart<00:01:38.520> where<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:38.939> put

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
there so it's the smart where they put

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.330 
there so it's the smart where they put
the<00:01:39.240> battery<00:01:39.509> oh<00:01:39.720> yeah<00:01:40.400> I'll<00:01:41.400> start<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> up

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.469 

started<00:01:49.340> up<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.549> have<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.759> put<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.000> can<00:01:50.180> and

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
started up you have to put the can and

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.889 
started up you have to put the can and
put<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.689> on<00:01:51.549> you<00:01:52.549> have<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.789> turn<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.090> fuel<00:01:53.360> on

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.100 

and<00:01:57.039> then<00:01:58.039> this<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.729> at<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.479> moment<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.899> box

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
and then this is at the moment the box

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.230 
and then this is at the moment the box
cold<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.689> take<00:02:02.689> a<00:02:02.720> bit<00:02:02.929> to<00:02:03.049> get<00:02:03.170> going<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
cold so take a bit to get going the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.609 
cold so take a bit to get going the
trick

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.440 

I'm<00:02:09.100> not<00:02:09.250> sure<00:02:09.429> if<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.610> can<00:02:09.759> say<00:02:10.000> very<00:02:10.209> well

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
I'm not sure if you can say very well

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.300 
I'm not sure if you can say very well
the<00:02:10.569> color<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.869> pretty<00:02:11.020> stuffy<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.760> just<00:02:13.060> here

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
the color is pretty stuffy is just here

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.949 
the color is pretty stuffy is just here
okay<00:02:15.310> start<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.209> up

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:48.670 

okay<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.459> we<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.930> lose<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.140> in

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680
