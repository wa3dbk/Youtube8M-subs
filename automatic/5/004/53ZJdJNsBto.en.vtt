00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
in time this digital journey that we're

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.420 
in time this digital journey that we're
on<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.790> changing<00:00:03.890> almost<00:00:04.890> everything<00:00:05.400> that

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
on is changing almost everything that

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.610 
on is changing almost everything that
we're<00:00:05.819> thinking<00:00:06.150> about<00:00:06.359> journalism<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:07.109> think

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
we're thinking about journalism I think

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.220 
we're thinking about journalism I think
we're<00:00:07.740> only<00:00:08.220> limited<00:00:08.730> by<00:00:08.760> our<00:00:09.230> imagination

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
we're only limited by our imagination

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.749 
we're only limited by our imagination
our<00:00:10.380> experience<00:00:10.950> at<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.099> moment<00:00:11.400> yeah<00:00:11.730> I

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
our experience at the moment yeah I

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.070 
our experience at the moment yeah I
think<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> guideline<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.480> renowned<00:00:12.809> as<00:00:12.960> an

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
think of the guideline is renowned as an

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.810 
think of the guideline is renowned as an
organization<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.650> takes<00:00:13.830> design<00:00:14.190> seriously

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
organization that takes design seriously

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.060 
organization that takes design seriously
and<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.240> course<00:00:15.570> design<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.379> not<00:00:16.410> just<00:00:16.920> about

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and of course design is not just about

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.730 
and of course design is not just about
what<00:00:17.730> things<00:00:18.029> look<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:19.170> about<00:00:19.320> how

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
what things look like it's about how

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.099 
what things look like it's about how
they<00:00:19.949> behave<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.330> how<00:00:21.420> they<00:00:21.600> function<00:00:21.810> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
they behave and how they function and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.529 
they behave and how they function and
how<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.260> use<00:00:22.560> them<00:00:25.699> when<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.849> started<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
how we use them when we started the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.230 
how we use them when we started the
Guardian<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> internet<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.939> 1997<00:00:29.939> we

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
Guardian on the internet in 1997 we

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.939 
Guardian on the internet in 1997 we
deliberately<00:00:30.720> created<00:00:31.199> something<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.560> was

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
deliberately created something that was

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.610 
deliberately created something that was
of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.759> internet<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.690> ripped<00:00:34.380> apart

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of the internet it was ripped apart

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.970 
of the internet it was ripped apart
rhythms<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> medium<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.290> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
rhythms of the medium and I think that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.830 
rhythms of the medium and I think that
original<00:00:38.579> decision<00:00:38.879> was<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.570> reasons

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
original decision was one of the reasons

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.260 
original decision was one of the reasons
why<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.020> Guardians<00:00:40.530> now<00:00:40.739> got<00:00:41.489> an<00:00:41.670> audience<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
why the Guardians now got an audience of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.790 
why the Guardians now got an audience of
nearly<00:00:42.480> 50<00:00:43.020> million<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> internet

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
nearly 50 million on the internet

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
nearly 50 million on the internet
because<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.700> appreciated<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
because we appreciated this was a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.240 
because we appreciated this was a
different<00:00:46.140> medium<00:00:46.260> we're<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> be

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
different medium we're not going to be

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.490 
different medium we're not going to be
scrambling<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.910> update<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> every<00:00:48.870> minute<00:00:49.140> or

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
scrambling to update it every minute or

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100 
scrambling to update it every minute or
every<00:00:49.530> hour<00:00:50.120> we<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
every hour we will do that on the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.439 
every hour we will do that on the
browser<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.129> browser<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.550> great<00:00:53.760> it'd<00:00:54.329> be

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
browser and the browser is great it'd be

searching for material this is going to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.619 
searching for material this is going to
be<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> different<00:00:59.699> kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> read<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.510> going

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
be a different kind of read it's going

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.170 
be a different kind of read it's going
to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.559> reflective<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.969> looked

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to be a bit more reflective so we looked

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.299 
to be a bit more reflective so we looked
at<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> beautiful<00:01:04.680> early

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
at some of the beautiful early

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.760 
at some of the beautiful early
experiments<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.060> people<00:01:06.540> did<00:01:06.810> as

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
experiments that people did as

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.620 
experiments that people did as
newspapers<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.939> iPad<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:11.570> they<00:01:12.570> were

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
newspapers on the iPad and they were

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.990 
newspapers on the iPad and they were
beautiful<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.830> were<00:01:13.970> kind<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
beautiful but they were kind of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.240 
beautiful but they were kind of
recreating<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.049> newspaper<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> iPad

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
recreating the newspaper on the iPad

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.820 
recreating the newspaper on the iPad
that<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> famous<00:01:18.270> great<00:01:18.540> i<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that the famous great i think the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.289 
that the famous great i think the
drawings<00:01:20.130> over<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.490> actually<00:01:20.670> say<00:01:21.119> we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
drawings over there actually say we

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.499 
drawings over there actually say we
could<00:01:21.720> always<00:01:21.960> take<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.619> did<00:01:22.770> too<00:01:23.509> well

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
could always take it out we did too well

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.520 
could always take it out we did too well
one<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> issues<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.229> were<00:01:25.290> grappling

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
one of the issues that we were grappling

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.050 
one of the issues that we were grappling
with<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:26.670> how<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> sense<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
with was how do you get that sense of a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
with was how do you get that sense of a
hierarchy<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.320> information<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.340> we're

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
hierarchy of information that we're

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.859 
hierarchy of information that we're
familiar<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.880> from<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> printed<00:01:33.509> newspaper

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
familiar with from a printed newspaper

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
familiar with from a printed newspaper
place<00:01:34.079> how<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.740> create<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.060> form

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
place how do we create that in a form

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.170 
place how do we create that in a form
that's<00:01:36.720> appropriate<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
that's appropriate to the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.080 
that's appropriate to the
we<00:01:38.750> just<00:01:38.930> came<00:01:39.110> up<00:01:39.170> with<00:01:39.410> this<00:01:39.500> idea<00:01:39.680> of<00:01:40.160> a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
we just came up with this idea of a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.420 
we just came up with this idea of a
simple<00:01:41.570> grid<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.740> stories<00:01:43.100> can<00:01:43.250> occupy

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
simple grid but the stories can occupy

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.280 
simple grid but the stories can occupy
one<00:01:43.760> cell<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.210> grid<00:01:44.540> or<00:01:44.720> two<00:01:44.870> cells<00:01:45.140> with

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
one cell of that grid or two cells with

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.900 
one cell of that grid or two cells with
a<00:01:45.380> grid<00:01:45.590> or<00:01:45.740> four<00:01:45.920> cells<00:01:46.160> of<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.400> grid<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.760> so<00:01:46.850> on

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
a grid or four cells of a grid and so on

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.820 
a grid or four cells of a grid and so on
and<00:01:47.120> immediately<00:01:47.540> you've<00:01:47.960> created<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.680> little

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
and immediately you've created a little

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.790
