00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
teaspoon of xantham gum we're just gonna

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
teaspoon of xantham gum we're just gonna
kind<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.270> dust<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> top<00:01:34.079> here

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
kind of dust to this on the top here

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.249 
kind of dust to this on the top here
it's<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.590> very<00:01:34.890> fine<00:01:35.220> stuff<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.990> reason

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it's this very fine stuff and the reason

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.399 
it's this very fine stuff and the reason
for<00:01:37.409> adding<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.729> found

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
for adding this is that I have found

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.760 
for adding this is that I have found
that<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.590> poppy<00:01:40.829> seed<00:01:41.159> filling<00:01:41.610> quite<00:01:41.850> often

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
that the poppy seed filling quite often

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.789 
that the poppy seed filling quite often
heats<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:44.040> when<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.960> root<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.200> dough<00:01:46.680> is

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
heats up when the root the dough is

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.830 
heats up when the root the dough is
being<00:01:46.979> baked<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.850> tends<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> split<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
being baked in it it tends to split and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080 
being baked in it it tends to split and
rip<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.590> dough<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.009> run<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.820> over<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
rip the dough and run out all over the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.069 
rip the dough and run out all over the
place<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> kind<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.780> give<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:51.990> some

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
place and to kind of give it some

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.109 
place and to kind of give it some
tension<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> allow<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> hold

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
tension and allow it to kind of hold

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.870 
tension and allow it to kind of hold
together<00:01:54.270> we're<00:01:54.780> adding<00:01:55.430> some<00:01:56.430> xanthan<00:01:56.700> gum

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
together we're adding some xanthan gum

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.969 
together we're adding some xanthan gum
to<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:58.500> recipe

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to this recipe

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.550 
to this recipe
totally<00:01:59.729> not<00:01:59.850> traditional<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.290> tried

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
totally not traditional but I have tried

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.889 
totally not traditional but I have tried
it<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> couple<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.189> times<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.820> believe<00:02:03.420> me<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
it a couple of times and believe me it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.830 
it a couple of times and believe me it
it<00:02:04.320> helps<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.920> lot<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:06.000> we're<00:02:06.119> mixing<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.600> in

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it helps a lot so we're mixing that in

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.360 
it helps a lot so we're mixing that in
and<00:02:07.110> now<00:02:07.290> we're<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> also<00:02:07.950> add

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.370 
and now we're going to also add

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.800 
and now we're going to also add
one<00:02:10.370> egg<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.800> then<00:02:12.800> we<00:02:12.950> are<00:02:13.070> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.580> mix<00:02:14.570> it
