00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.150
 langoustine tartare with bocca and 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.860
 Apple 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.090
 first look at our young lady 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.980
 from the sea since it is also their 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.170
 nickname one are splendid 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.730
 we're going to shell them so I'm going 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.380
 first torn off the head 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.770
 then I go there to crack the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.239
 different channels and we dissect good 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.950
 langoustines it is said that it is of the 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.210
 family of lobster banon finally 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.950
 it's a lot closer to lobster than 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.570
 lobsters a splendid product in 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.739
 see it they are cool for 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.530
 recognize that they are very cool 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.420
 it's simple we look at the head 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.180
 the eyes must be black 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.160
 body also a rosy hue for any 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.320
 way there is a last indicator that 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.570
 formidable is the nose a good product 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.460
 from the sea it does not smell if you have the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.770
 less smell of ammonia or there you 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.720
 run away there now I'm going 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.470
 try to remove the hose I do the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.270
 base and I draw tribute here I am 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.280
 remove this little gut I continue with 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 other years with lobster it is 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.110
 a product that is very fragile 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.270
 so it's kept pretty much 24 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.329
 hours but more is better 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.999
 it's joe clip the base and I pull 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.679
 gently to remove my hose to 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.850
 langoustines go fishing mainly 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.340
 in the gulf of gascogne 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.490
 moreover it brings everything 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.560
 full of protein on about 20 g 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.159
 per 100 g of langoustines very little 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.509
 fat 90 calories roughly for% keep 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.179
 another technique 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.630
 I take my back and let go a little 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.399
 notch 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.249
 there is a kind of trait a little bit 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.350
 tired we know monfort does not scramble at 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.909
 so there just with my knife and I 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.740
 removes it 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.229
 I continue with others we remove the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.779
 head one breaks the different channels and 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.999
 in deco jo clamp the base and I 

00:01:55.779 --> 00:02:00.100
 gently pulls to remove my guts 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.810
 and I put my scampi side 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.420
 said tartar necessarily says cuts 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.200
 so here I am going to cut his beautiful 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.119
 langoustines 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.910
 I'll try to make cubes 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.220
 about equal that's it's true we're 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.230
 working more with the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.340
 langoustine lend themselves to many modes 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.710
 different cooking 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.260
 we could make it fried we could 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.930
 to poach it in the back we could 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.840
 to make it on the barbecue you cut it 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.760
 in two in the direction of the length 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.870
 you season you lay side 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.620
 carapace on the barbecue 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.420
 a pure treat all that will go in 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.610
 my salad bowl for seasoning 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.030
 I have a lime I have a fine grater 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.830
 I put my gesture that the green part 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.340
 by the white part that would not bring 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.520
 bitterness 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.050
 I'm going to roll this lemon so 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.180
 to get the most juice goes 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.820
 slightly started to cook the pulpit 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.360
 langoustines a little bit of oil 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.150
 olive 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.050
 I mix germs as an accompaniment 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.060
 the green apple 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.530
 you're going to see it get married really 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.840
 very very well I'm going for cuts and 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.940
 two slices fine enough but that go 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.020
 to serve just now for the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.270
 achievement non millefeuille 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.920
 I will quote slightly that avoids 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.800
 oxidation and came blacken 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.950
 and I keep them aside the rest of my 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.270
 apple I 'm going to cut it into little cubes 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.760
 almost the same size as that 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.920

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.950
