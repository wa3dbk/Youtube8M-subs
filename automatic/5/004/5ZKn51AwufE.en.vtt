00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
right now before we go any further in

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.800 
right now before we go any further in
the<00:00:11.580> course<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.030> thing<00:00:12.060> I<00:00:12.270> do<00:00:12.420> want<00:00:12.600> to<00:00:12.630> look

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:12.810 
the course one thing I do want to look

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.520 
the course one thing I do want to look
at<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.530> value<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:15.240> simple<00:00:15.990> total

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
at is the value of the simple total

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.190 
at is the value of the simple total
sketch<00:00:16.860> now<00:00:17.610> the<00:00:17.670> tall<00:00:17.970> sketch<00:00:18.360> is<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.660> great

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
sketch now the tall sketch is a great

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.070 
sketch now the tall sketch is a great
and<00:00:19.440> very<00:00:19.500> quick<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.430> very<00:00:20.730> simple<00:00:20.880> way<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and very quick and very simple way to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
and very quick and very simple way to
work<00:00:22.320> out<00:00:22.590> what<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> best<00:00:23.250> composition<00:00:24.060> is

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
work out what the best composition is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.810 
work out what the best composition is
for<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.750> picture<00:00:25.140> you're<00:00:25.320> doing<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.610> also

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
for the picture you're doing but it also

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.900 
for the picture you're doing but it also
allows<00:00:27.419> you<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.349> deal<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.430> lights<00:00:29.669> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
allows you to deal with the lights and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.550 
allows you to deal with the lights and
darks<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.840> where<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.079> lightest

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
darks so you know where the lightest

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.850 
darks so you know where the lightest
lights<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.220> and<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.840> darkest<00:00:34.380> darks

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
lights are going and the darkest darks

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.260 
lights are going and the darkest darks
and<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.200> translated<00:00:37.650> into<00:00:38.270> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and that can be translated into the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.720 
and that can be translated into the
color<00:00:39.570> picture<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.340> cook<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
color picture so that when you cook to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.340 
color picture so that when you cook to
put<00:00:41.940> paint<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.719> doesn't<00:00:42.930> matter<00:00:43.170> whether

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
put paint on it doesn't matter whether

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.500 
put paint on it doesn't matter whether
it's<00:00:43.559> brown<00:00:43.859> blue<00:00:44.219> red<00:00:44.579> green<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.120> whatever

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it's brown blue red green or whatever

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.569 
it's brown blue red green or whatever
you<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:46.890> painting<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you know that if you're painting this

Sun now what I'm going to do is combine

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.510 
Sun now what I'm going to do is combine
different<00:01:09.360> elements<00:01:09.750> from<00:01:09.960> each<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.650> see

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
different elements from each one and see

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
different elements from each one and see
we<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.790> create<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.240> much<00:01:12.450> better<00:01:12.720> composition

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we can create a much better composition

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.800 
we can create a much better composition
now<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.430> these<00:01:14.520> thumbnail<00:01:15.060> sketches<00:01:15.450> because

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
now for these thumbnail sketches because

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
now for these thumbnail sketches because
that's<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.829> I've<00:01:17.250> used<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that's all they are really I've used a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
that's all they are really I've used a
cartridge<00:01:18.509> part<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.079> hundred<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> 80<00:01:19.500> gram

weight paper and I've used male friend

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.300 
weight paper and I've used male friend
were<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:23.009> graphite<00:01:23.700> pencil<00:01:24.259> but<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.530> could

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
were to be graphite pencil but you could

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.539 
were to be graphite pencil but you could
just<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.700> easily<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:29.070> piece<00:01:29.520> of

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
just as easily use a piece of

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.120 
just as easily use a piece of
photocopying<00:01:30.360> printer<00:01:30.869> paper<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.409> a

ballpoint pen for this with a few

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
ballpoint pen for this with a few
scribbles<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.520> essentially<00:01:36.119> they're

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
scribbles on you see essentially they're

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.609 
scribbles on you see essentially they're
the<00:01:36.600> same<00:01:36.840> sort<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:38.240> compositions<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.619> some

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the same sort of compositions and some

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
the same sort of compositions and some
early<00:01:40.829> ideas<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> had<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> they<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.930> as

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
early ideas I had and they can be as

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.889 
early ideas I had and they can be as
rough<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.710> ready<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
rough and ready as that but for this

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
rough and ready as that but for this
exercise<00:01:45.960> I've<00:01:46.770> done<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.310> bit<00:01:47.430> more

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
exercise I've done a little bit more

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.969 
exercise I've done a little bit more
detail<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.810> let's<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.560> through<00:01:49.829> each<00:01:49.860> one

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
detail and let's go through each one

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
detail and let's go through each one
individually<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.180> how<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> came<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
individually and see how it came to the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.800 
individually and see how it came to the
final<00:01:52.140> decision<00:01:53.090> but<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.270> first<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
final decision but on this first one I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.300 
final decision but on this first one I
looked<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.170> actually<00:01:55.590> quite<00:01:55.799> liked<00:01:56.070> when<00:01:56.280> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
looked at actually quite liked when I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.910 
looked at actually quite liked when I
did<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.180> was<00:01:57.299> based<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.229> area<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
did it it was based more on this area of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.060 
did it it was based more on this area of
this<00:01:59.850> picture<00:02:00.390> where<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.320> right-hand<00:02:01.770> side

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
this picture where the right-hand side

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.139 
this picture where the right-hand side
had<00:02:02.700> these<00:02:03.000> very<00:02:03.810> distinctive<00:02:04.880> angular<00:02:05.880> rocks

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
had these very distinctive angular rocks

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.980 
had these very distinctive angular rocks
jutting<00:02:06.930> out<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> sand<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:09.149> changed<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
jutting out of the sand and I changed it

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.690 
jutting out of the sand and I changed it
round<00:02:10.200> slightly<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.950> had<00:02:11.130> some<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.490> round

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
round slightly I had some of the round

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.980 
round slightly I had some of the round
the<00:02:11.850> rocks<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.270> was<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.570> put<00:02:12.720> some

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
the rocks I was going to put some

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.870 
the rocks I was going to put some
seaweed<00:02:13.530> or<00:02:13.920> whatever<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.490> foreground

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
seaweed or whatever in the foreground

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.570 
seaweed or whatever in the foreground
and<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.750> distance<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:17.130> see<00:02:17.400> we

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and in the distance here you can see we

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.670 
and in the distance here you can see we
had<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.390> sea<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.110> distant<00:02:19.530> headland

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
had the sea and the distant headland

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.830 
had the sea and the distant headland
the<00:02:20.769> only<00:02:20.890> problem<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.879> had<00:02:22.030> with<00:02:22.209> vasas<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:22.780> I

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the only problem I had with vasas that I

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.199 
the only problem I had with vasas that I
felt<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.470> composition<00:02:24.090> started<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
felt that the composition started to

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.600 
felt that the composition started to
push<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.659> eye<00:02:25.689> out<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.560> picture<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.459> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
push the eye out of the picture with the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.470 
push the eye out of the picture with the
angle<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.930> rocks<00:02:29.709> right<00:02:30.700> now<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:30.970> next

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
angle of the rocks right now the next

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.509 
angle of the rocks right now the next
photograph<00:02:31.659> I<00:02:31.989> tried<00:02:32.230> was<00:02:32.500> an<00:02:32.620> adaptation<00:02:32.769> of

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
photograph I tried was an adaptation of

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.990 
photograph I tried was an adaptation of
this<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.239> where<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:35.110> had<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.950> angular<00:02:36.519> angular

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
this one where I had the angular angular

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.640 
this one where I had the angular angular
rocks<00:02:37.599> in<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.650> foreground<00:02:38.680> here<00:02:39.540> some

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
rocks in the foreground here some

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.099 
rocks in the foreground here some
angular<00:02:41.650> rocks<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.790> center<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.840> cliff

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
angular rocks in the center the cliff

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.099 
angular rocks in the center the cliff
running<00:02:44.470> away<00:02:45.090> similar<00:02:46.090> sort<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.359> rocks<00:02:46.599> going

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
running away similar sort of rocks going

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.729 
running away similar sort of rocks going
into<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.560> sea<00:02:47.859> and<00:02:48.629> again<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:50.200> distant

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
into the sea and again the distant

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.699 
into the sea and again the distant
headland<00:02:51.189> but<00:02:51.849> overall<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.599> just<00:02:52.900> felt<00:02:53.500> that

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
headland but overall I just felt that

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.180 
headland but overall I just felt that
that<00:02:53.769> was<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.670> little<00:02:55.120> bit<00:02:55.329> lacking<00:02:55.629> in

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
that was a little bit lacking in

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.149 
that was a little bit lacking in
interest<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.480> moved<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.170> now<00:02:59.379> for<00:02:59.889> this

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
interest so I moved on now for this

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.059 
interest so I moved on now for this
composition<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:01.120> came<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.739> photograph

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
composition I came to this photograph

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.250 
composition I came to this photograph
here<00:03:03.609> and<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.299> can<00:03:04.420> see<00:03:04.599> there's<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:04.959> little

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
here and you can see there's this little

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.339 
here and you can see there's this little
family<00:03:05.500> group<00:03:05.829> with<00:03:06.189> the<00:03:06.340> dogs<00:03:06.639> that's<00:03:07.599> having

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
family group with the dogs that's having

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.369 
family group with the dogs that's having
a<00:03:08.439> nice<00:03:08.620> stroll<00:03:08.980> along<00:03:09.159> the<00:03:09.340> beach<00:03:09.639> and<00:03:10.379> you

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
a nice stroll along the beach and you

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.770 
a nice stroll along the beach and you
have<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.159> large<00:03:12.430> rock<00:03:12.909> the<00:03:13.120> angular<00:03:13.540> rocks

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
have the large rock the angular rocks

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.089 
have the large rock the angular rocks
here<00:03:14.019> sticking<00:03:14.409> at<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> beach<00:03:14.859> and<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
here sticking at the beach and the

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.879 
here sticking at the beach and the
foreground<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.900> framed<00:03:16.900> by<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.319> cliffs<00:03:17.709> and

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
foreground and framed by the cliffs and

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.110 
foreground and framed by the cliffs and
the<00:03:17.950> headland<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.549> background

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
the headland in the background

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.970 
the headland in the background
but<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.780> felt<00:03:20.109> that<00:03:20.170> there<00:03:20.409> was<00:03:20.530> something<00:03:20.889> a

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
but I felt that there was something a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.800 
but I felt that there was something a
little<00:03:21.250> bit<00:03:21.370> lacking<00:03:21.639> here<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.359> interest

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
little bit lacking here and interest

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.589 
little bit lacking here and interest
that<00:03:23.379> perhaps<00:03:23.829> needed<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.669> balance<00:03:25.269> the

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
that perhaps needed to balance the

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.750 
that perhaps needed to balance the
picture<00:03:25.959> somewhat<00:03:26.349> now<00:03:27.310> what<00:03:27.489> I've<00:03:27.579> done<00:03:27.609> is

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
picture somewhat now what I've done is

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.309 
picture somewhat now what I've done is
brought<00:03:28.090> some<00:03:28.359> of<00:03:28.449> these<00:03:28.510> angle<00:03:28.870> rocks<00:03:29.109> in

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
brought some of these angle rocks in

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.530 
brought some of these angle rocks in
here<00:03:29.530> using<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.370> large<00:03:30.639> photo<00:03:31.060> as<00:03:31.480> a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
here using this large photo as a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.189 
here using this large photo as a
reference<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.910> turn<00:03:33.910> them<00:03:34.209> round<00:03:34.419> so<00:03:35.019> they're

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
reference and turn them round so they're

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.710 
reference and turn them round so they're
pointing<00:03:35.680> inwards<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.280> picture<00:03:36.790> we<00:03:37.569> go

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
pointing inwards to the picture we go

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.420 
pointing inwards to the picture we go
back<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.169> photograph<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:38.709> can<00:03:38.949> see<00:03:39.220> this

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
back to the photograph you can see this

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.599 
back to the photograph you can see this
rock<00:03:40.120> base<00:03:40.810> here<00:03:41.230> I've<00:03:41.409> reduced<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.310> quite

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
rock base here I've reduced that quite

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.180 
rock base here I've reduced that quite
considerably<00:03:43.319> because<00:03:44.319> I<00:03:44.590> don't<00:03:44.799> want<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.099> to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
considerably because I don't want it to

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.849 
considerably because I don't want it to
be<00:03:45.310> competing<00:03:45.909> with<00:03:45.940> this<00:03:46.359> rock<00:03:47.349> formation

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
be competing with this rock formation

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.879 
be competing with this rock formation
which<00:03:48.430> will<00:03:48.730> be<00:03:48.909> the<00:03:49.030> focal<00:03:49.449> point<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.620> cliff

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
which will be the focal point the cliff

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.710 
which will be the focal point the cliff
face<00:03:51.129> is<00:03:51.430> still<00:03:51.669> there<00:03:51.879> in<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.000> headlands<00:03:52.540> but

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
face is still there in the headlands but

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.509 
face is still there in the headlands but
they've<00:03:52.900> been<00:03:53.139> pushed<00:03:53.379> back<00:03:53.620> by<00:03:53.829> making<00:03:54.340> them

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
they've been pushed back by making them

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.819 
they've been pushed back by making them
lighter<00:03:54.729> and<00:03:54.970> I've<00:03:55.540> moved<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.049> family<00:03:56.560> group

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
lighter and I've moved the family group

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.670 
lighter and I've moved the family group
forward<00:03:57.489> into<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.879> middle<00:03:58.150> distance<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.470> that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
forward into the middle distance so that

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.289 
forward into the middle distance so that
what<00:03:59.859> we<00:04:00.040> have<00:04:00.280> now<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.879> a<00:04:02.729> focal<00:04:03.729> point<00:04:04.000> but

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
what we have now is a focal point but

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.379 
what we have now is a focal point but
then<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.870> gap<00:04:05.260> here<00:04:05.560> so<00:04:05.889> this<00:04:06.010> after<00:04:06.639> you<00:04:06.790> is

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
then a gap here so this after you is

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.729 
then a gap here so this after you is
settled<00:04:07.780> on<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> focal<00:04:08.409> point

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
settled on the focal point

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.890 
settled on the focal point
it'll<00:04:09.280> be<00:04:09.430> eventually<00:04:09.760> drawn<00:04:10.329> through<00:04:10.720> this

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
it'll be eventually drawn through this

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.589 
it'll be eventually drawn through this
gap<00:04:11.199> in<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.470> rocks<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.979> down<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.790> beach<00:04:12.970> to

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
gap in the rocks and down the beach to

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.839 
gap in the rocks and down the beach to
this<00:04:13.750> secondary<00:04:14.319> focal<00:04:14.859> point<00:04:15.099> which<00:04:15.579> will<00:04:15.819> be

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
this secondary focal point which will be

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.149 
this secondary focal point which will be
the<00:04:16.120> family<00:04:16.539> now<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.500> other<00:04:17.799> good<00:04:17.949> thing

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
the family now the other good thing

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:19.890 
the family now the other good thing
about<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.489> tonal<00:04:18.820> sketch<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.539> can<00:04:19.690> see

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
about the tonal sketch is you can see

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.230 
about the tonal sketch is you can see
this<00:04:20.109> quite<00:04:20.380> an<00:04:20.560> area<00:04:20.919> here<00:04:21.280> which<00:04:21.849> is<00:04:22.060> quite

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
this quite an area here which is quite

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.580 
this quite an area here which is quite
light<00:04:22.570> which<00:04:22.780> is<00:04:22.900> obviously<00:04:23.199> going<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.440> be<00:04:23.500> the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
light which is obviously going to be the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.790 
light which is obviously going to be the
beach<00:04:23.860> but<00:04:24.729> I<00:04:24.909> just<00:04:25.330> wonder<00:04:25.780> whether<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.349> could

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
beach but I just wonder whether I could

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.620 
beach but I just wonder whether I could
add<00:04:26.949> a<00:04:27.130> few<00:04:27.190> little<00:04:27.550> bits<00:04:27.909> of<00:04:28.060> something<00:04:28.479> can

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
add a few little bits of something can

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.589 
add a few little bits of something can
nothing<00:04:28.840> can<00:04:29.200> scraps<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.940> lights<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.210> darks

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
nothing can scraps of lights and darks

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.780 
nothing can scraps of lights and darks
there<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.260> be<00:04:32.289> seaweed

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
there can be seaweed

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.730 
there can be seaweed
little<00:04:34.450> bit<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.720> rock<00:04:34.900> whatever<00:04:35.320> you<00:04:35.440> wanted

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
little bit of rock whatever you wanted

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.430 
little bit of rock whatever you wanted
to<00:04:35.920> be<00:04:36.070> well<00:04:36.820> yeah<00:04:37.210> that's<00:04:37.420> not<00:04:37.690> bad<00:04:37.930> at<00:04:38.140> five

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
to be well yeah that's not bad at five

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.730 
to be well yeah that's not bad at five
but<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.430> still<00:04:39.640> leaves<00:04:39.820> this<00:04:40.060> gap<00:04:40.630> here<00:04:40.930> now

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
but it still leaves this gap here now

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.350 
but it still leaves this gap here now
that's<00:04:41.950> fine<00:04:42.220> but<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.520> only<00:04:42.640> thing<00:04:42.940> is<00:04:42.970> I

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
that's fine but the only thing is I

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.170 
that's fine but the only thing is I
think<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:43.960> tends<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:45.010> position<00:04:45.640> here

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
think that tends to this position here

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.150 
think that tends to this position here
tends<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.930> block<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.350> view<00:04:47.380> off<00:04:47.710> through<00:04:47.980> the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
tends to block the view off through the

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.380 
tends to block the view off through the
gap<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:48.940> what<00:04:49.150> I'll<00:04:49.270> do<00:04:49.480> is<00:04:49.720> if<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.620> rub<00:04:50.890> that<00:04:51.070> out

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
gap so what I'll do is if I rub that out

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.730 
gap so what I'll do is if I rub that out
now<00:04:52.390> you<00:04:52.480> can<00:04:52.630> see<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.930> way<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.170> eye<00:04:53.200> feeds

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
now you can see the way the eye feeds

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.890 
now you can see the way the eye feeds
through<00:04:54.010> that<00:04:54.310> gap<00:04:54.610> between<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:55.150> two<00:04:55.330> rocks

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
through that gap between the two rocks

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.900 
through that gap between the two rocks
and<00:04:56.230> through<00:04:56.980> to<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.250> family<00:04:57.640> in<00:04:57.790> the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
and through to the family in the

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.560 
and through to the family in the
distance<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.570> can<00:04:59.500> put<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.710> bit<00:04:59.890> of<00:05:00.360> something<00:05:01.360> in

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
distance I can put a bit of something in

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.150 
distance I can put a bit of something in
nothing<00:05:01.960> shadow<00:05:02.260> it<00:05:02.710> just<00:05:02.890> could<00:05:03.040> be<00:05:03.100> a

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
nothing shadow it just could be a

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.280 
nothing shadow it just could be a
contour<00:05:03.610> on<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:03.850> beach<00:05:04.060> now<00:05:04.690> I'm<00:05:04.840> happy<00:05:05.170> with

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
contour on the beach now I'm happy with

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.800 
contour on the beach now I'm happy with
that<00:05:05.470> because<00:05:05.710> that<00:05:06.490> gives<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.180> natural<00:05:07.630> little

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
that because that gives a natural little

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.370 
that because that gives a natural little
path<00:05:08.200> through<00:05:09.010> this<00:05:09.940> picture<00:05:10.540> into<00:05:11.260> the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
path through this picture into the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.880 
path through this picture into the
middle<00:05:11.620> distance<00:05:12.720> right<00:05:13.720> now<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:13.930> can<00:05:14.170> see<00:05:14.410> by

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
middle distance right now you can see by

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.040 
middle distance right now you can see by
putting<00:05:15.250> this<00:05:15.370> angular<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.090> quick<00:05:16.630> strokes

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
putting this angular and quick strokes

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.270 
putting this angular and quick strokes
of<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.920> pencil<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:19.320> create<00:05:20.320> automatically<00:05:21.130> a

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
of the pencil you create automatically a

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.340 
of the pencil you create automatically a
sort<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.580> quite<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:21.850> breezy<00:05:22.300> effect<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.320> that

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
sort of quite a breezy effect and that

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.200 
sort of quite a breezy effect and that
seems<00:05:23.740> entirely<00:05:24.160> appropriate<00:05:24.580> for<00:05:24.940> this

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
seems entirely appropriate for this

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.330 
seems entirely appropriate for this
although<00:05:25.450> it's<00:05:25.630> a<00:05:25.720> bright<00:05:25.900> sunny<00:05:26.230> day<00:05:26.340> the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
although it's a bright sunny day the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.230 
although it's a bright sunny day the
wind<00:05:28.000> is<00:05:28.240> blowing<00:05:28.420> them<00:05:28.780> off<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.140> sea<00:05:29.380> and

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
wind is blowing them off the sea and

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.480 
wind is blowing them off the sea and
that's<00:05:31.240> an<00:05:31.390> ideal<00:05:31.780> sort<00:05:32.140> of<00:05:32.340> atmosphere<00:05:33.340> in

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
that's an ideal sort of atmosphere in

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.620 
that's an ideal sort of atmosphere in
the<00:05:33.610> sky<00:05:33.850> that<00:05:34.060> we're<00:05:34.180> going<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.390> try<00:05:34.570> and

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
the sky that we're going to try and

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.070 
the sky that we're going to try and
create<00:05:35.370> if<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.490> also<00:05:36.640> sea<00:05:37.120> of<00:05:37.360> dust<00:05:37.660> on<00:05:37.960> this

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
create if it also sea of dust on this

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.040 
create if it also sea of dust on this
hint<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.920> muted<00:05:39.520> reflections<00:05:40.240> which<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:40.840> what

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
hint of muted reflections which is what

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.830 
hint of muted reflections which is what
you're<00:05:41.290> gonna<00:05:41.470> get<00:05:41.710> on<00:05:42.130> wet<00:05:42.790> sand<00:05:43.120> where

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
you're gonna get on wet sand where

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.780 
you're gonna get on wet sand where
you're<00:05:44.080> not<00:05:44.200> gonna<00:05:44.410> get<00:05:44.620> a<00:05:44.650> full-blown<00:05:45.250> shiny

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
you're not gonna get a full-blown shiny

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.340 
you're not gonna get a full-blown shiny
reflection<00:05:46.480> if<00:05:46.570> you<00:05:46.660> like<00:05:46.870> it's<00:05:47.050> going<00:05:47.200> to<00:05:47.230> be

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
reflection if you like it's going to be

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.260 
reflection if you like it's going to be
slightly<00:05:47.560> blurry<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.580> we'll<00:05:48.820> have<00:05:49.000> a<00:05:49.030> look

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
slightly blurry and we'll have a look

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.450 
slightly blurry and we'll have a look
how<00:05:49.450> we<00:05:49.480> do<00:05:49.840> that<00:05:50.050> it's<00:05:50.200> not<00:05:50.350> difficult<00:05:50.620> once

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
how we do that it's not difficult once

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.610 
how we do that it's not difficult once
you<00:05:51.670> know<00:05:51.850> so<00:05:52.480> I'm<00:05:52.630> happy<00:05:52.900> with<00:05:53.170> that<00:05:53.320> as<00:05:53.560> a

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
you know so I'm happy with that as a

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.920

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.860 
tonal sketch now and it's given me a
good<00:05:56.170> idea<00:05:56.650> in<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.430> head<00:05:57.640> of<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:58.300> way<00:05:58.480> I<00:05:58.540> want

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
good idea in the head of the way I want

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.720
