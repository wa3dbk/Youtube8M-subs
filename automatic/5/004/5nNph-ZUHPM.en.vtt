00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
to be coated in a language that you can

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.530 
to be coated in a language that you can
translate<00:00:32.130> into<00:00:32.430> something<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> computer

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
translate into something the computer

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.959 
translate into something the computer
understands<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:35.280> we'll<00:00:35.460> talk<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:35.850> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
understands and we'll talk about that

computer science next year is not
science<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.239> parts<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
science at all really there are parts of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.250 
science at all really there are parts of
science<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:53.030> general<00:00:54.030> computer<00:00:54.660> science<00:00:55.020> but

science in general computer science but

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.200 
science in general computer science but
not<00:00:56.390> what<00:00:57.390> you're<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.840> doing<00:00:59.210> next

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
not what you're going to be doing next

year you're going to be doing
programming<00:01:01.739> you're<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.340> learning

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
programming you're going to be learning

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.479 
programming you're going to be learning
about<00:01:02.730> programming<00:01:03.409> which<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.680> really<00:01:05.250> an

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
about programming which is really an

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.300 
about programming which is really an
engineering<00:01:06.000> discipline<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:08.100> talk

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
engineering discipline and you can talk

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.859 
engineering discipline and you can talk
about<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.729> later<00:01:11.450> question<00:01:12.450> number<00:01:12.510> three

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
about that later question number three

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.310 
about that later question number three
why<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.100> start<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.390> explanation<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
why do I start this explanation at the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.209 
why do I start this explanation at the
beginning<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> universe

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:31.219 

the<00:01:24.320> explanation<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.829> that<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:30.229> it's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the explanation for that is that it's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.459 
the explanation for that is that it's
very<00:01:31.530> easy<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.219> get<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.549> over<00:01:32.789> your<00:01:32.820> head<00:01:33.149> and

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
very easy to get in over your head and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.319 
very easy to get in over your head and
believe<00:01:34.469> that<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> understand<00:01:35.549> things<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
believe that you understand things that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.149 
believe that you understand things that
you<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.049> fact<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.649> not<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> problem<00:01:39.960> for

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
you in fact do not this is a problem for

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
you in fact do not this is a problem for
students<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.280> school<00:01:41.700> who<00:01:44.090> maybe<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.600> look

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
students in school who maybe just look

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.300 
students in school who maybe just look
at<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.200> material<00:01:46.619> say<00:01:46.740> yeah<00:01:46.920> yeah<00:01:47.130> yeah<00:01:47.280> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
at some material say yeah yeah yeah I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889 
at some material say yeah yeah yeah I
understand<00:01:47.819> AB<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.539> that<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
understand AB get that I get that and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
understand AB get that I get that and
they<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.500> they<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> eventually

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
they go on and they go on and eventually

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.980 
they go on and they go on and eventually
they<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> point<00:01:51.659> where<00:01:51.780> they're

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
they get to a point where they're

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.690 
they get to a point where they're
completely<00:01:52.380> confused<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.459> because

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
completely confused and that's because

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.059 
completely confused and that's because
they<00:01:54.689> didn't<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.349> master<00:01:56.039> the

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
they didn't really master the

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.249 
they didn't really master the
fundamentals<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.569> they<00:01:57.720> were<00:01:57.780> studying

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
fundamentals of what they were studying

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.789 
fundamentals of what they were studying
they<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.799> sort<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.009> breeze<00:01:59.280> past<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.970> without

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
they just sort of breeze past it without

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.089 
they just sort of breeze past it without
really<00:02:01.799> understanding<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.990> and

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
really understanding it and

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.180 
really understanding it and
understanding<00:02:05.099> takes<00:02:05.369> time<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:05.939> effort<00:02:07.190> in

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
understanding takes time and effort in

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.979 
understanding takes time and effort in
it<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.549> you<00:02:08.579> can't<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.239> assume<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
it and you can't just assume that you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.210 
it and you can't just assume that you
understand<00:02:10.500> things<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> really

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
understand things you have to really

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.900 
understand things you have to really
stop<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.670> think<00:02:12.000> about<00:02:12.299> them

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.960 

that<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.800> also<00:02:17.980> happens<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.700> lot

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
that this is this also happens a lot

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.350 
that this is this also happens a lot
with<00:02:19.180> adults<00:02:19.480> for<00:02:19.870> what<00:02:20.020> it's<00:02:20.140> worth<00:02:21.360> many

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
with adults for what it's worth many

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.810 
with adults for what it's worth many
many<00:02:22.930> problems<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.710> world<00:02:23.740> are<00:02:24.160> caused<00:02:24.400> by

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
many problems in the world are caused by

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.330 
many problems in the world are caused by
adults<00:02:25.810> who<00:02:25.960> believe<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.440> they<00:02:26.830> understand

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
adults who believe that they understand

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.840 
adults who believe that they understand
things<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.970> they<00:02:28.120> really<00:02:28.480> don't<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
things that they really don't so and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.970 
things that they really don't so and
this<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:31.600> stems<00:02:31.900> from<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.590> just<00:02:32.770> more

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
this just stems from this is just more

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.380 
this just stems from this is just more
behavior<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.580> they've<00:02:33.790> learned<00:02:33.820> in<00:02:34.180> school

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
behavior that they've learned in school

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.180 
behavior that they've learned in school
they<00:02:34.900> learn<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.320> school<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.800> then<00:02:35.920> they<00:02:36.040> go

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
they learn it in school and then they go

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.330 
they learn it in school and then they go
out<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.400> they<00:02:37.080> practice<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:39.070> same

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
out and they practice that that same

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.690 
out and they practice that that same
habit<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.790> they<00:02:40.000> learned<00:02:40.210> as<00:02:40.390> adults<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:42.490> I'm

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
habit that they learned as adults so I'm

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.930 
habit that they learned as adults so I'm
trying<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.360> make<00:02:43.630> sure<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.340> understand

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
trying to make sure that you understand

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.100 
trying to make sure that you understand
things<00:02:46.330> at<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.690> very<00:02:47.020> fundamental<00:02:47.260> level<00:02:49.110> I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
things at a very fundamental level I

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.040 
things at a very fundamental level I
could<00:02:50.770> even<00:02:50.920> go<00:02:51.160> more<00:02:51.400> basic<00:02:51.820> than<00:02:51.850> what<00:02:52.240> what

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
could even go more basic than what what

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.170 
could even go more basic than what what
we're<00:02:53.200> doing<00:02:53.530> here<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.850> answer<00:02:57.970> I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
we're doing here so that's the answer I

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.410 
we're doing here so that's the answer I
give<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.540> hope<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.650> that's<00:02:59.800> sufficient

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
give to that hope that that's sufficient

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.350 
give to that hope that that's sufficient
and<00:03:01.510> finally<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.680> fourth<00:03:02.860> question<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.490> how

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
and finally the fourth question is how

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.510 
and finally the fourth question is how
do<00:03:04.420> computers<00:03:05.080> understand<00:03:05.709> what<00:03:06.130> we<00:03:06.280> tell

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
do computers understand what we tell

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.490 
do computers understand what we tell
them<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.819> do<00:03:06.989> that's<00:03:07.989> actually<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> very

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
them to do that's actually a very

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.360 
them to do that's actually a very
complicated<00:03:09.459> question<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:11.200> hope<00:03:11.530> by<00:03:12.310> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
complicated question and I hope by the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.190 
complicated question and I hope by the
end<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.819> this<00:03:12.970> series<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> good

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
end of this series that you have a good

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.979 
end of this series that you have a good
handle<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.920> I'll<00:03:15.280> give<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.420> some<00:03:16.840> hints

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
handle on that I'll give you some hints

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.880 
handle on that I'll give you some hints
about<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.500> right<00:03:17.680> now<00:03:18.690> you'll<00:03:19.690> note<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.200> you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
about it right now you'll note that you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.699 
about it right now you'll note that you
can't<00:03:21.190> just<00:03:21.489> speak<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.270> computer<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:22.810> you

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
can't just speak to the computer and you

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.380 
can't just speak to the computer and you
have<00:03:23.800> to<00:03:23.980> type<00:03:24.250> into<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.580> computer<00:03:25.030> most<00:03:25.239> of

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
have to type into the computer most of

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.660 
have to type into the computer most of
the<00:03:25.480> time<00:03:25.770> if<00:03:26.770> you<00:03:26.950> want<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.250> do<00:03:27.370> things

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
the time if you want it to do things

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.750 
the time if you want it to do things
there<00:03:28.420> are<00:03:28.569> exceptions<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.230> but

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
there are exceptions to that but

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.240 
there are exceptions to that but
generally<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.849> have<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.120> type<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.690> things<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
generally you have to type in things and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.190 
generally you have to type in things and
generally<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.370> have<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:33.700> follow<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.900> very

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
generally you have to follow a very

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.979 
generally you have to follow a very
rigid<00:03:35.440> format<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:37.060> can't<00:03:37.300> just<00:03:37.569> type<00:03:37.810> in

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
rigid format you can't just type in

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.670 
rigid format you can't just type in
anything<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.620> have<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.510> type<00:03:40.510> in<00:03:40.750> things<00:03:41.410> in<00:03:41.590> a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
anything you have to type in things in a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.890 
anything you have to type in things in a
very<00:03:41.709> specific<00:03:42.280> way<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.150> if<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.600> make<00:03:43.750> the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
very specific way and if you make the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.860 
very specific way and if you make the
slightest<00:03:44.470> little<00:03:44.620> deviation<00:03:45.540> many<00:03:46.540> times

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
slightest little deviation many times

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.740 
slightest little deviation many times
you'll<00:03:47.230> get<00:03:47.440> either<00:03:48.130> an<00:03:48.459> error<00:03:48.760> as<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.060> result

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
you'll get either an error as a result

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.440 
you'll get either an error as a result
or<00:03:50.170> you'll<00:03:50.890> get<00:03:51.220> what<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.880> something<00:03:52.360> you

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
or you'll get what you something you

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.320 
or you'll get what you something you
didn't<00:03:52.709> intend<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.799> happen<00:03:54.130> or<00:03:54.970> it<00:03:55.120> might<00:03:55.269> just

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
didn't intend to happen or it might just

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330 
didn't intend to happen or it might just
give<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.560> know<00:03:56.650> just<00:03:56.860> might<00:03:57.040> just<00:03:57.250> do

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
give you a you know just might just do

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
give you a you know just might just do
nothing<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.620> bad<00:03:59.830> news<00:03:59.860> is<00:04:00.130> sometimes<00:04:00.819> if

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
nothing the bad news is sometimes if

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.729 
nothing the bad news is sometimes if
you're<00:04:01.540> not<00:04:01.660> careful<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.170> might<00:04:02.319> do<00:04:02.470> something

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
you're not careful it might do something

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.990 
you're not careful it might do something
but<00:04:03.549> you<00:04:03.700> didn't<00:04:03.880> know<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.120> did<00:04:04.150> something<00:04:04.690> so

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
but you didn't know it did something so

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.680 
but you didn't know it did something so
that's<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.150> hint<00:04:07.859> you'll<00:04:08.859> you'll<00:04:09.400> learn<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:10.390> lot

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
that's a hint you'll you'll learn a lot

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.920 
that's a hint you'll you'll learn a lot
more<00:04:10.930> about<00:04:11.170> this<00:04:11.380> as<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.790> series<00:04:13.060> progresses

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
more about this as the series progresses

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.599 
more about this as the series progresses
and<00:04:14.200> certainly<00:04:14.530> learn<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:14.829> lot<00:04:15.100> more<00:04:15.160> about

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
and certainly learn a lot more about

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:16.300 
and certainly learn a lot more about
that

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
that

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.879 
that
and<00:04:16.519> when<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.180> take<00:04:17.419> computer<00:04:18.139> science<00:04:18.650> next

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
and when you take computer science next

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.039 
and when you take computer science next
year<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:20.090> thank<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:20.480> very<00:04:20.540> much<00:04:20.810> for<00:04:20.840> the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
year so thank you very much for the

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.379 
year so thank you very much for the
questions<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:22.310> look<00:04:22.490> forward<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.910> another

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
questions and I look forward to another

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.990 
questions and I look forward to another
round<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.810> them
