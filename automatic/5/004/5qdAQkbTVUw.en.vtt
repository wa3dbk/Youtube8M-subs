00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the temple this is for the first spawn

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.620 
the temple this is for the first spawn
location<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.030> let's<00:01:51.180> move<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.540> other

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
location now let's move to the other

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.679 
location now let's move to the other
ones<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.710> second<00:01:53.100> spawn<00:01:53.640> location<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.479> the

ones the second spawn location for the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.219 
ones the second spawn location for the
actual<00:01:55.110> ring<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.740> still<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
actual ring is still in the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.959 
actual ring is still in the
hydroelectric<00:01:58.920> power<00:01:59.070> plant<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.579> actually

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
hydroelectric power plant it's actually

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.060 
hydroelectric power plant it's actually
in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> center<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.259> container<00:02:01.590> here

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
in the center you have a container here

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.679 
in the center you have a container here
no<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.640> course<00:02:02.670> when<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
no of course when you get to the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.260 
no of course when you get to the
container<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.740> sámi<00:02:05.040> f<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.700> then

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
container you have the sámi f and then

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.730 
container you have the sámi f and then
you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> ring<00:02:07.500> so

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you know and you do have the ring so

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
you know and you do have the ring so
this<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.369> second<00:02:08.670> spawn<00:02:08.849> location<00:02:09.330> for

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
this is the second spawn location for

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.660 
this is the second spawn location for
this<00:02:09.869> actual<00:02:10.170> ring
