could move and get whoa I'm gonna kill
you<00:04:17.720> that's<00:04:18.650> right<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:18.980> better<00:04:19.280> run

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
you that's right you better run

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.909 
you that's right you better run
alright<00:04:20.989> so<00:04:23.169> there<00:04:24.169> let's<00:04:24.440> see<00:04:24.680> if<00:04:24.770> he

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
alright so there let's see if he

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:32.070 
alright so there let's see if he
survives<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:27.250> yep<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.430> he<00:04:28.520> survived<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:30.190> so

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
survives that yep and he survived it so

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.960 
survives that yep and he survived it so
it's<00:04:33.080> pretty<00:04:33.229> hard<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.710> think<00:04:33.950> let's<00:04:34.340> try<00:04:34.910> it

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
it's pretty hard to think let's try it

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.870 
it's pretty hard to think let's try it
with<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.240> normal<00:04:35.930> piece<00:04:36.140> of<00:04:36.169> TNT<00:04:36.710> this<00:04:36.890> time<00:04:39.880> I

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
with a normal piece of TNT this time I

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.610 
with a normal piece of TNT this time I
don't<00:04:41.300> think<00:04:41.450> he's<00:04:41.660> gonna<00:04:41.780> survive<00:04:41.990> this

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.560 

yep<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:46.400> stone<00:04:46.880> even<00:04:47.320> even<00:04:48.320> just<00:04:48.560> stone

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
yep so stone even even just stone

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.440 
yep so stone even even just stone
protects<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.720> from<00:04:51.430> exploding<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:53.030> now<00:04:53.300> with

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
protects it from exploding and now with

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.029 
protects it from exploding and now with
this<00:04:54.039> safer<00:04:55.039> arena<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:56.240> we<00:04:56.390> made<00:04:56.570> it<00:04:57.039> that

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
this safer arena that we made it that

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.219 
this safer arena that we made it that
were<00:04:58.250> made<00:04:59.110> here<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:01.820> can<00:05:02.539> experiment<00:05:02.930> even

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
were made here I can experiment even

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.740 
were made here I can experiment even
quicker<00:05:03.520> so<00:05:04.520> I'm<00:05:04.700> just<00:05:04.880> going<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.330> test<00:05:05.539> out

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
quicker so I'm just going to test out

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.029 
quicker so I'm just going to test out
cobblestone<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.289> they'll<00:05:06.470> quickly<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.860> see

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
cobblestone and they'll quickly and see

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.620 
cobblestone and they'll quickly and see
if<00:05:07.130> there<00:05:07.310> actually<00:05:07.550> is<00:05:07.880> a<00:05:08.030> difference

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
if there actually is a difference

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.230 
if there actually is a difference
between<00:05:08.750> cobblestone<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:12.160> drink

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
between cobblestone and drink

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.580 
between cobblestone and drink
cobblestone<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.919> stone<00:05:16.120> see<00:05:17.120> if<00:05:17.390> it<00:05:18.050> covers

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
cobblestone and stone see if it covers

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:27.550 
cobblestone and stone see if it covers
up<00:05:18.820> nope<00:05:19.850> no<00:05:20.300> difference<00:05:23.320> okay<00:05:24.910> well<00:05:26.560> hey

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560
