powers<00:04:35.750> also<00:04:36.050> fit<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.650> form<00:04:37.010> by<00:04:37.850> giving<00:04:38.300> him<00:04:38.510> a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
powers also fit the form by giving him a

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.340 
powers also fit the form by giving him a
tentacle<00:04:39.620> enacted<00:04:40.190> like<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.340> rip<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:41.660> he<00:04:42.080> used

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
tentacle enacted like a rip that he used

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.550 
tentacle enacted like a rip that he used
very<00:04:43.040> effectively<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.720> ability<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.260> spit

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
very effectively and the ability to spit

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.440 
very effectively and the ability to spit
a<00:04:45.590> cloud<00:04:45.920> of<00:04:45.950> blinding<00:04:46.670> ink<00:04:46.880> from<00:04:47.000> his<00:04:47.210> mouth

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
a cloud of blinding ink from his mouth

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.080 
a cloud of blinding ink from his mouth
and<00:04:47.930> all<00:04:48.140> writers<00:04:48.440> versus<00:04:48.980> die<00:04:49.190> shocker<00:04:49.670> he

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
and all writers versus die shocker he

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.520 
and all writers versus die shocker he
gained<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.570> ability<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:51.050> stretch<00:04:51.320> his

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
gained the ability to stretch his

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.850 
gained the ability to stretch his
tentacles<00:04:52.010> as<00:04:52.250> well<00:04:52.490> as<00:04:52.610> fire<00:04:52.880> icon<00:04:53.210> missiles

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
tentacles as well as fire icon missiles

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.290 
tentacles as well as fire icon missiles
but<00:04:54.860> ultimately<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.640> was<00:04:55.790> not<00:04:55.970> enough<00:04:56.150> to

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
but ultimately that was not enough to

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.160 
but ultimately that was not enough to
save<00:04:56.510> him<00:04:57.040> so<00:04:58.040> overall<00:04:58.700> I<00:04:58.850> really<00:04:59.060> like<00:04:59.600> Ike<00:05:00.140> a

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
save him so overall I really like Ike a

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.340 
save him so overall I really like Ike a
devil's<00:05:00.680> character<00:05:01.250> design<00:05:01.670> as<00:05:02.120> well<00:05:02.150> as<00:05:02.840> just

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
devil's character design as well as just

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.400 
devil's character design as well as just
how<00:05:03.470> powerful<00:05:03.710> he<00:05:04.280> is<00:05:04.720> so<00:05:05.720> I'm<00:05:06.080> going<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.320> give

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
how powerful he is so I'm going to give

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
how powerful he is so I'm going to give
him<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.790> 4.4<00:05:07.790> 4.5<00:05:08.180> out<00:05:08.870> of<00:05:08.900> 5<00:05:09.350> I<00:05:09.740> take<00:05:09.800> off<00:05:10.190> half<00:05:10.400> a

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
him a 4.4 4.5 out of 5 I take off half a

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.810 
him a 4.4 4.5 out of 5 I take off half a
point<00:05:10.730> because<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:12.110> confusion<00:05:12.860> over<00:05:13.520> how

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
point because of the confusion over how

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.620 
point because of the confusion over how
he<00:05:13.880> survived<00:05:14.480> all<00:05:14.840> riders<00:05:15.110> vs<00:05:15.650> die<00:05:15.830> shocker<00:05:16.630> so

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
he survived all riders vs die shocker so

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.440 
he survived all riders vs die shocker so
and<00:05:17.840> also<00:05:18.440> even<00:05:19.130> though<00:05:19.370> that<00:05:19.580> I'm<00:05:19.700> not<00:05:19.940> taking

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
and also even though that I'm not taking

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.120 
and also even though that I'm not taking
points<00:05:20.750> off<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.110> list<00:05:21.320> what<00:05:21.800> was<00:05:21.890> kind<00:05:22.040> of

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
points off the list what was kind of

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.130 
points off the list what was kind of
confusing<00:05:22.580> was<00:05:23.030> his<00:05:23.480> transformation

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
confusing was his transformation

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.300 
confusing was his transformation
sequence<00:05:24.650> in<00:05:25.070> all<00:05:25.670> riders<00:05:26.030> vs<00:05:26.510> die<00:05:26.690> shocker

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
sequence in all riders vs die shocker

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.740 
sequence in all riders vs die shocker
which<00:05:28.310> was<00:05:28.670> what<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:29.000> sound<00:05:29.210> effects<00:05:29.570> that

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
which was what the sound effects that

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.360 
which was what the sound effects that
the<00:05:29.900> depend<00:05:30.290> hicks<00:05:30.560> at<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.860> beginning<00:05:31.280> of

the depend hicks at the beginning of
