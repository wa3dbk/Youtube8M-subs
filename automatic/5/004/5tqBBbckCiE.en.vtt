this and you put it on the model and get

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.139 
this and you put it on the model and get
a<00:00:49.260> rough<00:00:49.559> idea<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> length<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.910> about

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
a rough idea of the length so about

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.580 
a rough idea of the length so about
there<00:00:52.010> pinch<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.629> then<00:00:54.629> you'd<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.469> you'd

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
there pinch it then you'd go and you'd

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.979 
there pinch it then you'd go and you'd
cut<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.510> fold<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.960> half

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
cut that and then you fold it in half

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.270 
cut that and then you fold it in half
and<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.039> you'd<00:00:59.219> cut<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:01.469> next<00:01:01.770> shape<00:01:01.949> by

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and then you'd cut the next shape by

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
and then you'd cut the next shape by
going<00:01:02.579> down<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.120> scissors<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> then

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
across and being careful if anything

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.429 
across and being careful if anything
make<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.280> too<00:01:08.430> small<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.880> first<00:01:09.110> not<00:01:10.110> too<00:01:10.260> large

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
make it too small at first not too large

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.530 
make it too small at first not too large
and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.790> will<00:01:11.880> try<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.420> model

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and then you will try that on your model

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.719 
and then you will try that on your model
trim<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:14.010> length<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:16.130> trim<00:01:17.130> any<00:01:17.280> other<00:01:17.549> bits
