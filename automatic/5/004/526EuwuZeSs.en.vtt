now<00:00:00.510> we're<00:00:00.659> going<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.810> discuss<00:00:01.350> how<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:02.750> change

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
now we're going to discuss how to change

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.010 
now we're going to discuss how to change
a<00:00:03.929> master<00:00:04.319> code<00:00:04.529> how<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.310> add<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.730> user<00:00:06.060> code<00:00:06.420> and

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
a master code how to add a user code and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.810 
a master code how to add a user code and
how<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.200> add<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> duress<00:00:07.950> code<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:08.639> like

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
how to add the duress code that we like

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.299 
how to add the duress code that we like
to<00:00:08.970> put<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.269> all<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> panels<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> first

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
to put on all of the panels so the first

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.910 
to put on all of the panels so the first
thing<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.880> these<00:00:12.840> panels<00:00:13.139> everything<00:00:13.769> that

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
thing on these panels everything that

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.279 
thing on these panels everything that
you<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.429> your<00:00:14.549> four-digit<00:00:15.120> code<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.690> then

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
you do is your four-digit code and then

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.170 
you do is your four-digit code and then
a<00:00:16.320> command<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.490> commands<00:00:17.880> are<00:00:18.060> all

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
a command and your commands are all

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.510 
a command and your commands are all
written<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.869> each<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.350> these<00:00:19.439> buttons<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.130> so

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
written on each of these buttons here so

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.380 
written on each of these buttons here so
for<00:00:20.760> example<00:00:21.350> when<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> code<00:00:23.269> what<00:00:24.269> we're

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
for example when we do a code what we're

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.060 
for example when we do a code what we're
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.869> our<00:00:25.019> four<00:00:25.289> digit<00:00:25.590> master

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
going to do is our four digit master

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.099 
going to do is our four digit master
code<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.640> then<00:00:27.359> we're<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> press<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
code and then we're going to press the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.689 
code and then we're going to press the
number<00:00:28.349> eight<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.099> code<00:00:29.369> button

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
number eight which is the code button

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.240 
number eight which is the code button
and<00:00:29.960> then<00:00:30.960> we're<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.289> type<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.980> user

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and then we're going to type in the user

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.110 
and then we're going to type in the user
number<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.750> code<00:00:34.050> pertains<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
number that that code pertains to and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.490 
number that that code pertains to and
then<00:00:36.120> we're<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> type<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.380> name

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
then we're going to type in the name

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.639 
then we're going to type in the name
code<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.660> master<00:00:40.079> code<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.469> is

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
code so for a master code this is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.830 
code so for a master code this is
specific<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.370> master<00:00:41.760> code<00:00:41.940> our<00:00:42.540> current

which<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:52.350> specifically<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.670> master

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
which is for specifically for the master

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.660 
which is for specifically for the master
code<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:55.500> we're<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> type<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.399> our

new<00:00:57.539> master<00:00:57.989> code<00:00:58.260> two<00:00:59.010> times<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:02.070> goes

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
new master code two times so here goes

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.219 
new master code two times so here goes
one<00:01:02.969> two<00:01:03.359> three<00:01:03.809> four<00:01:04.229> eight<00:01:05.010> zero<00:01:05.309> two<00:01:06.229> corn

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
one two three four eight zero two corn

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
one two three four eight zero two corn
going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.159> two<00:01:08.540> corn<00:01:09.540> gone<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> that's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
going to two corn gone to two and that's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.600 
going to two corn gone to two and that's
now<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.869> new<00:01:13.170> master<00:01:13.590> code<00:01:13.770> now<00:01:14.430> there's

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
now the new master code now there's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.160 
now the new master code now there's
another<00:01:14.880> way<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> without<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
another way to do that without the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.030 
another way to do that without the
master<00:01:16.560> code<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.700> being<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> Installer<00:01:18.600> can

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
master code you being the Installer can

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.100 
master code you being the Installer can
actually<00:01:20.119> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> installer<00:01:22.020> code

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
actually if you have the installer code

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
actually if you have the installer code
you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.560> change<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.979> without<00:01:23.130> having<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.670> know

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you can change it without having to know

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.880 
you can change it without having to know
their<00:01:24.119> their<00:01:24.360> current<00:01:25.259> master<00:01:25.560> code<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
their their current master code you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.469 
their their current master code you
would<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.340> by<00:01:26.549> doing<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:27.060> installer

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
would do that by doing your installer

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
would do that by doing your installer
code<00:01:27.570> which<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.979> four<00:01:29.250> three<00:01:29.430> two

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
code which right now is four three two

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.840 
code which right now is four three two
one<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.799> would<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.070> eight<00:01:32.400> zero<00:01:32.759> two

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
one and then you would do eight zero two

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.819 
one and then you would do eight zero two
and<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> would<00:01:34.079> type<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> new

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and then you would type in the new

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.160 
and then you would type in the new
master<00:01:35.040> code<00:01:35.520> whatever<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.299> may<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.509> just

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
master code whatever that may be just

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.090 
master code whatever that may be just
one<00:01:37.470> time<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.369> doing<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:40.100> your

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
one time if you're doing this with your

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.120 
one time if you're doing this with your
installer<00:01:41.909> code<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.600> four<00:01:43.049> three<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.829> one

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
installer code so four three two one

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.789 
installer code so four three two one
eight<00:01:44.880> zero<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.479> I'm<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> change<00:01:46.680> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
eight zero two I'm going to change it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.999 
eight zero two I'm going to change it
back<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.130> two<00:01:47.610> three<00:01:48.030> four<00:01:48.420> okay<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.590> now

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
back to one two three four okay so now

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.730 
back to one two three four okay so now
one<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.670> three<00:01:50.700> four

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.630 
add a user code I like to start my user
codes<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.200> user<00:02:01.829> number<00:02:02.280> five<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.579> because

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
codes at user number five just because

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.330 
codes at user number five just because
user<00:02:05.640> three<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> partitioned<00:02:07.710> master<00:02:08.099> code

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
user three is a partitioned master code

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.900 
user three is a partitioned master code
and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.480 
and
I<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.690> feel<00:02:09.900> like<00:02:09.990> it's<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.290> good<00:02:10.440> spark<00:02:10.740> spot

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
I just feel like it's a good spark spot

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.550 
I just feel like it's a good spark spot
to<00:02:11.640> start<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.060> your<00:02:12.240> your<00:02:12.840> next<00:02:13.050> user<00:02:13.290> code

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
to start with your your next user code

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.340 
to start with your your next user code
so<00:02:13.830> we're<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> add<00:02:14.610> another<00:02:14.760> code<00:02:15.350> for

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
so we're going to add another code for

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.650 
so we're going to add another code for
let's<00:02:17.190> say<00:02:17.430> one<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> kids<00:02:18.270> at<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.480> house

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
let's say one of the kids at the house

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.750 
let's say one of the kids at the house
so<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.380> would<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.400> case

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
so you would have to have in this case

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.110 
so you would have to have in this case
the<00:02:21.090> master<00:02:21.480> code<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.350> you're<00:02:22.470> going<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> do

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
the master code so you're going to do

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.380 
the master code so you're going to do
master<00:02:24.120> code<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.570> code<00:02:24.720> button<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:27.150> then

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
master code the code button and then

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.020 
master code the code button and then
user<00:02:27.900> number<00:02:28.260> five<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.650> zero<00:02:28.890> five<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.490> then

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
user number five so zero five and then

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.340 
user number five so zero five and then
the<00:02:30.060> code<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.690> want<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.020> pertain<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
the code that you want to pertain to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.060 
the code that you want to pertain to
that<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:32.340> go<00:02:33.060> into<00:02:33.330> three<00:02:33.720> four<00:02:34.050> eight<00:02:34.740> zero

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
that so go into three four eight zero

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.460 
that so go into three four eight zero
five<00:02:35.790> we're<00:02:36.330> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.510> make<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.750> card<00:02:36.990> seven

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
five we're going to make this card seven

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.000 
five we're going to make this card seven
seven<00:02:37.920> seven<00:02:38.250> seven<00:02:39.080> now<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.290> has<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> timeout

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
seven seven seven now this has a timeout

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.670 
seven seven seven now this has a timeout
if<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.400> stop<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.360> keystrokes<00:02:43.050> for<00:02:43.200> more<00:02:43.530> than

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
if you stop the keystrokes for more than

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.920 
if you stop the keystrokes for more than
two<00:02:43.830> seconds<00:02:44.280> then<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:45.450> actually<00:02:45.840> going

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
two seconds then it's not actually going

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.000 
two seconds then it's not actually going
to<00:02:45.990> work<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.770> do<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
to work for you so you have to do it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.400 
to work for you so you have to do it
fairly<00:02:47.220> quickly<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.820> now<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.020> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
fairly quickly so now if I do the the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.170 
fairly quickly so now if I do the the
code<00:02:49.710> that<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:49.950> put<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.310> seven<00:02:50.820> seven

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
code that I just put in seven seven

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.590 
code that I just put in seven seven
seven<00:02:51.420> seven<00:02:51.840> okay<00:02:52.740> that<00:02:53.280> works<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:56.450> then<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
seven seven okay that works and then the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.000 
seven seven okay that works and then the
last<00:02:57.780> thing<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.350> need<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.560> do<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:58.920> this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
last thing that we need to do and this

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.980 
last thing that we need to do and this
is<00:02:59.070> really<00:02:59.430> important<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.060> program<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
is really important is program the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.930 
is really important is program the
duress<00:03:01.320> code<00:03:01.590> now<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.490> program<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
duress code now for to program the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.540 
duress code now for to program the
duress<00:03:03.210> code<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.020> have<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.950> current

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
duress code you have to have the current

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.880 
duress code you have to have the current
master<00:03:05.730> code<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:07.050> if<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.320> don't<00:03:07.560> have<00:03:07.770> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
master code and if you don't have the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.470 
master code and if you don't have the
current<00:03:08.160> master<00:03:08.490> code<00:03:08.520> then<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.210> do<00:03:09.330> what

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
current master code then you can do what

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.850 
current master code then you can do what
I<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.750> showed<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.140> can<00:03:10.260> use<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
I just showed you you can use the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.830 
I just showed you you can use the
installer<00:03:11.220> code<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:12.060> change<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> code

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
installer code to change it to a code

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.720 
installer code to change it to a code
you<00:03:13.020> know<00:03:13.170> which<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.890> know<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.040> always<00:03:14.220> use<00:03:14.520> one

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
you know which you know I always use one

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.130 
you know which you know I always use one
two<00:03:14.910> three<00:03:15.120> four<00:03:15.360> since<00:03:15.630> that's<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> default

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
two three four since that's the default

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.160 
two three four since that's the default
anyway<00:03:16.710> um<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.120> right<00:03:18.450> now<00:03:18.630> it's<00:03:18.810> one<00:03:18.990> two

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
anyway um so right now it's one two

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.740 
anyway um so right now it's one two
three<00:03:19.440> four<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.890> here's<00:03:20.670> here's<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.420> cycle

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
three four and here's here's the cycle

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.210 
three four and here's here's the cycle
that<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.930> would<00:03:22.050> go<00:03:22.170> through<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:23.160> you're

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
that you would go through so you're

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.430 
that you would go through so you're
going<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.430> do<00:03:23.550> one<00:03:23.820> two<00:03:24.090> three<00:03:24.510> four<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.200> code

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
going to do one two three four the code

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.610 
going to do one two three four the code
button<00:03:25.860> user<00:03:26.400> 32<00:03:27.210> and<00:03:27.510> then<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.290> duress<00:03:28.590> code

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
button user 32 and then the duress code

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.530 
button user 32 and then the duress code
two<00:03:29.160> five<00:03:29.640> eight<00:03:30.000> zero<00:03:31.040> okay<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.820> puts

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
two five eight zero okay so that puts

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.970 
two five eight zero okay so that puts
the<00:03:33.690> code<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.050> but<00:03:34.260> that's<00:03:34.440> not<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:34.710> to<00:03:34.770> send

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
the code in but that's not going to send

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.120 
the code in but that's not going to send
any<00:03:35.040> signals<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.200> monitoring<00:03:37.590> station

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
any signals to the monitoring station

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.940 
any signals to the monitoring station
because<00:03:38.520> it's<00:03:38.700> not<00:03:39.230> authorized<00:03:40.230> as<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> dress

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
because it's not authorized as a dress

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.480 
because it's not authorized as a dress
yet<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.670> authorize<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.360> as<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> duress<00:03:42.930> code

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
yet so to authorize it as a duress code

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.790 
yet so to authorize it as a duress code
you<00:03:44.490> do<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.760> following<00:03:44.910> go<00:03:45.450> into<00:03:45.870> three<00:03:46.380> for

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
you do the following go into three for

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.900 
you do the following go into three for
user<00:03:48.740> 32<00:03:49.740> and<00:03:49.980> then<00:03:50.459> you're<00:03:50.580> going<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.820> do

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
user 32 and then you're going to do
