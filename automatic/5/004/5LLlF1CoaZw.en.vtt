some earlier ones that don't look
anywhere<00:03:06.639> near<00:03:06.849> as<00:03:07.030> good<00:03:07.090> there's<00:03:07.750> one<00:03:08.079> red

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
anywhere near as good there's one red

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.199 
anywhere near as good there's one red
piece<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:08.829> this<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.219> actually<00:03:09.669> not<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.849> sticker

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
piece so this is actually not a sticker

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.000 
piece so this is actually not a sticker
here<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:10.719> when<00:03:11.290> you're<00:03:11.379> putting<00:03:11.560> on<00:03:11.769> this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
here and when you're putting on this

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.830 
here and when you're putting on this
it's<00:03:12.280> actually<00:03:12.400> yellow<00:03:12.909> eyes<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.659> put<00:03:13.810> a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
it's actually yellow eyes that you put a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.559 
it's actually yellow eyes that you put a
black<00:03:14.109> sticker<00:03:14.590> around<00:03:15.189> so<00:03:15.939> that<00:03:16.090> gives<00:03:16.389> it<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
black sticker around so that gives it a

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.780 
black sticker around so that gives it a
real<00:03:16.750> pop<00:03:17.019> feature<00:03:17.349> put<00:03:18.129> some<00:03:18.340> black<00:03:18.489> lining

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
real pop feature put some black lining

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.729 
real pop feature put some black lining
in<00:03:18.970> there<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.389> can<00:03:19.540> make<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.870> look<00:03:20.229> really

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
in there and you can make it look really

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.119 
in there and you can make it look really
sharp<00:03:20.979> red<00:03:21.459> seal<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.419> big<00:03:22.659> red<00:03:23.290> jewel<00:03:23.590> so

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
sharp red seal and a big red jewel so

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.009 
sharp red seal and a big red jewel so
it's<00:03:24.310> simplistic<00:03:24.760> but<00:03:25.479> I<00:03:25.540> think<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.840> looks

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
it's simplistic but I think it looks

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.990 
it's simplistic but I think it looks
pretty<00:03:26.260> good<00:03:26.379> overall<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:27.220> beam<00:03:27.430> rifle<00:03:27.639> looks

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
pretty good overall the beam rifle looks

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.789 
pretty good overall the beam rifle looks
good<00:03:28.269> if<00:03:28.419> you<00:03:28.510> put<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.780> some<00:03:28.989> black<00:03:29.169> lining<00:03:29.680> it

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
good if you put on some black lining it

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.460 
good if you put on some black lining it
has<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.489> yellow<00:03:31.060> sticker<00:03:31.419> up<00:03:31.720> here<00:03:32.049> on<00:03:32.229> the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
has a yellow sticker up here on the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.949 
has a yellow sticker up here on the
front<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:33.400> goes<00:03:33.639> up<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.569> down<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.930> the

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
front and this goes up and down to the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.559 
front and this goes up and down to the
side<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.819> wanted<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.879> complain<00:03:37.269> about<00:03:37.359> the

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
side I wanted to complain about the

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.939 
side I wanted to complain about the
shield<00:03:37.750> when<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.019> started<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.379> make<00:03:38.439> it<00:03:38.709> but<00:03:38.859> it

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
shield when I started to make it but it

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.439 
shield when I started to make it but it
came<00:03:39.069> out<00:03:39.220> much<00:03:39.370> better<00:03:39.549> than<00:03:39.669> I<00:03:39.849> expected

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
came out much better than I expected

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.420 
came out much better than I expected
first<00:03:41.079> as<00:03:41.319> far<00:03:41.500> as<00:03:41.590> attaching<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.099> onto<00:03:42.340> the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
first as far as attaching it onto the

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.439 
first as far as attaching it onto the
arm<00:03:42.459> you'll<00:03:42.759> notice<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.120> there's<00:03:43.359> two

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
arm you'll notice that there's two

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.960 
arm you'll notice that there's two
grooves<00:03:44.169> on<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.590> left<00:03:44.769> arm<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.159> that<00:03:45.699> just

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
grooves on the left arm and that just

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.030 
grooves on the left arm and that just
slides<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.479> and<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.870> stays<00:03:47.079> in<00:03:47.379> fairly<00:03:47.829> well

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
slides in and it stays in fairly well

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.860 
slides in and it stays in fairly well
but<00:03:48.729> what's<00:03:48.939> sort<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.239> sucked<00:03:49.479> about<00:03:49.599> it<00:03:49.810> I

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
but what's sort of sucked about it I

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.539 
but what's sort of sucked about it I
thought<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:50.259> that<00:03:50.439> this<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.799> all<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.280> one<00:03:51.400> big

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
thought is that this is all just one big

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.729 
thought is that this is all just one big
gray<00:03:52.060> piece<00:03:52.329> and<00:03:52.629> what<00:03:53.109> you<00:03:53.229> do<00:03:53.319> is<00:03:53.439> you<00:03:53.530> put<00:03:53.709> on

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
gray piece and what you do is you put on

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.409 
gray piece and what you do is you put on
a<00:03:53.829> yellow<00:03:54.220> sticker<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.669> make<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.909> cross<00:03:55.150> and

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
a yellow sticker to make the cross and

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.119 
a yellow sticker to make the cross and
then<00:03:55.599> this<00:03:55.810> whole<00:03:56.049> thing<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.409> a<00:03:56.439> giant<00:03:56.709> sticker

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
then this whole thing is a giant sticker

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.589 
then this whole thing is a giant sticker
that<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.370> have<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.549> put<00:03:57.699> on<00:03:57.790> fairly<00:03:58.060> carefully

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
that you have to put on fairly carefully

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.569 
that you have to put on fairly carefully
but<00:03:59.139> overall<00:03:59.560> just<00:03:59.949> from<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.159> little<00:04:00.400> bit<00:04:00.459> of

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
but overall just from a little bit of

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.030 
but overall just from a little bit of
distance<00:04:00.759> I<00:04:01.150> think<00:04:01.599> it<00:04:01.689> looks<00:04:01.870> good<00:04:02.169> putting

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
distance I think it looks good putting

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.800 
distance I think it looks good putting
this<00:04:03.220> together<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.819> involves<00:04:04.329> putting<00:04:04.569> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
this together just involves putting the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.270 
this together just involves putting the
waste<00:04:05.199> onto<00:04:05.590> there

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
waste onto there

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.369 
waste onto there
pop<00:04:06.759> the<00:04:06.970> shoulder<00:04:07.359> on<00:04:07.540> first<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.259> then

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
pop the shoulder on first and then

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.679 
pop the shoulder on first and then
follow<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.769> up<00:04:08.919> with<00:04:08.979> the<00:04:09.189> arm<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.579> pop<00:04:10.209> the

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
follow it up with the arm and pop the

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.759 
follow it up with the arm and pop the
head<00:04:10.989> on<00:04:11.949> like<00:04:12.699> subtle<00:04:13.199> when<00:04:14.199> all<00:04:14.379> is<00:04:14.560> said<00:04:14.590> and

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
head on like subtle when all is said and

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.469 
head on like subtle when all is said and
done<00:04:15.090> here's<00:04:16.090> how<00:04:16.389> it<00:04:16.539> looks<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:18.549> spin

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
done here's how it looks and a spin

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.940 
done here's how it looks and a spin
around

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.700 

as<00:04:23.150> for<00:04:24.150> size<00:04:24.300> comparison<00:04:24.330> he's<00:04:25.110> quite<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.470> bit

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
as for size comparison he's quite a bit

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.310 
as for size comparison he's quite a bit
smaller<00:04:26.010> than<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.490> SD<00:04:27.030> double<00:04:27.840> Oh<00:04:27.960> Gundam

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
some of the old master grades and I'm

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.860 
some of the old master grades and I'm
looking<00:05:02.250> at<00:05:02.370> your<00:05:02.550> double<00:05:02.880> SATA<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.180> GP<00:05:03.540> o2a

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
looking at your double SATA and GP o2a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.170 
looking at your double SATA and GP o2a
so<00:05:04.680> though<00:05:04.830> at<00:05:04.980> first<00:05:05.220> glance<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:05.760> may<00:05:05.940> look

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
so though at first glance this may look

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.970 
so though at first glance this may look
like<00:05:06.300> some<00:05:06.540> of<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.720> older<00:05:07.020> SD<00:05:07.350> condoms<00:05:07.740> in
