here I found this one just randomly and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.680 
here I found this one just randomly and
I'm<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> start<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:47.539> going<00:00:48.539> ahead

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
I'm going to start out with going ahead

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.439 
I'm going to start out with going ahead
and<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:50.190> sharpening<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.210> bit

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and just sharpening it up a little bit

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.689 
and just sharpening it up a little bit
and<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:52.469> I'm<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.160> how<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> got

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and what I'm going to do is how I got

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.549 
and what I'm going to do is how I got
that<00:00:53.969> here's<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.170> think<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that here's what I think I think that

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.410 
that here's what I think I think that
every<00:00:55.920> NASA<00:00:56.190> picture<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.910> comes<00:00:57.059> back

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
every NASA picture that comes back

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.260 
every NASA picture that comes back
because<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.170> each<00:00:58.350> rover<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> color

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
because from each rover that the color

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
because from each rover that the color
of<00:01:00.420> Mars<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:01.109> been<00:01:01.289> different<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.039> look

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
of Mars has been different if you look

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
of Mars has been different if you look
at<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.579> spirit<00:01:03.120> Rovers<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.989> look<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.290> some

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
at the spirit Rovers if you look at some

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.570 
at the spirit Rovers if you look at some
of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> other<00:01:04.680> ones<00:01:04.949> they<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.400> look

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
of the other ones they just look

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.330 
of the other ones they just look
different<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.100> ahead<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
different so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.910 
different so I'm going to go ahead and
drop<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> temperature<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.570> which<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.650> think

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
drop the temperature down which I think

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.219 
drop the temperature down which I think
this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.299> how<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.020> going

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
this is I think this is how it's going

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.510 
this is I think this is how it's going
to<00:01:13.290> look<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.040> would<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.369> made

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to look because this would have made

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.350 
to look because this would have made
this<00:01:14.670> guy<00:01:14.970> blue<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:16.070> if<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.670> had<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> picture

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
this guy blue if if it was had a picture

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.550 
this guy blue if if it was had a picture
in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> sky<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.790> okay<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.560> let

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.480 
in the sky at it so okay here we are let
me<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:22.799> ahead<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.040> close<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> out<00:01:24.119> now

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
thought that was too cool over here now

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.200 
thought that was too cool over here now
this<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.929> what<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:05.250> blew<00:02:05.550> my<00:02:05.729> mind<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this is what really blew my mind a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.060 
this is what really blew my mind a
couple<00:02:06.390> things<00:02:06.720> these<00:02:06.929> look<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
couple things these look just like the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.170 
couple things these look just like the
puma<00:02:08.489> punku<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.489> where<00:02:11.850> they<00:02:12.030> actually

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
puma punku you know where they actually

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.630 
puma punku you know where they actually
quarry<00:02:12.750> some<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.290> these<00:02:13.410> rocks<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:14.489> you

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
quarry some of these rocks and if you

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.670 
quarry some of these rocks and if you
look<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.970> there<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.600> see<00:02:15.630> there's<00:02:16.320> a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
look up there you can see there's a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.140 
look up there you can see there's a
couple<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:18.180> couple<00:02:19.140> evidence<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.950> look

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
couple a couple evidence and it look

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.130 
couple a couple evidence and it look
dividends<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.480> then<00:02:21.600> look<00:02:21.750> at<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.930> right

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
dividends and then look at this right

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.580 
dividends and then look at this right
here<00:02:22.250> dividends<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.400> couple<00:02:23.820> divots<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:25.080> if

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
here dividends a couple divots and if

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.890 
here dividends a couple divots and if
you<00:02:25.680> look<00:02:25.709> here<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.790> block<00:02:27.180> looks<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.720> it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you look here this block looks like it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.320 
you look here this block looks like it
was<00:02:28.470> going<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.040> chiseled<00:02:29.340> out<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.910> used

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
was going to be chiseled out and used

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.860 
was going to be chiseled out and used
and<00:02:30.630> if<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:32.040> come<00:02:32.370> down<00:02:32.610> here<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.480> rock

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
and if you come down here this rock

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.520 
and if you come down here this rock
seems<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.769> have<00:02:37.950> hieroglyphics<00:02:38.579> on<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.530> it's

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
seems to have hieroglyphics on it it's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.080 
seems to have hieroglyphics on it it's
going<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.799> be<00:02:40.890> hard<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.250> see<00:02:41.610> if<00:02:41.850> you're<00:02:44.090> if

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
going to be hard to see if you're if

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.539 
going to be hard to see if you're if
you're<00:02:45.299> not<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.630> HD<00:02:46.110> but<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:47.010> looks<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.280> it's

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
you're not in HD but it looks like it's

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.400 
you're not in HD but it looks like it's
got<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> w<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.870> an<00:02:49.470> o<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.280> s<00:02:52.250> CW<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> 0<00:02:54.810> and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
got a w on it an o and s CW like a 0 and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.580 
got a w on it an o and s CW like a 0 and
s<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.160> just<00:02:56.940> looks<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.299> here<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.049> here<00:02:58.440> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
s and just looks like here and here that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.650 
s and just looks like here and here that
actually<00:02:58.799> has<00:02:59.130> some<00:02:59.370> writing<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.910> it<00:02:59.970> now<00:03:00.600> I

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
actually has some writing on it now I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.300 
actually has some writing on it now I
was<00:03:01.049> thinking<00:03:01.380> well<00:03:01.530> maybe<00:03:01.560> that's<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.160> a

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
was thinking well maybe that's just a

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.030 
was thinking well maybe that's just a
JPEG<00:03:02.760> artifacts<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:03.690> looking<00:03:04.260> around<00:03:04.380> I

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
JPEG artifacts but looking around I

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.720 
JPEG artifacts but looking around I
don't<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.060> anywhere<00:03:06.780> else<00:03:07.400> let<00:03:08.400> me<00:03:08.519> see

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
don't see that anywhere else let me see

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.420 
don't see that anywhere else let me see
if<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.940> can<00:03:09.239> bring<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.230> out<00:03:10.739> just<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.370> little

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
if I can bring that out just a little

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.789 
if I can bring that out just a little
bit<00:03:11.610> more<00:03:11.940> with<00:03:12.690> some<00:03:12.720> brightness<00:03:13.590> and

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
bit more with some brightness and

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.619 
bit more with some brightness and
contrast

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:25.479 

here<00:03:17.629> we<00:03:17.810> are<00:03:20.890> see<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.129> w's<00:03:22.760> dosed<00:03:23.450> esas<00:03:24.489> that

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
here we are see the w's dosed esas that

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.929 
here we are see the w's dosed esas that
could<00:03:25.700> just<00:03:25.939> be<00:03:26.030> sand<00:03:26.890> blasted<00:03:27.939> throughout

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
could just be sand blasted throughout

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.440 
could just be sand blasted throughout
the<00:03:29.120> years<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:29.780> they<00:03:30.709> dropped<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.450> contrast

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
the years but they dropped the contrast

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.740 
the years but they dropped the contrast
back<00:03:32.689> down<00:03:33.099> but<00:03:34.099> here<00:03:34.370> is<00:03:34.459> very<00:03:35.120> interesting

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
back down but here is very interesting

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.479 
back down but here is very interesting
how<00:03:35.989> it's<00:03:36.200> got<00:03:36.470> these<00:03:36.709> uh<00:03:37.239> it's<00:03:38.239> almost<00:03:38.569> like

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
how it's got these uh it's almost like

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.770 
how it's got these uh it's almost like
it's<00:03:40.489> almost<00:03:40.730> like<00:03:41.000> they've<00:03:41.150> taken<00:03:41.359> blocks

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
it's almost like they've taken blocks

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.020 
it's almost like they've taken blocks
from<00:03:42.019> here<00:03:42.379> and<00:03:42.590> they<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:43.489> they<00:03:43.549> used<00:03:43.909> them

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
from here and they and they used them

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.080 
from here and they and they used them
somewhere<00:03:44.450> else<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:44.900> Mars<00:03:45.519> if<00:03:46.519> you<00:03:46.730> know<00:03:46.939> my

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
somewhere else on Mars if you know my

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.210 
somewhere else on Mars if you know my
mind<00:03:47.870> what<00:03:48.109> I<00:03:48.140> think<00:03:48.440> happened<00:03:48.620> there<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:48.980> think

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
mind what I think happened there I think

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.300 
mind what I think happened there I think
life<00:03:49.549> was<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:50.000> Mars<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.420> long<00:03:50.690> time<00:03:50.959> ago<00:03:51.109> and<00:03:51.470> up

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
life was on Mars a long time ago and up

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.309 
life was on Mars a long time ago and up
at<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.489> top<00:03:52.579> here<00:03:52.849> i'm<00:03:53.480> just<00:03:53.690> going<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.870> reset

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
at the top here i'm just going to reset

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.770 
at the top here i'm just going to reset
it<00:03:54.349> this<00:03:55.220> almost<00:03:55.489> looks<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.940> seem<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.359> a<00:03:56.389> like

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
it this almost looks a seem like a like

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.349 
it this almost looks a seem like a like
a<00:03:56.810> wall<00:03:57.109> basically<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:58.190> was<00:03:58.430> at<00:03:59.090> one<00:03:59.329> time

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
a wall basically that was at one time

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.440 
a wall basically that was at one time
maybe<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.959> wall<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:01.489> many<00:04:01.730> things<00:04:02.030> on<00:04:02.180> earth

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
maybe a wall so many things on earth

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.229 
maybe a wall so many things on earth
after<00:04:02.900> just<00:04:03.470> hundreds<00:04:04.069> of<00:04:04.250> dials<00:04:04.730> are<00:04:04.970> just

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
after just hundreds of dials are just

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.539 
after just hundreds of dials are just
after<00:04:05.599> like<00:04:05.780> thousands<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:06.859> years<00:04:07.250> were

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
after like thousands of years were

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.789 
after like thousands of years were
buried<00:04:08.060> under<00:04:08.329> sand<00:04:08.599> imagine<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.409> this<00:04:09.560> was

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
buried under sand imagine that this was

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.220 
buried under sand imagine that this was
like<00:04:09.950> million<00:04:10.730> years<00:04:10.970> old<00:04:11.180> what<00:04:11.780> would<00:04:12.049> be

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
like million years old what would be

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.180 
like million years old what would be
buried<00:04:13.840> these<00:04:14.840> are<00:04:15.079> very<00:04:15.260> interesting<00:04:15.950> these

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
buried these are very interesting these

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.699 
buried these are very interesting these
look<00:04:16.400> like<00:04:16.430> triangle<00:04:17.389> shapes<00:04:18.169> that<00:04:18.349> have<00:04:18.590> been

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
look like triangle shapes that have been

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.120 
look like triangle shapes that have been
buried<00:04:19.959> see<00:04:20.959> over<00:04:21.199> here<00:04:21.229> there's<00:04:21.889> another

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
buried see over here there's another

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.250
