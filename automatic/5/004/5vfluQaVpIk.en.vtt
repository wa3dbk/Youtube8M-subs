00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.570
 hi people i'll give you two today 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.730
 introduce different shoes once 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.400
 the calendar of one of the most popular 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.990
 shoves in my favorite school ladder 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.570
 now the new version i had us 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.680
 last years the two and the 3 and 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.849
 I'll just go to the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.310
 compare with each other and through 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.470
 imagine the calendar costs 20 euros 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.829
 and so he is very cheap force 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.050
 also so popular now a dress up 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.649
 about 90 euros one of the cheaper 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.649
 at the live shows 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.230
 I have to fine shoes exactly the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.430
 made equal leaps and general 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.810
 I have to say that both times 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.590
 shoes are very suitable for 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.080
 make course 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.810
 who is now a four is just as good 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.750
 like the 2 and 3 version had a lot 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.000
 good wearing comfort it really soft on 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.830
 foot but has nevertheless extremely sturdy, 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.660
 by the fact that here behind a plastic 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.180
 element is installed on the hack what that 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.380
 Football state when wearing comfort notes 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.420
 one the difference between the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.250
 more expensive and cheaper 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.770
 Calendar calendar is made sturdy 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.980
 actually quite well processed but 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.750
 time is not even at the foot of the unite 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.670
 has a firm sole which also relatively 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.870
 has gone through the fast 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.340
 I have been around for a year now 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.290
 did not you wear that way? 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.560
 but nevertheless the sum is already 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.700
 pretty much gone through and hard and the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.200
 Shoe does not adapt so well 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.760
 like this one today I have that 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.470
 first time and he is already sitting perfectly 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.830
 for not being so comfortable on the foot 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.750
 sitting had karl angelina better luck 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.100
 on the wall it can, however, too 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.480
 again that's why I'm already 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.190
 have registered and yet not 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.360
 Usually the club gets better then 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.160
 the wall if the sole a bit 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.209
 expired which is located at the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.650
 summit also refill 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.410
 So had the previous models 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.060
 actually other very good grip 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.500
 So in conclusion , I would say that 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.090
 Both shoes are very suitable for 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.239
 It's easy then to do a course 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.430
 matter of taste what is important to you 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.120
 shoe is very cheap for that is the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.290
 Do not boom so well it's going away relatively quickly 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.590
 the grip is a bit better for that 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.660
 and the schooling of much cheaper 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.660
 wearing comfort is not so good 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.120
 this one is much more comfortable on the foot 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.590
 one is better summarizes the foot of are 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.360
 a bit more stability in that he 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.280
 here has this plastic element on the hook 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.480
 the damping is very cool and holds well 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.010
 I almost had a thing for a while 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.370
 forget the weight of the 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.740
 shoes 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.080
 there are both about equally good both 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.790
 are very easy and you can do both well 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.350
 I hope I could help you 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.030
 today, the two schools would not be in favor 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.690
 I have the flyer with you 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.280
 presented 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.350
 I will be in the next time too 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.640
 introduce other models subscribed 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.480
 Just watch my channel then you were 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.650
