this kind of stall fashion and then we

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.450 
this kind of stall fashion and then we
go<00:00:58.859> into<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> throw<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.879> Mandela<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.590> playing

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
go into a throw or Mandela but playing

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420 
go into a throw or Mandela but playing
around<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.170> whoa<00:01:04.710> there's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
around with it I was like whoa there's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.010 
around with it I was like whoa there's
all<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:05.729> other<00:01:05.790> things<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.780> do

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
all these other things that you can do

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440 
all these other things that you can do
instead<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.830> taking<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> hoop<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:09.030> behind

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
instead of taking the hoop from behind

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.899 
instead of taking the hoop from behind
the<00:01:09.570> back<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.750> moving<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.590> an<00:01:10.830> outside<00:01:11.580> move

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the back and moving into an outside move

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.020 
the back and moving into an outside move
so<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.020> first<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> pass

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
so this first one we are going to pass

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.929 
so this first one we are going to pass
to<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.049> elbow<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> opposite<00:01:17.580> elbow

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
to this elbow or the opposite elbow
that's<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.450> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.840> doing<00:01:19.530> nothing

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that's just kind of like doing nothing

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100
