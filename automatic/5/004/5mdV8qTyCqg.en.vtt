but<00:01:14.250> my<00:01:15.150> first<00:01:15.570> concern<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.740> strengthen

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
but my first concern was to strengthen

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.740 
but my first concern was to strengthen
up<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:18.060> defense<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> decided<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> give<00:01:20.280> away

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
up my defense so I decided to give away

Smeltzer and get myself jethro Williams
I<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> horrible<00:01:26.490> decision<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.390> put

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
I know it was a horrible decision to put

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.020 
I know it was a horrible decision to put
five<00:01:28.439> million<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.549> bit<00:01:29.850> extra<00:01:30.659> onto

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
five million on that bit extra onto

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.480 
five million on that bit extra onto
smelter<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.630> yeah<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> really<00:01:34.710> wanted<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> get

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
smelter but yeah I really wanted to get

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.640 
smelter but yeah I really wanted to get
rid<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> smelter<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.750> he<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
rid of smelter because I think he is a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.090 
rid of smelter because I think he is a
very<00:01:38.189> very<00:01:38.490> bad<00:01:38.970> player<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.259> as<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.829> see

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
very very bad player but as you can see

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
very very bad player but as you can see
