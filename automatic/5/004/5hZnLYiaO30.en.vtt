 early months 2014 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 also in this case it is one 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.140
 android smartphone with interface 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.890
 classic of andora of therefore without 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.449
 customizations that I personally 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.520
 the approach I prefer and with 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.719
 numerous interesting android content 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.600
 4.2 dual core 1.2 gigahertz processor 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.120

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:59.320
 find on the middle range i 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:02.500
 smartphone android 4 storage 512 gb 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.299
 megabytes of ram rear camera 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.299
 what a maximum we have been before from 5 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.690
 megapixels and a battery can under the 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.369
 rear body in plastic from me 630 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.080
 milian for then considering that it is a 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.759
 dual core from 1 2 to 2 gb to have 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.330
 an interesting autonomy not but if not 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.990
 of course this we said will be an entry 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.890
 level 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.649
 we understand this by looking at why 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.070
 however the phone a little bit more 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.030
 often 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.060
 compared to what we have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.560
 shown here is a profile of 10,000 5 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.780
 mm is however has its own particular 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.090
 originality you are already seeing for example 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.040
 luca told him here we don't have 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.630
 customizations here for example see 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.909
 the apps for this less than the part 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.990
 above the widget and application display 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.689
 that you have installed what is a 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.299
 a sort of subdivision of your gods 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.310
 your content that appears simple 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.469
 linear and then of course you can have 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 have access to everything I have 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.880

 possible to recover on the 9 39 of of 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 hashish 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.170

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.330

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.340
