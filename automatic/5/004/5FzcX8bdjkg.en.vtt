00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.780 
so of course we have some experiences
from<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> last<00:01:24.420> days<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:25.770> not<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.670> know

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
from the last days we will not you know

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.890 
from the last days we will not you know
test<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> whole<00:01:27.450> range<00:01:27.720> again<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.130> have

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
test the whole range again so we have

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
test the whole range again so we have
certain<00:01:30.900> favorite<00:01:31.170> favourites<00:01:32.040> already<00:01:32.729> in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
certain favorite favourites already in

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.469 
certain favorite favourites already in
the<00:01:33.509> line<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.790> approximately<00:01:35.790> four

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the line and then approximately four

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.340 
the line and then approximately four
five<00:01:37.110> versions<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:38.970> classic<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
five versions and the same classic and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.859 
five versions and the same classic and
is<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> difficult<00:01:41.340> today<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.600> we

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
is it difficult today with we have we

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.270 
is it difficult today with we have we
have<00:01:42.990> clear<00:01:43.259> skies<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.890> there's<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> good

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
have clear skies so there's a good

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
have clear skies so there's a good
chance<00:01:44.340> we'll<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.820> Sun<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> stadium<00:01:45.750> for

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
chance we'll have Sun in the stadium for

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
chance we'll have Sun in the stadium for
the<00:01:46.409> grip<00:01:46.619> wax<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> forest<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the grip wax and then in the forest it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.880 
the grip wax and then in the forest it
might<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.500> slightly<00:01:49.500> different<00:01:49.829> how<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
might be slightly different how do you

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
might be slightly different how do you
how<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.040> select<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.520> wax<00:01:53.759> when<00:01:54.060> when<00:01:54.420> maybe

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
how do you select a wax when when maybe

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.660 
how do you select a wax when when maybe
even<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.409> many<00:01:55.590> hours<00:01:55.860> before<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> race<00:01:56.369> time

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
even so many hours before the race time

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.580 
even so many hours before the race time
it<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.329> still<00:01:57.659> may<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.930> little<00:01:58.079> unknown<00:01:58.380> what

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it it still may be a little unknown what

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.219 
it it still may be a little unknown what
the<00:01:58.710> temperature<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.759> difficult

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
the temperature will do is it difficult

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.569 
the temperature will do is it difficult
it<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.409> difficult<00:02:01.890> today<00:02:02.009> because<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> has

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
it is difficult today because it has

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.060 
it is difficult today because it has
warmed<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.180> compared<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> yesterday<00:02:04.380> quite

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
warmed up compared to yesterday quite

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.300 
warmed up compared to yesterday quite
dramatically<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.329> about<00:02:06.750> 5:15<00:02:07.530> -<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
dramatically it was about 5:15 - in the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.070 
dramatically it was about 5:15 - in the
mountain<00:02:08.640> yesterday<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.660> morning<00:02:09.720> it

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
mountain yesterday and this morning it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.199 
mountain yesterday and this morning it
was<00:02:10.259> only<00:02:10.470> -<00:02:10.709> -<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.580> supposed<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.940> warm

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
was only - - and it's supposed to warm

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.900 
was only - - and it's supposed to warm
up<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
up to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.840 
up to
five<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.500> let's<00:02:14.500> see<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.400> snow<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.700> still

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
five and let's see the the snow is still

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.480 
five and let's see the the snow is still
dry<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.360> cold<00:02:16.660> but<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.680> said<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
dry and cold but as you said in the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.070 
dry and cold but as you said in the
sunny<00:02:18.700> parts<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.240> will<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.720> will<00:02:19.930> be

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
sunny parts that will it will be

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.870 
sunny parts that will it will be
different<00:02:20.260> than<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> woods<00:02:21.430> so

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
different than in the in the woods so

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.150 
different than in the in the woods so
you<00:02:21.940> have<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.240> find<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.630> combination<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.320> both

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
you have to find the combination of both

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.230 
you have to find the combination of both
you<00:02:24.610> know<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.990> shade<00:02:25.990> parts<00:02:26.410> are<00:02:26.970> mostly<00:02:27.970> dry

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
you know the shade parts are mostly dry

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.840 
you know the shade parts are mostly dry
and<00:02:28.510> then<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:29.230> Sun<00:02:29.470> parts<00:02:29.770> will<00:02:30.160> get<00:02:30.400> wet<00:02:30.610> and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and then the Sun parts will get wet and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.850 
and then the Sun parts will get wet and
then<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:30.970> have<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:31.480> which<00:02:31.900> part<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.350> you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
then you have to see which part is you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.280 
then you have to see which part is you
know<00:02:32.980> bigger<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.730> then<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.810> adapt

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
know bigger and then you have to adapt

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.400 
know bigger and then you have to adapt
to<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.590> situation<00:02:36.330> sounds<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.750> long<00:02:38.140> and
