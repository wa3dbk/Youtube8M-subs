this<00:01:49.000> retails<00:01:49.450> for<00:01:49.600> 749<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.310> u.s.<00:01:51.640> if<00:01:51.880> you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
this retails for 749 in the u.s. if you

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.580 
this retails for 749 in the u.s. if you
have<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.150> Sally's<00:01:52.690> card<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.200> think<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.440> might<00:01:53.560> be

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
have a Sally's card I think it might be

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.300 
have a Sally's card I think it might be
899<00:01:54.310> if<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.700> don't<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:56.350> canadians<00:01:56.920> i<00:01:57.040> think<00:01:57.250> i

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
899 if you don't for canadians i think i

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.850 
899 if you don't for canadians i think i
paid<00:01:57.520> eleven<00:01:57.970> dollars<00:01:58.150> for<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:59.170> wasn't

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.260 
paid eleven dollars for this I wasn't
really<00:02:00.040> sure<00:02:00.189> because<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.790> price<00:02:01.030> wasn't

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
really sure because the price wasn't

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.820

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.270 

okay<00:05:24.630> so<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:26.050> think<00:05:26.520> ironically<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.970> anastasia

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
okay so I think ironically the anastasia

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.779 
okay so I think ironically the anastasia
brow<00:05:30.280> stuff<00:05:30.669> looks<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:31.060> lot<00:05:31.210> darker<00:05:31.810> than<00:05:32.789> the

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
brow stuff looks a lot darker than the

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.740 
brow stuff looks a lot darker than the
ardell<00:05:34.180> stuff<00:05:34.479> on<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:34.990> brow<00:05:35.229> so<00:05:36.660> it's<00:05:37.660> a

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
ardell stuff on the brow so it's a

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.749 
ardell stuff on the brow so it's a
little<00:05:37.780> different<00:05:38.320> I<00:05:38.860> didn't<00:05:39.310> think<00:05:39.340> it<00:05:39.580> would

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
little different I didn't think it would

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.779 
little different I didn't think it would
you<00:05:39.940> know<00:05:40.060> turn<00:05:40.270> out<00:05:40.419> that<00:05:40.449> way<00:05:40.949> but<00:05:41.949> basically

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
you know turn out that way but basically

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.110 
you know turn out that way but basically
I<00:05:42.910> find<00:05:43.539> in<00:05:43.990> terms<00:05:44.320> of<00:05:44.680> texture<00:05:45.220> they<00:05:45.970> are

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
I find in terms of texture they are

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.580 
I find in terms of texture they are
exact<00:05:46.539> duplicates<00:05:51.900> roll<00:05:52.900> looks<00:05:53.110> really<00:05:53.380> dark

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
exact duplicates roll looks really dark

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.810 
exact duplicates roll looks really dark
for<00:05:53.919> me<00:05:54.270> so<00:05:55.270> I<00:05:55.300> i<00:05:55.919> prefer<00:05:56.919> the<00:05:56.949> ardell<00:05:57.400> for<00:05:57.669> a

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
for me so I i prefer the ardell for a

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.500 
for me so I i prefer the ardell for a
brow<00:05:58.539> pomade<00:05:58.979> so<00:05:59.979> I<00:06:00.370> definitely<00:06:01.030> think<00:06:01.270> these

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
brow pomade so I definitely think these

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.529 
brow pomade so I definitely think these
are<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.720> dupe<00:06:01.960> for<00:06:01.990> each<00:06:02.289> other<00:06:02.530> and<00:06:03.180> so<00:06:04.180> I<00:06:04.210> would

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
are a dupe for each other and so I would

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.020 
are a dupe for each other and so I would
i'm<00:06:05.440> gonna<00:06:05.710> be<00:06:05.830> saving<00:06:05.979> my<00:06:06.280> money<00:06:06.430> now<00:06:06.699> like
