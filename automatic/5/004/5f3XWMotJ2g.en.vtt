pro course on this small 250 bike then

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.260 
pro course on this small 250 bike then
move<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.250> up<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.520> Sportster<00:01:14.000> and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
eventually the electric light and if we

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.370 
eventually the electric light and if we
could<00:01:16.310> take<00:01:16.340> total<00:01:16.880> training<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.390> 24<00:01:17.990> hours<00:01:18.229> or

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
could take total training in 24 hours or

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.230 
could take total training in 24 hours or
less<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:18.860> think<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.610> would<00:01:19.729> be<00:01:19.760> good<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.150> the

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
less I think that would be good but the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.000 
less I think that would be good but the
first<00:01:20.450> thing<00:01:20.600> I'm<00:01:20.750> going<00:01:20.870> to<00:01:20.960> do<00:01:21.080> is<00:01:21.290> try<00:01:21.950> to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
first thing I'm going to do is try to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.070 
first thing I'm going to do is try to
assess<00:01:22.370> your<00:01:22.520> skill<00:01:22.940> so<00:01:23.210> using<00:01:23.750> some<00:01:23.930> of<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
assess your skill so using some of the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.570

techniques<00:01:24.380> from<00:01:24.560> my<00:01:24.650> ride<00:01:24.950> like<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.190> pro<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
techniques from my ride like a pro the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.980 
techniques from my ride like a pro the
easy<00:01:25.760> way<00:01:25.940> now<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.119> watch<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.630> video<00:01:26.810> a

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
easy way now you watch that video a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.020 
easy way now you watch that video a
couple<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.290> times<00:01:27.500> yes<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.640> know<00:01:28.820> what<00:01:28.940> it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
couple of times yes so you know what it

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.180 
couple of times yes so you know what it
takes<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.330> learn<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.690> basics<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.290> I'm<00:01:31.010> going

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
takes to learn the basics and I'm going

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.250 
takes to learn the basics and I'm going
to<00:01:31.250> look<00:01:31.460> see<00:01:32.150> how<00:01:32.270> well<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.600> do<00:01:32.780> try<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.080> get
