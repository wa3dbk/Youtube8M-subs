00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.110
 Hall people and welcome to one 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.300
 further episode of our plugin tutorial 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.640
 row and today we rather face each other 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.550
 own crafting recipes what I mean with that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:26.869
 I'll show you mine just now 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:31.230
 Here we go briefly in advance exactly 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.820
 to a world pure and we can ourselves 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.250
 Of course, minecraft of such 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.329
 things already here that means that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.760
 pretty the arrangement and then one 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.280
 recipe and we also want to go 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 own forces and want to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.899
 Today we make our own strong 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.210
 that looks like that is here 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.890
 comes out of a final result if we do that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.859
 so we arrange the whole thing in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.989
 our online storage method, yes 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.519
 important does not do this ever 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.409
 something else comes the whole 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.720
 not and here we just create ourselves 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.130
 first an item which then come out here 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.290
 that means what this end is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.200
 now a normal items covers that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:25.380
 Do you already know items tatum is the same 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:27.600
 new tech material point web sex 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.010
 let's want a weapon like that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.840
 that means we will be one by force 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.680
 The weapon in the form of an iron salmon 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.230
 I have to say that I have to pay 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.700
 you can not get completely new items 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.100
 forces in minecraft I have to stop 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.360
 any items forces the number 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 already in the game, but you can 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.860
 Of course, rename the others 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.250
 skills so that with the conversion 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 the lack of meter of the old dots meter 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:02.270
 and then call meter point 6 -display 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.289
 Just rapping the whole thing 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:11.030
 and now let's say one more point 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:13.970
 save meta meta and now that's coming 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.780
 new and now writing tape ries 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:22.760
 be and now many variable streetside 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.290
 is equal to zero shade recyc and here as 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.739
 Arguments we give our old man 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.629
 So the items tag then as finite 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.019
 should come out with something to the whole 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:37.280
 the keyboard shortcut ctrl shift and 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.569
 import and now we give that one 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.049
 the rest and we still have to 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.150
 us and the arrangement of the things 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.840
 set and say now recyc 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.549
 point then we have a few things 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:57.349
 and now we say tape and here 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:04.579
 we now have to specify the order 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:06.530
 as we arrange the items roll the 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.569
 first line we leave completely free 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:15.440
 I'll say hello for him aa 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.720
 then we write then write 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.609
 we here we only teacher then 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.650
 iron iron means that these are variable 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.859
 which you can choose yourself so 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.620
 I call it that 's easy for iron 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:35.510
 and so we say sticks we say 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.560
 just do it and so usa so that he 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.180
 Of course, she knows what these are 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.530
 mean individual variables 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.530
 let 's say reset integrated 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.160
 Let's take the first one as a key 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.470
 important not these quotes 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.060
 but this apostroph must again 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.640
 use because it is only a chance and no 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.200
 string bikes will always be just that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.480
 is not only as a dash-making 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.950
 her with shift and mostly left the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.590
 keys beside the teaching beside the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:26.200
 enter key and here just say 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:30.330
 a matter then he means yes then reset 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.730
 nobody likes is different than 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:39.400
 next we have never been at 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:47.610
 we received it is I think more of a 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.610
 angel and then still freestyle.ch 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:57.210
 material stick so i like to know 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.960
 ever have to specify the air here 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.120
 I do not know how to leave us now 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.950
 easy and then finally that 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.970
 most important bucket results may 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.740
 The result is not much 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.510
 Of course you have to know how it works 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:20.830
 going 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:24.870
 you do not have to start that way and you do not have to 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:28.419
 magic met connecten localhost 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.200
 he goes up quickly and so now 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:35.650
 Let's start with our game mode, why 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.229
 the pass ticks and verizon were and 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.360
 here many benches but jolo 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.550
 and now we have only said three 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.550
 completely free second free 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:54.319
 yes right here the stick and we 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.360
 see, nothing comes out so well 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.860
 good times 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.120
 then we probably just have to 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.469
 let the air away because of the 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.439
 probably just do not breathe 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:06.319
 that is, if the tomb is out 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:11.719
 just write the ada but not 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:17.060
 say what it should be at all times 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:19.580
 one that does it now and does it now 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.900
 that here it is our responsibility and 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.520
 Here comes out rap 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.159
 Now we can take them out 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.560
 and have crafted us a new axis 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.990
 and that would be great, of course, because we 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.639
 who have called here 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.259
 could now be with it 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.330
 various events with player discovered 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.089
 But we, for example , have that 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.779
 already programmed as far as I know 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:40.219
 on the right you can see that the arrow 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.439
 that really comes out as a weapon 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.150
 serves and as I said you can there 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:45.589
 really no new items forces 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.310
 but you have to do something 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.830
 is available 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.879
 but it is real for some gameplay modes 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.349
 I think I have one more 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.960
 server saw it was something with pug 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.909
 and then there you come then there was 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.889
 then also items that are printed and 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.479
 then you come with it new and new 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.879
 better weapons and so hit with 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:05.839
 own powers recipes is quite cool 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:07.099
 can play around a bit 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.449
 by beautiful things forces 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.680
 then I would say if it is you 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.000
 i would like to talk about that 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.009
 reviews look forward and see you 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.610
 the next video is doing well and 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:15.610
 bye
