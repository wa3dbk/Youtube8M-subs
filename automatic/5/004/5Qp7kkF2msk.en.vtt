you're playing a game that that could be

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.529 
you're playing a game that that could be
your<00:05:42.270> best<00:05:42.540> game<00:05:42.780> ever<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.530> know<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:43.919> and<00:05:44.539> one

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
so I think it's always key yeah at the

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.840 
so I think it's always key yeah at the
same<00:05:53.729> time<00:05:53.970> you<00:05:54.240> know<00:05:54.330> you<00:05:54.389> gotta<00:05:55.850> sometimes

the<00:06:26.910> board<00:06:27.150> like<00:06:27.420> that<00:06:27.660> a<00:06:28.160> sweeping<00:06:29.160> pattern

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
the board like that a sweeping pattern

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.550 
the board like that a sweeping pattern
again<00:06:30.240> now<00:06:30.570> we're<00:06:30.810> just<00:06:30.840> going<00:06:31.230> to<00:06:31.260> aim<00:06:31.530> the

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
again now we're just going to aim the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:43.160 
again now we're just going to aim the
sweep<00:06:32.100> here

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.410 

mmm<00:06:44.170> well<00:06:44.670> I'm<00:06:45.670> going<00:06:45.820> to<00:06:45.910> let<00:06:46.000> it<00:06:46.030> get<00:06:46.210> back

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420 
mmm well I'm going to let it get back

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.280 
mmm well I'm going to let it get back
under<00:06:46.720> control<00:06:46.810> a<00:06:47.140> little<00:06:47.410> bit<00:06:47.680> here<00:06:48.010> so<00:06:49.290> again

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
under control a little bit here so again

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.690 
under control a little bit here so again
we're<00:06:50.470> just<00:06:50.620> going<00:06:50.740> to<00:06:50.770> get<00:06:50.890> into<00:06:51.100> a<00:06:51.130> sweeping

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
we're just going to get into a sweeping

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.680 
we're just going to get into a sweeping
pattern<00:06:52.120> allow<00:06:52.720> it<00:06:52.780> to<00:06:52.960> to<00:06:53.740> go<00:06:53.860> over<00:06:54.190> the<00:06:54.280> whole

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
pattern allow it to to go over the whole

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.660 
pattern allow it to to go over the whole
you<00:06:55.690> know<00:06:55.750> the<00:06:55.870> course<00:06:56.280> horizontally<00:06:57.280> we<00:06:57.490> want

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
you know the course horizontally we want

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.950 
you know the course horizontally we want
you<00:06:58.060> want<00:06:58.210> to<00:06:58.270> get<00:06:58.360> as<00:06:58.450> much<00:06:58.630> with<00:06:59.620> as<00:06:59.860> we<00:07:00.040> can

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
you want to get as much with as we can

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.750 
you want to get as much with as we can
to<00:07:01.960> allow<00:07:02.200> the<00:07:02.230> snake<00:07:02.650> to<00:07:02.830> catch<00:07:03.010> up<00:07:03.310> and<00:07:03.580> then

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
to allow the snake to catch up and then

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.310 
to allow the snake to catch up and then
once<00:07:03.970> it's<00:07:04.150> nuts<00:07:04.570> caught<00:07:04.840> up<00:07:05.020> and<00:07:05.230> we're

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
once it's nuts caught up and we're

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.590 
once it's nuts caught up and we're
pretty<00:07:05.500> safe<00:07:05.830> we<00:07:06.130> can<00:07:06.280> go<00:07:06.460> ahead<00:07:06.580> and<00:07:06.730> and

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
pretty safe we can go ahead and and

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.190 
pretty safe we can go ahead and and
expand<00:07:08.410> it<00:07:08.590> a<00:07:08.650> little<00:07:08.680> bit<00:07:09.100> I<00:07:09.660> mean<00:07:10.660> ever<00:07:10.810> you

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200 
expand it a little bit I mean ever you

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.420 
expand it a little bit I mean ever you
never<00:07:11.380> really<00:07:11.590> want<00:07:11.770> to<00:07:11.830> get<00:07:11.890> too<00:07:12.160> out<00:07:12.400> of

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 
never really want to get too out of

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.980 
never really want to get too out of
control<00:07:12.550> of<00:07:13.180> it<00:07:14.970> then<00:07:15.970> you<00:07:16.270> just<00:07:16.510> sweep<00:07:16.810> it

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
control of it then you just sweep it

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.410 
control of it then you just sweep it
there<00:07:17.560> you<00:07:17.710> go<00:07:17.890> you<00:07:17.950> got<00:07:18.400> that<00:07:18.760> piece<00:07:19.060> and

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.420 
there you go you got that piece and

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.110 
there you go you got that piece and
going<00:07:19.600> to<00:07:19.660> keep<00:07:19.810> moving<00:07:20.490> all<00:07:21.490> right<00:07:21.700> we<00:07:21.880> missed

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
going to keep moving all right we missed

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.030 
going to keep moving all right we missed
it<00:07:22.330> but<00:07:22.510> we<00:07:22.600> should<00:07:22.780> be<00:07:22.810> able<00:07:22.900> to<00:07:23.110> rock<00:07:23.260> on<00:07:23.530> and

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
it but we should be able to rock on and

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:31.500 
it but we should be able to rock on and
