castings the best of all the worm

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.489 
castings the best of all the worm
castings<00:01:05.059> also<00:01:05.389> turns<00:01:05.689> into<00:01:05.929> this<00:01:06.170> liquid

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
producing this as well now you can't

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.359 
producing this as well now you can't
break<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.139> down<00:01:12.289> but<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:12.710> not<00:01:12.770> very<00:01:13.100> strong

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369
