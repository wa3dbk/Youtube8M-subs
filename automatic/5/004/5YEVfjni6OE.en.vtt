00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
pencil edge should before small radius

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.880 
pencil edge should before small radius
top<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.050> bottom<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> there<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.410> seam<00:01:13.740> in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
top and bottom and there is a seam in

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.330 
top and bottom and there is a seam in
this<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.630> seam<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.740> hard<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.100> see

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
this and the seam it's very hard to see

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.540 
this and the seam it's very hard to see
even<00:01:17.700> though<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> did<00:01:18.120> it<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.550> you

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
even though I did it it's right here you

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.210 
even though I did it it's right here you
can<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.119> behind<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.570> faucet

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
can see it a little behind the faucet

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
can see it a little behind the faucet
and<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.880> those<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> sink<00:01:24.690> so<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:24.960> have

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and we do those in the sink so you have

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.290 
and we do those in the sink so you have
a<00:01:25.200> smaller<00:01:25.619> scene<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.180> actually

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
a smaller scene and this one we actually

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.910 
a smaller scene and this one we actually
put<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> middle<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.800> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
put in the middle here so that the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.640 
put in the middle here so that the
faucet<00:01:29.340> would<00:01:29.460> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.820> sort<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.720> hide<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.080> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
faucet would kind of sort of hide it so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.600 
faucet would kind of sort of hide it so
when<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> look<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.190> step<00:01:33.090> back<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.479> here

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
when you look in step back right here

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.440 
when you look in step back right here
you<00:01:35.610> can't<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:38.580> again<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.210> st.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you can't see it and again this is st.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.600 
you can't see it and again this is st.
