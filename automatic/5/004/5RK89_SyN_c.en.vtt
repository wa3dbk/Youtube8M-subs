every of you but if you guys would still

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.450 
every of you but if you guys would still
like<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.019> then<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.740> can<00:04:22.860> request<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.400> the

comments below but I typically will use

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.560 
comments below but I typically will use
this<00:04:25.860> as<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.160> smaller<00:04:26.730> wallet<00:04:27.030> on<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.300> go

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
this as a smaller wallet on the go

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.810 
this as a smaller wallet on the go
because<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:28.140> attached<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.650> my<00:04:28.770> keys<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.610> let's

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
because is attached to my keys so let's

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.520 
because is attached to my keys so let's
say<00:04:30.060> I'm<00:04:30.180> running<00:04:30.450> into<00:04:30.600> target<00:04:31.080> really<00:04:31.230> fast

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
say I'm running into target really fast

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.680 
say I'm running into target really fast
I<00:04:32.010> mean<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.460> told<00:04:32.550> him<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.730> bring<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.910> purse<00:04:33.150> then

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
I mean I told him to bring a purse then

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.410 
I mean I told him to bring a purse then
I'll<00:04:33.780> just<00:04:33.960> stuff<00:04:34.230> my<00:04:34.440> ID<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:35.040> my<00:04:35.130> bank<00:04:36.120> card

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
I'll just stuff my ID and my bank card

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.180 
I'll just stuff my ID and my bank card
in<00:04:36.660> here<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.140> just<00:04:37.290> take<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:37.680> with<00:04:37.860> my<00:04:37.980> phone

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
in here and just take this with my phone

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.710 
in here and just take this with my phone
I<00:04:38.430> don't<00:04:38.550> actually<00:04:38.790> know<00:04:39.090> why<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.600> in

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
I don't actually know why this is in

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.030 
I don't actually know why this is in
here<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.900> guess<00:04:40.140> I've<00:04:40.350> been<00:04:40.380> using<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:40.860> as<00:04:41.010> a

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
here I guess I've been using this as a

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.010 
here I guess I've been using this as a
hand<00:04:41.310> cream<00:04:41.520> because<00:04:41.670> it's<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.240> really<00:04:42.720> small

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
hand cream because it's a really small
