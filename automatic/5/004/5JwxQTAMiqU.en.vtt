half a cassette and he's three big dead
beetles<00:04:18.169> which<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.410> guess<00:04:18.590> eat<00:04:18.799> plastic<00:04:19.039> or

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459

ate<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.260> plastic<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.799> then<00:04:21.889> died<00:04:23.860> but<00:04:24.860> then

ate the plastic and then died but then

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.680 
ate the plastic and then died but then
