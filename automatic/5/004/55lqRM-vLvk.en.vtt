00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.359 
the top back on your pan and now you
want<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.300> ventilate<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:26.960> pan<00:01:27.229> really<00:01:28.160> well

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369

to<00:01:29.180> allow<00:01:29.450> all<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.810> moisture<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:31.160> escape

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
to allow all the moisture to escape

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.330 
to allow all the moisture to escape
there's<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.930> lot<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.229> steam<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:33.740> condensation

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
there's a lot of steam and condensation

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.280 
there's a lot of steam and condensation
that's<00:01:34.790> going<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.060> be<00:01:35.600> generated<00:01:36.080> by<00:01:36.229> this

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
that's going to be generated by this

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.749 
that's going to be generated by this
process<00:01:41.350> careful<00:01:42.350> some<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.950> kernels<00:01:43.340> you

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
process careful some of the kernels you

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.820 
process careful some of the kernels you
may<00:01:43.880> try<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.149> escape<00:01:44.750> if<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.140> have<00:01:45.259> in<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.530> too

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
may try to escape if you have in it too

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.999 
may try to escape if you have in it too
much<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:47.090> like<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.110> hold<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.380> lid<00:01:48.560> up<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:48.890> you

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
much so I like to hold the lid up as you

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.420 
much so I like to hold the lid up as you
can<00:01:49.160> see<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.930> lose<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.170> kernel<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:51.830> make<00:01:52.280> sure

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
can see you lose a kernel just make sure

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.359 
can see you lose a kernel just make sure
it<00:01:52.520> doesn't<00:01:52.820> get<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.649> actual<00:01:54.649> stove<00:01:55.070> eye

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
it doesn't get on the actual stove eye

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.150 
it doesn't get on the actual stove eye
or<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.789> will<00:01:56.000> catch<00:01:56.210> fire<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:59.000> process<00:01:59.479> takes

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
or it will catch fire this process takes

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.710 
or it will catch fire this process takes
barely<00:02:01.160> even<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.640> minute<00:02:01.789> once<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.270> popcorn
