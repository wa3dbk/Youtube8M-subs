but<00:00:36.930> while<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:37.739> i'm<00:00:38.129> planning<00:00:38.940> on

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
but while it's not i'm planning on

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.400 
but while it's not i'm planning on
taking<00:00:39.149> advantage<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.230> why

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
taking advantage of it and that's why

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.750 
taking advantage of it and that's why
I'm<00:00:40.500> making<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.739> video<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.129> other<00:00:41.399> people

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
I'm making this video for other people

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.420 
I'm making this video for other people
like<00:00:42.329> me<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> same<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:44.340> I'm

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
like me to do the same so when I'm

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.639 
like me to do the same so when I'm
spawning<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.719> called<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> Disney

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
spawning right now is called the Disney

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250 
spawning right now is called the Disney
infinity<00:00:46.770> hub<00:00:47.510> directly<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.140> two

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
infinity hub directly to my one or two

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.690 
infinity hub directly to my one or two
o'clock<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.920> directly<00:00:50.250> over<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:50.610> at

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
o'clock which is directly over there at

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.689 
o'clock which is directly over there at
that<00:00:50.789> spotlight<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.629> where<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.260> need<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> go

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
that spotlight is where you need to go

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.810 
that spotlight is where you need to go
so<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.930> by<00:00:54.989> doing<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.129> toy

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
so how I get there is by doing the toy

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.689 
so how I get there is by doing the toy
view<00:00:57.140> which<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.399> switch

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
view which is this and then I switch

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.439 
view which is this and then I switch
over<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.270> build<00:01:00.570> view<00:01:01.760> which<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
over to the build view which is this and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
over to the build view which is this and
then<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.930> switch<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> spark<00:01:04.769> mode<00:01:05.010> which<00:01:05.189> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
then I switch to spark mode which is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.580 
then I switch to spark mode which is
that<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.790> spark<00:01:06.750> mode<00:01:06.960> seems<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that and spark mode seems to be the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.070 
that and spark mode seems to be the
fastest<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.400> terms<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.880> traveling<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> come

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
fastest in terms of traveling so I come

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.620 
fastest in terms of traveling so I come
up<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> figure<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.299> where<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
up here and then I figure out where I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.060 
up here and then I figure out where I
want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> land<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.710> doesn't<00:01:13.979> really

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
want to go and land it doesn't really

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.920 
want to go and land it doesn't really
matter<00:01:14.280> where<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> land<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.030> long<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.509> long<00:01:15.780> as

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
matter where you land as long as long as

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.890 
matter where you land as long as long as
you<00:01:16.049> land<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.920> fall<00:01:17.220> off<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you land it and not fall off you want to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530 
you land it and not fall off you want to
get<00:01:19.080> into<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> autopia<00:01:19.890> car<00:01:20.240> because<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
get into the autopia car because this is

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
get into the autopia car because this is
critical<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.320> spawn<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.820> two

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
critical this will spawn the the two

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.550 
critical this will spawn the the two
mountains<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.689> rather<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> mountain<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
mountains or rather the mountain you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
mountains or rather the mountain you
need<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.580> go<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:26.880> into<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
need to get on you go back into the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
need to get on you go back into the
build<00:01:27.630> view<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.259> spark<00:01:28.650> mode<00:01:28.799> again<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
build view and then spark mode again you

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.539 
build view and then spark mode again you
go<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.619> take<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> second<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
go up and then you take the second the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.429 
go up and then you take the second the
taller<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.210> taller<00:01:33.420> hill<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.930> where<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.259> go

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
taller the taller hill is where you go

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.859 
taller the taller hill is where you go
and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:35.189> again<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.880> land<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.329> anywhere

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and then again you land it anywhere

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.340 
and then again you land it anywhere
anywhere<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:38.119> I'm<00:01:39.119> very<00:01:39.180> picky<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> try

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
anywhere you can I'm very picky so I try

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.690
