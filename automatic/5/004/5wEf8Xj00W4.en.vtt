 from the company griffin very famous 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.220
 a company called a sop war seems 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.730
 so considered 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.029
 shockproof case for ipad air 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.490
 Let's start our review as I said earlier 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.590
 Case from the company Griffin that is very 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.830
 famous company that produces 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.770
 very high quality covers and here for 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.480
 the new ipad air she released here 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.550
 here is a shockproof case which we 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.129
 now open 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.610
 produce and packing and see what 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.510
 on presents so tick box 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.920
 opens 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 as follows so here it is 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:10.500
 I opened the stickers here 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:16.400
 protrudes this way on the side he 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.400
 pops out remains 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:46.429
 so here so shorter we do not need yet 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:49.399
 So here's what we see inside the 16 case 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.979
 Made such a rubberized material 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:57.759
 This component plastic such more 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:03.289
 solid than plain plastic it means 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:07.580
 stand cover consists I look here and 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:11.260
 I open it for the first time with you 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:17.380
 there is see that is present here 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:20.510
 protective screen so this is a protective film 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.340
 so how would it open this case see 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.859
 here are membranes that close 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.700
 holes 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:33.370
 i.e. it is lightening this camcorder 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.760
 headphones 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.680
 this is a microphone hole 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.530
 let's try to open it the same way 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.170
 it opens and here is the top 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.040
 removed it turns out to shoot this 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.120
 top lidded protective screen then 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:58.430
 there is this brochure advertising what we see 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.810
 inside it means all plastic is protective 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.650
 that is, it is so durable 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.480
 here it is this material 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:11.450
 something in the form of foam that is 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:14.630
 soft construction just here he 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.170
 inserted as framed here 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.829
 too, well here it is clear that 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:25.540
 protective all sorts of foam on the tab 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.400
 there is that will not give a scratch 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.409
 bumper tablets 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.409
 that is, a tablet is inserted here 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:40.780
 closes snaps 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.530
 that is, such a cover is quite possible 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.609
 to use 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.590
 if you're somewhere on a sandy beach somewhere 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.319
 use your potter 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.040
 during work where can get 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.040
 dust or moisture that is, or either cook 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.650
 food that is to say that fat does not fly there 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.750
 some crumbs 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.329
 that is, it is so shockproof that is 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:14.540
 cover even if it falls here 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:16.840
 softened rubber sidewalls well one 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.440
 word case for ipad air 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:25.039
 quite such a thing I will say it again 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.229
 that it is released by the griffin company 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.830
 there is a logo here 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:33.169
 letter g i.e. corporate logo 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.300
 griffin case cover is quite famous 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:41.060
 on apple gadget fans the same 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.090
 covers are for the previous generation 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.909
 ipad 2 3 4 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.479
 and in my opinion if I am not mistaken the same 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.360
 covers 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.530
 Well, just a little smaller are made 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.349
 for iPhone with case goes 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.669
 Here is a stand that is hiding 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:04.849
 in a real way that is like that 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:07.610
 put forward set and she clings here 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.580
 for this part of the cover or for this or for 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.400
 opposite, that is, no role 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.630
 plays 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.880
 that is, here we put the cover 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.159
 vertically or also possible 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:28.370
 use this stand horizontally 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:30.200
 that is, for printing, that is, either without 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.570
 her 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.760
 the case will be indispensable when traveling on 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.710
 rest if you find yourself somewhere on the beach 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.230
 This case will protect your tablet from sand 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.540
 moisture and so on that is very very 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.570
 A good option to protect your 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:51.410
 tablet and so we had a cover on the review 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.950
