00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.970
 Saitama Prefecture Suzuki Dental Clinic 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.630
 Omiya 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.240
 You have metal allergies 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.740
 The fact that I think I said in metal in the mouth 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:29.220
 I want to remove all the metal in my mouth and make it whiter 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:32.730
 Or white in the Well first tiny and tooth decay or insurance without 's metal allergy 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.660
 Whitening some partial silver teeth 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.220
 Well, while I'm doing it, all the metal in my mouth already 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.420
 I want to get rid of metal , that is, I say sleep or metal free, though 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:50.510
 I want whitening 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.310
 Such people are coming, but doing it in a row 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.440
 is not it 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.600
 However 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:05.050
 If you want to keep it for a long time 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.290
 It will change the color more and more rapidly degraded or Rashiku Pu it's insurance 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.000
 You should not change the color to some extent 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:16.110
 If there is a price there, hybrid ceramics 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.820
 No , if I do it again properly, it is all-ceramics 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.720
 It will be said All ceramic color does not change 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.230
 Whatever you choose 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.310
 Please brush your teeth well and have a regular checkup after that 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:37.049
 That's so important 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.420
 After the house that will become black Ya anymore 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.110
 Front teeth 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.659
 This is the old-fashioned type that the half flag is down and it's a bit of a hardship or 9 inch 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.790
 Say this 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.030
 Of this type 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.800
 It is because or there is a ceramic using a metal 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.080
 That's why my fangs are blackened with this silvery color 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.290
 Whether the all-ceramics are now of ceramic 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.550
 For example because it is there is no silver 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:11.650
 There is hardly anything that Chiba gets black 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.060
 Only of course do I fix it Well hey When you become a tooth decay I sense at all 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.660
 There is a ceramic 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 Sounds good 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.319
 After all it is beautiful 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.190
 Though you will dark color is dark it is really a color and use the metal 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.060
 After that the color is already 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.650
 It is each one of them individually, just like Kiyohara 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:40.840
 It is already white when it is like gackt like Ayu Hamasaki 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:44.159
 White That's why I feel Toka or the foundation in Well after is white together also that you were silver 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.159
 I think I should do
