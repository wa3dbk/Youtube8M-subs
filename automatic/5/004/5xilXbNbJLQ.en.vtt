00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.970
 Welcome you dear customers and 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.920
 partners 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.740
 Before you next working video review 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.900
 shoe company is pleased in this release 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.940
 you have to learn the characteristics and 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.790
 strengths of protective shoes 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.980
 master is-1 and 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.640
 in the implementation of this review will help me 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.789
 my colleague 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.800
 ivan hello alexander say what 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.630
 the quality of these shoes you would highlight on 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.090
 first plan for what should be addressed 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.399
 attention to buying a weight so that it is 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.140
 models since it's about flooring shoes 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.059
 the first thing to say about 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.699
 that the model is focused on wearing in 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.559
 indoors or outside working walls 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.239
 in the summer and off season 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.249
 this contributes relatively 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.079
 low structure with which Verka 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.239
 one side opens the foot surface 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.879
 for the entry of air masses and 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.120
 uniform blowing warm and hot 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.309
 time of year and on the other hand it protects against 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.229
 water and dirt getting inside the shoe 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.179
 bad weather during work 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.659
 the top is made of genuine leather 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.460
 with water repellent and oil resistant 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.619
 coated so low shoes for long 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.259
 maintain their integrity and excellent 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.149
 the look then their boots are beautiful from 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.649
 external influence and what can we say 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.479
 about internal elements 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.390
 busy directly saving could 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.719
 owner's list of low shoes master ps1 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.880
 P 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.799
 equipped with metal masks 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.320
 maximum impact load 200 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.750
 joules that protect an employee from 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.689
 injuries in the fall of heavy loads on their feet 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.520
 besides under the socks and steel keeping 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.560
 their strength have a small thickness 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.179
 walls allowing you to enlarge 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.979
 space inside the boot 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.929
 metal tiber roundabout 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.689
 protects feet from sharp lesions 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.479
 objects strength and up to one thousand 100 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.149
 newtons on the side of the sole of the nails 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.579
 reinforcement broken glass debris 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.499
 and other hazards often 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.659
 accompanying production 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:57.840
 the construction site will not be able to 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.270
 comprehend on human health 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.890
 The fiction follows that the sole of the low shoes 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.979
 made of polyurethane 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.960
 it is logical that such a sole has a small 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.789
 weight and high strength and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.129
 resistant to aggressive chemicals 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.650
 substances and anti-static you 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.040
 but I would like to know how things are 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.390
 cases with resistance to slip 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.849
 polyurethane outsole possess 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.080
 natural low resistance 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.700
 slip development only 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.040
 special tread allows 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.590
 fulfill the requirements prescribed 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.230
 European standards case workers 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.090
 low shoes master ps1 and such 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.160
 the opportunity of course was realized 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.349
 the sole is specially designed so 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.540
 way to improve catchy 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.730
 properties of the wet and wet ground in 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.860
 walking time dirt and moisture are taken away by 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.739
 lamella channels and tread blocks 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.599
 becoming more malleable thereby 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.459
 increasing the contact area 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.099
 surfaces so safety shoes 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.110
 polyurethane outsole gets and against 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.030
 sliding properties before 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.549
 owned to a lesser extent now about 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.709
 the rest of the elements but with the boot is equipped 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.569
 polyurethane cover which 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.180
 protects the front of the shoe from 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.130
 shocks and also protects against wear 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.590
 when working on your lap the model has 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.000
 energy absorbing heel stripping 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.380
 load could while walking 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.660
 for increased comfort inside 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.810
 lining materials are located 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.209
 mouse master ps1 pi equipped and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.609

 any sphere or one weather 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.819
 season model has a presentable 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.049
 appearance which is practically 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.190
 identical to casual shoes 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.669

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.889
 comfortable and safe operation 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:49.120
