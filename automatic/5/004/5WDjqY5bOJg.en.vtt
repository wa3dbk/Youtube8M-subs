00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.750
 first step stripped rj45 cable 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:18.720
 we first cut course 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.119
 well nara we use the function of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.859
 demining the clamp and go out for 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.099
 remove the plastic part around the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.869
 cable called the sheath we will you 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.460
 advise to keep this sheath in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.570
 plastic that will come in handy when 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.570
 step 2 of age twists 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.210
 you must now remove the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.600
 plastic then the shielding that surrounds 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600
 the threads 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.350
 use the cutting pliers to cut 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.180
 the shielding as well as the part in 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.760
 plastic that were around the wires 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.390
 be careful not to touch any wires 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.390
 with nippers 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.160
 it is essential to preserve the thread of 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.410
 iron that is not twisted with the 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.060
 other girls because it's shielding and 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.060
 it will be useful in a next step 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.920
 so we're going now removed the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.160
 last plastic film protecting the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.160
