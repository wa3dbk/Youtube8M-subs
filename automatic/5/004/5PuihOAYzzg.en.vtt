in<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.090> way<00:03:18.209> traditional<00:03:18.389> music<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.109> folk

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
in the way traditional music of folk

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.930 
in the way traditional music of folk
music<00:03:19.680> would<00:03:19.829> really<00:03:20.069> unfold<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:20.880> I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
music would really unfold and I and I

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.160 
music would really unfold and I and I
appreciate<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.600> those<00:03:21.750> are<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.959> most

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
appreciate and those are the most

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.020 
appreciate and those are the most
rewarding<00:03:22.380> spots<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.370> album<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> think

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
rewarding spots of this album I think

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.420 
rewarding spots of this album I think
like<00:03:24.569> tracks<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.319> Luna<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.769> Glynis<00:03:26.130> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
like tracks like and Luna and Glynis and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.220 
like tracks like and Luna and Glynis and
Jackie<00:03:26.700> where<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.180> just<00:03:27.389> kind<00:03:27.569> of<00:03:27.600> explodes

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
Jackie where it just kind of explodes

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.710 
Jackie where it just kind of explodes
into<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.650> random<00:03:29.250> kind<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.790> electric<00:03:30.359> guitar

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
into this random kind of electric guitar

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.500 
into this random kind of electric guitar
bass<00:03:31.019> thing<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.310> thing<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.579> those<00:03:33.030> spots

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
bass thing and the thing is those spots

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.680 
bass thing and the thing is those spots
really<00:03:33.900> stick<00:03:34.200> out<00:03:34.380> because<00:03:34.920> what<00:03:35.910> it's<00:03:36.450> kind

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
really stick out because what it's kind

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.240 
really stick out because what it's kind
of<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.810> double<00:03:37.049> sided<00:03:37.230> thing<00:03:37.470> because<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:38.130> think

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
of a double sided thing because I think

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.640 
of a double sided thing because I think
every<00:03:38.700> song<00:03:38.910> on<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.150> album<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.569> good<00:03:39.870> but

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
every song on this album is good but

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.559 
every song on this album is good but
they<00:03:40.920> start<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.400> sound<00:03:41.639> kind<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.299> lot<00:03:42.450> of

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
they start to sound kind of a lot of

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.470 
they start to sound kind of a lot of
like<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.739> when<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:44.010> have<00:03:44.250> those<00:03:44.639> moments<00:03:45.030> that

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
like so when you have those moments that

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.879 
like so when you have those moments that
really<00:03:46.019> all<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.769> sudden<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.340> wake<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.540> up

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
it's very very useful and needed yeah

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.990 
it's very very useful and needed yeah
time<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.340> felt<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.639> exact<00:03:53.970> same

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000

thing I felt like this album established

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.809 
thing I felt like this album established
this<00:03:55.829> mood<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:56.579> very<00:03:56.910> chill<00:03:57.419> kind<00:03:58.109> of<00:03:58.230> Airy

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
this mood this very chill kind of Airy

then maintained that throughout the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.150 
then maintained that throughout the
album<00:04:03.840> which<00:04:04.169> I<00:04:04.290> really<00:04:04.470> liked<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.919> there's<00:04:05.069> a

some

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.180 
some
instrumental<00:04:12.260> intensity<00:04:12.770> but<00:04:12.860> there's<00:04:13.040> also

instrumental intensity but there's also

you know track 9 loaded man this is
really<00:04:15.940> brooding<00:04:16.940> ballad<00:04:17.420> that<00:04:17.450> was<00:04:17.720> just

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
really brooding ballad that was just

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.810 
really brooding ballad that was just
very<00:04:18.200> sentimental<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.980> me<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.190> really<00:04:19.610> liked

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820

very sentimental to me I really liked
that<00:04:19.940> song<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.390> know<00:04:20.480> it<00:04:20.540> was<00:04:20.630> clearly<00:04:20.930> one<00:04:21.049> of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
that song you know it was clearly one of

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.930 
that song you know it was clearly one of
my<00:04:21.320> track<00:04:21.620> pics<00:04:21.890> but<00:04:22.340> at<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.490> same<00:04:22.700> time<00:04:22.880> I

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
my track pics but at the same time I

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.540 
my track pics but at the same time I
really<00:04:23.300> felt<00:04:23.330> like<00:04:23.890> overall<00:04:24.890> that<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.460> it

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
really felt like overall that that it

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.550 
really felt like overall that that it
was<00:04:25.730> kind<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.030> monotone<00:04:26.570> oh<00:04:26.840> yeah<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.260> little

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
was kind of monotone oh yeah a little

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.860 
was kind of monotone oh yeah a little
bit<00:04:27.680> just<00:04:27.980> in<00:04:28.190> intensity<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:29.540> it<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:29.780> made

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
bit just in intensity and it just made

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.360 
bit just in intensity and it just made
it<00:04:29.900> less<00:04:30.110> believable<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.770> think<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.190> it's

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
it less believable and I think that it's

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.730 
it less believable and I think that it's
because<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.910> vocals<00:04:32.330> he<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.380> didn't<00:04:33.650> really

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
because of the vocals he I didn't really

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.650 
because of the vocals he I didn't really
feel<00:04:33.830> like<00:04:34.040> he<00:04:34.310> was<00:04:34.430> trying<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:35.000> suck<00:04:35.330> me<00:04:35.540> in

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
feel like he was trying to suck me in

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.480 
feel like he was trying to suck me in
right<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:36.020> kind<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:36.470> sounded<00:04:36.860> more<00:04:37.040> like<00:04:37.100> he

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
right it kind of sounded more like he

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.370 
right it kind of sounded more like he
was<00:04:37.640> just<00:04:37.910> singing<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.420> himself<00:04:38.570> than<00:04:39.110> trying

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
was just singing to himself than trying

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.230 
was just singing to himself than trying
to<00:04:39.500> incur<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.160> capture<00:04:40.550> an<00:04:40.640> audience<00:04:41.030> yeah

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
to incur and capture an audience yeah

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.480 
to incur and capture an audience yeah
and<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.410> know<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.560> feel<00:04:42.800> like<00:04:42.980> vocals

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
and and you know I feel like vocals

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.340 
and and you know I feel like vocals
