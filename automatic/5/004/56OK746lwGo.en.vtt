00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.930
 hi what I try to do with 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.620
 this essential video is to make an accordion 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.480
 like this one 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.019
 so you can go see everything this 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.019
 information 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.010
 and it's very fast and very easy to do 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.260
 with these two things that are visits for 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.800
 The hair 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.800
 of these things 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.160
 my paper 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.310
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.310
 cut the leaf in half 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.379
 yes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.379
 and then again in the middle 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.210
 my recommendation is that it is more 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.179
 of four of these because then all the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.350
 video information of a no module 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.350
 you obviously fit 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.290
 after you have those 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.450
 then you start writing the information 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 in each one 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.020
 one 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.890
 look you get a lot of these and 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.890
 you start writing your information here 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.820
 everything you have to write for you 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.770
 information and your exam and then what 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.810
 you can with adhesive tape in this part 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.810
 from here where they join 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.180
 then roll it up 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.450
 in such a way 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.450
 you can see the information 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.480
 A) Yes 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.550
 you roll it 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.550
 and the information is left in front 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.860
 and on the other side you do the same 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.640
 and it's rolling everything 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.700
 and once you have it that way 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.100
 as you will see if you turn the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.100
 information goes through here 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.490
 and it's all in the roll 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.120
 the last one who wants to make you 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.940
 expose him to extend the league and get 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.920
 here in the center 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.050
 once you have it in the center of 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.250
 you stretch 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.680
 and as you can see, you can not leave 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.390
 and you can spin it and take it out on your 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.390
 one -hand exam
