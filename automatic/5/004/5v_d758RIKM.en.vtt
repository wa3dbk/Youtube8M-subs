so<00:00:11.330> well<00:00:12.330> they<00:00:12.420> look<00:00:12.599> like<00:00:12.690> when<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.960> folded

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
so well they look like when you folded

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.980 
so well they look like when you folded
them<00:00:13.440> away<00:00:13.650> anyway<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.570> don't<00:00:15.570> know<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:15.809> good

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.250 
just going to go over the physical side
of<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> headphones<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.450> thing<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.840> mine<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
of the headphones one thing with mine is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.350 
of the headphones one thing with mine is
they're<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> bit<00:00:37.590> off<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> side<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> know

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
they're a bit off to the side you know

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.049 
they're a bit off to the side you know
you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.370> but<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.430> thing<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.969> goes

you can see that but the thing that goes

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
you can see that but the thing that goes
around<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.600> you've<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.399> pieces<00:00:44.399> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
around here you've got two pieces of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.660 
around here you've got two pieces of
wire<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.710> I've<00:00:46.800> been<00:00:46.920> bending<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> little

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
wire so I've been bending them a little

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.290 
wire so I've been bending them a little
bit<00:00:48.110> like<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:50.340> try<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.730> straighten<00:00:51.059> them

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
bit like that to try and straighten them

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.950 
bit like that to try and straighten them
out<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.750> mean<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.449> something<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.629> massive

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960

problem for me but you know I like

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
problem for me but you know I like
symmetry<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.829> than<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.579> top<00:00:59.850> band

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
symmetry other than that this top band

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.810 
symmetry other than that this top band
here<00:01:00.390> where<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> headrest<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.770> that's<00:01:02.550> really

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
here where the headrest is that's really

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.810 
here where the headrest is that's really
nice<00:01:02.969> I've<00:01:03.270> comfy<00:01:03.920> but<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.070> problems<00:01:05.519> told

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
this as you can see here these are

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
this as you can see here these are
pulled<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:09.210> bit<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.229> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
pulled out a little bit but this is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.420 
pulled out a little bit but this is
actually<00:01:10.729> about<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> size<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.689> me<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:14.369> was

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
actually about the size for me so it was

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.190 
actually about the size for me so it was
my<00:01:14.729> big<00:01:14.909> head<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:15.810> having<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
my big head you know I'm not having to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.070 
my big head you know I'm not having to
have<00:01:17.009> them<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.840> still

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
have them out like this so they still

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.530 
have them out like this so they still
look<00:01:19.320> alright<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> look<00:01:20.939> at<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> size<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
look alright if you look at the size of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.289 
look alright if you look at the size of
the<00:01:21.630> cans<00:01:22.130> compare<00:01:23.130> those<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:23.850> old<00:01:24.030> ones

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the cans compare those to my old ones

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.749 
the cans compare those to my old ones
and<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.259> pretty<00:01:25.380> standard<00:01:26.070> headphone

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and these are pretty standard headphone

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.520 
and these are pretty standard headphone
size<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.509> honest<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
size to be honest you can see that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.670 
size to be honest you can see that
they're<00:01:28.770> almost<00:01:28.920> half<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.960> tall<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.530> they're

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
they're almost half as tall but they're

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
they're almost half as tall but they're
still<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.549> about<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.909> wide<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
still just about was wide I kind of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
still just about was wide I kind of
liked<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.250> them

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
liked them but I think as you make them

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.340 
liked them but I think as you make them
short<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.930> should<00:01:37.170> get

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
short like this I think they should get

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.260 
short like this I think they should get
a<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.770> thinner<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.280> well<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
a little bit thinner as well just to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.149 
a little bit thinner as well just to
kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> look<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.049> don't<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.920> when<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
kind of look I don't know just when you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
kind of look I don't know just when you
put<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.670> stick<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> lot<00:01:42.450> is

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
put them on they do stick out a lot is

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
put them on they do stick out a lot is
all<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.740> another<00:01:44.009> thing<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.310> didn't<00:01:44.579> show

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
all and then another thing I didn't show

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
all and then another thing I didn't show

splits<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.909> how<00:01:48.090> much<00:01:48.270> length<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.689> get

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
splits that's how much length you get

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.780 
splits that's how much length you get
and<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> split

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and here you can see what the split

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.410 
and here you can see what the split
looks<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.439> adjustable<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:54.000> it's

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
looks like it's not adjustable but it's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
looks like it's not adjustable but it's
a<00:01:54.509> good<00:01:54.659> enough<00:01:54.810> range<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.590> then<00:01:55.710> quitly<00:01:55.979> on

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
a good enough range and then quitly on

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.709 
a good enough range and then quitly on
the<00:01:56.189> physical<00:01:56.610> side<00:01:56.850> before<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.450> show<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.659> what

trying to look as I kind of from 45

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.729 
trying to look as I kind of from 45
degrees<00:02:52.190> or<00:02:52.459> slide<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.780> don't<00:02:54.260> know<00:02:54.560> if<00:02:54.620> they

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
degrees or slide on I don't know if they

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.420 
degrees or slide on I don't know if they
saved<00:02:54.980> me<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:56.590> what<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.620> don't<00:02:57.739> do<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.160> then

you<00:02:59.239> can<00:02:59.390> flip<00:02:59.510> these<00:02:59.750> around<00:02:59.870> like<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.880> full

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
you can flip these around like that full

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.160 
you can flip these around like that full
head<00:03:02.000> down<00:03:02.239> there's<00:03:02.480> loads<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.720> gym<00:03:02.930> room

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
head down there's loads of gym room

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.580 
head down there's loads of gym room
that's<00:03:04.130> kind<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.959> where<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.050> divider<00:03:06.410> is

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
that's kind of where the divider is

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.410 
that's kind of where the divider is
there<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.430> yeah<00:03:07.519> in<00:03:07.610> terms<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.030> sound<00:03:08.300> on

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
there so yeah in terms of the sound on

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.509 
there so yeah in terms of the sound on
these<00:03:08.600> they're<00:03:09.110> pretty<00:03:09.140> good<00:03:09.590> especially<00:03:09.890> for

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
these they're pretty good especially for

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.670 
these they're pretty good especially for
the<00:03:10.640> size<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.780> considering<00:03:12.319> these<00:03:12.440> they're

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
the size and considering these they're

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.440 
the size and considering these they're
lower-tier<00:03:13.130> headphones<00:03:13.610> compared<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.360> my

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
lower-tier headphones compared to my

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.570 
lower-tier headphones compared to my
previous<00:03:14.690> headphones<00:03:15.290> which<00:03:15.560> are<00:03:15.860> the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
previous headphones which are the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.539 
previous headphones which are the
technics<00:03:17.000> RPF<00:03:17.750> 200s<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.680> base<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.220> really

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
technics RPF 200s the base is really

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.140 
technics RPF 200s the base is really
quest

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
quest

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.120 
quest
it<00:03:20.299> doesn't<00:03:20.690> drown<00:03:20.870> out<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.470> other<00:03:21.590> sounds

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
it doesn't drown out the other sounds

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.860 
it doesn't drown out the other sounds
that's<00:03:22.760> pretty<00:03:22.970> much<00:03:23.120> what<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.329> can<00:03:23.540> say<00:03:23.690> really

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
that's pretty much what I can say really

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.960 
that's pretty much what I can say really
against<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.560> technics<00:03:24.980> there<00:03:25.430> wasn't<00:03:25.760> much

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
against the technics there wasn't much

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.039 
against the technics there wasn't much
difference<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.230> treble<00:03:27.950> or<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:29.030> mids<00:03:29.239> it

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
difference in the treble or the mids it

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.590 
difference in the treble or the mids it
was<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.440> bass<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.610> wasn't<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.480> was

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
was just bass and it wasn't like it was

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.620 
was just bass and it wasn't like it was
just<00:03:32.720> nice<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.860> was<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.130> elevated<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.420> kind

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
just nice it was just elevated to kind

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.380 
just nice it was just elevated to kind
of<00:03:35.690> feel<00:03:35.959> bit<00:03:36.260> more<00:03:36.519> realistic<00:03:37.519> whether<00:03:38.299> he

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
of feel bit more realistic whether he

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.789 
of feel bit more realistic whether he
