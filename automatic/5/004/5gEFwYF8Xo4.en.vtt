order<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> understand<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> first<00:00:37.920> thing

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
order to understand this the first thing

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.680 
order to understand this the first thing
that<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.219> need<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> look<00:00:38.520> at<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.910> how<00:00:38.940> calories

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that we need to look at is how calories

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.240 
that we need to look at is how calories
work<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.110> obviously<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.860> far<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.190> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
work and obviously so far on this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.410 
work and obviously so far on this
channel<00:00:41.489> we've<00:00:41.700> talked<00:00:41.940> quite<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.239> bit<00:00:42.300> about

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
channel we've talked quite a bit about

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.569 
channel we've talked quite a bit about
calories<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.200> intake<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.739> we've<00:00:44.280> deemed

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
calories and intake and we've deemed

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
calories and intake and we've deemed
from<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.930> caloric<00:00:46.320> surplus

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
from that that in a caloric surplus

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.170 
from that that in a caloric surplus
you're<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> gain<00:00:47.280> weight<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.850> caloric

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you're going to gain weight in a caloric

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
you're going to gain weight in a caloric
deficit<00:00:48.629> you're<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> lose<00:00:49.170> weight<00:00:49.230> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
deficit you're going to lose weight so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
deficit you're going to lose weight so
this<00:00:50.070> brings<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> question<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.059> mind<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.539> well

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
this brings the question to mind is well

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.450 
this brings the question to mind is well
when<00:00:52.260> I'm<00:00:52.410> training<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.039> expending<00:00:53.430> more

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
when I'm training and expending more

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
when I'm training and expending more
energy<00:00:53.610> should<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.210> eat<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.750> compensate

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
energy should I eat more to compensate

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
energy should I eat more to compensate
and<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.160> days<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.879> training

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and then on days when I'm not training

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.029 
and then on days when I'm not training
and<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.600> less<00:00:57.809> active<00:00:58.199> should<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.500> eat<00:00:58.710> less

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and I'm less active should I eat less

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.639 
and I'm less active should I eat less
that<00:00:59.489> way<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.730> evens<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.270> now<00:01:00.899> my<00:01:01.050> response<00:01:01.469> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that way it evens out now my response to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.260 
that way it evens out now my response to
this<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.309> whenever<00:01:02.460> someone<00:01:02.910> asking<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
this to whenever someone asking this

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.359 
this to whenever someone asking this
question<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.840> basically<00:01:04.129> boils<00:01:05.129> down<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
question is basically boils down to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
question is basically boils down to
personal<00:01:05.580> preference<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.840> reason<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.200> say

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
personal preference and the reason I say

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.929 
personal preference and the reason I say
this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:07.979> again<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> look

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this is because again you have to look

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
this is because again you have to look
at<00:01:09.119> dieting<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> long<00:01:10.200> term<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
at dieting more in the long term a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
at dieting more in the long term a
simple<00:01:11.610> change<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.270> day<00:01:12.479> being<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
simple change of one day being in a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
simple change of one day being in a
caloric<00:01:13.590> surplus<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:14.310> day<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> caloric

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
caloric surplus one day and a caloric

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
caloric surplus one day and a caloric
deficit<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> next<00:01:15.840> day<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
deficit the next day is it going to have

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800 
deficit the next day is it going to have
much<00:01:17.400> overall<00:01:17.790> result<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.570> weight

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
much overall result on your weight

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.289 
much overall result on your weight
however<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:20.280> does<00:01:20.520> take<00:01:20.759> effect<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.210> your

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
however what does take effect on your

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
however what does take effect on your
weight<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> consistently<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.860> one

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
weight is when you consistently do one

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.190 
weight is when you consistently do one
or<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> other<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.270> over<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.659> course<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
in a caloric surplus you'll gain weight

deficit<00:01:31.860> you'll<00:01:32.130> lose<00:01:32.369> weight<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> again

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
deficit you'll lose weight and again

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.359 
deficit you'll lose weight and again
it's<00:01:33.540> simple<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.409> most<00:01:34.650> cases<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
it's simple as that in most cases and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.010 
it's simple as that in most cases and
I'm<00:01:35.820> trying<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> keep<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.329> simple<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.689> for

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I'm trying to keep it simple here for

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.859 
I'm trying to keep it simple here for
explanation<00:01:37.680> purposes<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.509> general

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
explanation purposes so the general

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.200 
explanation purposes so the general
theory<00:01:40.110> behind<00:01:40.320> having<00:01:41.040> higher<00:01:41.369> intakes<00:01:41.970> on

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
theory behind having higher intakes on

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.929 
theory behind having higher intakes on
your<00:01:42.420> workout<00:01:42.899> days<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.560> lower<00:01:44.220> intakes<00:01:44.759> on

your workout days and lower intakes on

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.179 
your workout days and lower intakes on
your<00:01:45.090> off<00:01:45.240> days<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.899> over<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> course<00:01:46.890> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
your off days is that over the course of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.249 
your off days is that over the course of
let's<00:01:47.430> say<00:01:47.640> seven<00:01:48.119> days<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:49.079> to

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
let's say seven days it's going to

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
let's say seven days it's going to
average<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> around<00:01:50.280> maintenance<00:01:50.880> for

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
average out to around maintenance for

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.760 
average out to around maintenance for
most<00:01:51.240> people<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> fact<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.590> you're

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
most people so the fact that you're

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
most people so the fact that you're
eating<00:01:53.040> more<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.220> burning<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.790> can

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
eating more and burning more can

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.730 
eating more and burning more can
compensate<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> fact<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.470> those<00:01:55.590> off

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
compensate for the fact on those off

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.410 
compensate for the fact on those off
days<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.340> eating<00:01:56.490> less<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.880> burning

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
days that you're eating less and burning

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
days that you're eating less and burning
less<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.979> reason<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.280> kind<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> steer

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
less now the reason that kind of steer

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.219 
less now the reason that kind of steer
people<00:01:59.850> way<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.719> at<00:02:00.750> least<00:02:01.020> say<00:02:01.170> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
people way to this or at least say you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.359 
people way to this or at least say you
know<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.890> your<00:02:02.009> personal

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
know it's really up to your personal

know it's really up to your personal
preference<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.329> some<00:02:03.509> people

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869

it's<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.140> hard<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> manage<00:02:04.890> constantly

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
it's just hard to manage constantly

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.340 
it's just hard to manage constantly
knowing<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.329> much<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> eat<00:02:06.960> having

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
knowing how much you have to eat having

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.710 
knowing how much you have to eat having
to<00:02:07.439> vary

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
to vary

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.810 
to vary
that<00:02:07.840> amount<00:02:08.110> each<00:02:08.320> day<00:02:08.619> for<00:02:09.220> most<00:02:09.430> people

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
that amount each day for most people

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.060 
that amount each day for most people
having<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.390> consistent<00:02:10.810> plan<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.500> place<00:02:11.680> works

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
having a consistent plan in place works

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.590 
having a consistent plan in place works
much<00:02:12.340> better<00:02:12.370> because<00:02:12.820> it's<00:02:13.090> easier<00:02:13.450> to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
much better because it's easier to

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.840 
much better because it's easier to
adhere<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.740> for<00:02:14.950> instance<00:02:15.010> let's<00:02:15.520> say<00:02:15.610> your

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
adhere to so for instance let's say your

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.180 
adhere to so for instance let's say your
maintenance<00:02:16.090> level<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.570> calories<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.170> 2500<00:02:18.070> or

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
maintenance level of calories is 2500 or

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.590 
maintenance level of calories is 2500 or
that's<00:02:18.340> what<00:02:18.460> your<00:02:18.640> goal<00:02:18.820> intake<00:02:19.240> should<00:02:19.420> be

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
that's what your goal intake should be

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.410 
that's what your goal intake should be
based<00:02:19.870> off<00:02:20.140> however<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.890> calculated<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.670> so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
based off however you calculated that so

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.670 
based off however you calculated that so
for<00:02:22.630> someone<00:02:22.810> who's<00:02:23.020> going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> cycle<00:02:23.440> their

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
for someone who's going to cycle their

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.620 
for someone who's going to cycle their
calories<00:02:24.160> on<00:02:24.340> training<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.850> off<00:02:25.030> days<00:02:25.360> on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
calories on training and off days on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.390 
calories on training and off days on
training<00:02:26.260> days<00:02:26.380> they<00:02:26.680> would<00:02:26.830> probably<00:02:27.070> take

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
training days they would probably take

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.090 
training days they would probably take
in<00:02:27.580> let's<00:02:27.790> say<00:02:28.000> 3,000<00:02:28.870> calories<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.530> off<00:02:29.860> days

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
in let's say 3,000 calories and off days

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.370 
in let's say 3,000 calories and off days
they<00:02:30.340> take<00:02:30.580> in<00:02:30.790> two<00:02:31.000> thousand<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.990> averaged

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
they take in two thousand so averaged

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.680 
they take in two thousand so averaged
out<00:02:32.530> they're<00:02:32.800> still<00:02:33.040> taking<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:33.730> 2,500

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
out they're still taking in that 2,500

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.320 
out they're still taking in that 2,500
calories<00:02:34.870> per<00:02:35.200> day<00:02:35.470> as<00:02:35.890> opposed<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> person

that they eat each day that person could

that they eat each day that person could
just<00:02:44.410> simply<00:02:44.620> eat<00:02:44.920> 2,500<00:02:45.790> calories<00:02:45.940> per<00:02:46.270> day

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
just simply eat 2,500 calories per day

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.680 
just simply eat 2,500 calories per day
and<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:47.080> fine<00:02:47.410> in<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.740> end<00:02:48.250> over<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.090> given<00:02:49.360> set

timeframe both people would see the same

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.060 
timeframe both people would see the same

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.160 
results so when it comes down to it
should<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.580> do<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.910> it's<00:02:55.330> really<00:02:55.600> up<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.020> you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
should you do this it's really up to you

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.170 
should you do this it's really up to you
if<00:02:56.440> it's<00:02:56.890> more<00:02:57.070> convenient<00:02:57.550> or<00:02:57.790> if<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:57.970> feel

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
if it's more convenient or if you feel

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.850 
if it's more convenient or if you feel
better<00:02:58.450> having<00:02:58.750> more<00:02:59.110> food<00:02:59.380> on<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> days<00:02:59.830> that

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
better having more food on the days that

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.770 
better having more food on the days that
you<00:03:00.040> train<00:03:00.340> then<00:03:00.820> definitely<00:03:01.150> go<00:03:01.330> for<00:03:01.480> it
