00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.740
Those who give and feel

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.820
this sensation one more time

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.680
When you’ve felt that beauty

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.720
let’s try to cross the borderline

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.560
If you know the structure, you’ll make it

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.440
or so I had thought, what foolishness

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.360
”It would’ve been great if we didn’t open the lid”

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.280
We could have overcome regrets

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.480
Unable to get over that beauty

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.340
I just savoured the fantasy

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.240
though it’s better not to know

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.160
what’s behind the forbidden zone

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.700
Though it’d be nice to have fun

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.680
living in this sealed-off world,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.740
shall I show wings of freedom

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.320
to you, who hates “normal?”

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.160
You can say for sure

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.300
that common sense doesn’t suit you

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.160
Paying mind to people’s gazes,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.140
are you just going to be boxed up?

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.820
It’s about the day you imagined

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.760
becoming someone ideal

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.640
Every time you try to get close

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.560
“It’s so easy being a blank canvas”

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.460
It’s a specific repetition,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.360
feeling unhappy with the pain

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.260
from the opposite of aspiration

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.560
but isn’t that what it means to be alive?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.900
Becoming something different

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.060
Yourself, contrasting with your surroundings

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.660
and the one who had sought a shine,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.680
yourself who was young and and clueless

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.440
With wings of freedom

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.580
the ground is unassured, so to say

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.480
It’s a reckless style

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.120
but it’d be cool to watch from nearby from now on
