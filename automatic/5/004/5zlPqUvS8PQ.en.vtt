00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.439
 hello to you community so 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.210
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.009
 little video on finally a long video 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.990
 on several tutorials for your 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.180
 vehicles but we started this 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.010
 I would like to discuss some of the new 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.489
 perfume quite quickly to his clothes 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.050
 Well, I think this pack is the most 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.269
 complete that we knew we 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.850
 have a super sports mons ac 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.190
 like all parents will say a motorcycle 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.769
 that we had we had never had 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.010
 before motorcycle in the paws to my 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.149
 remember and we had a good one there 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.420
 massacre where she looks like 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.950
 not bad to several vehicles of the game 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.050
 but not to spread on the subject is there 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.829
 for the tutorial so we will start 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.390
 with the primo for laying in the ground 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.539
 in the rules the belittling what in 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.130
 clearer then direction los santos 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:10.990
 guardian to show you the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.009
 changes that need to be made or rather 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.280
 the modest ones and to go the 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.310
 changes do not do I do not 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.640
 speak by there by the armor he is and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.220
 the bulletproof tires so I 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.959
 will show you that so there you go 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.580
 see that the armor had it at 20% 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.369
 it's reset to seem 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.690
 therefore no blocking at the level of 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.330
 bullet tires he 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.780
 so do not take it if you said it to me 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.770
 ben or buy the vehicle or for the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.479
 find 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.679
 because we can not take it off at least 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.810
 do not think we can take it off I have not 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.979
 successful 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.730
 ottawa the little words like india 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.780
 elderly to copts by bullets 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.960
 we think distant a little I you 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.600
 recommend putting a silencer and 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.870
 take the sniper the lightest and the most 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.930
 lightweight 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.600
 then aimed at the center of the leg and 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.370
 you 're going to shoot do not actually care that the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.380
 car of the high level stands if 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.340
 you do not shoot 5.25 high level if they 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.960
 wanted art dropped slightly 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.560
 but if you want to flatten it on the ground 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.750
 better shot 9 shots this is nine or and 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.050
 naive that's okay said it's sure are 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.280
 accelerated it goes much faster 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.780
 here it will be necessary to lower you will see 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.900
 I put myself inside to believe 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.510
 although still different is the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.990
 full season of heroes so the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.710
 kandertal camber so for the 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.360
 next vehicle 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.280
 it will be on the sultan because there 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.290
 sultan it's like the beautiful air finally the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.780
 beautiful air is the tornado in the game 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.460
 pardon and ben if you shoot in the center 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.850
 agents tomorrow she explodes you to the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.250
 figure 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.560
 so there is another technique that 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.200
 I use so we will go to the custom ls 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.630
 we will remove the armor we will check 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.260
 that the wheels no one is not to 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.300
 bullet proof 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.160
 we go to the same place because it's more 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.950
 discreet so there I do not want to take the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.600
 sniper misunderstand the rifle there are some 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.860
 others who take the 47 but I 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.420
 prefer with karami finally if lyon 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.850
 it's the only one I silencer 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.150
 so we will aim high level of the is the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.050
 fender good on the first real bad I 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.790
 am a little missed because I have 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.170
 opened the door a little too fired 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.880
 on the island has increased in the passage 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.250
 of euros really pull between the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.930
 Euro passages 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.730
 so I could not tell you how much 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.440
 I shot but it's the same 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.370
 eh have to wait until she comes down from 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:34.720
 two levels the car I accelerate 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.010
 that's what I would have if a little better and 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.050
 on the rear bumper we do not see 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.540
 impact it's cool but something to 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.490
 be careful is that others them 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.160
 on the other hand will surely have an impact on 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.200
 your life that a celebuzz good is the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.350
 online games cgt to one knows very well 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.709
 the bugs we get used to and we get 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.450
 accomodates at the end of the month we are obliged 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.580
 so I let you watch a little the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.620
 ground soup how good is it 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.110
 belittle the hedgehog at least two as 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.520
 mothers as the primary, but it suits you 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.410
 friendly to drive and it does not slip 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.480
 bad for a 4th it's a 4 wheels 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.410
 forgiveness motor for what will be its 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.410
 list really not bad 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.530
 so here's the next tutorial ben it will be 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.959
 for the opening of the hoods 40 me 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.000
 asked a lot and I said so much that 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.770
 do we'll do everything from this video 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.630
 so show you once with the big 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.650
 block so the air intake that emerges from 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.110
 hat in front by at least two taken 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.430
 air and bin we understand and once 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.600
 without it's the same technique but at 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.060
 the less you see the motor differences 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.620
 on the sapad so you take the meeting 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.440
 on the side it works almost every 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.419
 vehicles pull you right once 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.690
 at the top right and once at the top 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.340
 left 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.370
 for you to be far from a pole or 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.990
 otherwise it does not bug shielding biel 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.910
 or in a hurry you must not shield 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.580
 or if we have to shoot more shots and 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.870
 there you risk to smoke the engine 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.080
 this is the day the hood gently we 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.590
 without the parking brake and throttle 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.729
 but here it is open I will you 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.530
 show with the camera now 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.600
 the motor differences anyway 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.810
 can see the belt on the front 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.710
 this type motor so no air filter 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.710
 logic supported the block 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.280
 there and with them our chop so it's 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.510
 not the original hood jimmy the first 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.110
 so it's exactly the same technique 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:27.520
 in light sniper we aim at the end 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.800
 right the left end by making the 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.830
 vehicle and you will see and via a 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.990
 air filter we will say here is the 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.670
 next tutorial is finally the rate 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.430
 following what it is to turn on 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.090
 lighthouses it's pretty simple but there are some 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.280
 maybe they do not know so bring in 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.120
 you from a weapon with silent from 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.200
 preferably you shoot once in the air 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.250
 you will be referred your mates is 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.230
 maybe a little better to avoid the 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.640
 cops to get into the vehicle we 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.960
 waited for engine blues to come on 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.540
 you hit the headlights and you 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.460
 get out of the vehicle here and the lighthouses 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.320
 stay on and for more 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.700
 discretion can use a shot of 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.310
 punch a punch in the void you 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.000
 get into the vehicle and you do 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.730
 the same technique 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.190
 so if you liked this tutorial also you 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.780
 have questions invites you to me 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.080
 ask in comments on my page 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.970
 facebook on big theft auto network 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.800
 france the forum where i am most active 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.420
 and I 'll see you soon for a 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.070
 next video because there will be videos 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.580
 to remove the bumpers I 'm there 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.150
