gonna<00:00:59.550> feel<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> lot<00:01:00.180> softer<00:01:00.510> than<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.899> six<00:01:01.199> even

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
gonna feel a lot softer than a six even

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.110 
gonna feel a lot softer than a six even
though<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.160> does<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> aluminum

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
though it does have that aluminum

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.289 
though it does have that aluminum
chassis<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.350> chassis<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.299> completely

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
chassis now this chassis is completely

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.880 
chassis now this chassis is completely
rockered<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.380> means<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.740> there'll<00:01:07.860> be

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
rockered that means that there'll be

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
rockered that means that there'll be
less<00:01:08.189> dead<00:01:08.549> spots<00:01:08.850> underneath<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.540> foot
