t-mobile<00:02:22.800> funny<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.760> think<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.110> one

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
t-mobile funny I think this is the one

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.970 
t-mobile funny I think this is the one
yeah<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> one<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.730> has<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.330> broken

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
yeah this is the one that has a broken

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.160 
yeah this is the one that has a broken
display<00:02:28.980> cable<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.790> doesn't<00:02:30.000> really<00:02:30.170> yeah

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
display cable so it doesn't really yeah

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.530 
display cable so it doesn't really yeah
it's<00:02:31.620> kind<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.069> messed<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.090> got<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.269> very

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's kind of messed up it's got a very

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.990 
it's kind of messed up it's got a very
loose<00:02:33.810> display<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:35.280> think<00:02:35.519> he<00:02:35.640> said<00:02:35.880> that

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
loose display and I think he said that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.190 
loose display and I think he said that
the<00:02:36.090> display<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.599> this<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:36.870> does<00:02:36.989> not<00:02:37.019> work

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the display on this one does not work

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.910 
the display on this one does not work
but<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.980> rest<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.430> does<00:02:38.870> okay<00:02:39.870> well<00:02:40.319> cool

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
but the rest of it does okay well cool

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.570 
but the rest of it does okay well cool
display<00:02:41.760> piece<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.180> guess<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:43.260> then<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:44.280> one

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
display piece I guess and then this one

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.910 
display piece I guess and then this one
I<00:02:44.610> believe<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.209> black<00:02:45.450> one<00:02:45.720> he<00:02:46.590> said<00:02:46.799> this

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
I believe is the black one he said this

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.729 
I believe is the black one he said this
one<00:02:47.100> does<00:02:47.310> work<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:48.090> here<00:02:48.750> we<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.590> a

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
one does work so here we go this is a

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.800 
one does work so here we go this is a
singular<00:02:50.220> foot<00:02:50.430> holy<00:02:50.700> crap<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
singular foot holy crap this is the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.509 
singular foot holy crap this is the
exact<00:02:52.470> same<00:02:52.860> one<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.489> had<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.660> was<00:02:55.430> 11<00:02:56.430> I
