00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
musicians each with a different voice

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.480 
musicians each with a different voice
you<00:00:21.539> start<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.230> notice<00:00:22.410> as<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.830> explore<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you start to notice as you explore the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.910 
you start to notice as you explore the
musicians<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.660> rhythmic<00:00:25.170> some

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
musicians that some are rhythmic some

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.029 
musicians that some are rhythmic some
are<00:00:26.099> more<00:00:26.490> melodic<00:00:27.320> all<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.590> them<00:00:28.740> work

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
are more melodic all of them work

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.550 
are more melodic all of them work
together<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> same<00:00:30.000> four<00:00:30.570> beat<00:00:31.019> looping

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
together in the same four beat looping

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.700 
together in the same four beat looping
rhythm<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.660> freely<00:00:33.960> mix<00:00:34.440> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
rhythm and so you can freely mix and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
rhythm and so you can freely mix and
match<00:00:34.890> these<00:00:35.250> different<00:00:35.760> voices<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.390> off

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
first glance this looks like a very

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
first glance this looks like a very
simple<00:00:50.370> app<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.090> there's<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.690> might<00:00:51.840> think

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
simple app and there's you might think

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380 
simple app and there's you might think
brother<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.649> much<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> quickly

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
brother that much to do but you quickly

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.030 

let's<00:01:43.630> take<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.870> closer<00:01:44.200> look<00:01:44.320> at<00:01:44.650> each<00:01:44.740> of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
let's take a closer look at each of

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
let's take a closer look at each of
these<00:01:45.160> different<00:01:46.440> performers<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.910> see<00:01:48.910> what

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
these different performers and see what

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.880 
these different performers and see what
they<00:01:49.180> can<00:01:49.240> do<00:01:49.480> one<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.350> things<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.680> notice

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
they can do one of the things you notice

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.980 
they can do one of the things you notice
is<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.280> there's<00:01:51.790> all<00:01:52.030> sorts<00:01:52.480> of<00:01:52.570> ways<00:01:52.750> that

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
is that there's all sorts of ways that

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.320 
is that there's all sorts of ways that
you<00:01:53.110> can<00:01:53.230> explore<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.430> different<00:01:54.790> dimensions

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
you can explore the different dimensions

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.969 
you can explore the different dimensions
in<00:01:55.900> terms<00:01:56.230> of<00:01:56.470> pitch<00:01:57.250> as<00:01:57.850> well<00:01:58.150> as<00:01:58.300> rhythm<00:01:58.979> as

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
in terms of pitch as well as rhythm as

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.210 
in terms of pitch as well as rhythm as
well<00:02:00.040> as<00:02:01.290> volume<00:02:02.550> and<00:02:03.630> these<00:02:04.630> are<00:02:04.780> all

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
well as volume and these are all

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.690 
well as volume and these are all
important<00:02:06.810> musical<00:02:07.810> relationships<00:02:08.700> that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
important musical relationships that

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.910 
important musical relationships that
have<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.000> do<00:02:10.060> with<00:02:10.210> patterns<00:02:10.479> so<00:02:11.290> while<00:02:11.770> you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
have to do with patterns so while you

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.140 
have to do with patterns so while you
may<00:02:12.280> not<00:02:12.310> think<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.120> a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
may not think that this is a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.770 
may not think that this is a
mathematical<00:02:14.550> application<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:16.090> actually<00:02:16.570> is

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
mathematical application it actually is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.840 
mathematical application it actually is
very<00:02:17.140> there's<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.040> lot<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.340> logic<00:02:18.459> in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
very there's a lot of logic in

00:02:18.850 --> 00:03:28.300 
very there's a lot of logic in
mathematics
