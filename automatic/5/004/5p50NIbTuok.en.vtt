the video so this new story mode is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.389 
the video so this new story mode is
basically<00:00:36.840> either<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.129> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
basically either going to be one of

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.430 
basically either going to be one of
three<00:00:38.700> things<00:00:38.820> that's<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:39.870> guess<00:00:39.930> either

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
three things that's just my guess either

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.979 
three things that's just my guess either
a<00:00:40.710> prequel<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.059> story<00:00:42.329> mode<00:00:42.540> which<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
a prequel to the story mode which is

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.740 
a prequel to the story mode which is
like<00:00:43.200> basically<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.550> few<00:00:45.180> hours<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.539> gameplay

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
like basically a few hours of gameplay

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
like basically a few hours of gameplay
before<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> story<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:47.010> actually<00:00:47.340> happened

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
before the story would actually happened

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
before the story would actually happened
you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.450> either<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:48.870> alternative<00:00:49.289> ending

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
you can either be an alternative ending

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.990 
you can either be an alternative ending
which<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.980> don't<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.399> happen<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
which I don't think will happen but I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.830 
which I don't think will happen but I
thought<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.750> pretty

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
thought would be actually pretty

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.290 
thought would be actually pretty
interesting<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.579> sort<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.239> like

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
interesting or it can be sort of like

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
interesting or it can be sort of like

that<00:01:37.740> wouldn't<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.040> too<00:01:38.310> interesting<00:01:38.759> because

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that wouldn't be too interesting because

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.249 
that wouldn't be too interesting because
it's<00:01:39.150> basically<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.570> okay<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.079> are<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it's basically like okay here are the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.010 
it's basically like okay here are the
events<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.710> happened<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.610> before<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
events that happened right before the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.840 
events that happened right before the
events<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.380> Arkham<00:01:43.680> origins<00:01:43.829> happened<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
events of Arkham origins happened and I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.160 
events of Arkham origins happened and I
mean<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.090> guess<00:01:45.240> I'll<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.479> pretty<00:01:45.720> interesting

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
mean I guess I'll be pretty interesting

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.109 
mean I guess I'll be pretty interesting
like<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.860> could<00:01:47.040> throw<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.579> villain<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
like they could throw in a villain that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
like they could throw in a villain that
isn't<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.630> Arkham<00:01:48.899> origins<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.320> all<00:01:49.530> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
it's more from origins to play but it

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.599 
it's more from origins to play but it
wouldn't<00:02:24.769> really<00:02:24.859> provide<00:02:25.370> anything

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609

character like Killer Croc and add some

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.970

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.959 
we'll eventually see in a future Arkham
game<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.799> wouldn't<00:02:37.069> bring<00:02:37.219> nearly<00:02:37.879> as

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:37.969 
game but it wouldn't bring nearly as

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.449 
game but it wouldn't bring nearly as
much<00:02:38.150> attention<00:02:38.329> as<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.169> after<00:02:39.950> story<00:02:40.250> mode

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
much attention as a after story mode

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.250

Grayson's<00:03:13.730> origin<00:03:14.090> now<00:03:14.449> I<00:03:14.480> think<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:15.199> expense

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
Grayson's origin now I think in expense

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.740 
Grayson's origin now I think in expense
story<00:03:16.400> mode<00:03:16.609> should<00:03:17.060> definitely<00:03:17.479> deal<00:03:17.720> with

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
story mode should definitely deal with

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.649 
story mode should definitely deal with
Dick<00:03:18.379> Grayson<00:03:18.889> now<00:03:19.639> obviously<00:03:20.209> okay<00:03:20.449> it's

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
Dick Grayson now obviously okay it's

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.059 
Dick Grayson now obviously okay it's
gonna<00:03:20.780> deal<00:03:20.989> with<00:03:21.019> Dick<00:03:21.229> Grayson<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:21.829> got<00:03:21.979> his

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
gonna deal with Dick Grayson you got his

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.800 
gonna deal with Dick Grayson you got his
parents<00:03:22.459> dying<00:03:22.699> and<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.209> that's<00:03:23.509> basically

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
parents dying and that that's basically

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.800 
parents dying and that that's basically
the<00:03:24.650> motive<00:03:24.979> is<00:03:25.159> doors<00:03:25.909> into<00:03:26.060> Dick<00:03:26.209> Grayson<00:03:26.599> in

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
the motive is doors into Dick Grayson in

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.839 
the motive is doors into Dick Grayson in
a<00:03:26.930> video<00:03:27.139> game<00:03:27.199> but<00:03:27.979> they<00:03:28.159> could<00:03:28.370> also<00:03:28.549> go<00:03:28.819> a

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
a video game but they could also go a

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.670 
a video game but they could also go a
different<00:03:29.120> route<00:03:29.389> like<00:03:29.659> you<00:03:29.750> go<00:03:29.959> more<00:03:30.379> of<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
different route like you go more of the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.129 
different route like you go more of the
villains<00:03:31.159> route<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.669> explain<00:03:32.090> where<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
villains route and explain where the

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.289 
villains route and explain where the
assassins<00:03:33.650> are<00:03:33.799> now<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.400> let's<00:03:34.609> say<00:03:34.849> one<00:03:35.209> of

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
assassins are now so let's say one of

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.179 
assassins are now so let's say one of
the<00:03:35.359> assassins<00:03:35.599> dies<00:03:36.199> or<00:03:36.680> some<00:03:36.919> sort<00:03:37.129> of

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.189 
the assassins dies or some sort of

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.280 
the assassins dies or some sort of
accident<00:03:37.819> like<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.030> which<00:03:38.689> I<00:03:38.810> think<00:03:39.049> might

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
accident like that which I think might

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.979 
accident like that which I think might
happen<00:03:39.530> for<00:03:39.769> on<00:03:40.159> a<00:03:40.189> copperhead<00:03:40.790> or<00:03:41.479> not

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
happen for on a copperhead or not

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.319 
happen for on a copperhead or not
Firefly<00:03:42.560> some<00:03:43.280> sort<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.579> I<00:03:43.729> think<00:03:43.790> villain

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
Firefly some sort of I think villain

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.289 
Firefly some sort of I think villain
will<00:03:44.569> eventually<00:03:45.109> be<00:03:45.259> dying<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:45.859> us<00:03:46.299> game

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
will eventually be dying in this us game

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.699 
will eventually be dying in this us game
I<00:03:47.479> don't<00:03:47.599> know<00:03:47.689> why<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:47.840> say<00:03:48.169> that<00:03:48.349> I<00:03:48.379> just<00:03:48.590> got

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
thing and they can just you know expand

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.529 
thing and they can just you know expand
deeper<00:04:09.049> into<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:10.099> Joker's<00:04:10.519> mind<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.239> really

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:11.539 
deeper into the Joker's mind and really

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.409 
deeper into the Joker's mind and really
like<00:04:11.900> explain<00:04:12.349> that<00:04:12.650> in<00:04:12.949> any<00:04:13.430> expanding<00:04:14.150> story

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
like explain that in any expanding story

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.449 
like explain that in any expanding story
move<00:04:14.629> so<00:04:15.169> they<00:04:15.289> could<00:04:15.469> go<00:04:15.590> with<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.859> joker<00:04:16.159> they

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
move so they could go with a joker they

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.430 
move so they could go with a joker they
could<00:04:16.609> go<00:04:16.699> with<00:04:16.820> pretty<00:04:17.269> much<00:04:17.479> any<00:04:17.750> assassin

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
could go with pretty much any assassin

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.409 
could go with pretty much any assassin
and<00:04:18.650> just<00:04:19.159> give<00:04:19.340> us<00:04:19.459> an<00:04:19.579> expanded<00:04:19.969> story<00:04:20.239> mode

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
and just give us an expanded story mode

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.300 
and just give us an expanded story mode
so<00:04:20.690> mostly<00:04:21.469> I<00:04:21.590> think<00:04:21.650> it's<00:04:21.919> going<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.159> be

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
so mostly I think it's going to be

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.730 
so mostly I think it's going to be
hopefully<00:04:22.909> a<00:04:23.180> Dick<00:04:23.449> Grayson<00:04:23.779> origin

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
hopefully a Dick Grayson origin

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.350 
hopefully a Dick Grayson origin
typist<00:04:25.190> expense<00:04:25.610> story<00:04:25.880> mode<00:04:26.060> or<00:04:26.210> they're

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
typist expense story mode or they're

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.180 
typist expense story mode or they're
going<00:04:26.449> to<00:04:26.660> go<00:04:26.810> with<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.169> events<00:04:27.590> where<00:04:28.009> the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
going to go with the events where the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.879 
going to go with the events where the
assassins<00:04:28.639> are<00:04:28.850> after<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:30.410> story<00:04:30.650> mode<00:04:30.800> of

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
assassins are after the story mode of

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:31.240 
assassins are after the story mode of
course

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
course

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.279 
course
so<00:04:31.669> my<00:04:31.910> last<00:04:32.180> thing<00:04:32.419> I<00:04:32.509> want<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.690> talk<00:04:32.810> about<00:04:32.960> is

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
so my last thing I want to talk about is

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.670 
so my last thing I want to talk about is
a<00:04:33.889> alternative<00:04:34.610> ending<00:04:35.389> now<00:04:35.930> on<00:04:36.259> alternative

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
a alternative ending now on alternative

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.559 
a alternative ending now on alternative
ending<00:04:36.979> wouldn't<00:04:37.580> but<00:04:37.970> most<00:04:38.240> people<00:04:38.449> will

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
ending wouldn't but most people will

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:39.700 
ending wouldn't but most people will
disagree<00:04:38.660> with<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.050> because<00:04:39.319> why<00:04:39.500> would<00:04:39.680> you

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
disagree with you because why would you

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.170 
disagree with you because why would you
want<00:04:39.770> alt<00:04:40.009> inventing<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.550> wouldn't<00:04:40.849> have<00:04:40.970> no

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
want alt inventing it wouldn't have no

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.029 
want alt inventing it wouldn't have no
continuity<00:04:41.660> with<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.199> other<00:04:42.470> games<00:04:42.770> now

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
continuity with the other games now

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.339 
continuity with the other games now
that's<00:04:43.370> true<00:04:43.669> but<00:04:44.569> it<00:04:44.690> would<00:04:44.780> be<00:04:44.900> pretty<00:04:45.080> damn

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
that's true but it would be pretty damn

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:46.570 
that's true but it would be pretty damn
interesting<00:04:45.590> but<00:04:46.009> that<00:04:46.130> doesn't<00:04:46.400> mean<00:04:46.460> they

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
interesting but that doesn't mean they

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.950 
interesting but that doesn't mean they
can't<00:04:46.610> add<00:04:46.940> Easter<00:04:47.360> eggs<00:04:47.449> like<00:04:47.690> they<00:04:47.810> could

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
can't add Easter eggs like they could

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.779 
can't add Easter eggs like they could
add<00:04:48.169> these<00:04:48.800> strikes<00:04:49.069> to<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.340> this

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
add these strikes to the this

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.689 
add these strikes to the this
alternative<00:04:50.210> ending<00:04:51.130> that<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.160> could<00:04:52.610> have

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
expanded store mode could definitely

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.520 
expanded store mode could definitely
focus<00:05:30.979> on<00:05:31.070> e<00:05:31.250> strikes<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:31.880> but<00:05:32.570> besides<00:05:33.409> that

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
focus on e strikes and but besides that

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.230 
focus on e strikes and but besides that
like<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:34.130> think<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.520> alternate<00:05:34.849> ending<00:05:34.970> could

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
like I think the alternate ending could

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.110 
like I think the alternate ending could
really<00:05:35.479> you<00:05:36.259> know<00:05:36.349> do<00:05:36.560> that<00:05:36.710> so<00:05:37.280> what<00:05:38.000> would

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
really you know do that so what would

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.580 
really you know do that so what would
you<00:05:38.330> want<00:05:38.539> to<00:05:38.630> see<00:05:38.780> for<00:05:38.990> an<00:05:39.080> alternate<00:05:39.440> ending

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
you want to see for an alternate ending

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.529 
you want to see for an alternate ending
so<00:05:40.009> obviously<00:05:40.520> I<00:05:40.610> don't<00:05:40.759> know<00:05:40.969> the<00:05:41.000> ending<00:05:41.330> yet

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
so obviously I don't know the ending yet

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.080 
so obviously I don't know the ending yet
