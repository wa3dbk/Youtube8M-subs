that I get it to the crafting box again
to<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.379> furnace<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.979> it'll<00:01:05.489> work<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
to the furnace but it'll work so the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
to the furnace but it'll work so the
first<00:01:07.110> thing<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:08.240> we're<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
first thing you would be we're going to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.929 
first thing you would be we're going to
do<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> move<00:01:09.840> forward<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.670> down<00:01:11.670> there's<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
do is to move forward and down there's a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.230 
do is to move forward and down there's a
big<00:01:12.420> trap<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.110> lava<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> aren't<00:01:15.090> paying

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
big trap of lava so if you aren't paying

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.560 
big trap of lava so if you aren't paying
attention<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:16.619> still<00:01:16.860> doesn't<00:01:16.979> work<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:18.450> go

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
attention it still doesn't work you go

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.980 
attention it still doesn't work you go
and<00:01:18.750> fall<00:01:18.930> down<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> die<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.090> obviously<00:01:21.090> all

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and fall down and die and obviously all

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
and fall down and die and obviously all
your<00:01:22.320> equipment<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.799> sprint<00:01:23.009> down<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
it's a pretty sneaky trap not a lot to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.100 
it's a pretty sneaky trap not a lot to
it<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.119> multiple<00:01:30.479> people<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> only

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it and you go multiple people the only

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.280 
it and you go multiple people the only
bad<00:01:31.320> part<00:01:31.530> about<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:32.009> trap<00:01:32.250> though<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.670> uh

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
bad part about this trap though is uh

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.270 
bad part about this trap though is uh
it's<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.560> easy<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.810> destroy<00:01:36.890> just<00:01:37.890> putting

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it's really easy to destroy just putting

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.999 
it's really easy to destroy just putting
a<00:01:38.340> few<00:01:38.369> blocks<00:01:38.610> down<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:40.920> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
a few blocks down you know then you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.389 
a few blocks down you know then you
don't<00:01:41.159> die<00:01:41.310> anymore<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
don't die anymore or you can just have a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.670 
don't die anymore or you can just have a
pitcher<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> water<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> drop<00:01:46.259> some<00:01:46.470> water

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
pitcher of water go and drop some water

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
pitcher of water go and drop some water
down<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> flames<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:48.780> hey

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
down there then the flames go hey

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.560 
down there then the flames go hey
obviously<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.430> my<00:01:50.610> trap<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.329> pretty

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
obviously but that's my trap it's pretty

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.149 
obviously but that's my trap it's pretty
genius<00:01:51.600> gonna<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.590> over<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.950> place

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
genius gonna put them all over the place
