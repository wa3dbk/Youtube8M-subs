goals<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.220> discarding<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.820> because<00:01:42.030> I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
goals I'm just discarding them because I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
goals I'm just discarding them because I
probably<00:01:42.899> already<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.320> them<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.799> they

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
probably already have them and they

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.069 
probably already have them and they
really<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.759> go<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.240> too<00:01:45.329> much<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:45.930> just

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
really don't go for too much so I'm just

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.389 
really don't go for too much so I'm just
going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.350> ahead<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.710> discard<00:01:47.040> most<00:01:47.310> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
going to go ahead and discard most of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
going to go ahead and discard most of
these<00:01:47.460> low<00:01:47.729> overall<00:01:48.060> goals<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> save

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
these low overall goals I have to save

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.520 
these low overall goals I have to save
my<00:01:49.140> reserve<00:01:49.619> space<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.869> guys<00:01:52.049> don't<00:01:52.259> freak

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
out too much on that so that pack was

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.139 
out too much on that so that pack was
pretty<00:01:55.710> nice<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.040> got<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.189> Carter<00:01:56.579> collectible

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
pretty nice we got a Carter collectible

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.880 
pretty nice we got a Carter collectible
and<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> Donte<00:01:58.170> Moncrief<00:01:58.380> so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.320 

that<00:02:03.890> pack<00:02:04.130> was<00:02:04.310> definitely<00:02:04.820> nice<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.030> try

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
that pack was definitely nice to try

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.109 
that pack was definitely nice to try
keep<00:02:05.510> that<00:02:05.540> rolling<00:02:05.840> into<00:02:06.140> pack<00:02:06.440> number<00:02:07.160> six<00:02:07.850> I

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
keep that rolling into pack number six I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:16.720 
keep that rolling into pack number six I
guess<00:02:08.360> or<00:02:09.320> five<00:02:11.080> Alshon<00:02:12.080> Jeffery<00:02:15.700> get<00:02:16.700> a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
guess or five Alshon Jeffery get a

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.190 
guess or five Alshon Jeffery get a
blender<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:19.130> not<00:02:19.670> not<00:02:20.510> too<00:02:20.690> much<00:02:20.810> luck<00:02:21.080> in

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200

these pack so far hopefully doesn't stay
that<00:02:23.120> way<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> entire<00:02:23.540> time<00:02:24.110> hopefully<00:02:24.410> it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
that way the entire time hopefully it's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.770 
that way the entire time hopefully it's
just<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.860> little<00:02:24.980> rough<00:02:25.190> patch<00:02:25.459> we<00:02:25.850> gotta<00:02:26.030> push

was the 84 up food seven packs left and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.280 
was the 84 up food seven packs left and
then<00:02:49.640> we'll<00:02:49.760> open<00:02:49.790> up<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.270> talker<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.170> this

then we'll open up this talker so this

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.229 
then we'll open up this talker so this
topper<00:02:51.620> definitely<00:02:52.040> seems<00:02:52.250> nonsense<00:02:52.790> that's

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
topper definitely seems nonsense that's

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.820 
topper definitely seems nonsense that's
one<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.660> main<00:02:53.810> reasons<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.290> end<00:02:54.440> up<00:02:54.500> getting

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
one of the main reasons I end up getting

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.070 
one of the main reasons I end up getting
this<00:02:54.950> because<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.430> toppers<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:56.150> look<00:02:56.930> too

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
this because the toppers just look too

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.310 
this because the toppers just look too
good<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.410> turn<00:02:57.590> down<00:02:58.660> like<00:02:59.660> i<00:02:59.690> said<00:02:59.870> though<00:03:00.200> if

good to turn down like i said though if

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.660 
good to turn down like i said though if

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.650 

once<00:03:17.460> these<00:03:17.580> collectibles<00:03:18.150> really<00:03:18.360> don't<00:03:18.510> go

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
once these collectibles really don't go

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.510 
once these collectibles really don't go
for<00:03:18.900> anything<00:03:19.110> except<00:03:19.590> for<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.830> new<00:03:20.010> legends

for anything except for the new legends
those<00:03:20.700> are<00:03:20.850> really<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> only<00:03:21.270> ones<00:03:21.540> that

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
those are really the only ones that

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.240 
those are really the only ones that
actually<00:03:21.810> go<00:03:22.110> for<00:03:22.290> anything<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.710> that's<00:03:22.830> why<00:03:23.010> I

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
actually go for anything so that's why I

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.950 
actually go for anything so that's why I
was<00:03:23.730> hoping<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.060> fall<00:03:24.240> collectible<00:03:24.720> from<00:03:24.810> the

was hoping to fall collectible from the
new<00:03:25.110> legends<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:25.740> it<00:03:25.920> doesn't<00:03:26.190> like<00:03:26.400> I'm

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
new legends but it doesn't like I'm

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.670 
new legends but it doesn't like I'm
going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.880> now<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:27.900> still<00:03:28.050> got<00:03:28.170> five<00:03:28.380> packs

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
going to now we still got five packs

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.990 
going to now we still got five packs
left<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.010> i'm<00:03:29.070> not<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.370> completely<00:03:29.760> give

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
left so i'm not going to completely give

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.790 
left so i'm not going to completely give
up<00:03:30.030> hope<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:30.600> i<00:03:30.870> was<00:03:31.170> hoping<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.500> bundle

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
up hope but i was hoping the bundle

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.350 
up hope but i was hoping the bundle
would<00:03:31.890> be<00:03:31.980> better<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.460> far<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:32.940> hasn't

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
would be better so far and it hasn't

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.510 
would be better so far and it hasn't
been<00:03:36.320> another<00:03:37.320> blita<00:03:37.710> call<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.160> think<00:03:38.370> that's

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
been another blita call I think that's

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.850 
been another blita call I think that's
the<00:03:38.580> same<00:03:38.820> one<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.120> pulled<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.710> got

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
the same one I pulled to this you got

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.400 
the same one I pulled to this you got
some<00:03:40.980> high<00:03:41.130> overall<00:03:41.400> goals<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.090> back<00:03:45.410> you

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
some high overall goals in that back you

year<00:05:54.280> they've<00:05:54.520> done<00:05:54.729> it<00:05:54.880> so<00:05:55.090> I<00:05:55.120> really<00:05:55.479> think

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
year they've done it so I really think

that<00:05:55.810> this<00:05:55.960> has<00:05:56.290> potential<00:05:56.770> some<00:05:57.130> of<00:05:57.190> these

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
that this has potential some of these

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.380 
that this has potential some of these
cards<00:05:57.460> have<00:05:57.640> potential<00:05:58.000> especially<00:05:58.090> with

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
cards have potential especially with
