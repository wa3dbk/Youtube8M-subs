00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
player on that I'm still thinking doing

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.009 
player on that I'm still thinking doing
one<00:02:09.280> just<00:02:09.549> a<00:02:09.580> storm<00:02:09.819> i<00:02:09.940> wish<00:02:10.239> if<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.840> don't

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
mind every time that probably will was

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.819 
mind every time that probably will was
drew<00:02:12.819> out<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:12.940> whole<00:02:13.180> course<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.810> for<00:02:14.739> me

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
drew out the whole course of it for me

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.339 
drew out the whole course of it for me
to<00:02:14.950> get<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> end<00:02:15.480> well<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:16.810> through<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.110> m

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
to get the end well just through the m

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.960 
to get the end well just through the m
was<00:02:17.530> going<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.950> show<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.220> how<00:02:18.400> long<00:02:18.790> it

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
was going to show you how long it

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.160 
was going to show you how long it
actually<00:02:19.120> lasts<00:02:19.660> in<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.959> standard<00:02:20.380> match<00:02:20.610> so

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
actually lasts in the standard match so

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.380 
actually lasts in the standard match so
this<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.319> basically<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:24.130> really<00:02:24.640> classic<00:02:24.970> i

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
this is basically a really classic i

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.979 
this is basically a really classic i
think<00:02:26.349> i'll<00:02:26.470> assume<00:02:26.769> which<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.880> basically<00:02:28.780> in

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
think i'll assume which is basically in

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.360 
think i'll assume which is basically in
their<00:02:29.110> kids<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.620> mean<00:02:29.769> will<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:29.950> really<00:02:30.160> like

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
their kids I mean will it really like

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.240 
their kids I mean will it really like
the<00:02:30.489> look<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:31.170> columns<00:02:32.170> tree<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.799> my<00:02:32.920> pain

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the look of it columns tree and my pain

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.910 
the look of it columns tree and my pain
just<00:02:33.700> didn't<00:02:34.000> do<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.360> well<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.630> basically<00:02:38.470> this

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
just didn't do so well so basically this

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.600 
just didn't do so well so basically this
one<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.579> going<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.879> last<00:02:40.030> pretty<00:02:40.329> long<00:02:40.799> I<00:02:41.799> know

five

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.910 

and<00:03:52.909> the<00:03:53.540> game<00:03:53.689> does<00:03:53.989> get<00:03:54.170> faster<00:03:54.590> like<00:03:54.739> your

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
and the game does get faster like your

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.740 
and the game does get faster like your
traditional<00:03:55.099> puzzle<00:03:56.030> game<00:03:56.180> where<00:03:56.209> that's<00:03:56.569> hot

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
fast I guess unless longer in Tetris but

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.140 
fast I guess unless longer in Tetris but

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
personally I preferred over it because I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.880 
personally I preferred over it because I
