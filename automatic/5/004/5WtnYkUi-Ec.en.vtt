about<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.830> video<00:00:13.950> applications<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> home

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
about the video applications in the home

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.580 
about the video applications in the home
or<00:00:15.299> how<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> get<00:00:15.630> video<00:00:15.839> out<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> bunch<00:00:16.500> of

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
or how you get video out to a bunch of

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.710 
or how you get video out to a bunch of
TVs<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.250> building<00:00:17.550> well<00:00:17.730> first<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> all<00:00:18.570> when

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
TVs in a building well first of all when

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570 
TVs in a building well first of all when
you<00:00:18.779> bring<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> coax<00:00:19.590> well<00:00:19.859> home<00:00:20.310> runs

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
you bring all the coax well home runs

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.160 
you bring all the coax well home runs
for<00:00:20.850> all<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> coax<00:00:21.390> runs<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
for all the coax runs out to the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.630 
for all the coax runs out to the
building<00:00:22.439> back<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.160> panel

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
building back to the panel

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.279 
building back to the panel
we<00:00:23.910> like<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.210> bash<00:00:24.420> those<00:00:24.720> through<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.170> two

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
we like to bash those through one or two

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
we like to bash those through one or two
knockouts<00:00:25.800> whatever<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> takes<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.670> start

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
knockouts whatever it takes and start

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.429 
knockouts whatever it takes and start
bundling<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.420> together<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:27.960> looping<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
bundling it together then looping it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.929 
bundling it together then looping it
maybe<00:00:28.680> into<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.130> needed<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.609> into

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
maybe into what we needed to get into

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
maybe into what we needed to get into
and<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.990> plenty<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> slack<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
and so we have plenty of slack in a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
and so we have plenty of slack in a
panel<00:00:32.279> later<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.610> down<00:00:32.730> there<00:00:32.910> or<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> plus<00:00:33.270> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
panel later on down there or the plus it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240 
panel later on down there or the plus it
makes<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> look<00:00:33.840> nice<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.079> neat<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.710> we've

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
makes it look nice and neat now we've

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.709 
makes it look nice and neat now we've
got<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> couple<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> options<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> video

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
got a couple of options with the video

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
got a couple of options with the video
application<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.350> could<00:00:37.500> use<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.980> standard

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
application we could use just a standard

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.119 
application we could use just a standard
splitter<00:00:38.750> which<00:00:39.750> might<00:00:39.989> work<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.200> fine<00:00:40.620> or

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
splitter which might work just fine or

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.729 
splitter which might work just fine or
we<00:00:41.550> could<00:00:41.790> use<00:00:41.940> an<00:00:42.180> amplifier<00:00:42.540> slash<00:00:43.230> splitter

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
we could use an amplifier slash splitter

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.650 
we could use an amplifier slash splitter
tied<00:00:43.980> together<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.820> combination<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
tied together or combination of the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
tied together or combination of the
boats<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.140> let's<00:00:46.890> take<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> look<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.460> those

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
boats so let's take a look at those

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.930 
boats so let's take a look at those

video signals in a building or in a home

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.289 
video signals in a building or in a home
would<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.860> use<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.850> product<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.270> this

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
would be to use a product like this

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.719 
would be to use a product like this
which<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.020> actually<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.439> splitter<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.220> an

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
which is actually a splitter and an

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.460 
which is actually a splitter and an
amplifier<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.869> that's<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.320> have

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
amplifier all in one that's what we have

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.200 
amplifier all in one that's what we have
wired<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.159> we've<00:01:47.579> got<00:01:47.759> four<00:01:48.000> wires

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
wired up here we've got four wires

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.789 
wired up here we've got four wires
coming<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.689> which<00:01:48.899> go<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.290> Ford<00:01:49.530> about

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
coming in which go out to Ford about

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.929 
coming in which go out to Ford about
puts<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.189> actually<00:01:50.399> there's<00:01:50.549> eight<00:01:50.729> outputs

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
puts and actually there's eight outputs

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.580 
puts and actually there's eight outputs
here<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:51.540> only<00:01:51.600> using<00:01:52.020> four<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.290> them

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
