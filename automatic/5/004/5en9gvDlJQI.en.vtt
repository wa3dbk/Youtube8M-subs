00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 even the little boy just wants to play 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.320
 for the amis the q3 is of course one 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.180
 mini suv they do not take that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.900
 but they should be really serious 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.580
 this one is dangerous 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 this car is risky just like that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.910
 entire gambled in las vegas here 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.910
 loves the thrill 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.190
 once a brave suv primarily for 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.989
 the female customer because that's it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.089
 those who sit the ear loves the overview 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 and the muscular appearance of her 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.579
 Daily companion of this concept car 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.409
 but here has more to offer than it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.300
 did not train with secretly 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.770
 but with five cylinders and 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.409
 a turbo committed to the rs logo in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.960
 this case to 360 ps that brings the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.320
 dare in 5 2 seconds to 100 and the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.960
 tacho needle shows 265 pointed at the end 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.650
 a brute suv animal just that 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:33.400
 waiting to be let go 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.690
 at least in theory yes, but we 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.010
 are here in america friends here can 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.619
 you do not drive as fast as you want 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.330
 65 miles on the highway in this 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.290
 city â€‹â€‹even only 35 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.210
 that's just 60 km h but even if 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.860
 one wanted and should drive faster 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.170
 This car is not the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.759
 Tires barely fit in the wheelhouses and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 the rims are all complete 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.910
 custom-made that means if you something 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.649
 breaks down then it costs like synonymous 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.119
 times a five-digit amount that is 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.670
 You should do this car after all 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.530
 because like a raw egg a raw egg 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.630
 but should not necessarily be here 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.369
 take the concept car is about like that 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.560
 yield the loans in las vegas 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.090
 the series version but it will be the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.959
 possibility to give the chassis too 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.430
 adjust 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.570
 then you can between crispbread and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.970
 rs q3 american white fine 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.280
 is a really nice toy 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.500
 club is said to benefit from the scb fans 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.760
 with the go of a compact athlete 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.989
 however, he is a bit here 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.830
 expensive between two and three 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.350
 You have to spend millions for one 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.850
 concept vehicle but already calculate that 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.250
 Of course, here is also a unique piece 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.570
 still one must say because I believe that 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.820
 will soon go into production 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.510
 he is too close to that perhaps 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.340
 already in 2013 until then you just have to 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.290
 earn the money in the covers 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.060
 to able to buy off-dwarf 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.459
 other cars with two and a half liters 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.360
 turbocharged engines cost around 60,000 euros 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:56.760
 underneath it will probably give up a rs3 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.760
 So the next kuka 100 has to be won 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.870
 hello audi yes probably only I call because of 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.490
 the car so who rs q3 is in the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.110
 hour he is back there no problem 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.100
 Do not worry that I 'll get killed 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.020
 all this again 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.600
 I'll let it all go again 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.730
 me just reported runs is more faithful 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.110
 sure, everything is not a problem here 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.110
 all this misunderstanding
