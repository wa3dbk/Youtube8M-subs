00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Hi everyone, I am working class 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.560
 this is the presentation of the shoe 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.519
 adidas by howard 4 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:13.080
 [Music] 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.910
 starting from the amortization also in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.939
 this adidas basketball shoe 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.130
 we have a midsole a mil money there 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.869
 the classical form is therefore eva 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.480
 used throughout the basketball line 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.000
 for the upper materials we have one 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.800
 lower state of mesh than we can 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.439
 see clearly in the area of ​​the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.080
 tongue while we have a layer 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.339
 diffuse upper or material 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.899
 plastic that does not allow us to glimpse 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.579
 nothing of the lower material of the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.309
 lower status than in the part 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.579
 back of the shoe where we have 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.340
 sprintweb technology that as always 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.800
 given by these bands of plastic tpu 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.660
 added at strategic points as far as 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.219
 there is no good fit 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.870
 a lot to say is a shoe that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.730
 vesta and true to site then of the same 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.780
 size with which we regularly go with 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.390
 the other shoes 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.820
 as for the support we have 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.070
 as always our sprintframe that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.250
 is used in the line of roses 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.770
 and in the crisis from the three we already have 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.810
 seen the presentation and therefore we have 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.580
 this dish tpu that starts from 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.860
 back of the shoe and arrives 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.259
 up to the central part that gives support 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.840
 and support especially at the level of 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.660
 twist with regard to support 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.399
 at the upper level we have this 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.429
 ankle cut which is enough 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.560
 high but above all compared to others 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.990
 adidas line shoes we have 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.140
 however a 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.380
 a fabric a supportive material 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.549
 it is not simply a layer of nash 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.320
 as for example the of roll 773 in 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.110
 general as final considerations 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.640
 this shoe is used and is the symbol 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.619
 dry dwight howard 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.500
 so it's definitely a shoe with 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.679
 cushioning support maintaining 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.570
 however the adidas line that 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.119
 favors the core file then the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.420
 feeling of grip on the ground compared 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.190
 to a massive cushioning and this 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.950
 colorway is the one that will be used 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.780
 in the star game and then in the details 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.480
 very interesting such as the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.670
 upper that changes color when struck 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.140
 from light in different angles and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.290
 above all something that I like 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.640
 very much that is in the laces that 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.860
 I kindly ask for the direction 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.200
 thank you so much for passing me the version 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.530
 previous of previous colorway 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.890
 that is the one with that to the classics 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.799
 flat laces then the dishes used in 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.130
 almost all adidas shoes while 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.660
 here we have round laces 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.519
 so a little bigger with a different one 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.530
 feeling to the touch and above all a lot 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.540
 very nice in terms of aesthetics 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.540
 for the rest we can say that this 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.090
 shoe is being used by a center 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.250
 it is however a shoe with support for one 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.780
 good traction good cushioning like 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.359
 I told you before and therefore it is definitely 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.430
 complete said this I invite you as 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.590

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.569
