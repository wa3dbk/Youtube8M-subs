00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.199 

was<00:02:08.530> living<00:02:08.739> here<00:02:09.100> long<00:02:09.369> time<00:02:09.640> though<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.149> it

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
was living here long time though and it

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.440 
was living here long time though and it
wasn't<00:02:10.390> me<00:02:10.630> many<00:02:11.140> years<00:02:11.760> ago<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.120> think

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
wasn't me many years ago I just think

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690

four<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.050> five<00:02:14.230> years<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.800> think<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.340> might<00:02:15.489> be

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
four to five years I think it might be

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.420 
four to five years I think it might be
more<00:02:15.880> than<00:02:16.120> merely<00:02:16.810> being<00:02:17.290> about<00:02:17.590> 20<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.130> think

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
more than merely being about 20 I think

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.030 
more than merely being about 20 I think
20<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.780> only<00:02:19.930> thing<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.140> was<00:02:20.260> ever<00:02:20.350> told<00:02:20.680> was
