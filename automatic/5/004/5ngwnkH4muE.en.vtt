there<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> threshold<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:52.199> information<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
there a threshold of information you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
there a threshold of information you
need<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.699> them<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.780> testify<00:00:55.530> we

however<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:07.350> sort<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.830> set<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> threshold<00:01:08.340> in

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
however we sort of set a threshold in

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640 
however we sort of set a threshold in
terms<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.210> them<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.689> least<00:01:09.900> being<00:01:10.170> able<00:01:10.350> to
