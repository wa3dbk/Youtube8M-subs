whatever it may be that has the closure
in<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> back<00:00:31.109> you'd<00:00:31.500> open<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> work<00:00:32.160> on

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
in the back you'd open up to work on

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.520 
in the back you'd open up to work on
your<00:00:32.460> engine<00:00:32.820> now<00:00:33.780> there's<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> there's<00:00:34.350> a

your engine now there's a there's a
button<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.460> right<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:35.940> see<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.239> on

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
button and right here you can see it on

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.990 
button and right here you can see it on
this<00:00:36.450> photo<00:00:36.660> says<00:00:36.899> blower<00:00:37.579> that<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.820> need

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this photo says blower that you need

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.770 
this photo says blower that you need
your<00:00:39.180> wand<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.590> not<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.920> need<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.399> run

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
your wand and it's not just need to run

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.920 
your wand and it's not just need to run
but<00:00:42.780> you've<00:00:42.960> got<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.379> run<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.770> every<00:00:44.610> time<00:00:45.090> you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
but you've got to run it every time you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
but you've got to run it every time you
turn<00:00:46.110> off<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.410> engine<00:00:46.739> he<00:00:46.860> started<00:00:47.250> again

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
turn off your engine he started again

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
turn off your engine he started again
and<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> reason<00:00:48.059> being<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.200> all<00:00:49.559> those

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and the reason being is that all those

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.560 
and the reason being is that all those
gases<00:00:50.399> they<00:00:50.640> build<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.149> within<00:00:51.360> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
gases they build up within that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.110 
gases they build up within that
enclosure<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> fail<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> run<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
enclosure and if you fail to run the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
enclosure and if you fail to run the
blower<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.320> could<00:00:55.469> actually<00:00:55.680> blow<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.370> your

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
blower you could actually blow up your

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.389 
blower you could actually blow up your
boat<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.600> mean<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> sounds<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.350> bad<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
boat and I mean it sounds really bad it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
boat and I mean it sounds really bad it
doesn't<00:00:59.730> mean<00:00:59.789> you're<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> blow<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
doesn't mean you're going to blow up and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
doesn't mean you're going to blow up and
everything<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
everything is going to be like a like a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
everything is going to be like a like a
bomb<00:01:02.640> went<00:01:02.670> off<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> means<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
bomb went off what it means is that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.929 
bomb went off what it means is that
there's<00:01:04.680> enough<00:01:04.920> gases<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
there's enough gases in there that you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.690 
there's enough gases in there that you
blow<00:01:06.270> up<00:01:06.540> probably<00:01:07.439> blow<00:01:07.590> off<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:07.979> backup<00:01:08.430> or

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
blow up probably blow off for backup or

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.280 
blow up probably blow off for backup or
damage<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.510> engine

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
damage your engine

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.220 
damage your engine
tons<00:01:11.290> of<00:01:11.500> repairs<00:01:11.950> damage<00:01:12.490> your<00:01:12.640> passengers

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
tons of repairs damage your passengers

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.430 
tons of repairs damage your passengers
put<00:01:14.230> your<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:15.400> know<00:01:15.610> put<00:01:15.850> your<00:01:16.000> people<00:01:16.210> out<00:01:17.200> of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
put your you know put your people out of

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.560 
put your you know put your people out of
the<00:01:17.500> boat<00:01:17.740> because<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.250> kept<00:01:18.430> going<00:01:18.730> off<00:01:18.940> and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
the boat because it kept going off and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.170 
the boat because it kept going off and
it's<00:01:19.990> not<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.170> good<00:01:20.470> thing<00:01:20.680> so<00:01:21.040> always<00:01:21.670> run<00:01:22.000> your

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
it's not a good thing so always run your

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.510 
it's not a good thing so always run your
blower<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.530> reason<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.890> run<00:01:24.100> your<00:01:24.280> blower

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
blower and the reason to run your blower

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.910 
blower and the reason to run your blower
and<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.270> simple<00:01:25.660> you<00:01:25.870> just<00:01:26.080> turn<00:01:26.620> a<00:01:26.650> little

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
and it's simple you just turn a little

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.550 
and it's simple you just turn a little
switch<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:28.450> this<00:01:28.630> case<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.050> right<00:01:29.229> there<00:01:29.470> in

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
switch in this case is right there in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.890 
switch in this case is right there in
the<00:01:29.650> handle<00:01:29.979> turn<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.910> switch<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.600> sucks

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
the handle turn a switch and it sucks

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.109 
the handle turn a switch and it sucks
all<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.350> out<00:01:32.580> something<00:01:33.580> else<00:01:33.760> you<00:01:33.940> might

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
all that out something else you might

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.700 
all that out something else you might
want<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.479> do<00:01:34.630> in<00:01:34.840> addition<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.290> running<00:01:35.470> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
want to do in addition to running the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.859 
want to do in addition to running the
blower<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.340> probably<00:01:36.550> overkill<00:01:37.000> but

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
blower and this is probably overkill but

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.380 
blower and this is probably overkill but
you<00:01:38.020> can<00:01:38.170> open<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.530> cover<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.970> you<00:01:40.090> can<00:01:40.240> let

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
you can open that cover and you can let

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.090 
you can open that cover and you can let
it<00:01:40.540> air<00:01:40.690> out<00:01:40.720> because<00:01:41.050> all<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.530> lowers<00:01:41.860> doing

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
it air out because all the lowers doing

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.490 
it air out because all the lowers doing
is<00:01:42.220> sucking<00:01:42.700> those<00:01:42.820> gas<00:01:43.090> vapors<00:01:43.600> out<00:01:43.810> sucking

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
is sucking those gas vapors out sucking

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.740 
is sucking those gas vapors out sucking
it<00:01:44.590> out<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.830> back<00:01:45.040> there's<00:01:45.310> little<00:01:45.550> pipes<00:01:45.759> so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
it out the back there's little pipes so

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.420 
it out the back there's little pipes so
always<00:01:46.930> remember<00:01:47.229> run<00:01:47.680> your<00:01:47.860> blower<00:01:48.040> and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
always remember run your blower and

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.770 
always remember run your blower and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
people tell you not to run your blower

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.570 
people tell you not to run your blower
they<00:01:50.560> don't<00:01:50.800> know<00:01:50.920> what<00:01:51.100> they're<00:01:51.250> talking

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
they don't know what they're talking
