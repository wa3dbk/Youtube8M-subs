gurbani this is similar to sicky to the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.540 
gurbani this is similar to sicky to the
max<00:00:27.240> which<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> web<00:00:28.740> which<00:00:29.369> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
another similar one like this by other

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.450 
another similar one like this by other
volunteers<00:00:40.320> by<00:00:40.500> sick<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> max<00:00:41.219> which

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
volunteers by sick of the max which

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.930 
volunteers by sick of the max which
works<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.670> Microsoft<00:00:45.200> mobile<00:00:46.940> phone

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
so if you have one of those platforms

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.529 
so if you have one of those platforms
that's<00:00:50.250> been<00:00:50.430> available<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> long<00:00:51.270> time

that's been available for a long time
but<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> first<00:00:52.170> app<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.920> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
but this is the first app that is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.459 
but this is the first app that is
available<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.020> popular<00:00:56.270> iPhone<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.989> iPod

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
touch so right now this is the first

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.359 
touch so right now this is the first
version<00:01:02.300> it's<00:01:03.300> fairly<00:01:03.780> basic<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.100> see

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
version it's fairly basic you can see

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.890 
version it's fairly basic you can see
that<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.000> there's<00:01:06.299> pretty<00:01:06.479> much<00:01:06.540> just

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that right now there's pretty much just

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.640 
that right now there's pretty much just
the<00:01:07.799> standard<00:01:08.810> keyboard<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.260> would<00:01:10.409> see

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the standard keyboard that you would see

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.789 
the standard keyboard that you would see
on<00:01:10.680> an<00:01:11.070> iPhone<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:13.229> would<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.409> start

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
on an iPhone and you would just start

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.990 
on an iPhone and you would just start
doing<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> search<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.420> using<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> keyboard

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
doing the search here using the keyboard

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.910 
doing the search here using the keyboard
there's<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.380> upcoming<00:01:19.380> version<00:01:19.560> that's

already<00:01:20.159> been<00:01:20.460> developed<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.390> they're

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
already been developed but they're

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.630 
already been developed but they're
waiting<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> release<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:23.040> there's<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
waiting to release it because there's it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.179 
waiting to release it because there's it
takes<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> long<00:01:24.150> time<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.890> release<00:01:25.890> apps

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
takes a long time to release apps

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
takes a long time to release apps
through<00:01:26.580> iTunes<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.439> get

you know some of the keys for doing the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
you know some of the keys for doing the
search<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.729> would<00:01:41.880> generally<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> first

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
search you would generally do the first

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.850 
search you would generally do the first
letter<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.439> each<00:01:43.649> word<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:44.720> capital<00:01:45.860> that

be4 dun dun um das um um das glue and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.039 
be4 dun dun um das um um das glue and
then<00:01:55.020> we'll<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> search<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.899> this<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
then we'll do a search and this is

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.819 
then we'll do a search and this is
searching<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.500> local<00:01:59.270> version<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:01.320> their

searching a local version of of their
database<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.290> use<00:02:04.500> this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
database in here so you can use this

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.910 
database in here so you can use this
whether<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.670> an<00:02:05.790> internet<00:02:06.090> connection
