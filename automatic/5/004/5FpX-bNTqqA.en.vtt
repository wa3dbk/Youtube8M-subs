 hello how will you see the video title today 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:12.010
 to make some doll bags and 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.410
 that in my video inside I had it 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.410
 asked so let's start 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.619
 material 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.619
 a small rectangular fabric 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.120
 ribbon with waves if you want to know how 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.250
 it does 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.700
 I leave the link at the bottom of 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.700
 this video 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 glue 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.410
 ages 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.460
 needle thread 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.530
 and two thin slats that are of 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.530
 different color and sizes 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.520
 good 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.390
 we start by taking the thin fabric 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.250
 and what we are going to do is with the thread and 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.780
 needle 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.780
 let's fold the cloth 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:29.280
 well and let's get to know this side and that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.060
 another is to say on both sides less 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.780
 on the top only on this side and 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780
 on this side 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.860
 once we have both cooked 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 sides 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.880
 on this side and the other what we 're going to 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.880
 to do is flip it 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.120
 once you have already flipped I have 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.120
 what to see this little bag 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.600
 once you have flipped it you are going to 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.600
 get this little bag 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.230
 and what he's going to do is take something 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.230
 round with the picture 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.560
 I can enter 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.260
 the sachet 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.950
 this is optional 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.220
 in this way 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.480
 now let's take 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.480
 the glue 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.490
 and we are going to throw everything around 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.640
 in this way 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.890
 and let's take the glue around 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.890
 from the bag
