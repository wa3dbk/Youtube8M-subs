00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.359 
quad cores all look and feel the same it
just<00:01:04.960> that<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.170> configuration<00:01:05.500> differs<00:01:06.130> here

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
just that the configuration differs here

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.730 
just that the configuration differs here
so<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.630> video<00:01:07.899> basically<00:01:08.229> shows<00:01:08.469> you<00:01:08.649> the

so the video basically shows you the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.260 
so the video basically shows you the
look<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.040> feel<00:01:09.219> and<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.490> kind<00:01:09.729> of<00:01:09.820> ports<00:01:10.149> it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
look and feel and the kind of ports it

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.750 
look and feel and the kind of ports it
has<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:11.260> kind<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.440> color<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:11.890> has<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.490> all

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
has and the kind of color it has and all

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.719 
has and the kind of color it has and all
that<00:01:12.909> stuff<00:01:13.150> so<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:15.130> is<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.280> way<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.520> top

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
that stuff so this is the way the top

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.310 
that stuff so this is the way the top
panel<00:01:15.940> looks<00:01:16.240> like<00:01:16.450> as<00:01:16.659> you<00:01:16.690> can<00:01:16.780> see<00:01:17.080> your

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.260 

so<00:01:56.890> these<00:01:57.010> are<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.280> tilt<00:01:57.520> angles<00:01:57.940> letting

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
so these are the tilt angles letting

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.790 
so these are the tilt angles letting
tilt<00:01:58.600> angles<00:01:58.900> are<00:01:58.990> not<00:01:59.080> all<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.320> great<00:01:59.530> as

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
tilt angles are not all that great as

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.320 
tilt angles are not all that great as
you<00:01:59.890> can<00:02:00.040> see<00:02:00.190> one<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.460> ten<00:02:00.670> degrees<00:02:00.820> at<00:02:01.210> the

you can see one and ten degrees at the
max<00:02:02.490> does<00:02:03.490> not<00:02:03.670> have<00:02:03.850> real<00:02:04.390> good<00:02:04.630> tilt<00:02:04.900> angles

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
max does not have real good tilt angles

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.490 
max does not have real good tilt angles
