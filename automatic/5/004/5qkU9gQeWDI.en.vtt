00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
this is I don't think this is what he is

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.420 
this is I don't think this is what he is
talking<00:01:55.230> about<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.650> might<00:01:55.800> go<00:01:55.920> together<00:01:56.130> right

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
talking about it might go together right

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.170

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
I know people call them cinders or

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.250 
I know people call them cinders or
whatever<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:03.060> just<00:03:03.660> called<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.080> headache

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
whatever but I just called it a headache

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.839 
whatever but I just called it a headache
and<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.910> hazard<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.920> honestly<00:03:07.920> don't<00:03:08.250> think<00:03:08.430> that

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
and a hazard I honestly don't think that

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.250 
and a hazard I honestly don't think that
they<00:03:09.150> actually<00:03:10.879> do<00:03:11.879> that<00:03:12.060> much<00:03:12.299> improving

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
they actually do that much improving

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.280 
they actually do that much improving
traction<00:03:13.530> for<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.950> car<00:03:14.390> because<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.720> would

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
traction for a car because I would

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
traction for a car because I would
imagine<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.769> car<00:03:16.799> would<00:03:17.280> have<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:19.829> same<00:03:20.010> issues

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
imagine a car would have the same issues

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.039 
imagine a car would have the same issues
of<00:03:20.430> traction<00:03:20.819> as<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> motorcycle<00:03:21.569> but<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:21.930> not

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
of traction as a motorcycle but just not

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.740 
of traction as a motorcycle but just not
as<00:03:22.170> bad

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.690 

I<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.500> if<00:03:26.620> they<00:03:26.710> made<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.010> roads<00:03:27.190> like

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
I can see if they made the roads like

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.910 
I can see if they made the roads like
physically<00:03:28.120> rough<00:03:28.390> but<00:03:29.200> if<00:03:29.530> they're<00:03:29.710> just

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
physically rough but if they're just

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.560 
physically rough but if they're just
putting<00:03:30.280> shit<00:03:30.580> on<00:03:30.700> top<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.210> I<00:03:31.330> don't<00:03:31.480> see

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
putting shit on top of it I don't see

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:54.160

coming<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.500> stop<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.580> know<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:15.000> little

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
coming to a stop it's you know a little

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.629 
coming to a stop it's you know a little
quirk<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.680> bike<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.220> brakes<00:04:17.459> are<00:04:17.609> a

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
quirk of the bike the brakes are a

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.949 
quirk of the bike the brakes are a
little<00:04:17.790> squeaky<00:04:18.090> it's<00:04:18.150> like<00:04:18.299> all<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.690> fucking

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
little squeaky it's like all the fucking

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.360 
little squeaky it's like all the fucking
time<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.290> brakes<00:04:19.470> squeak<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.280> don't

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
time that brakes squeak and I don't

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.560 
time that brakes squeak and I don't
think<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:20.700> anything<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:21.120> did<00:04:21.329> personally

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
think it's anything I did personally

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.469 
think it's anything I did personally
because<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.710> bike<00:04:22.889> only<00:04:23.100> has<00:04:23.310> like<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.850> think

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
because the bike only has like I think

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.650 
because the bike only has like I think
when<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.190> filled<00:04:26.190> up<00:04:26.310> gap<00:04:26.580> my<00:04:26.850> gas<00:04:27.060> last<00:04:27.419> time

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
when I filled up gap my gas last time

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.990 
when I filled up gap my gas last time
about<00:04:27.990> 10<00:04:28.320> miles<00:04:28.530> ago<00:04:28.680> or<00:04:28.919> 20<00:04:29.130> miles<00:04:29.250> ago<00:04:29.550> it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
about 10 miles ago or 20 miles ago it

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.430 
about 10 miles ago or 20 miles ago it
had<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:32.300> 1625<00:04:33.300> miles<00:04:33.510> this<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.320> just

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.950 

this<00:04:52.150> is<00:04:52.300> probably<00:04:52.479> what<00:04:52.659> it's<00:04:52.810> all<00:04:52.930> about

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960
