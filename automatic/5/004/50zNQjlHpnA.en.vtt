00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
installed and let's check the drive I

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.350 
installed and let's check the drive I
renamed<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.260> right<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.460> C<00:02:53.700> Drive<00:02:53.880> and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
renamed it right this is the C Drive and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.980 
renamed it right this is the C Drive and
the<00:02:55.350> two<00:02:55.590> drives<00:02:56.010> are<00:02:56.430> recognized<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.510> one

the two drives are recognized as one

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.760 
the two drives are recognized as one
single<00:02:58.380> almost<00:02:59.420> 160<00:03:00.420> gigabytes<00:03:00.990> drive<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
single almost 160 gigabytes drive and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.070 
single almost 160 gigabytes drive and
theoretically<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.820> should<00:03:02.850> be<00:03:03.180> almost<00:03:03.810> double

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
theoretically it should be almost double

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.190 
theoretically it should be almost double
as<00:03:04.320> fast<00:03:04.680> because<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.370> one<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.180> made<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.540> two

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
as fast because this one is made of two

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.920 
as fast because this one is made of two
hard<00:03:07.590> drives<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:08.340> whole<00:03:08.760> space<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.390> composed

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
hard drives the whole space is composed

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.110 
hard drives the whole space is composed
from<00:03:10.050> two<00:03:10.650> hard<00:03:11.010> drives<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.610> second<00:03:11.940> hard

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
from two hard drives the second hard

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.680 
from two hard drives the second hard
drive<00:03:12.150> it's<00:03:12.570> much<00:03:12.840> larger<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:14.090> 320<00:03:15.090> gigabytes

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
drive it's much larger is 320 gigabytes

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.070 
drive it's much larger is 320 gigabytes
but<00:03:15.960> only<00:03:16.650> 80<00:03:17.220> gigabytes<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.300> used<00:03:18.540> from<00:03:18.870> it

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
but only 80 gigabytes is used from it

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.260 
but only 80 gigabytes is used from it
because<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.740> second<00:03:20.220> hard<00:03:20.430> drive<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:20.940> 80

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
because the second hard drive is 80

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.870 
because the second hard drive is 80
gigabytes<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.560> two<00:03:22.740> spaces<00:03:23.160> must<00:03:23.670> be

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
gigabytes and the two spaces must be

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.210 
gigabytes and the two spaces must be
equal<00:03:24.360> okay<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:27.170> don't<00:03:28.170> know<00:03:28.380> what<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:29.070> is

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
equal okay so I don't know what that is

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.390 
equal okay so I don't know what that is
okay<00:03:29.670> bye
