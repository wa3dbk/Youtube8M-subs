00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
around the end of the microphone make a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
around the end of the microphone make a
loop<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> wrap<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> other<00:01:13.560> end<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.070> same

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
loop and wrap the other end of that same

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.170 
loop and wrap the other end of that same
one<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.350> then<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.860> take<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.729> other<00:01:17.759> end

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.539 
really they're really sticky and they I
mean<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.710> couldn't<00:01:28.920> even<00:01:28.979> pull<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.369> thing

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
mean you couldn't even pull this thing

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.390 
mean you couldn't even pull this thing
off<00:01:29.700> try<00:01:30.150> probably<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.619> smash<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
off try probably and then I smash it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.510 
off try probably and then I smash it
down<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> make<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.960> these<00:01:34.140> little

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
down and and make all these little

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
down and and make all these little
different<00:01:35.520> shapes<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.290> which<00:01:37.290> actually

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
different shapes in here which actually

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.289 
different shapes in here which actually
helps<00:01:38.430> isolate<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.400> any<00:01:41.400> vibrations<00:01:42.090> or

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
helps isolate the any vibrations or

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.510 
helps isolate the any vibrations or
handling<00:01:42.720> noise<00:01:42.899> from<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> boom<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.159> keeps<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
handling noise from the boom it keeps it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
handling noise from the boom it keeps it
from<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.790> into<00:01:45.439> being<00:01:46.439> transmitted<00:01:46.920> into

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
from going into being transmitted into

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.120 
from going into being transmitted into
the<00:01:47.130> microphone<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:49.500> showing<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the microphone and then showing up in

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.380 
the microphone and then showing up in
your<00:01:50.159> sound<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:51.570> final<00:01:51.960> step<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:53.790> take<00:01:53.939> the

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
since I built the crappy pole I have

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.670 
since I built the crappy pole I have
been<00:02:21.530> using<00:02:21.799> that<00:02:22.040> almost<00:02:22.400> exclusively<00:02:23.680> I'm

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
been using that almost exclusively I'm

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.380 
been using that almost exclusively I'm
actually<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.870> actually<00:02:26.870> prefer<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.530> use<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
actually I actually prefer to use it the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.369 
actually I actually prefer to use it the
shock<00:02:29.659> mount<00:02:29.930> works<00:02:30.409> as<00:02:30.860> well<00:02:31.519> if<00:02:31.790> not<00:02:31.940> better

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
shock mount works as well if not better

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
the pole this crappy pole is much

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.490 
the pole this crappy pole is much
lighter<00:02:38.030> than<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.170> aluminum<00:02:39.650> pole<00:02:39.859> and<00:02:41.500> when

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
lighter than the aluminum pole and when

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.399 
lighter than the aluminum pole and when
it's<00:02:42.650> cold<00:02:42.920> outside<00:02:43.159> it<00:02:43.879> doesn't<00:02:44.409> transmit

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
it's cold outside it doesn't transmit

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.440 
it's cold outside it doesn't transmit
that<00:02:45.650> cold<00:02:45.980> into<00:02:46.280> your<00:02:46.370> hand<00:02:46.579> I<00:02:46.790> can't<00:02:47.239> wear

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
gloves on my left hand because a lot of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.390 
gloves on my left hand because a lot of
times<00:02:49.879> I'm<00:02:50.030> riding<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:52.060> riding<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.180> levels

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
times I'm riding the riding the levels

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.250 
times I'm riding the riding the levels
so<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.909> I've<00:02:56.150> been<00:02:56.299> really<00:02:56.540> happy<00:02:56.750> with<00:02:57.079> this

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.300 
so this I've been really happy with this
build<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:59.450> thought<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.470> was<00:03:00.650> going<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:00.889> you

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.759 
build and I thought I was going to you

other<00:03:04.010> people<00:03:04.310> could<00:03:04.459> use<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:05.030> didn't<00:03:05.720> think

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
other people could use it I didn't think

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.449 
other people could use it I didn't think
that<00:03:06.109> I<00:03:06.170> would<00:03:06.290> end<00:03:06.530> up<00:03:06.620> using<00:03:06.859> it<00:03:07.099> quite<00:03:07.250> as

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
that I would end up using it quite as

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.930 
that I would end up using it quite as
much<00:03:07.670> as<00:03:07.819> I<00:03:07.909> do<00:03:07.970> since<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.540> do<00:03:08.599> have

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
much as I do since I do have

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.129 
much as I do since I do have
professional<00:03:10.940> equipment

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
professional equipment

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.199 
professional equipment
the<00:03:12.739> reason<00:03:13.099> this<00:03:13.280> pole<00:03:13.579> cost<00:03:13.909> me<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> little

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
the reason this pole cost me a little

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.520 
the reason this pole cost me a little
bit<00:03:14.389> more<00:03:14.599> is<00:03:14.720> because<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.109> put<00:03:15.290> foam

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
bit more is because I put foam

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.740 
bit more is because I put foam
insulation<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:16.459> then<00:03:16.639> I<00:03:16.670> wrap<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.239> in<00:03:17.449> cloth

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
insulation and then I wrap that in cloth

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.069 
insulation and then I wrap that in cloth
sports<00:03:18.410> tape<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:20.000> all<00:03:20.299> in<00:03:20.449> total<00:03:20.840> this

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
sports tape so all in total this

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.879 
sports tape so all in total this
