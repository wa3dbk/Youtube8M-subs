00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.310 
like shaky footage with my phone not the
best<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:05.090> probably<00:03:05.690> just<00:03:05.810> throw<00:03:05.989> some<00:03:06.200> of

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
best so I probably just throw some of

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.090 
best so I probably just throw some of
that<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.560> this<00:03:06.680> video

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
that in this video

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.390 
that in this video
there-there's<00:03:08.019> doing<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.200> because<00:03:10.160> it

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
there-there's doing that because it

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.680 
there-there's doing that because it
wasn't<00:03:10.700> enough<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.030> make<00:03:11.060> like<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.329> proper

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
wasn't enough to make like a proper

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.120 
wasn't enough to make like a proper
video<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.230> wanted<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:12.739> I'll<00:03:12.829> try<00:03:13.010> and

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
video like I wanted to but I'll try and

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.770 
video like I wanted to but I'll try and
document<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.700> better<00:03:13.820> next<00:03:14.030> time<00:03:14.269> maybe<00:03:14.630> I'll

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
document it better next time maybe I'll

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.360 
document it better next time maybe I'll
go<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:14.989> another<00:03:15.170> event<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:15.680> year<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.190> not

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
go to another event this year but if not

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.780 
go to another event this year but if not
manifest<00:03:17.079> 2013<00:03:18.079> on<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.130> I've<00:03:19.220> been<00:03:19.340> doing<00:03:19.489> some

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
manifest 2013 on so I've been doing some

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.600 
manifest 2013 on so I've been doing some
stuff<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.570> doing<00:03:20.810> some<00:03:21.079> things<00:03:21.320> just<00:03:21.829> not<00:03:22.489> as

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
stuff and doing some things just not as

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.580 
stuff and doing some things just not as
much<00:03:22.790> as<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:22.970> want<00:03:23.209> honestly<00:03:24.110> guys<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.500> I'll

much as I want honestly guys and I'll
probably<00:03:24.739> regret<00:03:25.100> saying<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.579> but<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:26.030> wanted

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
probably regret saying this but I wanted

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.020 
probably regret saying this but I wanted
to<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.290> want<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.709> do<00:03:27.799> at<00:03:28.130> least<00:03:28.250> one<00:03:28.549> thing<00:03:28.579> a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
myself in the foot probably by saying

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.970 
myself in the foot probably by saying
