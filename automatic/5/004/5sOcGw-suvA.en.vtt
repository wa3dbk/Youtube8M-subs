00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
talk to you guys about this idea I have

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.909

for<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.879> playlist<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.480> halo<00:00:06.690> 5<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.649> like<00:00:07.799> to

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
for a playlist in halo 5 and I like to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.280 
for a playlist in halo 5 and I like to
call<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.280> thousand<00:00:09.269> map<00:00:09.599> playlist

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
call it the thousand map playlist

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.129 
call it the thousand map playlist
because<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.920> would<00:00:11.040> literally<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.269> playlist

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
because it would literally be a playlist

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.269 
because it would literally be a playlist
with<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.940> thousand<00:00:14.940> maps<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.130> idea

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
with a thousand maps in it and this idea

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.300 
with a thousand maps in it and this idea

there<00:01:34.619> could<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.799> something<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.310> similar

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
there could be something really similar

there could be something really similar
in<00:01:36.240> Halo<00:01:36.869> 5<00:01:37.140> where<00:01:37.680> there<00:01:37.829> would<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
in Halo 5 where there would be a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.149 
in Halo 5 where there would be a
playlist<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.689> thousand<00:01:40.500> maps<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
playlist with a thousand maps so you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.710 
playlist with a thousand maps so you
have<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> end<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.790> doing<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:42.420> similar

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

and<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.320> no<00:01:49.799> idea<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.700> going

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and you also have no idea what is going

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.990 
and you also have no idea what is going
to<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.180> thrown<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.890> now<00:01:52.890> obviously<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
to get thrown at you now obviously the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 
to get thrown at you now obviously the
concern<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.079> quality<00:01:55.799> control<00:01:56.189> how

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
concern with this is quality control how

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
concern with this is quality control how
do<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.579> make<00:01:56.790> sure<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:57.390> maps<00:01:57.750> are

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
do you make sure that these maps are

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
do you make sure that these maps are
actually<00:01:58.439> good<00:01:58.799> well<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.729> don't<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.149> they

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
actually good well I don't think they

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.080 
actually good well I don't think they
actually<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.829> amazing<00:02:02.490> they<00:02:02.909> don't

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
actually have to be amazing they don't

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.999 
actually have to be amazing they don't
even<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> b-level

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
even really have to be like a b-level

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.270 
even really have to be like a b-level
maps<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.820> could<00:02:05.969> be<00:02:06.090> even<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.540> see

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
maps they could be even like see

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.300 
maps they could be even like see
or<00:02:07.400> D<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:08.240> lot<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.020> times<00:02:09.259> because<00:02:09.619> you're

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
or D a lot of the times because you're

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.170 
or D a lot of the times because you're
only<00:02:10.640> going<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.420> see<00:02:11.720> them<00:02:12.020> once<00:02:12.819> so<00:02:13.819> if<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
only going to see them once so if the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.140 
only going to see them once so if the
map<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.600> kind<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.410> stinker<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.459> not<00:02:16.760> really

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
map is kind of a stinker it's not really

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.910 
map is kind of a stinker it's not really
going<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.420> matter<00:02:17.690> because<00:02:18.350> chances<00:02:18.650> are

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
going to matter because chances are

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.830 
going to matter because chances are
you're<00:02:19.160> never<00:02:19.459> even<00:02:19.730> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.150> play<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.390> map

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
you're never even going to play that map

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.350 
you're never even going to play that map
again<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.470> your<00:02:21.500> entire<00:02:21.980> life<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.670> then<00:02:23.150> also

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
again in your entire life and then also

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.890 
again in your entire life and then also
to<00:02:23.620> help<00:02:24.620> with<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.310> quality<00:02:25.730> control<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.420> think

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
to help with the quality control I think

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.720 
to help with the quality control I think
there<00:02:27.020> would<00:02:27.110> have<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.290> be<00:02:27.440> game<00:02:27.830> types<00:02:28.190> that

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
there would have to be game types that

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.760 
there would have to be game types that
are<00:02:28.760> kind<00:02:29.300> of<00:02:29.390> cut<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.810> half<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.410> terms<00:02:30.650> of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
are kind of cut in half in terms of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.040 
are kind of cut in half in terms of
length<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.910> know<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> team<00:02:32.390> slayer<00:02:32.750> match

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
length so you know a team slayer match

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.670 
length so you know a team slayer match
that<00:02:33.410> only<00:02:33.680> lasts<00:02:34.370> 225<00:02:34.790> kills<00:02:35.569> or<00:02:36.260> maybe<00:02:36.560> a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
that only lasts 225 kills or maybe a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.920 
that only lasts 225 kills or maybe a
oddball<00:02:37.100> game<00:02:37.580> type<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:38.030> lasts<00:02:38.360> 2<00:02:38.510> 100

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
oddball game type that lasts 2 100

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.170 
oddball game type that lasts 2 100
seconds<00:02:39.320> instead<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.769> 250<00:02:40.310> or<00:02:40.459> something<00:02:41.090> like

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
seconds instead of 250 or something like

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.720 
seconds instead of 250 or something like
that<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:42.200> way<00:02:42.410> if<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.950> do<00:02:43.160> get<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.459> map<00:02:43.700> that

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
that that way if you do get a map that

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.479 
that that way if you do get a map that
is<00:02:44.000> again<00:02:44.360> kind<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.410> stinker<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:46.010> kind<00:02:46.370> of

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
is again kind of a stinker it's kind of

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.210 
is again kind of a stinker it's kind of
apparently<00:02:47.209> broken<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.470> surface<00:02:48.950> it's

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
apparently broken on the surface it's

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.310 
apparently broken on the surface it's
not<00:02:49.790> really<00:02:50.090> going<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.360> matter<00:02:50.510> because<00:02:51.170> you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
not really going to matter because you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.630 
not really going to matter because you
can<00:02:51.440> say<00:02:51.560> okay<00:02:51.950> well<00:02:52.069> it's<00:02:52.250> going<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.430> be<00:02:52.519> three

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
can say okay well it's going to be three

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.680 
can say okay well it's going to be three
minutes<00:02:52.940> we're<00:02:53.030> gonna<00:02:53.090> play<00:02:53.330> another<00:02:53.480> map

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
minutes we're gonna play another map

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.030 
minutes we're gonna play another map
we're<00:02:54.050> gonna<00:02:54.140> see<00:02:54.350> something<00:02:54.560> else<00:02:54.800> it's

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
we're gonna see something else it's

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.910 
we're gonna see something else it's
gonna<00:02:55.160> be<00:02:55.340> awesome<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.880> then<00:02:56.660> ideally<00:02:57.319> there

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
gonna be awesome and then ideally there

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.309 
gonna be awesome and then ideally there
would<00:02:58.069> be<00:02:58.100> some<00:02:58.430> sort<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.819> like<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.600> dislike

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
would be some sort of like and dislike

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.309 
would be some sort of like and dislike
button<00:03:01.130> at<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.489> end<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.120> match<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.080> way

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
button at the end of a match so that way

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.910 
button at the end of a match so that way
the<00:03:04.040> really<00:03:04.730> disliked<00:03:05.480> maps<00:03:05.900> would<00:03:06.440> float

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
the really disliked maps would float

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.170 
the really disliked maps would float
down<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> bottom<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.850> then<00:03:08.000> they<00:03:08.120> could

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
down to the bottom and then they could

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.210 
down to the bottom and then they could
get<00:03:08.420> phased<00:03:08.690> out<00:03:08.930> with<00:03:09.319> new<00:03:09.560> maps<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.040> then

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
get phased out with new maps and then

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.880 
get phased out with new maps and then
eventually<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:11.299> entire<00:03:11.600> playlist<00:03:12.290> would<00:03:12.739> be

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
eventually the entire playlist would be

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.270 
eventually the entire playlist would be
filled<00:03:13.160> with<00:03:13.280> at<00:03:13.640> least<00:03:14.120> all<00:03:14.480> right<00:03:15.170> maps<00:03:15.860> to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
filled with at least all right maps to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.420 
filled with at least all right maps to
play<00:03:16.540> but<00:03:17.540> anyways<00:03:17.959> there<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:18.980> have<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.190> that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
play but anyways there you have it that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.240 
play but anyways there you have it that
is<00:03:19.459> my<00:03:19.940> idea<00:03:20.360> for<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:21.350> playlist<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.950> think<00:03:22.160> it

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
is my idea for this playlist I think it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.759 
is my idea for this playlist I think it
would<00:03:22.370> be<00:03:22.549> really<00:03:23.299> neat<00:03:23.690> really<00:03:24.200> interesting

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
would be really neat really interesting

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.650 
would be really neat really interesting
really<00:03:25.100> fun<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.850> also<00:03:25.970> think<00:03:26.269> would<00:03:26.480> be<00:03:26.630> a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
really fun and I also think would be a

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.600 
really fun and I also think would be a
really<00:03:27.049> good<00:03:27.320> way<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.560> get<00:03:28.100> some<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.430> those

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
really good way to get some of those

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.120 
really good way to get some of those
community<00:03:29.299> maps<00:03:29.630> out<00:03:29.900> there<00:03:30.140> because<00:03:30.320> we<00:03:30.890> do

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
community maps out there because we do

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.250 
community maps out there because we do
see<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.940> playlists<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.750> are<00:03:32.870> like<00:03:33.110> the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
see the playlists that are like the

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.630 
see the playlists that are like the
community<00:03:33.470> playlist<00:03:34.160> or<00:03:34.370> eventually

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
community playlist or eventually

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.479 
community playlist or eventually
community<00:03:35.329> maps<00:03:35.570> get<00:03:35.840> get<00:03:36.320> put<00:03:36.590> into<00:03:36.829> certain

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
community maps get get put into certain

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.550 
community maps get get put into certain
playlists<00:03:37.910> but<00:03:38.600> obviously<00:03:39.049> those<00:03:39.290> are<00:03:39.320> only

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
playlists but obviously those are only

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.699 
playlists but obviously those are only
the<00:03:39.739> best<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.640> best<00:03:41.090> community<00:03:42.019> maps<00:03:42.350> and

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
the best of the best community maps and

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.500 
the best of the best community maps and
it's<00:03:43.070> really<00:03:43.370> hard<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.850> get<00:03:43.940> featured<00:03:44.180> in

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
it's really hard to get featured in

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.750 
it's really hard to get featured in
there<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.840> also<00:03:45.320> there's<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.950> lot<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.250> testing

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
there and also there's a lot of testing

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.490 
there and also there's a lot of testing
that<00:03:46.910> has<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.239> go<00:03:47.359> behind<00:03:47.540> them<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.109> a<00:03:48.320> lot<00:03:48.470> of

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
that has to go behind them and a lot of

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.380 
that has to go behind them and a lot of
work<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:49.370> all<00:03:49.549> of<00:03:49.700> this<00:03:49.820> stuff<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.150> it's

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
work and and all of this stuff so it's

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.690 
work and and all of this stuff so it's
difficult<00:03:50.959> if<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.739> want<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.070> make<00:03:52.190> maps<00:03:52.370> to

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
difficult if you want to make maps to

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.940 
difficult if you want to make maps to
get<00:03:53.030> something<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:53.870> featured<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.620> the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
get something that is featured in the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.949 
get something that is featured in the
playlist<00:03:55.190> but<00:03:55.579> with<00:03:55.700> this<00:03:55.910> because<00:03:56.630> the

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
playlist but with this because the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.810 
playlist but with this because the
quality<00:03:57.170> control<00:03:57.709> doesn't<00:03:58.070> necessarily<00:03:58.640> have

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
quality control doesn't necessarily have

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.990 
quality control doesn't necessarily have
to<00:03:58.880> be<00:03:59.000> there<00:03:59.480> to<00:04:00.230> as<00:04:00.530> much<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.220> degree<00:04:01.579> as<00:04:01.790> it

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
to be there to as much of a degree as it

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.759 
to be there to as much of a degree as it
would<00:04:02.180> if<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.390> was<00:04:02.510> in<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.750> main<00:04:03.170> playlist<00:04:03.709> that

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
would if it was in a main playlist that

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.910 
would if it was in a main playlist that
only<00:04:04.010> has<00:04:04.190> about<00:04:04.430> 12<00:04:05.090> maps<00:04:05.420> or<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:05.810> or<00:04:06.019> even

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
only has about 12 maps or so or even

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.099 
only has about 12 maps or so or even
less<00:04:07.130> than<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.519> lot<00:04:07.700> of<00:04:07.820> times<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.299> think<00:04:08.810> it

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
less than that a lot of times I think it

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.979 
less than that a lot of times I think it
would<00:04:09.230> be<00:04:09.350> a<00:04:09.380> cool<00:04:09.769> way<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.070> allow<00:04:11.030> people<00:04:11.060> to

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
would be a cool way to allow people to

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.399 
would be a cool way to allow people to
get<00:04:12.380> their<00:04:12.560> stuff<00:04:12.890> out<00:04:13.100> there<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.640> lot<00:04:13.880> easier

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
get their stuff out there a lot easier

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.949 
get their stuff out there a lot easier
but<00:04:15.409> anyways<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.459> my<00:04:16.820> idea<00:04:17.239> for<00:04:17.330> the
