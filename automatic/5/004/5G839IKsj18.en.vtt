00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.010 

so<00:00:56.580> yeah<00:00:56.880> I<00:00:57.150> think<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.420> took<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.630> bit<00:00:57.810> of<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
so yeah I think I took a bit of that

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.000 
so yeah I think I took a bit of that
well<00:00:58.200> it's<00:00:58.320> open

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.850 

okay<00:01:02.010> first<00:01:02.700> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> complications<00:01:03.860> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
okay first of the complications the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.010 
okay first of the complications the
chain<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.339> heart<00:01:05.550> ordered<00:01:05.910> four<00:01:06.120> plus<00:01:06.420> six

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
chain that I heart ordered four plus six

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.760 
chain that I heart ordered four plus six
if<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:08.280> link<00:01:08.700> too<00:01:09.120> short<00:01:09.770> which

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
if one link too short which

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.990 
if one link too short which
sucks<00:01:11.130> dick<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> they're<00:01:11.670> gonna<00:01:11.790> order

sucks dick and they're gonna order
another<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.160> gonna<00:01:14.280> run<00:01:14.520> two

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
another one so I'm not gonna run two

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.900 
another one so I'm not gonna run two
master<00:01:15.810> links<00:01:16.410> at<00:01:17.300> all<00:01:18.300> so<00:01:18.660> I<00:01:19.910> was

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
master links at all so I was

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.250 
master links at all so I was
having<00:01:21.150> clutch<00:01:21.390> problems

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
having clutch problems

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.300 
having clutch problems
I<00:01:22.290> guess<00:01:23.690> there's<00:01:24.690> like<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.290> washer<00:01:25.800> type<00:01:26.040> deal

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I guess there's like a washer type deal

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.600 
I guess there's like a washer type deal
in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.240> center<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.350> pressure<00:01:28.770> plate<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
in the center of the pressure plate and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
in the center of the pressure plate and
I<00:01:30.540> guess<00:01:31.170> since<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.440> didn't<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.649> enough<00:01:31.920> oil

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I guess since I didn't have enough oil

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.380 
I guess since I didn't have enough oil
in<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.580> had<00:01:32.700> been<00:01:32.850> trying<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.270> so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
in there and they had been trying for so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.170 
in there and they had been trying for so
long<00:01:33.800> it<00:01:34.800> was<00:01:34.860> spinning<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.000> turning

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
long it was spinning when I was turning

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.180 
long it was spinning when I was turning
this<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.200> couldn't<00:01:37.470> ever<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.130> thing

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
this so I couldn't ever get that thing

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.670 
this so I couldn't ever get that thing
adjusted<00:01:38.850> right<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.660> I<00:01:39.750> had<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> adjusted<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
adjusted right and I had it adjusted the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.800 
adjusted right and I had it adjusted the
next<00:01:40.890> thing<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.160> it<00:01:41.880> lost<00:01:42.119> pressure<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
next thing I know it lost pressure and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.880 
next thing I know it lost pressure and
she'll<00:01:42.990> slurping<00:01:43.320> me<00:01:43.410> out<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.830> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
she'll slurping me out because it's a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
she'll slurping me out because it's a
clutch<00:01:44.160> cable<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.050> not

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
clutch cable you know it's not

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.330 
clutch cable you know it's not
pressurized<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.680> boys<00:01:49.890> he<00:01:50.040> can't<00:01:50.250> help

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
pressurized so so my boys he can't help

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.120 
pressurized so so my boys he can't help
me<00:01:50.430> figure<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.940> one<00:01:51.090> out<00:01:52.130> other

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
me figure that one out other

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.639 
me figure that one out other
complication<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:54.330> had<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.140> shoot

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
complication was I had to actually shoot

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.230 
complication was I had to actually shoot
that<00:01:56.160> off<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:59.310> was<00:01:59.429> stupid<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.970> when<00:02:00.209> I

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that off it was stupid and when I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.940 
that off it was stupid and when I
did<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.569> I<00:02:00.630> had<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.840> barber<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.920> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
did that I had a barber in there so that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
did that I had a barber in there so that
