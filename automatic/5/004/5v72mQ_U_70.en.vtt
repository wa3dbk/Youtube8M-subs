hybrid<00:00:00.829> it<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.010> hydrogen

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
hybrid it is a hydrogen

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.070 
hybrid it is a hydrogen
it's<00:00:04.770> running<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.279> hydrogen<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:06.629> makes<00:00:06.870> its

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
it's running on hydrogen that makes its

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.520 
it's running on hydrogen that makes its
own<00:00:07.290> electricity

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.580 

fully<00:00:12.130> electric<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:14.620> have<00:00:14.769> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
fully electric you have a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.940 
fully electric you have a
battery<00:00:17.370> but<00:00:17.840> most<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> energy<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.740> coming

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
battery but most of the energy is coming

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.840 
battery but most of the energy is coming
from<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> energy

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.970 

okay<00:00:26.600> um<00:00:26.810> if<00:00:27.530> you<00:00:27.710> see<00:00:27.920> here<00:00:28.160> this<00:00:29.150> is<00:00:29.420> a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
okay um if you see here this is a

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.530 
okay um if you see here this is a
kilowatt<00:00:31.720> energy<00:00:32.720> but<00:00:33.080> we<00:00:33.260> are<00:00:33.590> producing

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.320 

and<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:38.130> there's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> minus<00:00:39.590> area<00:00:41.330> when

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
and and there there's a minus area when

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.320 
and and there there's a minus area when
we<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.810> we<00:00:42.990> break<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.590> car<00:00:43.830> we<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:45.090> get

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
we and we break the car we can get

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.480 
we and we break the car we can get
energy<00:00:46.260> back

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.660 

is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.170 

and<00:00:56.590> you're<00:00:57.590> looking<00:00:58.310> for<00:00:58.550> something<00:00:58.820> about

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
and you're looking for something about

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:08.750 
and you're looking for something about
the<00:00:59.450> UI<00:00:59.740> yeah<00:01:00.740> yeah<00:01:01.010> okay

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

yeah<00:01:09.390> yeah<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.440> have<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> stop

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
yeah yeah you have to stop

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.150 
yeah yeah you have to stop
yeah<00:01:13.520> this<00:01:13.940> Henry<00:01:14.510> that<00:01:14.870> coming<00:01:15.590> for<00:01:15.800> driving

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
yeah this Henry that coming for driving

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:33.420 
yeah this Henry that coming for driving
oh<00:01:16.340> yeah<00:01:16.810> wait<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.870> minute<00:01:18.020> now<00:01:20.470> okay<00:01:21.470> here's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.110 

okay<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:35.440> hydrogen<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:36.190> coming<00:01:36.640> from<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
okay the hydrogen is coming from the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.570 
okay the hydrogen is coming from the
tanks

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
tanks

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.370 
tanks
go<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.800> stack<00:01:40.800> Easter<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.380> electricity

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
go to the stack Easter and electricity

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.090 
go to the stack Easter and electricity
is<00:01:43.650> going<00:01:44.160> to<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> battery

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.300 

when<00:01:49.700> we<00:01:49.880> drive<00:01:50.560> electricity<00:01:51.560> go<00:01:51.830> from<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
when we drive electricity go from the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.380 
when we drive electricity go from the
stack<00:01:52.580> there's<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.450> moto<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.610> we<00:01:55.610> can<00:01:55.759> also<00:01:56.000> use

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
stack there's a moto and we can also use

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.560 
stack there's a moto and we can also use
some<00:01:56.810> from<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.290> battery

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:12.200 

that<00:02:03.570> was<00:02:03.840> coming<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.009> all<00:02:05.250> okay

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.990 

Norma<00:02:13.310> get<00:02:14.310> shift<00:02:15.050> drive

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
Norma get shift drive

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
Norma get shift drive
only<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:18.930> year

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020
