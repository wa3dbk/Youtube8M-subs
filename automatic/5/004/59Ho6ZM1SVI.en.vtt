00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.140
 he demands a very popular telephone from his sisters and many people want it 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.730
 of course protect your phone well and rightly so naturally and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.790
 in this video 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.430
 go chicken satay covers, I naturally have some simple rouches 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.280
 and your case advice discussed, you may be interested in, he seeks that through 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.210
 definitely back 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.240
 on our channel 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.900
 adb in this video I'm going to talk about the covers namely the pussies with 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.310
 some extra functions from it may be that they are a bit more robust it may be that 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.010
 are this agrees have example 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.930
 everything and in this video it's all about telling 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.510
 yes to show that's racing by the sea here seems like this and the a6 iraq 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 do you vote ds 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.550
 is the cheapest of the delay 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.730
 namely around 14 euros it is of course not so bad 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.120
 and the amateur club that would touch is that I give voice 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.780
 and look that I would unfold it is not very easy 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.010
 but with that you can drop a movie to watch and that is of course different 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 easier what is far fine is that it is quite a sturdy 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.460
 It consists of two parts and silicone shared hard plastic part trains it 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.060
 get the best part carlos from silicone parts 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.950
 and ended up because of that I could quite well cope with some blows that is that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.180
 it not so super well connected 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.680
 yes you may already see a bit here that it is a bit loose and 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.330
 then you have to put a little pressure on it sometimes gets a bit stuck 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.810
 but it is not quite great 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.600
 he came to finish yes there is something to criticize further I do not find myself 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.179
 very beautiful but that is of course personal and that is possible 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.229
 yes if you vote a cheap danish 8 a cheap kees heemskerk then it is 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.860
 this maybe interesting 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.660
 the dough is this piss meet afc not even with aversion that keep costs for 25 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.220
 euros 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.750
 two sons touches it looks like the some protection in the side 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.890
 but it is protection when it is otherwise not very special cell 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.549
 but it's just another plastic club 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.869
 a bit thicker and also a bit firmer 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.380
 it is also noticeable that on the inside we have a few blocks of mountain edge through the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.090
 bursts of space comes showering and the telephone 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.740
 and that again means that if your phone rings it will be pretty nice 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 is protected 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.899
 what struck me 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.569
 is that the skirt day doesn't have a lot of tactility so you don't feel it 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.430
 very good that you have to press the button 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.240
 and I can just do everything from the device to the mediene 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.770
 mh yes, according to him, that sturdy case because he is a bit sturdier not strict 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.489
 sturdy but for some sturdy case 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.489
 You see the best sets of truth and for that matter it is World Cup 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.909
 According to a while cities at the box circuit and the otterbox are Gloucester 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.680
 solid rouches are so popular and you notice that with this symmetry 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.560
 It is made up of NSS hard plastic on the outside 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.049
 and well it is just a very solid combination if your device does the in one 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.160
 do you notice that that to what 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.729
 has thicker teeth 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:47.419
 put out your bed and that is possible with the use of the device yes 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.520
 a bit awkward 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.290
 on the other hand it just means what i am very well protected too 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.310
 agree what they dropped or something 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.440
 yes that won't touch screens quickly and then if your phone is just very sorry 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.819
 well protected all this notebook circuit is available in a number of colors 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.450
 and why this better but also 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.219
 for example all kinds of variants with nice accommodations 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.010
 and after a shower costs around 35 euros and is therefore not super cheap 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.159
 but a very good protection if you just have it economical on your phone 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.729
 with 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.839
 the violence best case arm I think at least this is before you get the 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.460
 production at the hairdresser 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.290
 The one that specializes is that I put you in the cards in Kabul 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.830
 where the plants bank card go the credit card segment that gets worse 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.780
 Keirin do up to three passengers that he can easily take out 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.130
 and what I find funny is that she immediately has some extra snow 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.179
 namely that you think I can make a voice out of it 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.459
 as your pass most read set 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.179
 it's a drop then you have tent tips and if you put a device in 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.179
 that it is AMC and naturally tasty you can check out or something like that 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.919
 and that remains so good despite that he is just on a pass 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.149
 and I think it's a nice addition 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.379
 that also says it can be disadvantageous 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.670
 that the backside yes that will dennis 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.319
 behind the passes it withdraws a little bit and has a little play 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.070
 that is all a little less neatly arranged 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.579
 it is the sprint on the first stone out of amen 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.899
 if your shoulders make you easy to take out 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:11.679
 and the job because there is room for a card is also just such a thick file 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.439
 and with that is made of plastic 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.189
 and silicone and therefore it protects well 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.350
 also because it is so close of course 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.620
 but yes it is just when the law but I can therefore easily 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.590
 take your passes 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.300
 and you can also make the extend of it so I kind of like it well this costs 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.880
 $ 40 room start available on police website so not necessarily in 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.110
 the netherlands yes so they have to put in a little more effort 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.039
 but I just think that is funny geese 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.520
 it is available in this turquoise but also in black leaf 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.409
 and a number of other colors so in that respect it is well arranged 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.779
 last but not least have this plan I will give you a hot tip 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.759
 and that is because he agrees with this and is more attentive 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.159
 anp and to wear that 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.509
 the job with the devices 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.520
 click the back on it 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.719
 the collateral 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.519
 and then your derk is remarkably firm in it actually seems a bit like one 

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.410
 difference systems that is not too bad 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.940
 and if you talk to me on the phone it could be that the undersides are coming 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.559
 as one that isn't that bad 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:13.129
 and beyond is reasonable to touch the cities he is just a yes in itself 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.750
 just fine looking plastic from the black plastic but with a soft finish 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.550
 it is black in blue but also in the town hall and some other clothes 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.030
 yet 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.410
 and it's a kek tune well what strikes me is that it is just per bottle 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.570
 he is stuck together with a feather 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.750
 yes and you may know the side branch is held here with the magnetic strip 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.979
 and if you had it outside on August 14th 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.050
 but 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.260
 orange can stand down so that is fine and watch a movie 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.080
 he is not super we definitely want to get hit 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.189
 then that just could fall that blow because those kids and of course him 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:47.050
 sit on the side 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.090
 so that is a disadvantage but also find it 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.880
 it will be a couchette amcor $ 35 also reports the website of production so 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.480
 not necessarily available in the Netherlands 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.750
 so you also find something like that more effort should do bleacher fun 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.400
 ouchène 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.050
 on and yes he protects to less than the other covers not discussed 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.880
 perhaps 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.180
 just at that kids tent is just as handy and I think 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.560
 because he just spends reasonable it is still nice just 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.009
 yes to use 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.629
 those were the five covers that I wanted to talk to with his five musicians 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.360
 referendum, there are of course tens of hundreds 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.669
 maybe thousands of covers for the own of six available 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.270
 well on this 3 the potter's counterweight and the a6 ii 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.780
 they get on a mobile reachable point nl but I also think a lot about the 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.619
 get rouches 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:35.339
 and it has politically intervened on the website of corruption with the links 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.439
 in the description of this video if you want to buy ahum further i have i 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.149
 has tested a lot of girls for the ipad and that is my experience 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:43.270
 actually that 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.560
 if you come after a poor 10 euros then they are usually just going to earth 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.389
 at least good enough to protect your device a bit and so 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.830
 yes the school also didn't play just another citco 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.340
 after all, boxing is a very good one 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.610
 abyei further there are just super many covers and poor 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.949
 so you can usually handle it well 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:07.330
 certainly not for you but limited to this 5 but yes maybe there is a nice one 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.809
 testing so be sure to check that out 

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:12.829
 if you have any questions there you can of course in the description of this video 

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:15.349
 rightly thank you both for watching and see you next time
