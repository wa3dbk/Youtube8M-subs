foot<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.670> mobilization<00:00:41.330> costs<00:00:41.660> are<00:00:41.720> going<00:00:41.930> to

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
foot the mobilization costs are going to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.069 
foot the mobilization costs are going to
be<00:00:42.140> ten<00:00:42.560> thousand<00:00:42.950> dollars<00:00:43.899> based<00:00:44.899> on<00:00:44.989> the

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
be ten thousand dollars based on the

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.690 
be ten thousand dollars based on the
combined<00:00:45.410> overhead<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.010> profit<00:00:46.190> margin<00:00:46.610> of

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
combined overhead and profit margin of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.250 
combined overhead and profit margin of
twenty<00:00:46.910> five<00:00:47.030> percent<00:00:47.180> was<00:00:47.630> the<00:00:47.809> final<00:00:48.079> bit

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
twenty five percent was the final bit

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.729 
twenty five percent was the final bit
amount<00:00:49.329> okay<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:50.390> we<00:00:50.960> just<00:00:50.989> have<00:00:51.380> a

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
amount okay so we just have a

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.979 
amount okay so we just have a
combination<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.760> couple<00:00:52.910> things<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.570> first

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
combination of a couple things the first

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.819 
combination of a couple things the first
thing<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.469> an<00:00:54.649> estimation<00:00:55.960> tallying<00:00:56.960> up<00:00:57.170> our

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
thing is an estimation tallying up our

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.740 
thing is an estimation tallying up our
linear<00:00:58.130> feets<00:00:58.489> with<00:00:59.239> somebody's<00:00:59.660> already

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
linear feets with somebody's already

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.180 
linear feets with somebody's already
done<00:00:59.960> that<00:01:00.110> work<00:01:00.290> for<00:01:00.559> us<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:00.890> there's<00:01:01.040> not<00:01:01.160> a

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
done that work for us so there's not a

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.590 
done that work for us so there's not a
quantity<00:01:01.610> take<00:01:01.790> off<00:01:01.940> that<00:01:02.090> needs<00:01:02.270> to<00:01:02.329> be<00:01:02.420> done

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
quantity take off that needs to be done

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.900 
quantity take off that needs to be done
and<00:01:02.930> then<00:01:03.469> we<00:01:03.500> just<00:01:03.710> multiply<00:01:03.860> by<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.489> unit

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
and then we just multiply by the unit

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.080 
and then we just multiply by the unit
cost<00:01:05.420> by<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.259> actual<00:01:06.740> unit<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.310> nothing<00:01:07.789> real

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
cost by the actual unit so nothing real

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.440 
cost by the actual unit so nothing real
difficult<00:01:08.630> here<00:01:08.960> we<00:01:09.320> have<00:01:09.470> eight<00:01:09.649> inch<00:01:09.800> pipe

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
difficult here we have eight inch pipe

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.969 
difficult here we have eight inch pipe
tenant<00:01:11.450> seeing<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.080> 8<00:01:12.200> inch<00:01:12.320> pipe<00:01:12.500> 6<00:01:12.770> inch

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
tenant seeing the 8 inch pipe 6 inch

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:13.990 
tenant seeing the 8 inch pipe 6 inch
pipe<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.369> then<00:01:13.460> we<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.670> mobilization

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
pipe and then we have a mobilization

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.120 
pipe and then we have a mobilization
cost<00:01:14.510> of<00:01:14.720> we'll<00:01:14.840> add<00:01:14.960> in<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.409> then<00:01:15.740> we<00:01:15.830> have<00:01:15.979> to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
cost of we'll add in and then we have to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.730 
cost of we'll add in and then we have to
figure<00:01:16.490> out<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.880> incorporate<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.260> profit

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
figure out that incorporate the profit

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.770 
figure out that incorporate the profit
and<00:01:18.890> overhead<00:01:19.580> margin<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:20.420> they've<00:01:20.540> given

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
and overhead margin that they've given

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.930 
and overhead margin that they've given
us<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:20.960> 25%<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.310> first<00:01:22.490> thing<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:22.729> want<00:01:22.909> to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
us a 25% so the first thing we want to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.929 
us a 25% so the first thing we want to
do<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.240> just<00:01:23.390> get<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.570> pipe<00:01:24.010> values<00:01:25.010> so<00:01:25.820> we

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
do is just get the pipe values so we

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.100 
do is just get the pipe values so we
have<00:01:26.619> we<00:01:27.619> have<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.830> 8<00:01:27.950> inch<00:01:27.979> pipe

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.690 

which<00:01:32.410> was<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.970> had<00:01:34.680> 5050<00:01:35.680> 300<00:01:36.220> linear<00:01:36.460> foot<00:01:36.670> of

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
which was we had 5050 300 linear foot of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.030 
which was we had 5050 300 linear foot of
that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.000 

and<00:01:41.910> at<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.540> was<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.720> door<00:01:43.110> by<00:01:43.260> two<00:01:43.620> multiplied

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
and at that was a door by two multiplied

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.810 
and at that was a door by two multiplied
times<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.930> $9<00:01:45.930> linear<00:01:46.290> foot<00:01:49.550> so<00:01:50.550> we<00:01:50.640> multiply

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
times the $9 linear foot so we multiply

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:00.050 
times the $9 linear foot so we multiply
that<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.330> 47<00:01:54.930> 700<00:01:55.650> for<00:01:55.800> that<00:01:59.060> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that out and I get 47 700 for that that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.000 
that out and I get 47 700 for that that
would<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.270> dollars<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.780> course<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.890> have

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
would be dollars of course then we have

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.040 
would be dollars of course then we have
6<00:02:02.250> inch<00:02:02.430> diameter<00:02:02.790> pipe<00:02:03.260> and<00:02:05.150> that<00:02:06.150> was<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:07.650> had

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
6 inch diameter pipe and that was we had

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.790 
6 inch diameter pipe and that was we had
6100<00:02:10.050> linear<00:02:10.290> foot<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:13.590> was<00:02:13.680> at

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
6100 linear foot of that and that was at

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.490 
6100 linear foot of that and that was at
7,000<00:02:14.400> x<00:02:15.300> or<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:16.050> $7<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.070> 50<00:02:17.250> cent<00:02:18.230> per<00:02:19.230> linear

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
7,000 x or at $7 and 50 cent per linear

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.980 
7,000 x or at $7 and 50 cent per linear
foot<00:02:20.120> multiply<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.300> out<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:21.900> get<00:02:22.080> 45<00:02:22.830> 750

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.620 

so<00:02:27.170> nothing<00:02:27.530> real<00:02:28.070> real<00:02:28.610> challenging<00:02:29.150> yet<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
so nothing real real challenging yet and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.330 
so nothing real real challenging yet and
then<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:29.960> have<00:02:30.080> mobilization<00:02:30.770> calls<00:02:31.010> we<00:02:31.190> would

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
then we have mobilization calls we would

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.680 
then we have mobilization calls we would
want<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.610> account<00:02:31.880> for<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.210> it's<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.600> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
want to account for that it's just a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.060 
want to account for that it's just a
lump<00:02:32.900> sum<00:02:34.450> value<00:02:36.700> mobilization<00:02:37.990> it

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
lump sum value mobilization it

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.940 
lump sum value mobilization it
abbreviated<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:42.380> we<00:02:42.440> have<00:02:42.530> three<00:02:42.770> different

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
abbreviated so we have three different

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.410 
abbreviated so we have three different
values<00:02:43.220> we're<00:02:43.490> going<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.670> add<00:02:43.760> those<00:02:43.940> up<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.360> I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
values we're going to add those up and I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.330 
values we're going to add those up and I
get<00:02:44.630> 103<00:02:45.260> 450<00:02:45.950> for<00:02:46.160> those<00:02:46.280> three<00:02:46.520> values<00:02:50.110> and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
get 103 450 for those three values and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.890 
get 103 450 for those three values and
that's<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.580> would<00:02:52.670> be<00:02:52.760> our<00:02:52.880> subtotal

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.940 

and<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.379> now<00:02:59.560> we

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
and so now we

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.260 
and so now we
account<00:03:00.160> for<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.459> overhead<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:01.090> profit

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
account for the overhead and profit

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.309 
account for the overhead and profit
margin<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:03.510> before<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:04.900> multiply<00:03:05.260> this

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
margin and before you just multiply this

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.720 
margin and before you just multiply this
value<00:03:05.680> by<00:03:06.780> 0.25<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.410> add<00:03:09.129> it<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:11.080> subtotal

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
value by 0.25 and add it to the subtotal

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.449 
value by 0.25 and add it to the subtotal
or<00:03:12.730> just<00:03:12.970> x<00:03:13.269> 1.25<00:03:13.900> be<00:03:14.680> careful<00:03:15.129> about<00:03:15.400> doing

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
or just x 1.25 be careful about doing

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.050 
or just x 1.25 be careful about doing
that<00:03:15.940> because<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:17.709> want<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.160> says<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.670> wants<00:03:18.849> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
that because you want it says it wants a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.380 
that because you want it says it wants a
profit<00:03:19.480> margin<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.959> 25%<00:03:20.670> which<00:03:21.670> means<00:03:21.970> or

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
profit margin of 25% which means or

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.259 
profit margin of 25% which means or
overhead<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.050> profit<00:03:23.260> margin<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.860> 25%<00:03:24.400> for

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
overhead and profit margin of 25% for

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.440 
overhead and profit margin of 25% for
the<00:03:25.360> job<00:03:25.569> which<00:03:25.840> means<00:03:26.080> your<00:03:26.709> profit<00:03:27.220> and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
the job which means your profit and

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.150 
the job which means your profit and
overhead<00:03:28.450> by<00:03:28.630> definition<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.470> profit<00:03:29.830> margin

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
overhead by definition and profit margin

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.580 
overhead by definition and profit margin
by<00:03:30.250> definition<00:03:30.519> is<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.810> multiplication

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
by definition is a is a multiplication

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.670 
by definition is a is a multiplication
of<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.250> revenue<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.910> total<00:03:34.269> revenue<00:03:34.680> alright

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
of the revenue the total revenue alright

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.140 
of the revenue the total revenue alright
so<00:03:35.830> in<00:03:36.069> doing<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.670> want<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.030> actually

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
so in doing so you want to actually

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.710 
so in doing so you want to actually
divide<00:03:37.660> by<00:03:38.019> 1<00:03:38.410> minus<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.760> profit<00:03:40.150> margin<00:03:40.510> and

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
divide by 1 minus the profit margin and

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.620 
divide by 1 minus the profit margin and
overhead<00:03:41.200> markup<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.280> or<00:03:42.459> not<00:03:42.610> markup<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
overhead markup so or not markup but the

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.539 
overhead markup so or not markup but the
overhead<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.290> profit<00:03:44.410> margin<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.069> that<00:03:45.430> would

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
overhead and profit margin so that would

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.539 
overhead and profit margin so that would
be<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:46.180> would<00:03:46.269> actually<00:03:46.390> divide<00:03:46.870> this<00:03:47.110> by<00:03:49.319> 0.75

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
be it would actually divide this by 0.75

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.270 
be it would actually divide this by 0.75
in<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:53.019> case<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.769> it's<00:03:53.890> going<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.040> be<00:03:54.160> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
in this case so it's going to be the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.830 
in this case so it's going to be the
total<00:03:54.549> is<00:03:54.610> going<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.790> be<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.269> subtotal

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
total is going to be the subtotal

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.759 
total is going to be the subtotal
divided<00:03:56.319> by<00:03:56.410> one<00:03:57.190> minus<00:03:58.110> one<00:03:59.110> minus<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.590> point

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
divided by one minus one minus the point

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.670 
divided by one minus one minus the point
two<00:04:00.010> five<00:04:00.220> which<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.459> going<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.730> be<00:04:01.530> excuse<00:04:02.530> me

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
two five which is going to be excuse me

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.490 
two five which is going to be excuse me
it's<00:04:03.400> going<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.670> in<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:03.880> case<00:04:04.060> be<00:04:04.209> one<00:04:04.500> 0.75

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
it's going to in this case be one 0.75

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.970 
it's going to in this case be one 0.75
so<00:04:05.829> taking<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.730> 103<00:04:07.269> 450<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:10.739> divide<00:04:11.739> that<00:04:11.889> by

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
so taking the 103 450 and divide that by

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:23.890 
so taking the 103 450 and divide that by
0.75<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:16.500> what<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.590> that

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.230 

make<00:04:24.900> sure<00:04:25.050> your<00:04:25.170> battery<00:04:25.470> has<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:26.090> power<00:04:29.240> my

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
make sure your battery has a power my

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.180 
make sure your battery has a power my
battery<00:04:30.570> actually<00:04:30.900> my<00:04:31.050> Casio<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.860> actually

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
battery actually my Casio is actually

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.890 
battery actually my Casio is actually
working<00:04:32.340> on<00:04:32.580> sunlight<00:04:33.120> right<00:04:33.300> now<00:04:33.510> so<00:04:33.750> but

working on sunlight right now so but

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.210 
working on sunlight right now so but
it's<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.490> $138,000<00:04:38.150> 138<00:04:39.150> there's<00:04:39.410> 137<00:04:40.410> 933<00:04:41.130> to
