the<00:02:11.910> concept<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.510> similar<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.990> this<00:02:13.110> one<00:02:13.349> but

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
the concept is similar to this one but

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.270 
the concept is similar to this one but
instead<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:16.200> kind<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.590> tightening

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.240 
instead of the this kind of tightening
system<00:02:17.819> would<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.060> one<00:02:18.540> scratch<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.250> we

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
system would have one scratch and we

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.400 
system would have one scratch and we
have<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> rubber<00:02:20.760> sole<00:02:21.120> instead<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.690> poly

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410
