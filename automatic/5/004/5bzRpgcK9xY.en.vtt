00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.500
 in short all the boys and welcome back on 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.290
 rai2 on the server and on the corner of the 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.810
 monkey we returned to work again 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.760
 of the monkey because fortunately yes 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.980
 is facing something new 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.870
 something really interesting 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.220
 really interesting indeed 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.670
 interesting because it was a period 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.090
 survival horror award but none that 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.150
 then left us satisfied no 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.150
 let's say that there just broke it 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.970
 survival horror balls you broke 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.180
 balls especially the survival horror with 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.270
 crafting elements enough hell in a 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.200
 cell t this game is an inspection with 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.340
 however, elements of kraft however have us 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.500
 left a moment stupid for three 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.870
 gameplay that we saw later in the in 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.149
 producer channel 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.159
 in fact we are talking about the forest 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.350
 or the only one on the bread but them with 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.120
 crafting elements that only to see 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.880
 the trailer you feel bad you feel like it 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.490
 to turn us off is really there 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.909
 horror since there are elements of 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.600
 I think that crafting comes in second 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.080
 plan 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.299
 one is a beautiful graphic that is written 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.250
 render real time well unless 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.130
 let's shoot big bullshit 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.580
 will be the graphics of the game it says 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.500
 also that there will be several monsters and 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.460
 monsters we saw remind me 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.590
 very silent hill because i am 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.049
 of creatures with more bra in short 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.260
 really scary really cool e 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.420
 there are also sequences of one of 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.240
 an impressive harmony when you hold 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.130
 I do n't know about a sparrow robin 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.440
 ie fingers we have seen things that 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.409
 normally in a game you don't see not 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.479
 see the accept who takes out pieces of 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.190
 wood to chop down a tree even the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.190
 security cutter that wants to be a 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.450
 simulation game 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.310
 let's talk about lancaster and damaging 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.709
 serious but is saying 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.780
 Holy bitch we have seen things that 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.140
 maybe we're also gassing empty is 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.720
 but we are actually causing a 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.220
 I'd like to take human pieces and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.160
 then set him on a picket fire 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.070
 I do not know why as I tivo cases 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.230
 would like so much iron that is these 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.239
 gameplay actually because why there 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.040
 we are choosing this rose game 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.959
 for us the technical sector likes it from 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.830
 die you are music that the graphics there 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.870
 they look great so point 1.2 are 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.880
 managed to make limp her that there 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.760
 they have thrown a curiosity in their hearts 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.299
 insane just yes absolutely that is 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.130
 boys day everything perfect idyllic 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.870
 almost giving up a wood where to build 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.090
 your caserta etc. and so on 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.370
 the night arrives as in minecraft is that 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.799
 should be left alone to make us lose 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.350
 monsters arrive but monsters arrive 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.150
 that make you shit under management 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.280
 of lights at least from the gameplay that 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.290
 we have seen are trailer trains in 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.570
 reality and therefore it is not that we have seen 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.250
 then a lot can also inculcate you 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.850
 something that will not be inside 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.530
 of the game 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.390
 I repeat we trust that a lot 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.090
 trends 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.370
 in short, it's written in real time 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.160
 of lighting management wishes but you 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.650
 always think of similar graphics a 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.540
 horror videogame think of graphics 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.430
 exactly like when i do good 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.590
 pacific rim you can't see it big 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.010
 so that the cinema no longer ok 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.700
 certainties but murray to look as well 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.820
 the audio would make us think of the game either 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.239
 done slightly above the 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.920
 average 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.260
 what I have to do to them that we have seen 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.900
 that a mean shit made of copy 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.570
 fuck the fuck see seven days to 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.120
 die berasi all these worlds if with one 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.390
 dull graphics with atmosphere equal to 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.940
 zero is an appropriate audio especially 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.260
 so guys hope so 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.790
 particularly in this forest but 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.160
 on the other hand you are seeing the images 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.300
 and therefore the monkey will have ascended 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.300
 definitely for you too
