00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.360
 April 19, 1970 can be considered 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.219
 the beginning of a new car era 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.379
 Soviet Union from the main assembly line 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.730
 Volga Automobile Plant gone 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.949
 the first truly folk car VAZ 2101 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.580
 sedan drive rear engine capacity 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.310
 1.3 liters and 64 horsepower 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.990
 4-speed manual transmissions 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.660
 price of the test vehicle in 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.640
 seventies of the last century 5500 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.860
 rubles for 16 years of production was 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.440
 collected more than 2 million 700 thousand 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.780
 cars car produced in union 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.140
 Soviet Socialist Republics 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.780
 the prototype of the VAZ 2101 was Italian 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.570
 fiat 124 in the design of a small car was 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.609
 made to 800 changes however these 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.770
 changes are not very noticeable if not 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.180
 look closely the design remains the same 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.430
 in those days he was very 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.320
 promising amount of chrome 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.390
 details of the minimum Soviet designer 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.579
 really worked on durability 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.679
 body after that the cars increased 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.050
 ground clearance and bumper appeared 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.299
 Kalmyks about the type of saying that she 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.240
 inside is more than it seems from the outside and it is 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.979
 but of course the instruments of the car a little water 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.990
 necessary minimum well greed 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.119
 layout compensates for very good 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.860
 the stove really blows it only up and 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.049
 down because of this all glass except 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.360
 frontal fog up but the driver is warm 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.310
 the machine can easily accommodate five 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.530
 human front seats recline 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.500
 horizontally and it turns out the bedroom 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.619
 there was no place for fiat even though 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.420
 miscalculations the main problem vaz 2101 and 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.890
 similarity is not classic swivel vents 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.630
 in the front doors 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.939
 they significantly reduce get review 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.250
 as well as glued locks constantly 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.200
 fall off one of the most important to my 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.280
 a look of the completions a hole in the front 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.280
 crooked starter bumper 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.500
 in our conditions a thing is necessary 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.930
 engine refined by Soviet engineers 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.850
 easy to start in any frost and instead 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.860
 water which drove almost all 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.939
 Soviet cars in the radiator poured 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.950
 non-freezing mass 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.080
 sixty four horses without difficulty 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.939
 dispersed the car to a hundred in 20 seconds 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.250
 and the maximum speed of the new 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.789
 car was 140 two kilometers 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.220
 at one o'clock 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.290
 swarm of course thinish but you get used 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.390
 fast especially as it is easy to spin 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.610
 successful body geometry painting 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.319
 allow you to pass quite steep 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.150
 good speed turns 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.190
 the only flaw in principle 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.590
 the whole classic family is the back 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.380
 dead zone when rebuilding need to be 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.690
 more closely if it slows down 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.670
 the pedal must be pressed from the soul in the car there 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.739
 vacuum booster adapted themselves 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.750
 you understand that the brakes are not bad for 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.120
 30-year-old cars are true except for 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.130
 the fact that all the wheels inhibit insanity 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.489
 Because of this, the machine has to catch 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.519
 driving on the road from the date of the first 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.530
 VAZ 2101 more than thirty years have passed but also 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.690
 in old age penny continues 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.519
 drive on the roads of different countries causing 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.299
 admiration for their reliability and 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.299
 unpretentiousness
