out<00:05:38.419> I<00:05:38.630> am<00:05:38.990> actually<00:05:39.490> kind<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.580> worried<00:05:40.880> about

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
out I am actually kind of worried about

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.290 
out I am actually kind of worried about
this<00:05:41.389> because<00:05:41.810> quite<00:05:42.800> simply<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.610> original

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
this because quite simply the original

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.689 
this because quite simply the original
first<00:05:44.750> three<00:05:45.050> seasons<00:05:45.440> were<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:45.830> fucking<00:05:46.430> good

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
first three seasons were so fucking good

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.820 
first three seasons were so fucking good
but<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.449> don't<00:05:47.509> think<00:05:47.930> before<00:05:48.080> oral<00:05:48.560> could

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
but I don't think before oral could

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.570 
but I don't think before oral could
actually<00:05:48.979> touch<00:05:49.460> it<00:05:49.520> but<00:05:50.620> I'm<00:05:51.620> gonna<00:05:51.800> keep<00:05:52.400> an

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
actually touch it but I'm gonna keep an

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.360 
actually touch it but I'm gonna keep an
