00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 many people are already thinking of that 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.109
 have to my video to one 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.389
 possible snes remix 1 and 2 after all 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.420
 at the same time of course remix 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.700
 options for the n64 rausgesucht 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.850
 Again, the same rule I have 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.770
 a remix 1 and a remix 2 in the remix 1 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.210
 the older nintendo 64 games and the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.269
 mx2 the newer internal 64 games not 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.460
 are probably taken games 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.830
 who created the technology itself 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.230
 In no case be there banjo 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.290
 kazooie band tui.com costs for the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.140
 perfect goldeneye btob sandforce 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.360
 germany because the rare games are 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.230
 completely designed by her characters 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 they will become zero 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.850
 although they are all right 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.610
 violin pastes grad with conquer with 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.329
 banjo with blas courts the hands perfect 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.820
 But was is microsoft simply stop 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 bad bad smakov I wanted to say that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.379
 So there's even more games for 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 nintendo 64 the pastes though 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.189
 probably not going to do it easy 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 as nintendo games are star wars 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.830
 raymond resident evil tetris day with 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.530
 Tony Hawk Bomberman Turok Road Rash 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.360
 goalie magic century you have to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.880
 unfortunately, but still cut internally 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.909
 a high-quality offer in stock and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.960
 Although you see this here , I want that 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.630
 time and a little bit 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.640
 balanced 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.100
 It's because the players are about 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.689
 To have the same level is easy 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.200
 Of course, let's go with the launch 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.070
 title mario 64 at 164 little later 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.380
 it seemed 64 and mario kart 64 the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.860
 will probably all at the first n64 remix 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.460
 Starfox 2 suffers as well 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.750
 a year later china 97 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.189
 Of course, that could come from Rheinhausen 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.250
 diddy kong racing so if you donkey 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.420
 kong country creates the sms service 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.610
 diddy kong racing I'm right 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.170
 confident because it also appeared 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.110
 for the nintendo ds 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:06.409
 diddy kong racing dsj story that's one 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.420
 perfect title for such a remix then 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.160
 also need teddy snowboarding 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.780
 not many that is a clean 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.849
 There is still the snowboard 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.940
 kids but that's from the other developer 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.829
 teddy is as much by intel as herself 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.440
 You can bring fcx in, of course 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:24.920
 zelda ocarina of time the first mario 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.459
 party hey you pikachu is a game for 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.700
 Nintendo 64 where they piccata Yes 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.450
 You do not have to treat a tamagotchi 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.359
 there is never played snow is there 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 Of course it would be achim 460 riems 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.639
 ingenious 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.040
 as well as mario golf by pokémon 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.040
 stadium also wrapped up with it 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.109
 is relatively balanced 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.260
 because n64 remix has the same times 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.690
 really big kracher donkey kong 64 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.870
 super smash bros much easier anyway 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.889
 pokémon snap photographed these are the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.040
 pokémon money 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.620
 Mario party two and three 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.620
 zelda majora's mask it important the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.650
 given as first and second paper 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.450
 mario train later hit mario tennis 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.549
 also present and pokémon cerium 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.010
 that's why the puck for 1 also at 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.489
 first remix one did not do it in 2002 yet 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.819
 To give 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.290
 pokémon basel ii is also curry 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.120
 Europe did not appear it is supposed to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.730
 late was just her daughter born 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.519
 Platz wozu still on Germany brinker 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.879
 how many 16 servers are assigned and 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.810
 exactly 64 and dr mario 64 by the way 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.180
 the same fate as kirby 64 i 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.810
 think that is a very good variant 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.010
 write your opinion in the comments 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.260
 that could actually be seen 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.840
 It would also be fun, I hope 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.879
 really that something like that brings synonymous if so 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.310
 really high caliber like banjo and 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.319
 curves 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.430
 that looks really nice after 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.859
 appetite for more 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.359
 we'll be thumbing next time 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.359
 high and until then and ciao
