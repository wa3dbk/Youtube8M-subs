hi<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.050> chipping<00:00:07.850> I'm<00:00:08.850> just<00:00:09.120> testing<00:00:09.360> out

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:10.879 
hi this is chipping I'm just testing out

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.790 
hi this is chipping I'm just testing out
something<00:00:11.879> that<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.180> I<00:00:12.570> was<00:00:12.660> inspired<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.590> do

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
something that in I was inspired to do

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.070 
something that in I was inspired to do
by<00:00:14.809> this<00:00:15.809> justin.tv<00:00:17.300> experiment<00:00:18.300> are

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
by this justin.tv experiment are

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.600 
by this justin.tv experiment are
children<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.560> his<00:00:19.650> experiment<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.310> think<00:00:20.520> these

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
children of his experiment I think these

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.429 
children of his experiment I think these
guys<00:00:20.820> are<00:00:20.880> doing<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.329> for<00:00:21.360> real<00:00:21.660> what<00:00:22.320> they're

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
guys are doing it for real what they're

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.010 
guys are doing it for real what they're
doing<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:23.040> they're<00:00:23.450> carrying<00:00:24.450> around<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.720> video

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
doing is they're carrying around a video

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.670 
doing is they're carrying around a video
cam<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.779> presumably<00:00:27.779> some<00:00:28.140> sort<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> cellular

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
cam and presumably some sort of cellular

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.049 
cam and presumably some sort of cellular
data<00:00:28.890> connection<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.669> actually<00:00:29.970> looked

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:30.059 
data connection have actually looked

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.590 
data connection have actually looked
into<00:00:30.419> it<00:00:30.540> see<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.349> they're<00:00:31.470> using<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:32.600> they

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
into it see what they're using and they

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180 
into it see what they're using and they
plug<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> webcam<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> laptop<00:00:34.620> tethered

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
plug the webcam is the laptop tethered

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610 
plug the webcam is the laptop tethered
the<00:00:35.280> laptop<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> hsdpa<00:00:36.480> absolutel<00:00:37.260> 3g

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the laptop to the hsdpa absolutel 3g

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.950 
the laptop to the hsdpa absolutel 3g
connection<00:00:38.130> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.820> live<00:00:39.060> video<00:00:39.570> blogging

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
connection and then live video blogging

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.440 
connection and then live video blogging
their<00:00:40.350> daily<00:00:41.160> activities<00:00:41.310> which<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.180> kind<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
their daily activities which is kind of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.870 
their daily activities which is kind of
a<00:00:42.570> weird<00:00:42.750> idea<00:00:42.900> about<00:00:43.400> technologies<00:00:44.400> cool<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
a weird idea about technologies cool so

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.870 
a weird idea about technologies cool so
I<00:00:44.910> thought<00:00:45.240> I'd<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.630> take<00:00:46.340> some<00:00:47.340> I'll<00:00:47.700> take

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
I thought I'd do is take some I'll take

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.630 
I thought I'd do is take some I'll take
it<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> MPC<00:00:48.720> see<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.920> could<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> with

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it you MPC see if I could do it with

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.530 
it you MPC see if I could do it with
with<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.440> I've<00:00:52.530> got<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:52.680> everyone<00:00:53.540> and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
with that so I've got the everyone and

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.890 
with that so I've got the everyone and
I've<00:00:54.630> got<00:00:54.860> hsdpa<00:00:55.860> incapable<00:00:56.460> phone<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> I'm

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
I've got hsdpa incapable phone so I'm

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.450 
I've got hsdpa incapable phone so I'm
gonna<00:00:58.020> tether<00:00:58.260> those<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.800> together<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.370> then

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
gonna tether those two together and then

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.510 
gonna tether those two together and then
I<00:00:59.489> had<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.820> video<00:01:00.420> cam<00:01:00.930> okay<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.040> is<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.220> rather

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
I had a video cam okay this is a rather

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.850 
I had a video cam okay this is a rather
large<00:01:02.790> solution<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.660> ok<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
large solution but ok it's just a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.030 
large solution but ok it's just a
technology<00:01:05.369> demonstrator<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.799> see<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
technology demonstrator and see if it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
technology demonstrator and see if it
works<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.579> I'll<00:01:08.670> installing<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:09.300> now

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
works so I'll installing it right now

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.560 
works so I'll installing it right now
and<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.770> back<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> few<00:01:11.340> minutes<00:01:11.760> maybe<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and then be back a few minutes maybe a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.320 
and then be back a few minutes maybe a
bit<00:01:12.690> longer<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.890> show<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.400> whether<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> works

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
bit longer to show you whether it works

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.590 
bit longer to show you whether it works
or<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.540> let's<00:01:16.260> see<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.130> TV<00:01:17.550> TV<00:01:17.970> TV<00:01:18.000> this

or not let's see just in TV TV TV this

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.180 
or not let's see just in TV TV TV this
could<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.930> new<00:01:19.110> thing<00:01:19.320> keep<00:01:19.950> an<00:01:20.070> eye<00:01:20.159> on

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190
