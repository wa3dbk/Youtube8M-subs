00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
handling what kind of capsule are we

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
handling what kind of capsule are we
running<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:49.020> kind<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.320> polar<00:00:49.559> pattern

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
running and what kind of polar pattern

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.160 
running and what kind of polar pattern
it's<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> cardioid<00:00:50.730> dynamic<00:00:51.449> microphone<00:00:51.989> it's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it's a cardioid dynamic microphone it's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
it's a cardioid dynamic microphone it's
a<00:00:52.260> high-energy<00:00:52.590> capsule<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
a high-energy capsule so it's in the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.910 
a high-energy capsule so it's in the
odium<00:00:54.120> capsule<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.410> guess<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
odium capsule it's I guess a it's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.619 
odium capsule it's I guess a it's
designed<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> working<00:00:56.730> working

of their own mic now if you want a
hyper-cardioid<00:01:05.790> you're<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> situation

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
hyper-cardioid you're in a situation

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.000 
hyper-cardioid you're in a situation
where<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> need<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> little<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.799> tighter

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
where you need a little bit tighter

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.039 
where you need a little bit tighter
pattering<00:01:08.460> control<00:01:08.820> we've<00:01:09.420> also<00:01:09.630> done<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
pattering control we've also done the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.399 
pattering control we've also done the
same<00:01:10.080> thing<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> ATM<00:01:11.100> six-ten<00:01:12.409> handheld

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
same thing to the ATM six-ten handheld

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.800 
same thing to the ATM six-ten handheld
microphone<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> 6/10<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.299> so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
microphone and it's now the 6/10 a so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.149 
microphone and it's now the 6/10 a so
it's<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.020> improved<00:01:16.320> handling<00:01:16.590> noise<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
it's got improved handling noise a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.590 
it's got improved handling noise a
little<00:01:17.340> bit<00:01:17.549> better<00:01:17.670> performance<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.450> just

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
little bit better performance we're just

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
little bit better performance we're just
kind<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.840> improving<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> performance<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:20.070> our

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
kind of improving the performance as our

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
kind of improving the performance as our
engineering<00:01:20.850> keeps<00:01:21.180> developing<00:01:21.689> better<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
engineering keeps developing better and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.210 
engineering keeps developing better and
better<00:01:22.110> technologies<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.920> better<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
better technologies have better and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.649 
better technologies have better and
better<00:01:23.310> ways<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.299> bring<00:01:24.509> those

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
better ways to do it if we bring those

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
better ways to do it if we bring those
out<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.020> products<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.740> absolutely<00:01:26.640> love

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
out in the products I absolutely love

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.149 
out in the products I absolutely love
that<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.509> we've<00:01:27.659> got<00:01:27.900> better<00:01:28.229> better<00:01:28.710> handling

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that so we've got better better handling

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.590 
that so we've got better better handling
we've<00:01:29.310> got<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> hypercar<00:01:30.329> doing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
we've got the hypercar doing

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
we've got the hypercar doing
hyper-cardioid<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> cardioid<00:01:31.710> the
