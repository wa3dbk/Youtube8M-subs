00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.140 
given him FIFA love to downgrade players
downgrade<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> older<00:01:38.250> players<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.790> I'm

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
downgrade the older players so I'm

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.390 
downgrade the older players so I'm
thinking<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.049> his<00:01:40.200> time<00:01:40.439> he<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> really

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
thinking this is his time he is a really

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.399 
thinking this is his time he is a really
good<00:01:41.549> player<00:01:41.729> must<00:01:42.030> give<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> him<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
good player must give it to him if it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.990 
good player must give it to him if it
was<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> me<00:01:43.740> I'd<00:01:44.040> definitely<00:01:44.460> say<00:01:44.729> he's<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
was up to me I'd definitely say he's a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.440 
was up to me I'd definitely say he's a
lot<00:01:45.240> better<00:01:45.390> than<00:01:45.720> most<00:01:46.530> defenders<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.759> again

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
lot better than most defenders but again

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
lot better than most defenders but again
he<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.780> getting<00:01:49.079> old<00:01:49.229> he's<00:01:49.380> starting<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.829> slow

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
he is getting old he's starting to slow

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.039 
he is getting old he's starting to slow
up<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.700> maybe<00:01:51.180> his<00:01:51.450> pace<00:01:51.689> might<00:01:51.930> go

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
up a little bit maybe his pace might go

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.630 
up a little bit maybe his pace might go
down<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> bit<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.590> maybe<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.220> stay<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
down a bit more maybe just stay up a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
down a bit more maybe just stay up a

opinion to me and I want to hear it
xuan's<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.549> gone<00:02:05.670> down<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.119> whatever<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
xuan's just gone down with whatever I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.240 
xuan's just gone down with whatever I
probably<00:02:06.810> could<00:02:07.049> go<00:02:07.170> down<00:02:07.320> even<00:02:07.469> more<00:02:07.619> from<00:02:08.069> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
probably could go down even more from to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.940 
probably could go down even more from to
reigns<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.729> honest<00:02:09.030> looking<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.420> again<00:02:09.950> 63

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
reigns to be honest looking and again 63

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100 
reigns to be honest looking and again 63
passing<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.489> think<00:02:12.000> obviously<00:02:12.150> they<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.959> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
passing I think obviously they have to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.400 
passing I think obviously they have to
go

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
go

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.040 
go
somewhere<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.940> think<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.690> obviously

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
somewhere and I think it's obviously

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.530 
somewhere and I think it's obviously
going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.350> affect<00:02:16.680> his<00:02:16.830> whole<00:02:17.070> stats<00:02:17.540> 55

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
going to affect his whole stats 55

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.880 
going to affect his whole stats 55
driven<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.990> probably<00:02:19.320> could<00:02:19.530> put<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.680> down

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
driven I probably could put that down

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.200 
driven I probably could put that down
even<00:02:20.250> more<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.580> it's<00:02:20.790> not<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
even more because it's not really of a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.660 
even more because it's not really of a
dribbler<00:02:21.560> defendant<00:02:22.560> will<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:22.830> down<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.340> he

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
dribbler defendant will go down if he

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.940 
dribbler defendant will go down if he
does<00:02:23.940> go<00:02:24.120> down<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.810> think<00:02:25.680> personally

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
does go down that is I think personally

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.310 
does go down that is I think personally
he<00:02:26.130> will<00:02:26.310> go<00:02:26.430> down<00:02:26.550> 24<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.420> because<00:02:27.750> he's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
he will go down 24 just because he's

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.230 
he will go down 24 just because he's
getting<00:02:28.620> older<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:28.980> look<00:02:29.430> at<00:02:29.580> Lampard<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
getting older and look at Lampard and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.700 
getting older and look at Lampard and
Gerard<00:02:30.600> compared<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> couple<00:02:31.470> years<00:02:31.620> ago

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
Gerard compared to a couple years ago

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.460 
Gerard compared to a couple years ago
but<00:02:32.460> is<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.750> time<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.350> question

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
but is it is time that is the question

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.160 
but is it is time that is the question
will<00:02:34.980> they<00:02:35.130> keep<00:02:35.280> him<00:02:35.460> up<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.640> an<00:02:35.820> 85<00:02:36.270> or<00:02:36.570> an<00:02:36.660> 86

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
will they keep him up to an 85 or an 86

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.620 
will they keep him up to an 85 or an 86
I<00:02:37.380> personally<00:02:38.130> don't<00:02:38.220> think<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.940> there<00:02:39.510> is

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
I personally don't think so so there is

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.750 
I personally don't think so so there is
the<00:02:39.720> first<00:02:39.900> person<00:02:40.230> done<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.130> moving

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
exact same card obviously I've tweaked

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.150 
exact same card obviously I've tweaked
their<00:03:36.060> stats<00:03:36.360> around<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.660> little<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.350> 86<00:03:37.980> is

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
their stats around a little but 86 is

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.400 
their stats around a little but 86 is
why<00:03:38.430> I'm<00:03:38.490> keeping<00:03:38.730> him<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.150> don't<00:03:39.959> personally

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
why I'm keeping him I don't personally

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.310 
why I'm keeping him I don't personally
think<00:03:40.800> you'll<00:03:41.100> go<00:03:41.220> up<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.430> an<00:03:41.490> 87<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:43.080> that

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
think you'll go up to an 87 that that

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.380 
think you'll go up to an 87 that that
could<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.680> wrong<00:03:43.860> he<00:03:44.160> might<00:03:44.430> go<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:44.850> but

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
could be wrong he might go up but

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.970 
could be wrong he might go up but
personally<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.110> personal<00:03:46.410> level<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.709> don't

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
personally on a personal level I don't

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.830 
personally on a personal level I don't
think<00:03:47.190> he's<00:03:47.310> done<00:03:47.459> enough<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.910> go<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.090> an<00:03:48.270> 87<00:03:48.720> I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
think he's done enough to go to an 87 I

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.900 
think he's done enough to go to an 87 I
maybe<00:03:49.470> not<00:03:50.010> correct<00:03:50.370> there<00:03:50.520> but<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.700> believe

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
maybe not correct there but I believe

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.300 
maybe not correct there but I believe
he's<00:03:51.120> had<00:03:51.330> more<00:03:52.020> of<00:03:52.140> an<00:03:52.230> average<00:03:52.470> season<00:03:53.160> than

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
he's had more of an average season than

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.520 
he's had more of an average season than
this<00:03:53.760> year<00:03:54.060> then<00:03:54.480> he<00:03:54.600> did<00:03:54.750> last<00:03:55.020> year<00:03:55.170> last

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
this year then he did last year last

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.770 
this year then he did last year last
year<00:03:55.709> was<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.130> brilliant<00:03:56.430> season<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:57.180> him<00:03:57.270> but

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
year was a brilliant season for him but

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.560 
year was a brilliant season for him but
i<00:03:57.840> think<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.290> year<00:03:58.560> my<00:03:59.489> opinion<00:03:59.940> he's<00:04:00.150> had<00:04:00.330> a

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
i think this year my opinion he's had a

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.360 
i think this year my opinion he's had a
kind<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:00.959> average<00:04:01.140> season<00:04:01.739> compared<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.160> most

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
kind of average season compared to most

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.060 
kind of average season compared to most
but<00:04:03.200> saying<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.380> I've<00:04:04.470> tweaked<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.830> stats

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
but saying that I've tweaked the stats

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.560 
but saying that I've tweaked the stats
around<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> little<00:04:05.459> bit<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.790> gave<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.180> little<00:04:06.390> bit

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
around a little bit I gave a little bit

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.090 
around a little bit I gave a little bit
more<00:04:06.660> pace<00:04:06.900> than<00:04:07.110> what<00:04:07.230> he<00:04:07.320> what<00:04:07.590> he<00:04:07.620> was<00:04:07.860> I

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
more pace than what he what he was I

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.350 
more pace than what he what he was I
believe<00:04:08.370> he<00:04:08.670> has<00:04:08.790> got<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.000> little<00:04:09.090> bit<00:04:09.239> more

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
believe he has got a little bit more

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.240 
believe he has got a little bit more
pace<00:04:09.570> than<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.900> he<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.200> quite<00:04:10.500> fast<00:04:10.770> but<00:04:11.040> not

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
pace than that he is quite fast but not

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.670 
pace than that he is quite fast but not
not<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:11.910> surgery<00:04:12.480> most<00:04:12.780> standards<00:04:13.290> i<00:04:13.440> would

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
not the surgery most standards i would

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.620 
not the surgery most standards i would
say<00:04:13.830> i'm<00:04:14.160> shooting<00:04:14.820> i've<00:04:14.940> dropped<00:04:15.120> by<00:04:15.330> one

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
say i'm shooting i've dropped by one

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.330 
say i'm shooting i've dropped by one
just<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.049> tweak<00:04:16.440> them<00:04:16.590> around<00:04:16.770> so<00:04:16.950> i<00:04:17.010> can<00:04:17.190> tweak

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
just to tweak them around so i can tweak

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.550

personally<00:05:21.210> don't<00:05:21.480> think<00:05:21.600> he's<00:05:21.810> anal<00:05:22.200> and<00:05:22.260> I

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
personally don't think he's anal and I

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.110 
personally don't think he's anal and I
think<00:05:22.530> defenders<00:05:23.070> do<00:05:23.250> find<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:23.580> hard<00:05:23.820> to<00:05:24.000> get

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
think defenders do find it hard to get

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.830 
think defenders do find it hard to get
to<00:05:24.240> an<00:05:24.330> 89<00:05:24.720> but<00:05:25.410> 88<00:05:26.220> definitely<00:05:26.910> if<00:05:27.120> anything<00:05:27.810> I

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
to an 89 but 88 definitely if anything I

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.110 
to an 89 but 88 definitely if anything I
believe<00:05:28.230> he<00:05:28.380> should<00:05:28.440> go<00:05:28.860> up<00:05:29.010> at<00:05:29.220> least<00:05:29.250> one<00:05:29.880> if

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
believe he should go up at least one if

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.900 
believe he should go up at least one if
he<00:05:30.540> doesn't<00:05:30.900> go<00:05:30.990> up<00:05:31.110> one<00:05:31.380> then<00:05:32.370> there's<00:05:32.669> got<00:05:32.820> to

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
he doesn't go up one then there's got to

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.460 
he doesn't go up one then there's got to
be<00:05:32.940> something<00:05:33.180> wrong<00:05:33.450> because<00:05:33.630> his<00:05:33.930> had<00:05:34.200> such

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
be something wrong because his had such

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.310 
be something wrong because his had such
a<00:05:34.500> good<00:05:34.740> season<00:05:34.980> for<00:05:35.160> real<00:05:35.850> madrid<00:05:36.150> for<00:05:36.990> a<00:05:37.020> few

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
a good season for real madrid for a few

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.260 
a good season for real madrid for a few
seasons<00:05:37.500> now<00:05:37.890> he<00:05:38.100> came<00:05:38.669> in<00:05:38.820> to<00:05:38.910> center<00:05:39.120> back

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
seasons now he came in to center back

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.240 
seasons now he came in to center back
and<00:05:39.480> made<00:05:39.630> it<00:05:39.750> his<00:05:39.840> own<00:05:40.020> he<00:05:40.500> is<00:05:40.650> literally<00:05:41.130> the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
and made it his own he is literally the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.520 
and made it his own he is literally the
captain<00:05:41.790> of<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.000> center<00:05:42.330> of<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:43.169> defense

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
captain of the center of the the defense

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.980 
captain of the center of the the defense
i<00:05:43.820> just<00:05:44.820> can't<00:05:45.030> see<00:05:45.270> why<00:05:45.480> they<00:05:45.690> wouldn't<00:05:45.900> have

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
i just can't see why they wouldn't have

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.870 
i just can't see why they wouldn't have
great<00:05:46.230> him<00:05:46.380> so<00:05:46.890> I've<00:05:47.010> tweaked<00:05:47.370> his<00:05:47.490> stats

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
great him so I've tweaked his stats

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.130 
great him so I've tweaked his stats
around<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.180> little<00:05:48.300> bit<00:05:48.419> gave<00:05:48.660> him<00:05:48.810> a<00:05:48.840> bit<00:05:49.020> more

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
around a little bit gave him a bit more

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.810 
around a little bit gave him a bit more
pace<00:05:49.440> because<00:05:49.590> i<00:05:49.770> think<00:05:50.010> he<00:05:50.190> is<00:05:50.220> absolutely

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
pace because i think he is absolutely

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.330 
pace because i think he is absolutely
rapid<00:05:51.570> just<00:05:52.200> because<00:05:52.500> he's<00:05:52.650> not<00:05:52.800> a<00:05:52.860> wrote<00:05:53.130> back

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
rapid just because he's not a wrote back

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.490 
rapid just because he's not a wrote back
I<00:05:53.610> believe<00:05:54.390> he's<00:05:54.630> definitely<00:05:55.050> is<00:05:55.169> a<00:05:55.200> fast

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
I believe he's definitely is a fast

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.500 
I believe he's definitely is a fast
center<00:05:55.770> back<00:05:55.950> I<00:05:56.130> think<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.000> pace<00:05:57.210> should<00:05:57.419> have

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
center back I think the pace should have

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.610 
center back I think the pace should have
carried<00:05:57.690> over<00:05:57.900> because<00:05:58.169> I<00:05:58.230> believe<00:05:58.410> he<00:05:58.500> did

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
carried over because I believe he did

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.010 
carried over because I believe he did
have<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.830> bit<00:05:58.950> more<00:05:59.010> pace<00:05:59.370> and<00:05:59.550> fee<00:05:59.730> for<00:06:00.000> 12<00:06:00.570> when

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
have a bit more pace and fee for 12 when

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.540 
have a bit more pace and fee for 12 when
he<00:06:01.050> was<00:06:01.320> Roy<00:06:01.500> but<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:01.830> need<00:06:01.980> to<00:06:02.070> check<00:06:02.250> that<00:06:02.280> I

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
he was Roy but I need to check that I

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.040 
he was Roy but I need to check that I
believe<00:06:03.120> he<00:06:03.210> did<00:06:03.330> have<00:06:03.450> quite<00:06:03.600> a<00:06:03.690> bit<00:06:03.750> of<00:06:03.870> pace

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
believe he did have quite a bit of pace

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.130 
believe he did have quite a bit of pace
so<00:06:04.410> looking<00:06:05.190> at<00:06:05.370> his<00:06:05.640> stats<00:06:06.030> we've<00:06:06.570> given<00:06:06.840> him

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
so looking at his stats we've given him

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.340 
so looking at his stats we've given him
an<00:06:07.290> increase<00:06:07.620> of<00:06:07.650> free<00:06:08.190> in<00:06:08.400> pace<00:06:08.760> a<00:06:09.390> bit<00:06:10.050> more

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
an increase of free in pace a bit more

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.840 
an increase of free in pace a bit more
shooting<00:06:10.800> to<00:06:10.919> be<00:06:10.950> fair<00:06:11.190> don't<00:06:11.340> know<00:06:11.460> why<00:06:11.669> have

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
shooting to be fair don't know why have

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.440 
shooting to be fair don't know why have
increased<00:06:12.330> about<00:06:12.600> that<00:06:12.840> much<00:06:13.140> but<00:06:13.470> I<00:06:14.450> don't

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
increased about that much but I don't

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.940 
increased about that much but I don't
even<00:06:15.540> know<00:06:15.780> why<00:06:16.020> I've<00:06:16.169> increased<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.590> damage

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
even know why I've increased the damage

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.860 
even know why I've increased the damage
and<00:06:17.100> passing<00:06:17.669> but<00:06:18.150> anyway<00:06:18.390> I've<00:06:18.510> gone<00:06:18.660> with

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
and passing but anyway I've gone with

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.780 
and passing but anyway I've gone with
something<00:06:18.900> going<00:06:19.650> on<00:06:19.710> but<00:06:20.130> are<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.370> defensive

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
something going on but are the defensive

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.500 
something going on but are the defensive
stats<00:06:21.060> there<00:06:21.270> a<00:06:21.419> 72<00:06:22.290> 84<00:06:22.740> and<00:06:22.950> defending<00:06:23.340> 89<00:06:23.850> 288

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
stats there a 72 84 and defending 89 288

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.390 
stats there a 72 84 and defending 89 288
I<00:06:24.660> think<00:06:25.380> his<00:06:25.560> stats<00:06:25.860> should<00:06:26.040> definitely

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
I think his stats should definitely

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.340 
I think his stats should definitely
being<00:06:26.550> cruise<00:06:26.790> by<00:06:27.000> quite<00:06:27.360> a<00:06:27.390> bit<00:06:27.480> and<00:06:27.720> I<00:06:28.140> think

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
being cruise by quite a bit and I think

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.290 
being cruise by quite a bit and I think
they<00:06:28.440> have<00:06:28.740> to<00:06:29.130> be<00:06:29.220> kind<00:06:29.370> of<00:06:29.550> to<00:06:29.640> get<00:06:29.760> to<00:06:29.850> an<00:06:29.970> 88

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
they have to be kind of to get to an 88

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.820 
they have to be kind of to get to an 88
so<00:06:30.720> that's<00:06:30.900> probably<00:06:31.080> why<00:06:31.320> i've<00:06:31.530> increased

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
so that's probably why i've increased

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.210 
so that's probably why i've increased
