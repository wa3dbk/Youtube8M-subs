00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.910
 fc groningen made two new additions this afternoon for the coming season 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.940
 johan kappelhof lorenzo burnet come over from young ajax the two players come 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.019
 Strengthening the defense of FC Groningen is very happy 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.349
 that's with the players 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.539
 for FC Groningen 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.249
 have chosen 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:21.359
 and why 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.839
 that is, considerably more coopers and hijackers at the fair 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.679
 so both men also work wonders at sign that it is at ajax 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.749
 we wish them both good luck in the next step in my career 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.140
 I am very welcome 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.760
 our club 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.960
 the costs do johan as what a losers that they have an agreement 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.480
 blankets 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.140
 at fc groningen 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 for a period of three years 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.770
 both players ran out of their contract 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.620
 weekers these 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.560
 we have so many lorenzo boys 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.870
 transfer free 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.490
 we have taken over a response 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.170
 among the boys who lost porto Thursday afternoon 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.040
 that says be very happy with a contract for FC Groningen yes I am very happy 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.450
 really i can only smile it was only smiling 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 it is such a warm club and the challenges of each other dela the environment whatever i do 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 get to know no, I can hardly ever go to Groningen and such 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.250
 nice club with good football 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 yes so very beautiful city what i heard that are 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.280
 he would like me to come here 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.020
 The new figures that go to the Euroborg are admirable it's important that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170
 they also knew about the city of Groningen 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.980
 last week appeared earlier 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.370
 a gronings for the martini tower if it is not 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.790
 what is that 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.340
 As the largest tower Groningen have played half also learned a week 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.530
 earlier 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.960
 9 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960
 and as if I say the martinitors 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.400
 the brand better 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.550
 next Sunday fc groningen hopes the competition match against nbc 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.880
 fc groningen tries to refuel with confidence in the run-up to the playoffs 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.420
 well what I find very important are the last three league games 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.260
 film crew seeing that 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.820
 which exudes that they became their own audience the previous day two more 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.999
 home games 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.999
 nfc and psv well i like the traffic this season 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.929
 to finish as it started 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.279
 also the interaction with the public 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.419
 the band has built it up anyway 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.480
 the way of playing on top of that is determined in the euroborg that we look forward to 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.589
 to come 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:32.559
 two game home games purchase from FC Groningen a lot of the new farmer 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.980
 was injured during training 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.399
 he will not be with him on Sunday 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.649
 maikel kieftenbelt, on the other hand, would return to the basic eleven of FC 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:41.469
 groningen 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.340
 the duel in the euroborg starts half an Easter day
