00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.260
 two 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.619
 until a few years ago in these fields 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.900
 they cultivated olives now the beauty of 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.419
 Moga marriage is integrated into the environment 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.029
 since a year ago the family lives here 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.660
 in the middle of the countryside 30 minutes away by car 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.660
 from Avignon 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.070
 welcome among please 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.560
 draws attention to the distribution of 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.690
 rooms from the lobby the 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.000
 visitor arrives in a very bright area 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.000
 where the kitchen and the living room are located 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.720
 we had a very vague idea of what 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.059
 we wanted only we were able to 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.190
 describe our feelings and that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.960
 It was very important to radiate warmth 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.649
 to the house although in summer it is also 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.720
 cool 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.530
 We wanted to feel comfortable to be able to 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.530
 invite our friends 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.820
 with a few splashes of bright colors 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.880
 Carolina Moca marks the accent of the house 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.620
 decorated with beige tones I wanted a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.570
 open kitchen to be able to have your 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.070
 children in sight or to converse with 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.070
 the guests while cooking 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.370
 and 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.080
 until the house was finished 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.900
 many conversations took place 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.990
 with the architect phillip bennett friend 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.960
 of the family in the warm months the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.060
 terrace is the second living room and in 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.890
 winter the radiant floor distributes 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.020
 equally the heat 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.100
 but this type of heating also 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.100
 can cool 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.729
 in summer the soil remains cold something 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.130
 very important in this region when 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.190
 outside temperature is very hot in 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.600
 house is always between 3 and 4 degrees less 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.600
 thanks to the radiant floor 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.479
 when they have like big here 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.200
 windows is very nice to have the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.200
 cool house 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.080
 this hall marks the division between 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.500
 main area and the bedrooms of the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.500
 family 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.900
 we wanted to keep the space separated 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.940
 common and private was very important 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.099
 for us to have a bath next to 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.209
 our room just for my husband and 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:40.090
 for me it's a small luxury but we 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.550
 it's very nice that we want 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.740
 create it 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.550
 the bedrooms are covered in 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.880
 wood the living room and the kitchen 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.880
 stone 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.120
 they are stones from the region that 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.970
 remind the cottages that both 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.300
 it abounds here but we have 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:13.150
 undergoing special treatment more 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.150
 modern to give them a unique touch 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.960
 to the house has 210 meters 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.960
 squares distributed on two floors 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.710
 the ground floor is the realm of children 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.940
 even they have its own exit to 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 yard 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 yes 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.190
 a house with enough corners to 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:51.519
 retire and at the same time open 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:55.180
 and my husband and I have very similar tastes 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.660
 different but we are both happy in 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.510
 this house 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.760
 we feel very comfortable to act 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.730
 managed to combine our different 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.730
 ideas and it was not exactly easy 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.720
 a modern house that is integrated into the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.700
 nature and harmonizes completely with 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.379
 the traditional architecture of the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.379
 provence 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.379
 ah
