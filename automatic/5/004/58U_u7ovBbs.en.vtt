went ahead and just started using nail
polish<00:01:27.180> remover<00:01:27.270> instead<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.229> doing<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
polish remover instead of doing the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.840 
polish remover instead of doing the
peeling<00:01:28.950> off<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.189> you're<00:01:29.310> supposed<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> do

using<00:01:30.509> nail<00:01:30.659> polish<00:01:30.960> remover<00:01:31.020> instead<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
using nail polish remover instead of

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.130 
using nail polish remover instead of
doing<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> pilaf<00:01:32.369> pilaf<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:33.840> no<00:01:33.960> way

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.890 
doing the pilaf pilaf you no way

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
actually works a little bit easier than

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
actually works a little bit easier than
if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> didn't<00:01:37.409> use<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> base<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> still

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
if you didn't use the base but it still

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.160 
if you didn't use the base but it still
was<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> pain<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.689> didn't<00:01:40.049> use

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
was a pain so I kind of like didn't use

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
was a pain so I kind of like didn't use
it<00:01:40.200> again<00:01:40.500> until<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.159> was<00:01:41.400> staring<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it again until I was staring at it and I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.510 
it again until I was staring at it and I
read<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> tag<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> said<00:01:43.590> easily<00:01:44.250> peels

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
read the tag and it said easily peels

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.179 
read the tag and it said easily peels
off<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.299> oh<00:01:45.799> well<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:46.979> nice

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
off and I was like oh well that's nice

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.149 
off and I was like oh well that's nice
to<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.720> tried<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.229> again<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
to know so I tried it again and it's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
to know so I tried it again and it's
funny<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.990> looks

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
funny because the this is what it looks

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660 
funny because the this is what it looks
like<00:01:52.290> did<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.619> mention<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.490> looks

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
like did I mention that this if it looks

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
like did I mention that this if it looks
like<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.390> smell<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.259> smells<00:01:55.409> like

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
like the smell of it it smells like

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.880 
like the smell of it it smells like
Elmer's<00:01:56.009> glue<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:57.570> smells<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.140> smells<00:01:58.170> exactly

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
Elmer's glue it smells it smells exactly

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.230 
Elmer's glue it smells it smells exactly
like<00:01:58.920> Elmer's<00:01:59.369> glue<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.759> it's<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.000> thicker

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
like Elmer's glue and it's a thicker

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
like Elmer's glue and it's a thicker
white<00:02:00.570> consistency<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
white consistency so what you do is you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.010 
white consistency so what you do is you
put<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.790> your<00:02:02.909> nails<00:02:03.149> first<00:02:03.540> instead<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
put it on your nails first instead of

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
put it on your nails first instead of
using<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> base<00:02:04.710> coat<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.490> usually

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
using like a base coat like I usually

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.730 
using like a base coat like I usually
would<00:02:05.909> use<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> sesh<00:02:06.329> feet<00:02:06.600> base<00:02:06.780> coat<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.560> put

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
would use a sesh feet base coat you put

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.990 
would use a sesh feet base coat you put
it<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.890> your<00:02:08.009> nails<00:02:08.220> first<00:02:08.399> instead<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.819> your

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it on your nails first instead of your

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
it on your nails first instead of your
base<00:02:09.149> coat<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.629> then<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.229> put<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.860> did

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
base coat and then you put it on I did

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.940 
base coat and then you put it on I did
mine<00:02:11.459> pretty<00:02:11.730> thick<00:02:12.060> not<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.540> soup

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.710 
mine pretty thick not like soup
thick<00:02:13.190> but<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.849> know<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:13.970> made<00:02:14.180> sure<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.569> it

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
thick but I you know I made sure that it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.479 
thick but I you know I made sure that it
with<00:02:14.840> my<00:02:14.959> whole<00:02:15.140> nail<00:02:15.319> was<00:02:15.500> white<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:15.950> then<00:02:16.370> it

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
with my whole nail was white and then it

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.490 
with my whole nail was white and then it
dries<00:02:16.760> clear<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.780> want<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:17.989> make<00:02:18.110> sure<00:02:18.140> that

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
dries clear you want to make sure that

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.320 
dries clear you want to make sure that
it<00:02:18.590> completely<00:02:19.069> dries<00:02:19.489> before<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.060> put<00:02:20.239> your

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
it completely dries before you put your

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.210 
it completely dries before you put your
next<00:02:20.599> layer<00:02:20.780> on<00:02:21.019> else<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.440> doesn't<00:02:21.620> work<00:02:21.890> well

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
next layer on else it doesn't work well

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.369 
next layer on else it doesn't work well
and<00:02:22.459> then<00:02:22.790> i<00:02:22.819> would<00:02:23.180> say<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.690> i've<00:02:23.930> had<00:02:24.200> this

off I don't know if you can see that
very<00:02:43.519> well<00:02:43.670> um<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.870> literally<00:02:45.260> do<00:02:45.560> is

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
very well um so all you literally do is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.250 
very well um so all you literally do is
you<00:02:46.130> take<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:46.760> base<00:02:47.180> coat<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.870> then<00:02:48.140> you

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
you take this base coat and then you

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.500 
you take this base coat and then you
just<00:02:48.470> start<00:02:48.680> or<00:02:48.980> your<00:02:49.370> take<00:02:49.849> your<00:02:50.000> nail<00:02:50.209> and

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
and then it literally just peels off

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.960 
and then it literally just peels off
like<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:01.130> know<00:03:01.220> some<00:03:01.610> people<00:03:01.640> are

damaging your nails I wouldn't suggest
using<00:04:46.750> this<00:04:46.960> unless<00:04:47.260> you're<00:04:47.440> literally<00:04:47.860> just

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
using this unless you're literally just

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.800 
using this unless you're literally just
using<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.490> for<00:04:48.640> glitter<00:04:48.820> nail<00:04:49.030> polish<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:49.600> mean

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
using it for glitter nail polish I mean

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.270 
using it for glitter nail polish I mean
I<00:04:49.840> think<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.380> nail<00:04:50.530> polish<00:04:50.830> itself<00:04:50.980> is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
I think that nail polish itself is

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.560 
I think that nail polish itself is
really<00:04:51.370> easy<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.790> get<00:04:51.880> off<00:04:52.030> if<00:04:52.270> it's<00:04:52.420> just

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
really easy to get off if it's just

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.020 
really easy to get off if it's just
normal<00:04:52.810> nail<00:04:53.080> polish<00:04:53.440> because<00:04:54.430> I<00:04:54.460> do<00:04:54.610> think

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
basically like a protective coat that

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.410 
basically like a protective coat that
goes<00:05:02.260> on<00:05:02.440> first<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.130> thicker<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.150> put<00:05:04.330> it

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.120

peel<00:05:06.730> off<00:05:06.910> after<00:05:07.690> but<00:05:08.320> at<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.500> same<00:05:08.710> time<00:05:08.920> if

amazon has all the OPI nail polishes but
it's<00:06:48.949> totally<00:06:49.250> worth<00:06:49.490> the<00:06:49.879> price<00:06:50.270> I'm<00:06:50.629> not

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.089 
it's totally worth the price I'm not
sure<00:06:50.900> how<00:06:51.259> much<00:06:51.379> I<00:06:51.530> paid<00:06:51.710> for<00:06:51.740> it<00:06:51.979> because
