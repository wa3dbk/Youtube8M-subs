apparently it's not that popular maybe

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.840 
apparently it's not that popular maybe
it's<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> color<00:02:08.819> scheme<00:02:09.410> which<00:02:10.410> I

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's because of the color scheme which I

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.820 
it's because of the color scheme which I

it<00:02:53.550> again<00:02:53.720> typical<00:02:54.720> Baba<00:02:54.959> birds<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
it again typical Baba birds in the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.170 
it again typical Baba birds in the
background<00:02:56.600> which<00:02:57.600> i<00:02:57.690> think<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.959> pretty<00:02:58.079> cool

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
background which i think is pretty cool

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.550 
background which i think is pretty cool
this<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.360> close-up<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.019> display<00:03:01.380> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
this is a close-up of the display and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.780 
this is a close-up of the display and
the<00:03:02.450> only<00:03:03.450> thing<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.190> think<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.489> they

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the only thing that I think that they

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.610 
the only thing that I think that they
could<00:03:05.850> have<00:03:05.970> done<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.269> bit<00:03:06.540> more<00:03:06.750> on<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.170> design

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
could have done a bit more on the design

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.039 
could have done a bit more on the design
of<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.829> watch<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.340> display<00:03:08.820> it's<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:09.930> a

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
of the watch is the display it's just a

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.420 
of the watch is the display it's just a
generic<00:03:10.970> grey<00:03:11.970> or<00:03:12.780> whatever<00:03:13.560> color<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.160> you

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
generic grey or whatever color it is you

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.289 
generic grey or whatever color it is you
know<00:03:14.519> LCD<00:03:15.269> color<00:03:15.540> background<00:03:17.120> they<00:03:18.120> could

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
know LCD color background they could

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.569 
know LCD color background they could
have<00:03:18.390> inverted<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.079> for<00:03:19.860> example<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.400> make

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
have inverted it for example to make

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.900 
have inverted it for example to make
that<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.510> letter<00:03:21.750> silver<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.620> background

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
that the letter silver and a background

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.210 
that the letter silver and a background
blank<00:03:23.910> or<00:03:24.269> something<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.290> think<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.010> just<00:03:26.070> a

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
blank or something I think it's just a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.900 
blank or something I think it's just a
bit<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.700> bit<00:03:27.480> boring<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.380> noise<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
bit a bit boring you have the noise the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.840 
bit a bit boring you have the noise the
noise<00:03:29.940> flashy<00:03:30.540> colors<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.200> uh<00:03:31.400> on<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> outset

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
noise flashy colors and uh on the outset

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.050 
noise flashy colors and uh on the outset
and<00:03:32.880> then<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.269> have<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.739> gray<00:03:34.850> LCD<00:03:35.850> color

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
and then you have this gray LCD color

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.020 
and then you have this gray LCD color
background<00:03:36.900> which<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.340> yeah<00:03:38.340> they<00:03:38.790> could<00:03:38.940> have
