let me introduce the control to you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.980 
let me introduce the control to you
basically<00:00:22.680> we've<00:00:23.670> made<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> unit<00:00:24.300> extremely

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
basically we've made the unit extremely

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.870 
basically we've made the unit extremely
easy<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.320> operate<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.859> any<00:00:26.099> skill<00:00:26.519> level<00:00:26.550> can

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880

here<00:00:30.390> pretty<00:00:30.810> simple<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.439> digital<00:00:32.219> readout

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
here pretty simple a digital readout

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.750 
here pretty simple a digital readout
okay<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> central<00:00:34.860> dial<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
okay and then the central dial so if I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.610 
okay and then the central dial so if I
want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> set<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> temperature<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:37.590> now

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
want to set the temperature right now

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.530 
want to set the temperature right now
it's<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.010> 450<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.420> adjustment

and<00:01:40.590> texture<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> dough<00:01:41.880> before<00:01:42.150> we

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and texture on the dough before we

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
and texture on the dough before we
continue<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> bake<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.860> next<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.670> a

specifically with breads to get that
humidity<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.820> cavity<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> need

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
humidity out of the cavity when you need

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.139 
humidity out of the cavity when you need
to<00:01:51.840> now<00:01:52.590> when<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.890> hit<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.220> vent<00:01:53.399> button<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
to now when we hit the vent button it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.709 
to now when we hit the vent button it
takes<00:01:54.329> about<00:01:54.540> 30<00:01:54.990> seconds<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> open<00:01:56.009> up<00:01:56.159> and

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
takes about 30 seconds to open up and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.300 
takes about 30 seconds to open up and
then<00:01:57.719> we'll<00:01:58.110> start<00:01:58.350> venting<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.040> case

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
then we'll start venting in this case

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
then we'll start venting in this case
we're<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.790> venting<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.270> about<00:02:00.450> six

minutes or more and that will make an

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660 
minutes or more and that will make an
adjustment<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.770> manual<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.399> then

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
adjustment because it's manual and then

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
so we can make adjustments for the size

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.009 
so we can make adjustments for the size
of<00:03:43.430> different<00:03:43.819> types<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.269> loaves<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.810> bread

happening is the fan delay is coming

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.629 
happening is the fan delay is coming
into<00:04:05.599> place<00:04:05.870> then<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.590> slows<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.099> fan<00:04:07.459> down

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
into place then that slows the fan down

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.580 
into place then that slows the fan down
