00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.800
 my mother that does not need to be a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.350
 special date I removed an excuse but 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.460
 making the most of this day we are going to 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 remind our mom that the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.840
 we want a lot with a simple detail not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.700
 you need to do here and well then the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.070
 sign that I have done to my mother for 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.080
 for Mother's Day to see if it 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.300
 happens to you some idea with what 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.770
 that I am and you already know that I am very 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.110
 simple very simple I against a 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.570
 super super person like that and then this 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.940
 It will be something for home super super 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.530
 casual without lending some decoration 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.030
 something for her to have so she knows 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 that me and all my brothers 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.480
 we remember her and well I hope that you 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.470
 like 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.470
 I leave you with the video 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.600
 this vase with flowers like that a little 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.880
 we need a vase cited that 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.500
 I bought it in a bazaar some straws 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.410
 in this case I used green 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.810
 thread scissors also green for 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.630
 that will not highlight much a gillette for 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.450
 to be able to sew red pinocchio paper and 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.550
 Well, telitas, I picked up reddish colors 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.500
 with golden squares because the red one 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.280
 favorite color first thing we're going to 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.920
 to do is roll up the eastern tip of 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.500
 the cloth around the straw and we're going to 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.560
 hold well with a few stitches of thread 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.870
 then you just have to double the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.350
 fabric to the reverse side and follow 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.239
 spinning it over again and so on 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.769
 until you think the rose because this 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.209
 is what is going to be a rose be it 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.190
 size so that more or less to you 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.530
 like it so sometimes you want 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.989
 necessary and sometimes once again 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.550
 you have finished this then give it another 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.530
 Stitch so that everything is secure and 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.030
 do not disassemble easily you have to 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.280
 do the same with all the others 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.480
 you can open a little and in the end then 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.790
 cut what's left of cloth 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.560
 once this is done, we cut 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.989
 also the green straw so that either 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.360
 excel and look like a frequency 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.370
 a little strange and we cut the thread and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.980
 we have it ready this will be our 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.420
 flower happy now we go with the paper 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.970
 pinocho for pinocho paper 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.069
 I just cut a square of 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.769
 Pinocchio paper and bent into four 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.750
 parts in equal parts again in 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.760
 four and again then I put a 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.410
 straw in the middle and I have fastened everything 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.810
 Well with it and I have taken it well 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.769
 well fine and just shaped me with 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.329
 hands 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.090
 this does not look much like a breeze either 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.799
 but it looks great now we go with another 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.510
 list type although this is like curly 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.019
 you have to go around the whole 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.150
 straw following the center of the straw 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.400
 and sew it super super well so that it does not 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.140
 Dismantle and do not move anything once 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.049
 I have chosen it very very short is 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.209
 the green and ready and we have another rose and 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.829
 this is more of the same now we're going with 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.510
 the golden this is a little harder 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.650
 to manage, you have to do what 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.690
 it the same as we have done with the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.060
 first therefore equal with being everything very 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.790
 well cut it green 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.980
 and ready once I had all the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.900
 roses, what I did was cut the 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.910
 straws of different sizes so that 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.160
 all were equal, some of them lower 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.600
 higher you already know and cut a little 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.760
 little by little for him, they all remained more or 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.400
 less frayed and from equalized 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.740
 that I found something more beautiful 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.510
 I put all of them in the vase and 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.460
 I think it's a detail that is going to 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.590
 like a lot a lot a lot 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.180
 besides this you can make them from your 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.560
 favorite pictures I chose red because 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.180
 in its color but you can choose the 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.650
 color that you want since they are not 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.350
 flowers that you have to water and as only 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.580
 they need cool because it serves then I took 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.700
 a game I did a kind of 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.470
 parchment that I put we love you mom and of 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.000
 part of all my brothers and all that 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.740
 phrases like is the best mother in the world 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.510
 between those things and you can put everything 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.820
 how corny you want and then the 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.430
 roll up so it stays like that a little more 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.889
 idea of ​​parchment and I put what 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.960
 there was tape around and a little bow 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.090
 very nice and just from Korea a bit to 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.169
 to resolve to stay entirely accurate 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.169
 and ready 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.930
 i 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.490
 good love this has been all for the 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.130
 Today's video I hope you liked it 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.930
 what do you do if you want to learn a 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.240
 little bit to your mom and give her some 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.070
 surprise for the mother's day that 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.260
 You say grow when I love you 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.850

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.730
 little things of this you can pass me some 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.760

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.790
 lots of things anyway 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.640
 I have all down in the little box 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.220

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.950
 an eye and well I just hope you spend a 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.350
 happy mother's day with your mom

 very strong
