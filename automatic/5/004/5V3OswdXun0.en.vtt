 So much for you to do, but only for 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.350
 of having been made by a child 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.980
 It's pretty much the idea, it's pretty cool. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.120
 according to she was reading a story 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.809
 and about a boy who also 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.300
 was 14 years old and lived the game and billions 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.730
 of downloads then she got the idea there 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.020
 two years ago he began to study 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.969

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.990
 100 million people per day or more 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.560
 whether 100 million players are playing 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.220
 mobile and tablet games and mobile 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.070
 tablet does not look like Nintendo is 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 have vicious on this part and I believe 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.060
 who will make good money and how 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.240
 said a bug yesterday she is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.829
 needing since I do not understand the u 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.320
 was practically a failure sold 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.720
 less than the gamecube which was one of the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.090
 nintendo's failures at last we'll see 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.939
 how is going to be the result of nintendo 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 in this area remembering that he announced the game 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.579
 for that year it will be released 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.219
 a game 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.990
 this year the idea I understand for 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.549
 smartphones and tablets with this was the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.829
 I am already here a great deal 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.829
 hug and even the next technician to 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:19.859
 if you are an insult b and are looking for 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.620
 by a network that helps your channel to 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.819
 grow and also have good support 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.010
 I'll introduce you to the network. 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.889
 is a network that I believe and is 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.930
 I trust and the network offers 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:37.230
 benefits mainly to those who are 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.510
 beginning and does not understand much of this 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.989
 network business it offers a 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.450
 minimum payment of $ 1 or is your 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.959
 car yields at least $ 1 per month 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.239
 You get that money something else. 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.180
 network has a temporary contract of 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.489

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.919
 for three months if you do not like it 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.629
 just ask them they cancel 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.840
 your contract in case you want 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:07.109
 continue your contract is only one 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.669
 year and finally the ox thing that I think 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.620
 more interesting 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:13.139

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.970
