00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
modesty this chapter I think has made

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.540 
modesty this chapter I think has made
women<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.760> makes<00:02:42.390> me<00:02:42.600> feel<00:02:42.840> sometimes

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
women and makes me feel sometimes

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.920 
women and makes me feel sometimes
marginalized<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.210> actually<00:02:45.360> clashes

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
marginalized and it actually clashes

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.990 
marginalized and it actually clashes
with<00:02:46.230> other<00:02:46.590> parts<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.190> New<00:02:47.340> Testament<00:02:47.370> in

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
with other parts of the New Testament in

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.190 
with other parts of the New Testament in
that<00:02:48.300> which<00:02:48.720> are<00:02:48.900> far<00:02:49.110> more<00:02:49.280> open<00:02:50.280> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
that which are far more open to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.020 
that which are far more open to
everybody<00:02:52.200> come<00:02:52.560> together<00:02:52.770> as<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.340> this

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
everybody come together as one this

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.760 
everybody come together as one this
teaching<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.540> particularly<00:02:54.960> hard<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.560> swallow

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
teaching is particularly hard to swallow

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.280 
teaching is particularly hard to swallow
because<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.580> in<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.940> New<00:02:57.060> Testament<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.810> we

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
because it's in the New Testament if we

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.970 
because it's in the New Testament if we
had<00:02:58.500> sexist<00:02:59.460> teaching<00:02:59.820> in<00:02:59.910> the<00:02:59.970> Old<00:03:00.120> Testament

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
had sexist teaching in the Old Testament

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.500 
had sexist teaching in the Old Testament
maybe<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.190> easier<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.640> say<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.030> it's

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
maybe it's easier to say that it's

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.160 
maybe it's easier to say that it's
outdated<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.380> it's<00:03:05.480> kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.540> new<00:03:06.930> things

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
outdated and it's kind of new things

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.140 
outdated and it's kind of new things
have<00:03:07.290> happened<00:03:07.440> since<00:03:07.830> then<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:09.030> we

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
have happened since then but because we

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.840 
have happened since then but because we
find<00:03:09.510> even<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.470> New<00:03:10.650> Testament<00:03:10.850> attention

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
find even in the New Testament attention

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.620 
find even in the New Testament attention
over<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.900> place<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.260> women<00:03:13.380> in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> church

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
over the place of women in the church

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.330 
over the place of women in the church
that<00:03:15.630> has<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.470> think<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.490> Christians<00:03:19.340> maybe

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
that has I think for Christians maybe

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.160 
that has I think for Christians maybe
more<00:03:20.640> authority<00:03:21.180> because<00:03:21.600> they<00:03:21.750> don't<00:03:21.959> read

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
more authority because they don't read

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.720 
more authority because they don't read
the<00:03:22.350> Old<00:03:22.620> Testament<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.190> same<00:03:23.400> way<00:03:23.520> as<00:03:23.580> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
the Old Testament in the same way as the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.610 
the Old Testament in the same way as the
New<00:03:23.850> Testament<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:24.930> when<00:03:25.110> Paul<00:03:25.320> wrote<00:03:25.560> this

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
New Testament so when Paul wrote this

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.740 
New Testament so when Paul wrote this
letter<00:03:25.890> he<00:03:26.310> wrote<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.700> Greek<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.180> he<00:03:27.600> will

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
letter he wrote in Greek and he will

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.600 
letter he wrote in Greek and he will
probably<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.200> had<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.560> scribe<00:03:28.920> writing<00:03:29.220> for

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
probably have had a scribe writing for

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.790 
probably have had a scribe writing for
him<00:03:29.790> letter<00:03:30.390> writing<00:03:30.690> then<00:03:30.989> wasn't<00:03:31.500> quite

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
him letter writing then wasn't quite

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.340 
him letter writing then wasn't quite
like<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.310> today<00:03:32.570> where<00:03:33.570> we<00:03:33.690> privately<00:03:34.140> take
