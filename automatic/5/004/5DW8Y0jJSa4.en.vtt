00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.500
 this talus people and we end up with 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.050
 a course and we will see for a new 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.640
 video about the new money mode in 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.860
 to do too much then the new mode that is 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.930
 names chaos and can be discovered in 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.589
 the number 3 batman also called chaos 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.120
 only for the moment for the 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.040
 xbox players so it was available 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 for premium players from 7 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.610
 inches so we need the vence as 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.829
 usually then it is available in 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.510
 download or pack with a 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.500
 new multiplayer mode new modes 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.839
 of play and new special operation 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.689
 for 1200 microsoft points so a month 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.299
 two months of exclusivity so microsoft 

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:04.610
 who bought the exclusivity we know 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.229
 left vision in the contract so this 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.430
 game mode what is it so I 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.740
 am a little explained even if they confess 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.299
 already a lot of videos on the internet so 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.140
 it's okay to still the 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.759
 mine we are in a fashion sport 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.159
 survival boyer so we're dropped on the 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.140
 map and NPC characters are enemies 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.240
 no players are not not confronting 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.679
 someone in front it is with me I 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.479
 cooperation with the capital bell have 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.969
 always available to two and we will 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.109
 having to kill all that is no 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.509
 of scor limit makes it the only 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.759
 limit is time and our customers and 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.679
 you explain so you see android 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.729
 have had time starts at two 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.999
 minutes at the beginning of the game then who 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.149
 goes down to get to zero it takes 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.200
 to reach 0 2 possibilities either we 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.909
 we have our standing bar what's 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.159
 located in the middle of glass that falls to 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.780
 zero in this case the game is over but 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.240
 as long as we have the boot bar that 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.159
 is 100% filled by his gold instructions 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.670
 the boost bar will tell me how 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.709
 fill it out 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.280
 in fact it's simple every time 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.960
 we do one who 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.610
 that we recover a young plate that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560
 the fall of the 1000 km hour that 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.690
 get a weapon or pack the bar 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.819
 goes up to 0 I could see I'm recovering 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.470
 the yellow plates that allow me 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.459
 to have the multipliers remonstrated 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.200
 multiplier that's what's in 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.640
 below the booth bar and we see 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.230
 that the more I recover the score than 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.800
 I do to every enemy killed increases 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.300
 so there it is at 20 kg 1650 so where 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.800
 the importance actually for a big score 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.300
 to recover the young plates for 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.910
 make bigger multipliers 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.080
 possible so without it we will not do 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.910
 in quotation marks big thing because 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.140
 the goal is obviously to arrive at 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.120
 big multiplier to have big 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.890
 scores so big-scoring fans are going 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.540
 to be happy not big scores of 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.290
 scor hunters who like to see 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.920
 game demos like concept pleases the the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.580
 zombie on black ops we were in 3d view 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.260
 isometric 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.940
 it was something we could 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.470
 could we have a big 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.860
 score finally look to make big 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.060
 scores already the ugly omby and the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.080
 sleeves on wii allowed us that but 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.519
 I really think it's going to be 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.100
 something hyper interesting for 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.450
 people who are fierce so 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.760
 about the pages talked about it so 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.130
 we have the parcels in we can have 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.630
 frost turrets so block assets 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.280
 the button bar a few seconds this 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.870
 who we are we will not be stressed 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.910
 by that we can have 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.739
 multipliers so exceeds them by 10x 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.120
 so these ten multiplier can be 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.549
 have points so we see the five 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.049
 case we can also occupy barouds 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.269
 of honor you see above the 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.540
 shield and my name dates or baroud 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.950
 honor 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.400
 once you're dead for the most 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.810
 young age we kill an enemy finally 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.640
 here we are I see soldiers and we 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.780
 back to life so fashion and the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.110
 passion we start with 3 lorraine and 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.640
 both the assets adot down on 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.150
 do not have this because we have at the very beginning 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.530
 portion 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.200
 good trigger extreme conditions 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.720
 tracker visit solid and then we have a 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.939
 asset that allows us to originate more 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.500
 quickly note didier was often hurt 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.120
 yet start a little bit puts it 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.980
 at the shelter and so here I am dead 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.049
 no I'm dead I'm hurt I 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.519
 I leave yours and half are seen 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.370
 weapons that are actually available on 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.569
 all the map so you have to know that we have 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.760
 the same ones that come back in the mode 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.400
 survival it again we'll often see p 90 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.620
 p 90 crl 86 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.430
 see the weapons the striker also the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.920
 Japanese 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.379
 the mp 7 and we will drive choose the armed 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.940
 with which we will kill the enemies 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.289
 however we could not yesterday so what 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.970
 force us to change milk 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.760
 of weapons so there is also the bnf she 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.620
 is perfectible time and it is better 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.979
 in this kind of mode to recover the 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.630
 n86 or so there peace great 90 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.849
 chargers which offers a large number 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.169
 of balls however on this map the aele 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.669
 case on a site and on the bridge in 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.010
 dom water so that's something that 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.240
 would be a little dangerous to perform this 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.740
 that they gave you that there would be when 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.840
 even a big risk I get 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.729
 shoot so there you see judged the times 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.990
 evans in secondary so I kill that your 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.539
 friends to raise the boost bar 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.009
 before recovering the sixty sixties 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.499
 multiplier still not bad 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.379
 we also have mild and c4 number 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:59.099
 5 early in the game that we can 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:01.050
 may have heard other monsters 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.830
 so friends ask clemency it takes 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.360
 be careful as in the mode 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.770
 survival but hey it's not hyper 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.099
 dangerous unless we're actually red 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.149
 and we can see I recovered an impact 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.559
 in parcels 60 seconds so this allows 

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:16.409
 to have less stress is possible 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:18.740
 even in the event that our jo 2014 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.080
 finally other inhibitors fall back to 0 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.159
 0 we would still have 60 seconds will have 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.129
 we would not say we do not have 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.689
 directly finished at party after not 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.610
 you hide that if you have your 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.740
 multiplier that drops to zero 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.439
 the party does not have much interest in 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.460
 effect because that's what will you 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.520
 allow to make big scores so 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.289
 there again and had to see our 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.779
 budget to kill an enemy because our 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.309
 boost gauge to Irish and have the 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:45.719
 bigger difficulty actually in my opinion 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.830
 we have a lot of games 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.509
 locals could see that this clashe 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.889
 recovers from bars or because I 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:53.669
 had more the party was going to end 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:56.099
 6e fall in barousse so we tried 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.209
 dive lasted lightening recovers the 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.490
 scorpions I said it was not 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:00.779
 a super huh but I was obliged 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.149
 in fact in the heat of the action of the 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.930
 recharge it to the room and took 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:06.930
 other guys who have me so my 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.759
 teammate there who is down I try 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.089
 to make sure that there is a 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:14.279
 little sahin the balance a simple soldier if 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:17.039
 the soldiers simple soldiers who in 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:18.629
 armor which are it takes more balls 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.779
 to kill them and again the 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:23.069
 soldiers behemoth too I do not know 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.330
 this summer specified but if we recover a 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.849
 weapon that's it up the bar of 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.110
 boost and quest works very well 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.700
 so that's what allows us in general 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.140
 to find easily 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.640
 stumbling on the punishment but you 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.110
 see that's what I like in the 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.820
 part there is always friends 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.810
 everywhere and we'll see the part of 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.850
 is coming to an end because we have not 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.050
 managed to crawl to the boost bar and 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.460
 had been six minutes of play 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.750
 and yet the action you saw was 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.870
 really and years and I had the impression 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.730
 of lasted about fifteen minutes so 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.190
 we see my ranking there a little 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.020
 honest ranking without more than twenty 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.590
 thousandth so I hope that's going to please 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.420
 to everybody 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.420
 do not hesitate to check the mrc channel
