00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 what's up, stay, I'm wing haven and you 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.930
 I bring my first video of 2013 so 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.970
 first of all wish you a happy year to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.170
 all and as you can see in the title is a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.690
 new friday council I think it's the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.790
 number 10 and I do not know how many so good 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 the chords of the first of all that 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.240
 taught how to throw the grenades that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.430
 they were always pumped and so on 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.560
 just drop you're in and kill the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.050
 enemy I bring you a small tactic 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
 advanced of that video that basically 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.140
 will serve for two things the first of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.140
 all will serve to kill the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.930
 snipers that climb the rooftops 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.300
 loved by all of us so not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.410
 let's put in situation as always here 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 we see that the rebel lord is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 Riding a roof as it always does 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 unfortunately and then the problem 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.530
 that I always have is to calculate the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.200
 grenades so close to me 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.910
 usually it's pretty bad since I'm staying 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.469
 short or long passed me because 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 let's imagine that we are here we say 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.530
 well I think that one more grenade or 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.300
 less here we can more or less kill 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.609
 and we eat like what he does 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.390
 it's basically falling on about our 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.129
 head and in this case he would have killed us 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.680
 and then the little tactic that I want 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.300
 show you 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.190
 what you have to do for example if 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.590
 we want to trolle between quotes or kill 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.490
 to the sniper is what campeando 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.710
 what you have to do is get ahead 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.900
 do a couple of steps for example bone 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.820
 not stay stuck because if we would touch 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.260
 against the wall but if you do not put a little 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.270
 more forward and what we do 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.770
 basically we turn around and 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.260
 we aim the maximum that the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.030
 game we aim at the sky and the only thing that 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.250
 we have to do is give it where the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.229
 granada and how is the pomegranate itself 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.740
 already deals with the pse backwards alone and 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.500
 easily be able to kill the enemy 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.320
 As you can see, it's quite simple and it's something 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.330
 that never never never fails no longer as 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.530
 that if you have to do it like that to me 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.420
 it happens a lot that it usually does 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.360
 pretty bad and I usually stay short 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.250
 it passed by so I repeat it so that 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.869
 you see it and well basically now what 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.290
 I do fast so he gives me back you point to 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.540
 sky and leave the pomegranate and the claw 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.040
 beats the natural movement of if you aim 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.860
 to the sky to go a little further back 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.899
 so it's the easiest thing to be able to kill 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.149
 to the enemies and never make mistakes 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.950
 arrives without having another situation in the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.080
 which will also be or will not be a little 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 Useful 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 hello hello good now as you see we are 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.310
 In a big bazaar, I will explain a 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.750
 situation that usually happens to me 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.340
 quite especially in the world 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.230
 competitive and that is that basically 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.360
 we want to attack attack see we are in 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.040
 this little room and where it gets 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.750
 many enemies is where you go to the Lord 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.640
 the lord is really put here 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.200
 waiting for someone to come out so much 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.930
 here as up here to be able 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.720
 to be able to kill them and cover the area 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.180
 see and then we will use the same tactic 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.769
 that before will not work for us 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.360
 kill a sniper this we 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.100
 will serve to kill the Lord reverte another 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.799
 time since good since if we throw a 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.870
 grenade to the wall will basically give you 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.299
 time to see her and give her time to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.610
 cover here behind and obviously the 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.080
 Granada and we will not kill what 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.510
 we want is that it is to kill him so 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 well we do the same as before 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.599
 we put here 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.700
 we aim at the sky we give ourselves half 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.560
 and we throw it away and we do not 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.540
 we need to discover or anything of the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.010
 grenade that there is by itself and as you see 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.769
 we have managed to kill Mr. Rever from 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.299
 a pretty pretty simple way and 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.860
 us although we have taken away a 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.480
 little of life if we do it a bit a 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.250
 little farther I guess because in plan 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.349
 something like that for example maybe we do not 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.720
 we take away we take nothing away if we 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.370
 we cover and we cover ourselves well now as 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.040
 we have taken off quite a lot 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.890
 less than good life and I have just this 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.260
 explain on this map is extrapolated 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.389
 enough to all the maps or situations 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.639
 I remember the other day that he says in the 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.440
 streaming when crossing the senamhi and by 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.659
 that came to me the joy of doing the old 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.310
 advice so nothing is here on 10 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.500
 today's advice I hope you have 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.950
 liked and before closing the video that 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.379
 tell you two things the first 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.709
 I'm sorry I did not upload many videos 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:55.680
 this month two months and a half month and that is 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.569
 good between the end of the year Christmas holidays 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.120
 and between that I went to Sweden a couple of 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.489
 sometimes the truth that I have not had I have not 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.139

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.730
