00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 let's paste now yes it's hot 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.270
 our gun here we are going to put a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.270
 little bit of silicone 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.270
 we stick 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 we cut our surplus 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.710
 and that is what we are going to do now 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 let's hit the little body 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.040
 the antenitas 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.949
 to the rooms but that we are going to add here 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:40.040
 I for example if I wanted to hang this 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:43.190
 I'm going to add a butterfly 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.500
 a cord cited come let's add here 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.650
 a cord cited so that later the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.370
 they can paste then let's put a 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.219
 little bit of silicone on these sides 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.129
 let's put on one side of another 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.129
 side and we're going to take it back 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.750
 here we are going to add a little more 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.490
 we do this so you do not see 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.490
 we pull the back 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.420
 come 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.310
 I did not know about the back of soy 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.770
 we could have also put it before 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.940
 of twisting it and grabbing it too 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:30.140
 when we put this little bit of 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.990
 of tulle then there is already the appointment 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.670
 so that the cole more and now what are we going 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.090
 do let's present first as 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.120
 I want the little body to go 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.220
 there it is then let's put on let's 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.650
 paste back first 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.490
 d 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.490
 the antenita 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300
 there 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.830
 now the antenna is 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.130
 let's see where we would go here 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.250
 always measuring first we present 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.620
 always the doll before hitting it for 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.870
 see where we have to put the silicone 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.050
 as it would be so that later we do not 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.830
 do not see each other with little surprises 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:26.670
 So here it is and in the little head 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.050
 and the little body is going to be stuck there too 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.920
 so I can not do a stitch 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.069
 paste with this silicone the little body 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.530
 let's try that the eastern part 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.349
 of the seam that gives to the side a 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.280
 little pulling back so you do not 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.280
 note 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.550
 let's put silicone up on the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.170
 top part that will go 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.170
 supported on the face 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.280
 the face was going to go a little here too 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.580
 back where would I go 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.090
 is also holding the wing and there 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.640
 wait a little bit and here if I want it 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.110
 I can turn to the side 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.930
 a little bit of silicone on the side and 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.209
 double one of two or silicone that is more 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.090
 fast but they have to have a good 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.650
 short time there or you can also put you 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.560
 make a stitch with this with a 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.290
 thread another option that can also 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.640
 use is you put a wire quoted by 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.340
 and in this way to give that to 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.470
 wire that will make the tips the 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.630
 they're going to make a little chulito in the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.640
 tips to the style of the first its ready that 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:56.920
 we made here and if you want you can 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:04:00.130
 line with this with you know what it's called 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.130
 with wadding will reinforce with robe then 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.170
 do not notice the wire well there is that 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.110
 part and we will give you a small 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.470
 nice detail putting some 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.470
 little flowers 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:18.540
 so that you are more beautiful you are this 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.100
 and more beautiful 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.970
 these antennas 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.790
 with little things we can achieve the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.910
 difference 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.120
 want 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:37.260
 is what they want to add and adds 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.320
 it's very simple details are milestones and there 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.780
 we have 'look at our butterflies very 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.540
 it spring already know that here you 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.020
 you can add this drawing if you 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.020
 they want 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.650
 and well and look back it was very 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.680
 They also come and know that the 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.130
 details that make the difference 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.400
 with his this little dolls in this 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.420
 example I did dots in the 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.910
 white eyes says good here is not 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.120
 note a lot but dots also in the 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.460
 cheeks and good and I gave him color this 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.180
 He made some drawings here, like you 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.490
 can see are two options is it 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.419
 They like the antennas a lot and you know what 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.490
 can do to hang or not yes I hope 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.980
 that they have understood this any 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.810
 doubt write me 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.160
 and they send me photos of what they are doing 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.310
 so I can correct them 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.410
 see you in another and any other 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.630
 any of my other projects girls 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.630
 I hope you like it and learn a lot
