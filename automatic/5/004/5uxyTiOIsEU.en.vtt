00:00:20.297 --> 00:00:23.262
 Patch 2.3.0 - Kanai's Cube 

00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:29.985
 At the beginning of their history, the Horadrim hunted for the Three. 

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:34.495
 They realized that they needed a powerful artifact. 

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:37.667
 That's why they made this cube, 

00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:42.401
 which had really dangerous potential. 

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:45.795
 They use it for a while, 

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:49.055
 but they were aware of the corruption that emanated from him. 

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:53.987
 So they took the cube and handed it over 

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:57.191
 to a secret order of the barbarians. 

00:00:57.342 --> 00:00:59.565
 The barbarians guarded the cube for many years 

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.456
 until the fall of Sescheron, 

00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:05.279
 in which a barbarian leader named Kanai was killed. 

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:09.646
 Kanai was, as it turned out, the last guardian of this cube. 

00:01:09.797 --> 00:01:16.089
 In the world of Diablo III he was therefore called Kanais cube. 

00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:23.949
 When he should be hiding, an old Horadrim voted against it. 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.600
 That was Zoltun Kull. 

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.149
 In the game he appears and tells the player 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.886
 that there was once an ancient cube hidden in front of him, 

00:01:34.037 --> 00:01:37.173
 because he was too powerful. He would have to be found here somewhere. 

00:01:37.324 --> 00:01:40.317
 Go to this place and you will find it. 

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:47.640
 One of the most useful of the many aspects of the cube is: 

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:52.342
 It allows you to extract the characteristics of legendary objects 

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:54.774
 and add to a collection. 

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:56.566
 Once you have extracted the property, 

00:01:56.717 --> 00:02:00.860
 You can activate a number of these properties 

00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:04.227
 and thus strengthen your character without using the object itself. 

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:06.812
 So, if you want to use your Ring of the Royal Prunks, 

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:10.283
 but your ring places are already occupied, you can do that now. 

00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:14.899
 Multiple quiver properties for your Demon Hunter? No problem! 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.902
 We already have some really cool features for the cube 

00:02:18.053 --> 00:02:20.625
 and I look forward to adding more over time, 

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:25.420
 as soon as the players could try it out and come up with new ideas for it. 

00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:33.579
 Kanai's cube is named after Elder Kanai, 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.396
 who in turn is named after a friend and colleague, 

00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:41.108
 Kevin Kanai Griffith, 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:46.554
 who died during the development of Diablo III. 

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:53.176
 Kevin was a true pioneer in our team. 

00:02:53.327 --> 00:02:56.251
 He was always the first when we designed a new area, 

00:02:56.402 --> 00:02:58.029
 who jumped on it and started. 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.406
 He designed, for example, the ice caves. 

00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:07.412
 He created the entire zone in just one to two weeks! 

00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:12.312
 He was really clever, really fast and resourceful. 

00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:17.696
 He also worked on random elements for different environments. 

00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:21.975
 The lighting conditions change in nephalic portals or in adventure mode. 

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:25.522
 Sometimes it rains in Tristram and sometimes the sun is shining 

00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:27.939
 or there is a deep night in the stinging winds. 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.268
 The fans wanted to see stuff like that and Kevin was a hardcore fan, 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.516
 so his approach was always, "What would I like to play?" 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.416
 He wanted a Horadric cube 

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:41.440
 and see a barbarian temple in play. 

00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:47.063
 It means a lot to me that I can do these things now. 

00:03:49.144 --> 00:03:52.386
 I was allowed to work on the effects for Elder Kanai 

00:03:52.537 --> 00:03:57.855
 and I tried to make it an orange spirit, 

00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:01.810
 which embodies the rage of the barbarians. 

00:04:03.444 --> 00:04:06.946
 Kevin paid close attention to what his barbarian looked like 

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:11.142
 and this armor is the same one that carried its character. 

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:14.423
 It's great to take his barbarian 

00:04:14.574 --> 00:04:16.088
 and to put him on the throne. 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.317
 The barbarian who is bursting with orange pulsating energy, 

00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:25.568
 in memory of my friend. 

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:31.683
 Thank you for taking a closer look at Kanai's cube with us. 

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:34.875
