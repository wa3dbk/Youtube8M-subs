00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.280 
this tub well that is not a way to do
something<00:00:46.730> like<00:00:47.060> this<00:00:47.300> even<00:00:47.810> in<00:00:47.930> a<00:00:48.050> simple

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
something like this even in a simple

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.030 
something like this even in a simple
home

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
home

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.710 
home
brushing<00:00:49.970> anything<00:00:50.840> on<00:00:50.990> a<00:00:51.110> tub<00:00:51.350> is<00:00:52.720> definitely

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
brushing anything on a tub is definitely

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.190 
brushing anything on a tub is definitely
not<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.320> good<00:00:54.530> thing<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.950> do<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:56.630> so<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:56.870> have

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
not a good thing to do and so we have

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.069 
not a good thing to do and so we have
this<00:00:58.040> that<00:00:58.489> needs<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.880> be<00:00:58.910> straight<00:00:59.390> added

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
this that needs to be straight added

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.600 
this that needs to be straight added
percent<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:01.100> if<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:01.640> can<00:01:01.850> see<00:01:02.090> better<00:01:02.390> on<00:01:03.610> the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
percent and if you can see better on the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.300 
percent and if you can see better on the
brushes<00:01:05.409> it's<00:01:06.409> something<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:06.950> needs<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.220> be

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
brushes it's something that needs to be

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.520 
brushes it's something that needs to be
removing<00:01:08.150> precent<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.810> start<00:01:09.290> from<00:01:09.470> scratch
