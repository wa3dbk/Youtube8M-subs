it<00:00:27.449> ran<00:00:27.630> okay<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> panel<00:00:29.039> didn't<00:00:29.279> do

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
now this boards out of that TV as well I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.170 
now this boards out of that TV as well I
have<00:00:34.530> been<00:00:34.649> switching<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.340> did<00:00:35.790> switch<00:00:36.000> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
have been switching I did switch that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.760 
have been switching I did switch that
first<00:00:36.480> when<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> faults<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> same<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
first when the faults the same so the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.410 
first when the faults the same so the
power<00:00:38.010> supply<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.340> probably<00:00:38.670> both<00:00:38.850> still<00:00:39.120> fine

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
power supply is probably both still fine

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.500 
power supply is probably both still fine
but<00:00:39.680> there's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> problem<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.250> these

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
but there's a problem in one of these

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.540 
but there's a problem in one of these
buffer<00:00:42.510> boards<00:00:43.040> half<00:00:44.040> inclined<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> think

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
buffer boards half inclined to think

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.619 
buffer boards half inclined to think
it's<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> way<00:00:45.570> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it's that one because of the way it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.270 
it's that one because of the way it
behaved<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.469> I'll<00:00:46.590> also<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.980> some<00:00:47.160> more

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
behaved but I'll also do some more

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.950 
behaved but I'll also do some more
testing<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.789> try<00:00:48.570> unplugging<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.320> y-sustain

a digital board behind this but no other

a digital board behind this but no other
no<00:01:15.900> other<00:01:15.930> our<00:01:16.290> buffer<00:01:16.830> board<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:18.000> they're

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
no other our buffer board so they're

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
no other our buffer board so they're
pretty<00:01:18.360> straightforward<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
pretty straightforward but it's just a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.880 
pretty straightforward but it's just a
matter<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.040> finding<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.430> ones<00:01:20.670> short

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
matter of finding out which ones short

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.080 
matter of finding out which ones short
I'm<00:01:22.890> thinking<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> best<00:01:23.430> course<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.970> action

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
I'm thinking the best course of action

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
I'm thinking the best course of action
would<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> buy<00:01:24.840> second-hand<00:01:25.470> board

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
would just be to buy second-hand board

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.609 
would just be to buy second-hand board
off<00:01:25.950> eBay<00:01:26.900> would<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.439> these

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
off eBay would like to get one of these

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
off eBay would like to get one of these
two<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.250> don't<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.490> care<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.790> both

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
two going I don't really care about both

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
two going I don't really care about both
having<00:01:30.630> both<00:01:30.810> working<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
having both working but just for the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.330 
having both working but just for the
sake<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.189> see<00:01:35.189> what

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
sake of it get one going and see what

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.450 
sake of it get one going and see what
happens<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.710> I'll<00:01:37.710> swap<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> board<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.430> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
happens so I'll swap the board out of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.890 
happens so I'll swap the board out of
this<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.060> pretty<00:01:39.420> sure<00:01:39.479> they're<00:01:39.750> both

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this one but pretty sure they're both

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.800 
this one but pretty sure they're both
exactly<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> same<00:01:40.500> fault<00:01:41.270> if<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.450> fault<00:01:42.659> from

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
exactly the same fault if the fault from

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
exactly the same fault if the fault from
that<00:01:42.990> set<00:01:43.259> shows<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.430> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that set shows up on this one then you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.660 
that set shows up on this one then you
definitely<00:01:45.140> now<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> doesn't<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
definitely now if it doesn't well you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
definitely now if it doesn't well you
know<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.240> few<00:01:48.840> different<00:01:49.220> different

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
know as we go few different different

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.440 
know as we go few different different
candidates<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.909> swapped<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.210> board

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
candidates have you swapped that board

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
candidates have you swapped that board
out<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.290> fails<00:01:52.500> well<00:01:52.890> who<00:01:53.100> cares

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
out and if that fails well who cares

to<00:03:17.310> look<00:03:17.459> at<00:03:18.140> another<00:03:19.140> LCD<00:03:19.769> television<00:03:21.110> yeah

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
to look at another LCD television yeah

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.400 
to look at another LCD television yeah
it's<00:03:22.320> good<00:03:22.470> stuff<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.820> plasma<00:03:24.300> as<00:03:24.360> well<00:03:24.600> yeah

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
it's good stuff the plasma as well yeah

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.140 
it's good stuff the plasma as well yeah
I<00:03:25.440> guess<00:03:25.739> most<00:03:26.430> people<00:03:26.700> would<00:03:26.790> say<00:03:26.970> these

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
I guess most people would say these

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.190 
I guess most people would say these
aren't<00:03:27.360> worth<00:03:27.540> messing<00:03:27.870> around<00:03:27.959> with

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
aren't worth messing around with

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.449 
aren't worth messing around with
especially<00:03:28.620> since<00:03:28.830> this<00:03:28.950> one's<00:03:29.160> been<00:03:29.310> out<00:03:29.430> in

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
especially since this one's been out in

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.220 
especially since this one's been out in
the<00:03:29.550> weather<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.510> it'll<00:03:30.690> probably<00:03:30.720> be<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the weather so it'll probably be the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.320 
the weather so it'll probably be the
part<00:03:31.530> see<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.769> know<00:03:31.890> if<00:03:32.070> any<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.000> its<00:03:33.120> still

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
part see you know if any of its still

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.479 
part see you know if any of its still
good<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.320> does<00:03:34.440> try<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.800> startup<00:03:35.250> it's

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
good like it does try and startup it's

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.030 
good like it does try and startup it's
not<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.700> bad<00:03:35.940> thing<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:37.650> they've<00:03:37.860> both<00:03:37.980> been

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040

up<00:05:07.300> where<00:05:07.449> these<00:05:07.539> came<00:05:07.780> from<00:05:07.840> but<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:09.219> I<00:05:09.400> got

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
up where these came from but and I got

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.540 
up where these came from but and I got
to<00:05:09.699> draw<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:09.909> line<00:05:10.150> somewhere<00:05:11.190> it's<00:05:12.190> up<00:05:12.370> in

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
to draw the line somewhere it's up in

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
Jays area so if he picks them up he

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.510

picks<00:05:14.530> them<00:05:14.650> up<00:05:14.740> if<00:05:14.919> he<00:05:15.009> does<00:05:15.129> and<00:05:15.280> he<00:05:15.340> doesn't

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
picks them up if he does and he doesn't

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.139
