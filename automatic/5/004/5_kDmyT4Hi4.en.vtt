00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.279 
have it is that the best performance of
the<00:01:41.399> season<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.569> must<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.929> there<00:01:42.959> with<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
the season so you must go there with a

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.169 
the season so you must go there with a
big<00:01:43.500> chance<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.130> interesting<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.580> mean<00:01:44.610> is

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
big chance it's interesting I mean is

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.639 
big chance it's interesting I mean is
one<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.599> reasons<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.989> did<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.380> prenup

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
one of the reasons I did the prenup

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.139 
one of the reasons I did the prenup
because<00:01:46.709> I<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.069> fell<00:01:47.220> he<00:01:47.550> got<00:01:47.759> himself<00:01:47.880> into

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
because I just fell he got himself into

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.270 
because I just fell he got himself into
push<00:01:48.360> his<00:01:48.539> position<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.410> then<00:01:49.709> faded<00:01:50.160> a<00:01:50.250> bit

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
push his position and then faded a bit

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.710 
push his position and then faded a bit
from<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.849> the<00:01:50.910> second<00:01:51.179> ass<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.599> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
from the back of the second ass and I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120 
from the back of the second ass and I
just<00:01:52.170> wondered<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.679> breathing<00:01:52.979> wasn't

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
just wondered if the breathing wasn't

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.830 
just wondered if the breathing wasn't
stopping<00:01:53.459> that<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.849> we<00:01:54.239> can<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.479> improve

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
stopping that and we can just improve

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.940 
stopping that and we can just improve

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
lead in chance here and jockey

pink<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.830> yeah<00:02:26.190> he<00:02:26.310> will<00:02:26.460> but<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.640> think<00:02:26.970> he's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
pink is on yeah he will but I think he's

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.210

now<00:02:27.240> we<00:02:27.270> see<00:02:27.570> one<00:02:27.780> side

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
now we see one side

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.740 
now we see one side
grain<00:02:28.490> dependently<00:02:29.000> won't<00:02:29.210> have<00:02:29.330> really<00:02:29.600> nice

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
grain dependently won't have really nice

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.090 
grain dependently won't have really nice
ground<00:02:30.080> if<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.260> got<00:02:30.320> soft<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.710> probably<00:02:30.860> think

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
ground if it got soft I probably think

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.650 
ground if it got soft I probably think
about<00:02:31.130> choice<00:02:31.430> about<00:02:31.580> running<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.120> on

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
about choice about running it and on

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.910 
about choice about running it and on
what<00:02:32.960> he's<00:02:33.080> done<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.320> season<00:02:33.470> he's<00:02:33.710> got<00:02:33.860> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
what he's done this season he's got to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.100 
what he's done this season he's got to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.720 
improve quite a lot and so if he didn't
go<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> chat<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.650> would<00:02:36.770> he<00:02:36.860> go<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.370> Aintree<00:02:37.460> or

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
go to chat and would he go to Aintree or

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
something could go to Aintree could run

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.970 
something could go to Aintree could run
in<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.200> National<00:02:39.530> he<00:02:39.590> could<00:02:39.710> run<00:02:39.800> in<00:02:39.920> the
