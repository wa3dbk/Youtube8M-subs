just<00:02:21.860> open<00:02:22.010> every<00:02:22.370> single<00:02:22.520> 1i<00:02:22.819> guess<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.240> make

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
just open every single 1i guess to make

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.170 
just open every single 1i guess to make
this<00:02:23.480> video<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:24.010> little<00:02:25.010> bit<00:02:25.130> longer<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:26.060> can

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
this video a little bit longer you can

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.480 
this video a little bit longer you can
get<00:02:26.330> these<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:27.050> think<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:27.980> still<00:02:28.190> get<00:02:28.310> him<00:02:28.400> on

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
get these I think you still get him on

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.280 
get these I think you still get him on
amazon<00:02:28.640> not<00:02:29.180> really<00:02:29.420> sure<00:02:29.630> it's<00:02:29.990> just<00:02:30.140> had<00:02:30.260> a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
amazon not really sure it's just had a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.869 
amazon not really sure it's just had a
third<00:02:30.530> product<00:02:30.800> party<00:02:31.220> seller<00:02:31.459> he<00:02:31.700> probably

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
third product party seller he probably

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.399 
third product party seller he probably
just<00:02:32.060> bought<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.450> crapload<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.989> them<00:02:33.200> and

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
just bought a crapload of them and

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.180 
just bought a crapload of them and
priced<00:02:34.099> from<00:02:34.280> whatever<00:02:34.489> he<00:02:34.819> like<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
priced from whatever he like and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.520 
priced from whatever he like and
I'd<00:02:37.760> say<00:02:38.030> if<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.600> need<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.960> charge<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.320> lot<00:02:39.410> of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
I'd say if you need a charge a lot of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.250 
I'd say if you need a charge a lot of
batteries<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> same<00:02:40.220> time<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.260> you're

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
batteries the same time and you're

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.660 
batteries the same time and you're
afraid<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.770> break<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.130> would<00:02:43.250> say<00:02:43.400> by
