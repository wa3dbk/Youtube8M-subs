00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
which I freaking hate but I also have to

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.920 
which I freaking hate but I also have to
take<00:03:31.400> into<00:03:31.549> consideration<00:03:31.669> the<00:03:32.479> time<00:03:32.509> that

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
take into consideration the time that

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.499 
take into consideration the time that
they<00:03:33.019> came<00:03:33.229> out<00:03:33.409> it<00:03:33.560> came<00:03:33.709> out<00:03:33.859> in<00:03:34.009> 1998<00:03:34.970> if<00:03:35.299> I'm

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:35.509 
they came out it came out in 1998 if I'm

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.069 
they came out it came out in 1998 if I'm
correct<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.849> I<00:03:38.090> give<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.540> animation

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
correct so in that I give the animation

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.990 
correct so in that I give the animation
some<00:03:39.290> leeway<00:03:39.530> because<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.310> animation<00:03:40.819> has

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
some leeway because the animation has

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.149 
some leeway because the animation has
not<00:03:41.209> been<00:03:41.599> perfected<00:03:42.349> to<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.620> point<00:03:42.979> and

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
not been perfected to that point and

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.309 
not been perfected to that point and
that's<00:03:43.519> what<00:03:43.729> they<00:03:43.849> had<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.120> rely<00:03:44.419> on<00:03:44.449> but<00:03:45.199> for

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
that's what they had to rely on but for

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.199 
that's what they had to rely on but for
what<00:03:45.500> they<00:03:45.709> did<00:03:46.040> they<00:03:46.489> did<00:03:46.639> a<00:03:46.669> really<00:03:46.879> good<00:03:47.000> job

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209

sing<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.519> mean<00:04:01.699> it<00:04:02.269> was<00:04:02.389> pretty<00:04:02.569> catchy<00:04:02.840> I

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
sing I mean it was pretty catchy I

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.319 
sing I mean it was pretty catchy I
really<00:04:03.739> liked<00:04:03.949> it<00:04:04.189> but<00:04:04.400> even<00:04:04.549> with<00:04:04.849> all<00:04:04.879> those

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
really liked it but even with all those

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.809 
really liked it but even with all those
things<00:04:05.629> considered<00:04:06.319> I<00:04:06.439> still<00:04:06.949> had<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.519> lot<00:04:07.669> of

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
things considered I still had a lot of

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.909 
things considered I still had a lot of
problems<00:04:08.299> with<00:04:08.449> this<00:04:08.569> enemy<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.290> biggest<00:04:09.739> and

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
problems with this enemy the biggest and

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.189 
problems with this enemy the biggest and
probably<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.400> only<00:04:10.609> problem<00:04:11.389> that<00:04:11.599> really<00:04:11.900> is

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
probably the only problem that really is

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.259 
probably the only problem that really is
significant<00:04:12.889> in<00:04:12.949> this<00:04:13.099> anime<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.549> that<00:04:14.060> this

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
significant in this anime is that this

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.979 
significant in this anime is that this
anime<00:04:14.659> is<00:04:14.930> very<00:04:15.609> confusing<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.599> feel<00:04:17.810> like

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
anime is very confusing and I feel like

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.199 
anime is very confusing and I feel like
it's<00:04:18.169> confusing<00:04:18.739> on<00:04:19.009> purpose<00:04:19.609> like<00:04:20.090> they

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
it's confusing on purpose like they

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.510 
it's confusing on purpose like they
withhold<00:04:20.750> information<00:04:21.049> from<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:22.190> don't

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
withhold information from you and don't

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.180 
withhold information from you and don't
expand<00:04:23.090> on<00:04:23.419> other<00:04:23.570> characters<00:04:24.229> I<00:04:24.469> had<00:04:24.979> a

had throughout the entire enemy that
never<00:04:57.680> really<00:04:58.370> get<00:04:58.760> answered<00:04:59.510> most<00:04:59.840> of<00:04:59.930> the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
never really get answered most of the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.240 
never really get answered most of the
characters<00:05:00.410> in<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.620> anime<00:05:00.920> are<00:05:01.040> very

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
characters in the anime are very

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.950 
characters in the anime are very
one-dimensional<00:05:01.550> they<00:05:02.300> really<00:05:02.540> don't<00:05:02.780> go

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
one-dimensional they really don't go

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.960 
one-dimensional they really don't go
through<00:05:03.260> any<00:05:03.530> sort<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:03.980> development<00:05:04.640> but<00:05:04.940> I

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
through any sort of development but I

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.550 
through any sort of development but I
don't<00:05:05.180> think<00:05:05.420> this<00:05:05.600> anime<00:05:05.990> really<00:05:06.380> was

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
don't think this anime really was

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.190 
don't think this anime really was
focusing<00:05:07.100> on<00:05:07.250> all<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:08.090> characters<00:05:08.630> more<00:05:09.140> or

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
focusing on all the characters more or

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.170 
focusing on all the characters more or
less<00:05:09.320> maybe<00:05:09.530> one<00:05:09.890> character<00:05:10.430> or<00:05:10.610> even<00:05:10.790> just

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
less maybe one character or even just

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.570 
less maybe one character or even just
the<00:05:11.210> overarching<00:05:11.990> story<00:05:12.440> that<00:05:13.070> ties<00:05:13.310> all

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
the overarching story that ties all

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.550 
the overarching story that ties all
these<00:05:13.760> characters<00:05:14.210> together<00:05:14.390> doesn't<00:05:15.140> excuse

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
these characters together doesn't excuse

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.200 
these characters together doesn't excuse
the<00:05:15.590> fact<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:16.130> most<00:05:16.460> of<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.640> characters<00:05:16.820> are

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
the fact that most of the characters are

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.880 
the fact that most of the characters are
kind<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.450> bland<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:18.020> forgettable<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.770> my

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
kind of bland and forgettable and my

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.800 
kind of bland and forgettable and my
last<00:05:19.100> gripe<00:05:19.400> about<00:05:19.550> this<00:05:19.820> anime<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.390> its

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
last gripe about this anime is its

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.690 
last gripe about this anime is its
ending<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:21.500> I<00:05:21.560> know<00:05:21.620> I<00:05:21.770> can't<00:05:22.100> go<00:05:22.250> into<00:05:22.400> deep

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
ending and I know I can't go into deep

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.910 
ending and I know I can't go into deep
detail<00:05:23.120> about<00:05:23.540> what<00:05:23.720> happens<00:05:24.260> in<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.530> ending

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
detail about what happens in the ending

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.010 
detail about what happens in the ending
but<00:05:25.250> I<00:05:25.310> will<00:05:25.610> just<00:05:25.640> say<00:05:25.940> this<00:05:26.300> I<00:05:26.480> felt<00:05:26.690> like<00:05:26.870> it

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
but I will just say this I felt like it

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.740 
but I will just say this I felt like it
was<00:05:27.140> a<00:05:27.170> total<00:05:27.770> cop-out<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.940> mean<00:05:29.150> after<00:05:29.450> sitting

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
was a total cop-out I mean after sitting

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.660 
was a total cop-out I mean after sitting
and<00:05:29.900> watching<00:05:30.050> almost<00:05:30.440> 13<00:05:30.980> episodes<00:05:31.460> of<00:05:31.580> the

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
and watching almost 13 episodes of the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.760 
and watching almost 13 episodes of the
most<00:05:31.850> confusing<00:05:32.060> anime<00:05:32.720> I've<00:05:32.870> ever<00:05:33.050> seen<00:05:33.380> the

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
most confusing anime I've ever seen the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.010 
most confusing anime I've ever seen the
fact<00:05:33.950> that<00:05:34.070> I<00:05:34.250> really<00:05:34.550> don't<00:05:34.730> get<00:05:34.820> any

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
fact that I really don't get any

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.450 
fact that I really don't get any
resolution<00:05:36.020> or<00:05:36.200> understanding<00:05:37.160> of<00:05:37.220> what

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
resolution or understanding of what

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.820 
resolution or understanding of what
happens<00:05:37.970> kind<00:05:38.450> of<00:05:38.630> disappoints<00:05:39.260> me<00:05:39.290> I<00:05:39.590> mean

happens kind of disappoints me I mean
there<00:05:39.950> was<00:05:40.070> sort<00:05:40.460> of<00:05:40.669> a<00:05:40.790> resolution<00:05:41.419> at<00:05:41.540> the

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
there was sort of a resolution at the

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.600 
there was sort of a resolution at the
end<00:05:41.810> but<00:05:41.990> personally<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:42.500> didn't<00:05:42.890> like<00:05:43.070> it<00:05:43.370> and

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
end but personally I didn't like it and

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.940 
end but personally I didn't like it and
with<00:05:43.790> that<00:05:43.820> being<00:05:44.270> said<00:05:44.390> although<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:45.230> did<00:05:45.590> find

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
with that being said although I did find

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.770 
with that being said although I did find
the<00:05:46.190> concept<00:05:46.760> of<00:05:46.940> the<00:05:47.060> anime<00:05:47.390> very

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
the concept of the anime very

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.080 
the concept of the anime very
interesting<00:05:48.560> and<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:49.040> did<00:05:49.280> like<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.850> main

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
interesting and I did like the main

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.810 
interesting and I did like the main
character<00:05:50.419> Lane<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:51.740> opening<00:05:52.130> theme<00:05:52.370> it

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
character Lane and the opening theme it

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.400 
character Lane and the opening theme it
doesn't<00:05:53.150> change<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.480> fact<00:05:53.780> that<00:05:54.020> I<00:05:54.169> was

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
doesn't change the fact that I was

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.350 
doesn't change the fact that I was
confused<00:05:54.800> throughout<00:05:55.160> this<00:05:55.310> entire<00:05:55.520> anime

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
confused throughout this entire anime

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.600 
confused throughout this entire anime
which<00:05:56.540> really<00:05:56.750> sucked<00:05:57.500> me<00:05:57.710> out<00:05:57.950> of<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.310> enemy

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
which really sucked me out of the enemy

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.550 
which really sucked me out of the enemy
if<00:05:58.850> I<00:05:59.060> can't<00:05:59.330> really<00:05:59.540> attach<00:05:59.870> myself<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.440> the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
if I can't really attach myself to the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.200 
if I can't really attach myself to the
story<00:06:00.890> that's<00:06:01.160> happening<00:06:01.550> or<00:06:01.850> to<00:06:01.880> the

story that's happening or to the

story that's happening or to the
character's<00:06:02.690> dilemmas<00:06:03.260> then<00:06:03.620> I'm<00:06:03.740> not<00:06:03.919> really

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
character's dilemmas then I'm not really

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.430 
character's dilemmas then I'm not really
gonna<00:06:04.370> care<00:06:04.730> about<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.210> army<00:06:05.600> that<00:06:05.750> much<00:06:06.050> it

up<00:06:10.490> an<00:06:10.640> experimental<00:06:11.390> enemy<00:06:11.900> when<00:06:12.290> I<00:06:12.320> was

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
up an experimental enemy when I was

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.290 
up an experimental enemy when I was
watching<00:06:12.919> this<00:06:13.010> anime<00:06:13.400> I<00:06:13.430> got<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:13.910> feeling

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
watching this anime I got the feeling

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.990 
watching this anime I got the feeling
that<00:06:14.419> I<00:06:14.630> was<00:06:14.750> watching<00:06:15.110> like<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:16.070> movie<00:06:16.460> like<00:06:16.640> PI

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
that I was watching like a movie like PI

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.909 
that I was watching like a movie like PI
which<00:06:17.390> is<00:06:17.540> an<00:06:17.660> experimental<00:06:18.470> film<00:06:18.680> made<00:06:18.890> by

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
which is an experimental film made by

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.950 
which is an experimental film made by
Darren<00:06:19.640> Aronofsky<00:06:19.970> that's<00:06:20.450> what<00:06:20.600> it<00:06:20.720> gave<00:06:20.900> me

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
Darren Aronofsky that's what it gave me

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.070 
Darren Aronofsky that's what it gave me
that<00:06:21.169> feeling<00:06:21.680> of<00:06:21.919> an<00:06:22.220> experimental<00:06:22.910> film<00:06:23.510> so

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
that feeling of an experimental film so

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.780 
that feeling of an experimental film so
personally<00:06:24.860> I'm<00:06:25.070> not<00:06:25.130> a<00:06:25.280> big<00:06:25.340> fan<00:06:25.760> of
