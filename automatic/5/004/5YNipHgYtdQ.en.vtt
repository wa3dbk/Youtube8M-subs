00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
I'm always surprised when I have

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.130 
I'm always surprised when I have
athletes<00:00:31.240> that<00:00:31.420> have<00:00:31.480> been<00:00:31.630> riding<00:00:31.900> their

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
athletes that have been riding their

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.450 
athletes that have been riding their
bikes<00:00:32.320> for<00:00:32.619> years<00:00:32.860> and<00:00:33.040> I'll<00:00:33.100> say<00:00:33.220> them<00:00:33.370> hey

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
bikes for years and I'll say them hey

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.799 
bikes for years and I'll say them hey
what's<00:00:33.670> your<00:00:33.790> easiest<00:00:34.059> gears<00:00:34.390> is<00:00:34.540> a<00:00:34.600> really

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
what's your easiest gears is a really

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.110 
what's your easiest gears is a really
hilly<00:00:34.989> course<00:00:35.230> they<00:00:36.040> say<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.220> me<00:00:36.340> all<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:36.489> have

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
hilly course they say to me all I have

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.030 
hilly course they say to me all I have
no<00:00:37.270> idea<00:00:37.570> how<00:00:37.809> do<00:00:37.870> I<00:00:37.960> even<00:00:38.170> how<00:00:38.590> do<00:00:38.650> I<00:00:38.739> even<00:00:38.920> find

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
that out so let's have a little lesson

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.320 
that out so let's have a little lesson
on<00:00:42.280> gearing<00:00:42.790> so<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:44.500> gearing<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:45.040> this

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
on gearing so the gearing is this

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.880 
on gearing so the gearing is this
drivetrain<00:00:46.330> here<00:00:46.780> part<00:00:47.019> of<00:00:47.050> your<00:00:47.199> bike<00:00:47.320> so

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
drivetrain here part of your bike so

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.310 
drivetrain here part of your bike so
obviously<00:00:48.190> every<00:00:48.430> chain<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.930> have<00:00:50.140> your

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
obviously every chain and you have your

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.010 
obviously every chain and you have your
front<00:00:51.220> chainring<00:00:51.760> here<00:00:52.059> you've<00:00:52.600> got<00:00:52.750> your<00:00:52.780> big

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
front chainring here you've got your big

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.680 
front chainring here you've got your big
ring<00:00:53.230> in<00:00:53.440> your<00:00:53.559> little<00:00:53.710> ring<00:00:53.860> and<00:00:54.420> most<00:00:55.420> bikes

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
ring in your little ring and most bikes

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.170 
ring in your little ring and most bikes
with<00:00:56.020> 700c<00:00:57.010> wheels<00:00:57.040> use<00:00:57.489> standard<00:00:58.000> wheels

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
with 700c wheels use standard wheels

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.530 
with 700c wheels use standard wheels
have<00:00:58.750> a<00:00:58.780> 53<00:00:59.410> tooth<00:00:59.590> big<00:00:59.860> ring<00:01:00.239> that's<00:01:01.239> just<00:01:01.420> big

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
have a 53 tooth big ring that's just big

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.030 
have a 53 tooth big ring that's just big
ring<00:01:01.690> here<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.020> let's<00:01:02.200> shift<00:01:02.440> down<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:02.860> we<00:01:02.920> can

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
ring here and let's shift down so we can

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.979 
ring here and let's shift down so we can
look<00:01:03.100> at<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.280> small<00:01:03.489> ring<00:01:03.640> notice<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.629> circus

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
look at the small ring notice the circus

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.070 
look at the small ring notice the circus
bike<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.729> then<00:01:06.910> when<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.180> shift<00:01:07.420> down<00:01:07.509> so<00:01:08.020> you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
bike and then when you shift down so you

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.410 
bike and then when you shift down so you
see<00:01:08.320> this<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.530> 53<00:01:09.039> and<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.520> actually<00:01:09.970> even<00:01:10.090> says

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
see this is 53 and it actually even says

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.010 
see this is 53 and it actually even says
on<00:01:10.600> here<00:01:10.810> 53<00:01:11.440> so<00:01:12.160> you<00:01:12.250> didn't<00:01:12.430> have<00:01:12.550> to<00:01:12.640> count

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
on here 53 so you didn't have to count

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.270 
on here 53 so you didn't have to count
the<00:01:14.020> teeth<00:01:14.259> because<00:01:14.500> we<00:01:14.770> tell<00:01:14.979> you<00:01:15.070> I've<00:01:15.250> done

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
the teeth because we tell you I've done

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160 
the teeth because we tell you I've done
that<00:01:15.610> before<00:01:15.759> just<00:01:16.240> make<00:01:16.690> sure<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:16.869> really<00:01:16.990> has

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
that before just make sure it really has

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.050 
that before just make sure it really has
53<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:17.950> knew<00:01:18.399> this<00:01:18.520> country's<00:01:18.880> like

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
53 and I knew this country's like

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.090 
53 and I knew this country's like
discounted<00:01:19.869> I've<00:01:20.200> counted<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.710> teeth<00:01:20.890> I'm

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
discounted I've counted the teeth I'm

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.760 
discounted I've counted the teeth I'm
like<00:01:21.550> that<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:22.479> then<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.869> course<00:01:23.110> we<00:01:23.440> got<00:01:23.619> an

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
like that so then of course we got an

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.290 
like that so then of course we got an
easier<00:01:24.160> one<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.640> that's<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:25.000> one<00:01:25.149> that's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
easier one and that's the one that's

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.270 
easier one and that's the one that's
hidden<00:01:25.569> behind<00:01:25.690> it<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.740> that's<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.009> small

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
hidden behind it and that's the small

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.639 
hidden behind it and that's the small
ring<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.959> generally<00:01:28.959> speaking<00:01:29.110> on<00:01:29.500> those

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
ring and generally speaking on those

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.760 
ring and generally speaking on those
bikes<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.160> hell<00:01:30.810> 30:19<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:31.959> know<00:01:32.020> diesel<00:01:32.560> it's

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
bikes the hell 30:19 I know diesel it's

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.400 
bikes the hell 30:19 I know diesel it's
very<00:01:33.009> exciting<00:01:33.599> most<00:01:34.599> bikes<00:01:34.959> come<00:01:35.229> with<00:01:35.380> a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
very exciting most bikes come with a

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.309 
very exciting most bikes come with a
small<00:01:36.130> chain<00:01:36.310> Orion<00:01:36.550> has<00:01:36.610> 39<00:01:36.910> teeth<00:01:37.319> some

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
small chain Orion has 39 teeth some

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.550 
small chain Orion has 39 teeth some
people<00:01:38.560> arriving<00:01:38.860> with<00:01:39.130> 42<00:01:39.580> but<00:01:40.390> 39<00:01:41.110> is<00:01:41.289> really

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
people arriving with 42 but 39 is really

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.350 
people arriving with 42 but 39 is really
probably<00:01:42.039> your<00:01:42.369> best<00:01:42.520> bet<00:01:42.670> because<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.240> will

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
probably your best bet because that will

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.089 
probably your best bet because that will
give<00:01:43.509> you<00:01:43.660> some<00:01:44.200> easier<00:01:44.500> gears<00:01:44.800> if<00:01:44.979> you're

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
give you some easier gears if you're

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
give you some easier gears if you're
going<00:01:45.190> uphill<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:45.759> what's<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.000> difference

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
going uphill so what's the difference

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.150 
going uphill so what's the difference
between<00:01:46.360> 39<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:46.959> 42<00:01:47.319> why<00:01:47.619> would<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.950> want<00:01:48.099> a

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
between 39 and 42 why would you want a

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.650 
between 39 and 42 why would you want a
39<00:01:48.640> versus<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.060> 42

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
39 versus a 42

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.550 
39 versus a 42
well<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:49.840> don't<00:01:50.080> really<00:01:50.229> know<00:01:50.349> when<00:01:50.470> people

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
well I don't really know when people

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.870 
well I don't really know when people
write<00:01:50.770> 42<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.250> think<00:01:51.520> they<00:01:51.580> think<00:01:51.640> they're

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
write 42 I think they think they're

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.430 
write 42 I think they think they're
macho<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.360> they<00:01:52.420> can<00:01:52.569> they<00:01:53.170> don't<00:01:53.319> really

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
macho and they can they don't really

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.190 
macho and they can they don't really
need<00:01:53.740> easier<00:01:54.310> gears<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:54.970> I<00:01:55.000> think<00:01:55.240> 39<00:01:55.690> for

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
need easier gears but I think 39 for

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.930 
need easier gears but I think 39 for
just<00:01:56.649> about<00:01:56.740> anybody<00:01:57.039> is<00:01:57.310> gonna<00:01:57.490> be<00:01:57.640> unless

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
just about anybody is gonna be unless

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.880 
just about anybody is gonna be unless
you're<00:01:58.119> doing<00:01:58.300> everything<00:01:58.509> downhill<00:01:58.990> but

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
you're doing everything downhill but

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.949 
you're doing everything downhill but
once<00:02:00.069> you<00:02:00.160> also<00:02:00.310> say<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:01.090> we<00:02:01.390> had<00:02:01.599> you<00:02:01.750> switch

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
once you also say you we had you switch

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.350 
once you also say you we had you switch
out<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.410> 54<00:02:03.069> on<00:02:03.369> your<00:02:03.700> front<00:02:03.910> ring<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:04.239> when

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
out to a 54 on your front ring so when

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.029 
out to a 54 on your front ring so when
you're<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.509> higher-end<00:02:04.780> rider<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.649> you're<00:02:05.979> in

some of these races if you get your big

some of these races if you get your big
chain<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.929> can<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.410> can<00:02:08.590> get<00:02:08.770> those<00:02:08.920> bigger

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
chain you can you can get those bigger

chain you can you can get those bigger
gears<00:02:09.550> by<00:02:09.729> getting<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.060> bigger<00:02:10.720> big<00:02:11.590> chain

gears by getting a bigger big chain

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.410 
gears by getting a bigger big chain
crunch<00:02:12.099> chain<00:02:12.310> ring<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.180> when<00:02:13.300> you're

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
crunch chain ring so that when you're

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.300 
crunch chain ring so that when you're
going<00:02:13.540> downhill<00:02:13.870> or<00:02:14.440> you're<00:02:14.620> maybe<00:02:14.920> caught<00:02:15.190> in

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
going downhill or you're maybe caught in

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.650 
going downhill or you're maybe caught in
a<00:02:15.370> little<00:02:15.550> bit<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.760> tailwind<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.270> can<00:02:16.420> still

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
a little bit of a tailwind you can still

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.210 
a little bit of a tailwind you can still
push<00:02:17.260> some<00:02:17.440> bigger<00:02:17.620> gears<00:02:17.830> because<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.130> were

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
push some bigger gears because you were

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.729 
push some bigger gears because you were
losing<00:02:18.430> some<00:02:19.150> speed<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.720> areas<00:02:20.410> where<00:02:20.620> you

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
losing some speed in areas where you

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.870 
losing some speed in areas where you
just<00:02:20.860> didn't<00:02:21.099> need<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.610> put<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
just didn't need it and you put the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.030 
just didn't need it and you put the
bigger<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.180> channel<00:02:22.450> my<00:02:22.599> stone<00:02:22.870> well<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:23.890> is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
bigger to channel my stone well this is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.509 
bigger to channel my stone well this is
your<00:02:24.220> yeah<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.930> more<00:02:26.140> teeth<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:27.189> harder

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
your yeah so the more teeth the harder

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.339 
your yeah so the more teeth the harder
visit<00:02:27.790> pedal<00:02:28.000> definitely<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.719> the<00:02:28.840> front<00:02:29.110> in

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
visit pedal definitely in the front in

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.540 
visit pedal definitely in the front in
the<00:02:29.379> front<00:02:29.439> in<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.769> price<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.189> more

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
the front in the price the more

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.060 
the front in the price the more
the<00:02:30.910> hardest<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.540> once<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> get<00:02:31.930> past<00:02:32.140> 53<00:02:32.620> on

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
the hardest and once you get past 53 on

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.890 
the hardest and once you get past 53 on
the<00:02:33.100> front<00:02:33.370> chainring<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:34.030> lot<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.480> times<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
the front chainring a lot of times you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.810 
the front chainring a lot of times you
can<00:02:35.050> have<00:02:35.080> issues<00:02:35.650> dropping<00:02:36.340> down<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.550> your

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
can have issues dropping down to your

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.340 
can have issues dropping down to your
smaller<00:02:37.030> chain<00:02:37.300> ring<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.900> will<00:02:38.170> need<00:02:38.290> to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
smaller chain ring so you will need to

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.110 
smaller chain ring so you will need to
get<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.560> that's<00:02:39.010> why<00:02:39.190> some<00:02:39.340> people<00:02:39.430> go<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.790> 42

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
get a that's why some people go to a 42

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.760 
get a that's why some people go to a 42
yeah<00:02:40.390> because<00:02:40.570> they<00:02:40.840> have<00:02:40.960> in<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.260> jump<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.650> in

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
yeah because they have in the jump is in

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.280 
yeah because they have in the jump is in
this<00:02:41.890> big<00:02:42.100> but<00:02:42.370> really<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> 42<00:02:43.210> for<00:02:43.780> most<00:02:43.990> people

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
this big but really a 42 for most people

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.840 
this big but really a 42 for most people
isn't<00:02:44.530> gonna<00:02:44.740> give<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.070> easy<00:02:45.220> enough<00:02:45.460> gearing

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
isn't gonna give you easy enough gearing

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.100 
isn't gonna give you easy enough gearing
so<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.120> would<00:02:46.420> say<00:02:46.510> stick<00:02:46.780> with<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.960> 39<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:48.360> 53<00:02:49.360> 54

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
so I would say stick with a 39 and 53 54

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.170 
so I would say stick with a 39 and 53 54
if<00:02:50.260> you've<00:02:50.410> got<00:02:50.590> massive<00:02:50.890> claws<00:02:51.100> so<00:02:51.520> 39<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
if you've got massive claws so 39 on the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:02.370 
if you've got massive claws so 39 on the
smaller<00:02:52.510> ring<00:02:52.860> 53<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.160> big<00:02:54.730> ring<00:02:58.830> but<00:03:01.380> you

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
smaller ring 53 on the big ring but you

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.050 
smaller ring 53 on the big ring but you
also<00:03:02.500> might<00:03:02.770> drop<00:03:03.070> some<00:03:03.340> who<00:03:03.550> gets<00:03:03.730> dropped<00:03:03.910> on

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
also might drop some who gets dropped on

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.030 
also might drop some who gets dropped on
the<00:03:04.180> downhills<00:03:04.570> well<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.230> also<00:03:05.380> have<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.680> 80

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
the downhills well you also have like 80

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.780 
the downhills well you also have like 80
pounds<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.460> me

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
pounds on me

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.030 
pounds on me
does<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.630> also<00:03:07.960> depend<00:03:08.410> on<00:03:08.530> what<00:03:08.740> race<00:03:08.830> you're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
does it also depend on what race you're

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.290 
does it also depend on what race you're
doing<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.310> facility<00:03:09.730> versus<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.150> know<00:03:10.210> if

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
doing a facility versus you know if

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.580 
doing a facility versus you know if
you're<00:03:10.390> doing<00:03:10.510> army<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:10.870> Florida<00:03:11.260> versus

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
you're doing army on Florida versus

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.920 
you're doing army on Florida versus
doing<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:11.950> Coeur<00:03:12.130> d'Alene<00:03:12.360> well<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.810> know

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
doing like Coeur d'Alene well you know

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.100 
doing like Coeur d'Alene well you know
that<00:03:14.890> really<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.460> hilly<00:03:15.910> hilly<00:03:16.630> course<00:03:16.870> you're

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
that really a hilly hilly course you're

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.720 
that really a hilly hilly course you're
gonna<00:03:17.200> want<00:03:17.440> if<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.770> see<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.920> gear<00:03:18.130> as<00:03:18.250> possible

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
gonna want if you see a gear as possible

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.600 
gonna want if you see a gear as possible
into<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.030> 39<00:03:19.450> would<00:03:19.570> be<00:03:19.660> great<00:03:19.900> for<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.890> flat

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
into the 39 would be great for a flat

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.250 
into the 39 would be great for a flat
course<00:03:21.910> like<00:03:22.060> Florida<00:03:22.540> you're<00:03:22.780> almost<00:03:22.960> never

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
course like Florida you're almost never

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.570 
course like Florida you're almost never
gonna<00:03:23.470> be<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> small<00:03:23.920> chain<00:03:24.100> ring<00:03:24.130> anyway<00:03:24.520> so

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
gonna be in a small chain ring anyway so

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.730 
gonna be in a small chain ring anyway so
you<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:25.500> negligible<00:03:26.500> okay

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
you just negligible okay

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.550 
you just negligible okay
[Music]

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.140 

let's<00:03:32.560> talk<00:03:32.950> about<00:03:33.100> contact<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.910> yeah

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
let's talk about contact with it yeah

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.750 
let's talk about contact with it yeah
the<00:03:34.300> compact<00:03:34.660> hike<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.080> instead<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.380> having<00:03:35.530> a

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
the compact hike so instead of having a

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.220 
the compact hike so instead of having a
5339<00:03:36.790> most<00:03:37.450> compacts<00:03:37.900> come<00:03:38.110> 250<00:03:38.820> 34<00:03:39.820> so<00:03:40.510> your

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
5339 most compacts come 250 34 so your

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.900 
5339 most compacts come 250 34 so your
bigger<00:03:41.710> ring<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.100> your<00:03:42.220> small<00:03:42.430> ring<00:03:42.670> are<00:03:42.850> a

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
bigger ring and your small ring are a

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.210 
bigger ring and your small ring are a
lot<00:03:43.060> smaller<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:44.290> gives<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.740> much

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
lot smaller and that gives you much

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.800 
lot smaller and that gives you much
easier<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.790> gears<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.120> spinning<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.600> instead

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
easier and gears to spinning so instead

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.690 
easier and gears to spinning so instead
of<00:03:46.870> having<00:03:47.020> a<00:03:47.200> 39<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:48.100> whatever<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.459> have<00:03:48.610> in

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
of having a 39 and whatever you have in

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.590 
of having a 39 and whatever you have in
the<00:03:48.760> back<00:03:48.910> which<00:03:49.060> we'll<00:03:49.209> talk<00:03:49.330> about<00:03:49.390> shortly

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
the back which we'll talk about shortly

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.650 
the back which we'll talk about shortly
you'll<00:03:50.470> have<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.650> 34<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.490> the<00:03:51.760> gear<00:03:52.000> ratio<00:03:52.360> is

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
you'll have a 34 and the gear ratio is

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.510 
you'll have a 34 and the gear ratio is
just<00:03:53.200> it's<00:03:53.410> way<00:03:53.650> easier<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.340> will<00:03:54.430> allow

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
just it's way easier and it will allow

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.330 
just it's way easier and it will allow
you<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.750> spin<00:03:55.750> up<00:03:55.870> almost<00:03:56.230> anything<00:03:56.560> now<00:03:56.800> while

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
you to spin up almost anything now while

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.710 
you to spin up almost anything now while
we're<00:03:57.490> at<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.610> let<00:03:57.790> me<00:03:57.820> ask<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:58.180> question

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
we're at it let me ask you this question

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.210 
we're at it let me ask you this question
I<00:03:58.750> was<00:03:59.140> talking<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.410> Christy<00:03:59.709> Wellington<00:04:00.100> and

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
I was talking to Christy Wellington and

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.400 
I was talking to Christy Wellington and
she<00:04:00.400> loves<00:04:00.760> pushing<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.330> big<00:04:01.510> gear<00:04:02.110> you<00:04:02.290> know

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
she loves pushing a big gear you know

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.470 
she loves pushing a big gear you know
and<00:04:02.650> Lance<00:04:03.610> Armstrong<00:04:04.030> he's<00:04:04.209> almost<00:04:04.360> the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
and Lance Armstrong he's almost the

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.360 
and Lance Armstrong he's almost the
exact<00:04:04.750> opposite<00:04:05.170> he<00:04:05.350> said<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.890> know<00:04:06.010> spin<00:04:06.280> to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
exact opposite he said you know spin to

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.670 
exact opposite he said you know spin to
win<00:04:06.400> spin<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.850> win<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.510> lot<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:08.080> spinning<00:04:08.380> a

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
win spin to win so a lot of spinning a

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.010 
win spin to win so a lot of spinning a
lot<00:04:09.160> less<00:04:09.520> gearing<00:04:10.209> where<00:04:10.600> do<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.780> guys<00:04:10.870> stand

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
lot less gearing where do you guys stand

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.440 
lot less gearing where do you guys stand
on<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.350> I<00:04:11.610> tend<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.700> push<00:04:12.850> bigger<00:04:13.090> gear<00:04:13.420> I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
on that I tend to push bigger gear I

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.880 
on that I tend to push bigger gear I
have<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> slower<00:04:14.020> cadence<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.590> don't<00:04:14.739> know<00:04:14.800> if

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
have a slower cadence I don't know if

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.289 
have a slower cadence I don't know if
it's<00:04:15.010> like<00:04:15.250> pushing<00:04:15.550> barriers<00:04:15.940> but<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.120> ride

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
it's like pushing barriers but I ride

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.060 
it's like pushing barriers but I ride
with<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.450> slower<00:04:16.630> games<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.560> think<00:04:17.620> for<00:04:17.950> me

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
with the slower games and I think for me

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.190 
with the slower games and I think for me
it's<00:04:18.390> more<00:04:19.390> I<00:04:19.690> don't<00:04:19.780> know<00:04:20.019> it's<00:04:20.169> just

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
it's more I don't know it's just

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.290 
it's more I don't know it's just
something<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:20.530> developed<00:04:20.709> over<00:04:21.100> time<00:04:21.300> your

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
something I developed over time your

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.540 
something I developed over time your
heart<00:04:22.480> rates<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.750> lot<00:04:22.870> lower<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:24.130> if<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.370> can

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
heart rates a lot lower and if you can

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.159 
heart rates a lot lower and if you can
develop<00:04:24.760> your<00:04:25.000> muscles<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.480> be<00:04:25.600> strong<00:04:25.990> enough

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
develop your muscles to be strong enough

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.290 
develop your muscles to be strong enough
to<00:04:26.290> handle<00:04:26.410> or<00:04:26.710> lower<00:04:27.070> cadence<00:04:27.460> then<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.820> works

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
to handle or lower cadence then it works

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.180 
to handle or lower cadence then it works
but<00:04:28.480> some<00:04:28.660> people<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.620> have<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.800> little<00:04:29.980> bit<00:04:30.130> of

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
but some people you have a little bit of

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.110 
but some people you have a little bit of
a<00:04:30.250> higher<00:04:30.370> I'm<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.580> little<00:04:30.790> bit<00:04:30.880> of<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:30.970> higher

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
a higher I'm a little bit of a higher

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.690 
a higher I'm a little bit of a higher
but<00:04:31.330> it's<00:04:31.419> still<00:04:31.600> fairly<00:04:32.020> low<00:04:32.230> yes<00:04:33.100> most

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
but it's still fairly low yes most

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.640 
but it's still fairly low yes most
people<00:04:33.730> talk<00:04:34.060> about<00:04:34.240> Akane's<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.900> about<00:04:35.050> 88<00:04:35.380> to

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
people talk about Akane's of about 88 to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.580 
people talk about Akane's of about 88 to
90<00:04:36.010> s<00:04:36.100> or<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.310> ideal<00:04:36.669> cadence<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.300> ride<00:04:38.140> more

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
90 s or the ideal cadence I ride more

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.240 
90 s or the ideal cadence I ride more
like<00:04:38.740> 80

and<00:04:44.300> really<00:04:44.630> you<00:04:44.780> know<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:44.990> just<00:04:45.140> have<00:04:45.290> to

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
and really you know you just have to

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.200 
and really you know you just have to
find<00:04:45.560> your<00:04:45.680> sweet<00:04:45.890> spot<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.340> know<00:04:46.490> people<00:04:46.820> run

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
find your sweet spot you know people run

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.850 
find your sweet spot you know people run
as<00:04:47.540> different<00:04:47.930> Cadence's<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.560> somewhat

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
as different Cadence's and somewhat

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.740 
as different Cadence's and somewhat
different<00:04:49.160> Cadence's<00:04:49.280> so<00:04:49.880> cycling<00:04:50.540> is<00:04:50.600> gonna

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
different Cadence's so cycling is gonna

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.970 
different Cadence's so cycling is gonna
be<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.900> same<00:04:51.050> way<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:51.290> don't<00:04:51.560> think<00:04:51.830> there's

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
be the same way I don't think there's

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.950 
be the same way I don't think there's
really<00:04:52.640> anything<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.270> can<00:04:53.390> say<00:04:53.600> is

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
really anything that you can say is

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.110 
really anything that you can say is
ideal<00:04:54.530> for<00:04:54.950> any<00:04:55.160> given<00:04:55.400> person<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.820> mean<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.060> know

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
ideal for any given person I mean I know

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.030 
ideal for any given person I mean I know
from<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:57.170> know<00:04:57.230> training<00:04:57.500> with<00:04:57.710> my<00:04:57.830> power

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
from you know training with my power

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.420 
from you know training with my power
where<00:04:58.550> my<00:04:58.850> sweet<00:04:59.120> spot<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.510> plus<00:05:00.470> also<00:05:00.860> you

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
where my sweet spot is plus also you

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.040

change<00:05:07.310> your<00:05:07.460> gearing<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:07.790> little<00:05:08.000> bit<00:05:08.090> so<00:05:08.210> your

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
change your gearing a little bit so your

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.310 
change your gearing a little bit so your
legs<00:05:08.540> aren't<00:05:08.750> just<00:05:08.900> going<00:05:09.080> through<00:05:09.230> this

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
legs aren't just going through this

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.400 
legs aren't just going through this
repetitive<00:05:09.650> you<00:05:10.550> know<00:05:10.670> motion<00:05:11.150> for<00:05:11.540> 112<00:05:12.230> miles

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410

cassette rear cassette and most bikes

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.519 
cassette rear cassette and most bikes
now<00:05:32.279> come<00:05:32.610> with<00:05:32.789> ten<00:05:33.689> speeds<00:05:34.019> so<00:05:34.259> that<00:05:34.289> you'll

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
now come with ten speeds so that you'll

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.719 
now come with ten speeds so that you'll
have<00:05:34.559> ten<00:05:35.219> cogs<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:35.969> each<00:05:36.209> each<00:05:36.569> one<00:05:37.050> of<00:05:37.379> these

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
have ten cogs so each each one of these

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.649 
have ten cogs so each each one of these
parts<00:05:38.729> of<00:05:38.879> the<00:05:38.999> cassette<00:05:39.239> is<00:05:39.389> called<00:05:39.599> the

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
parts of the cassette is called the

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.719 
parts of the cassette is called the
cause<00:05:39.839> and<00:05:40.229> they<00:05:40.739> can<00:05:40.889> come<00:05:41.039> in<00:05:41.159> a<00:05:41.219> variety<00:05:41.339> of

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
cause and they can come in a variety of

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.350 
cause and they can come in a variety of
sizes<00:05:42.029> so<00:05:43.129> when<00:05:44.129> they<00:05:44.219> talk<00:05:44.279> about<00:05:44.550> a<00:05:44.999> cassette

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
sizes so when they talk about a cassette

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.389 
sizes so when they talk about a cassette
being<00:05:45.569> 11:23<00:05:46.469> that<00:05:46.709> means<00:05:46.919> that<00:05:47.039> their<00:05:47.189> range

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:47.399 
being 11:23 that means that their range

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:50.119 
being 11:23 that means that their range
is<00:05:47.849> your<00:05:48.059> the<00:05:48.439> smallest<00:05:49.439> one<00:05:49.619> here<00:05:49.649> would<00:05:50.039> be

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
is your the smallest one here would be

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.070 
is your the smallest one here would be
11<00:05:50.519> in<00:05:50.699> the<00:05:50.939> biggest<00:05:51.269> one<00:05:51.449> in<00:05:51.629> the<00:05:51.689> back<00:05:51.809> of<00:05:52.019> you

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
11 in the biggest one in the back of you

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.919 
11 in the biggest one in the back of you
23<00:05:52.619> and<00:05:52.889> then<00:05:52.979> there's<00:05:53.189> different<00:05:53.629> cogs<00:05:54.629> in

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:54.929 
23 and then there's different cogs in

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:56.209 
23 and then there's different cogs in
between<00:05:55.259> I<00:05:55.289> think<00:05:55.469> this<00:05:55.769> one<00:05:55.949> here<00:05:56.099> is

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
between I think this one here is

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:57.979 
between I think this one here is
actually<00:05:56.339> 11<00:05:56.639> 26<00:05:57.239> so<00:05:57.449> it<00:05:57.539> gives<00:05:57.689> me<00:05:57.779> a<00:05:57.839> great

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:57.989 
actually 11 26 so it gives me a great

00:05:57.989 --> 00:06:01.369 
actually 11 26 so it gives me a great
range<00:05:58.349> so<00:05:59.119> opposite<00:06:00.119> to<00:06:00.179> the<00:06:00.269> front<00:06:00.509> here<00:06:00.779> is

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
range so opposite to the front here is

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.499 
range so opposite to the front here is
the<00:06:01.800> less<00:06:01.949> teeth<00:06:02.249> you<00:06:02.399> have<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:03.149> harder<00:06:03.419> the

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
the less teeth you have the harder the

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.769 
the less teeth you have the harder the
gear<00:06:03.719> so<00:06:04.079> an<00:06:04.439> 11<00:06:04.919> here<00:06:05.159> is<00:06:05.279> going<00:06:05.399> to<00:06:05.459> be

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
gear so an 11 here is going to be

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.569 
gear so an 11 here is going to be
survivin<00:06:06.779> 11<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:07.349> in<00:06:08.009> my<00:06:08.099> good<00:06:08.279> trainer<00:06:08.489> II

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:08.579 
survivin 11 and in my good trainer II

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:11.869 
survivin 11 and in my good trainer II
that<00:06:08.699> we<00:06:08.789> my<00:06:08.909> hardest<00:06:09.209> gear<00:06:09.509> and<00:06:10.369> those<00:06:11.369> 11

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
that we my hardest gear and those 11

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.189 
that we my hardest gear and those 11
high<00:06:12.539> like<00:06:13.079> spinal<00:06:13.409> tail<00:06:13.589> yeah<00:06:15.050> your<00:06:16.050> bike

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
high like spinal tail yeah your bike

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.909 
high like spinal tail yeah your bike
goes<00:06:16.379> 11<00:06:16.679> it<00:06:17.039> goes<00:06:17.189> to<00:06:17.429> 11<00:06:18.379> and<00:06:19.379> then<00:06:19.529> back<00:06:19.889> here

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
goes 11 it goes to 11 and then back here

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.309 
goes 11 it goes to 11 and then back here
is<00:06:20.129> a<00:06:20.219> 26<00:06:20.849> so<00:06:21.119> that<00:06:21.329> when<00:06:21.419> I'm<00:06:21.509> climbing<00:06:22.050> and

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
is a 26 so that when I'm climbing and

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.290 
is a 26 so that when I'm climbing and
I'm<00:06:22.439> in<00:06:22.589> my<00:06:22.619> small<00:06:23.009> ring<00:06:23.219> in<00:06:23.309> the<00:06:23.399> 26<00:06:23.909> I've<00:06:24.119> got

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
I'm in my small ring in the 26 I've got

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.309 
I'm in my small ring in the 26 I've got
really<00:06:24.779> easy<00:06:25.169> well<00:06:26.389> really<00:06:27.389> but<00:06:27.749> for<00:06:28.199> most

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
really easy well really but for most

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.689 
really easy well really but for most
climbs<00:06:28.649> around<00:06:28.919> here<00:06:29.099> ain't<00:06:29.369> nothing<00:06:29.459> of

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
climbs around here ain't nothing of

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.399 
climbs around here ain't nothing of
those<00:06:29.819> goals<00:06:30.059> not<00:06:30.300> doubles<00:06:30.629> goals<00:06:30.839> but<00:06:31.139> for

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
those goals not doubles goals but for

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:32.749 
those goals not doubles goals but for
most<00:06:31.499> climbs<00:06:31.800> around<00:06:32.069> here<00:06:32.219> it's<00:06:32.369> ample

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
most climbs around here it's ample

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.540 
most climbs around here it's ample
gearing<00:06:33.149> and<00:06:33.329> then<00:06:33.749> you<00:06:34.229> know<00:06:34.349> in<00:06:34.589> between<00:06:34.709> it

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
gearing and then you know in between it

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.689 
gearing and then you know in between it
goes<00:06:35.819> about<00:06:36.059> maybe<00:06:36.240> 11<00:06:36.599> 12<00:06:36.629> 13<00:06:37.139> 15<00:06:38.129> on<00:06:38.579> the<00:06:38.669> I

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
goes about maybe 11 12 13 15 on the I

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.879 
goes about maybe 11 12 13 15 on the I
don't<00:06:38.849> exactly<00:06:39.059> know<00:06:39.209> but<00:06:39.629> you<00:06:40.619> know<00:06:40.740> the

range here is ample for almost anything
on<00:06:43.199> Julie<00:06:43.469> I've<00:06:43.559> joined<00:06:43.679> up<00:06:43.919> gears<00:06:44.249> for<00:06:44.550> the

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
on Julie I've joined up gears for the

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.850 
on Julie I've joined up gears for the
flats<00:06:44.879> for<00:06:45.209> the<00:06:45.300> climbs<00:06:45.709> most<00:06:46.709> of<00:06:46.800> the

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
flats for the climbs most of the

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.559 
flats for the climbs most of the
downhills<00:06:47.249> so<00:06:47.579> when<00:06:47.699> you<00:06:47.789> someone<00:06:48.269> asked<00:06:48.509> you
