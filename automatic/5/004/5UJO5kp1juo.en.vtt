I'm drawing the grid lines like five
horizontal<00:00:16.020> lines<00:00:17.690> like<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:22.010> one<00:00:23.010> more

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
horizontal lines like this and one more

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.620 
horizontal lines like this and one more
line<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.920> here's<00:00:25.920> another<00:00:26.340> line<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.060> see

line and here's another line you see
this<00:00:27.689> these<00:00:28.320> two<00:00:28.500> distances<00:00:28.859> are

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
this these two distances are

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.550 
this these two distances are
approximately<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> same<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.900> now<00:00:31.260> let's
