00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
 At the environment, we spent a few months talking to you about the most expensive 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.169
 the village 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.589
 - equality plan that we recount them real estelÃ­ the pair 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.150
 the important is that 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.560
 this summer he had created many expectations 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.699
 claire are flying a little bit because it turns out that this computer is finally 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.830
 still not sold in Spain 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.800
 only in some countries of europe 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.269
 in the United States than in Japan 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.390
 so while it is delayed 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.070
 there are others who are taking away the snack 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.680
 but this is happening with computers that are pretty similar 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 eat for example the one we have here today 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.830
 it will be the story 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.880
 the present 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.050
 entities a little bit bigger than the asus 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.290
 we just superimpose 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.300
 one more 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.790
 a little bit bigger on this part and also on the side 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.170
 its weight is quite similar 920 grams for the osc i900 50 for the iss 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.600
 but let's look more closely at the day 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.140
 its screen was seven inches with a native resolution of 800 by 480 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.710
 but you can force up to 1080 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.619
 so that it is much more tactical when it comes to being able to see in full screen 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.980
 the applications 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.330
 this old woman come standard in their configuration 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.000
 contrary to what happened with the asus that had to be cured, it has been achieved 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.340
 part 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.430
 the screen 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.610
 seve pretty well has surprised us and made it look pretty good 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 also the movies 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.450
 they have the same day the president something that has already expired 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.400
 it's a mania you can choose between 500 12 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.300
 depending on how high the model you choose 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.119
 the most important surveillance among 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.119
 this type and the others is that it offers various storage options 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.800
 you can choose 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.520
 4 gigs of flash memory or 40 gigas d discover 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.330
 is the rudder is very interesting 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
 park in the range of options to cover any need 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.150
 Many people need a little more hard drive to be able to work quietly 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.909
 that does lower the price the weight and consumption 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.310
 another curious detail 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.980
 ski 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.219
 has integrated nobel 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.629
 manet that may seem is a thing like last century 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.149
 but keep in mind that there are many situations in which you can 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.960
 need it 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.780
 for example 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.760
 If you are going to see your grandmother in town or if you go to countries, they should not even exist 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.580
 finite my 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.849
 derbez coalition 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.379
 the operating system is the impulse 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.409
 a variant of linux traced to the one used 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.959
 but you can also use our yesterday adot xp 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.459
 either of the two solutions works very well and quite fluently 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:53.450
 but another thing that we liked 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.559
 a lot 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.499
 is that you can change the way it is criterion 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.419
 of windows 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.889
 desk 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.570
 similar to the one that says 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.570
 children simply showed him traffic that is below 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.679
 this afternoon can be done with the asus 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.899
 but it's the same thing it's very dangerous to be able to do it 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.439
 the autonomy the horror of the strong points 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.939
 although this battery promises up to four hours of autonomy and sometimes that 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.849
 it stays in something less 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.889
 a lot more than I confessed his battery 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.339
 asus 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.119
 and that they are practically the same 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:37.289
 reviewing which side we all find that has a reader here 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:38.889
 cards 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.649
 on this side has 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:41.809
 two ports 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:42.919
 that kiss 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.449
 has the ethernet connection 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.449
 and it has the connection at the moment and if we do not look on the other side 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.689
 we find 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.540
 the departure of kun lares 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.569
 the microphone output 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.029
 the dv jean 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.329
 but we will be the team 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.629
 we will see 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.499
 settler that keyboard 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.620
 it is highly the same size as lassus 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.249
 but here 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.499
 the transpac that is also similar in size 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.499
 clear that the air sector is unemployed as Saturday at home 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:16.970
 as well 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.650
 exists in white in pink 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.879
 in yellow 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.039
 the finish is bright 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.039
 but the construction looks like some plates what thing 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.150
 at home you had to think 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.340
 yes you are going to give me a hard deal 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.120
 although there are ten strings 199 euros 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.550
 they do not have either 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.789
 rock not be 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.459
 while those of asus are for grapes for several months 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:42.490
 she is 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.039
 a much more complete team inves to you and also at a very competitive price 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 I know everything if we take into account that it is that she sells in Spain 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.110
 We had no need to say that as they have a personalized model in the 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.610
 eclipse colors 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.210
 Pedro 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.000
 but good 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.750
 I will not let him get jealous and all our asus we also love him and 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.050
 we are going to put a couple of applications now so you do not get jealous 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.590
 and meanwhile even if I understood
