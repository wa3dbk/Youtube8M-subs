at<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> eat<00:02:04.320> rats

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
at all it's not you have to eat rats

because<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.740> no<00:02:10.950> protein<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.670> plant

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
because there is no protein in plant

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.420 
because there is no protein in plant

and<00:02:18.960> secondly<00:02:19.320> that's<00:02:19.470> okay<00:02:19.860> but<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:20.970> to

twelve thirteen in a comment and they're
kind<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.820> eight<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.630> now<00:03:03.750> some<00:03:04.020> science<00:03:04.350> go

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
kind of eight and now some science go

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.140 
kind of eight and now some science go
actually<00:03:04.709> use<00:03:04.920> only<00:03:05.100> six<00:03:05.370> accentuate<00:03:06.060> her

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
actually use only six accentuate her

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.270 
actually use only six accentuate her
assets<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.959> all<00:03:07.080> plant<00:03:07.320> foods<00:03:07.380> have<00:03:07.709> all<00:03:07.860> six

as<00:03:15.560> yeah<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:16.709> first<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.100> not<00:03:17.220> enough<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:17.700> then

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
as yeah so first is not enough and then

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.820 
as yeah so first is not enough and then
there's<00:03:18.150> another<00:03:18.270> eyes<00:03:18.630> there's<00:03:19.140> too<00:03:19.590> much

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
there's another eyes there's too much
