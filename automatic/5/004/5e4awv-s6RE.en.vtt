00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.590
 Y 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.969
 and what happens that costs you more because 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.709
 It is very well today here Uruguay 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.209
 welcome to this new tutorial in the 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.529
 which I will show you how to improve how 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.150
 activate the pack a pons or better said 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.529
 how to build it to do this we have 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.790
 to get to the city and once 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.070
 arriving the first door to which 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.330
 we come in is actually the bank in this 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.130
 bank to see what a box looks like 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.840
 strong to which we have to throw a 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.399
 granada when throwing the pomegranate we have 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.200
 access to the bank itself which then 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.190
 I will explain its use that we can deposit and 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.050
 take out money 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.670
 and inside this one we are going to find 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.680
 still another safe to which 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.420
 we have to throw another grenade once 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.860
 to open we will have access to the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.329
 door where the pack is located 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.070
 pons but this door is closed and 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.780
 has an electricity sign which 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.160
 means that we have to have that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.690
 give power this door but as 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.980
 we have to give it good power if 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.870
 we go to where is the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.429
 power switch to this station and 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.199
 we open this door in the bottom 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.210
 let's see a door which has the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.649
 same electricity symbol and asks you 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.329
 give him energy as we give him 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.159
 good energy with the turbine that already 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.140
 explained some of its uses in 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.370
 past videos but good what is the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.900
 problem that if we put the 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.690
 turbine just in front of the door 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.490
 Once we get out of the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.230
 power station possibly the truck 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.720
 is no longer there and what 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.730
 because the truck is expected very little and 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.500
 We took a lot of time giving it all the way back 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.360
 lowering then the turbine giving all the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.320
 back and once we get out the truck 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.550
 it will not be there then 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.200
 we have to do good we have to 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.640
 get to the station and you do not have to go down 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.860
 do not go down, you do not have to go down 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.380
 simply put the turbine next to 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.640
 the east door this will be more than 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.260
 enough to reach to give the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.630
 energy to the door and simply the 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.670
 they put back and they get on the truck and they 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.900
 they are completely sure that the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.150
 turbine I say that the truck is going to 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.770
 continue there so they arrive in town and 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.300
 diego to the city sorry and once 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.520
 come the door is already going to be open 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.710
 when they go down the door he will enter 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.900
 some laboratories types five type five 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.430
 where are all the doors I say 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.860
 all the parts of the pack up on are three 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.110
 parts that would be the battery the table and 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.090
 the pack a points itself so the table 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.530
 construction is up here is not 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.490
 worry if the turbine is destroyed for 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.650
 those who do not know turbine then 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.030
 obviously you have a time limit if you 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.110
 destroy do not worry you leave network 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.510
 energy the door is not going to close 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.100
 until you get out of these 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.020
 laboratories then here to build 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.490
 the battery then build the table 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.050
 As I always tell you, it is not necessary 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.520
 that this be in order and finally 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.200
 find the machine paid the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.220
 which is always in the same place 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.660
 two other things 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.160
 in the same place but it's not that hard 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.620
 find them since it's simply 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.330
 can appear on the side tables 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.040
 of Ivan or recharge the barrels well a 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.780
 once finished we will have the pack up 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.370
 on ready to be able to improve any 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.470
 weapon gentlemen as always costs 5 thousand 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.820
 weights good points better said and it fits 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.080
 mention that this has to be with the 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.420
 power on if you have the 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.800
 power off no problem can they 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.360
 simply put a turbine give 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.710
 be able to pack pons and improve so 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.300
 thanks for nothing because people will see that 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.860
 all the tutorial take care of us 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.860
 we see later goodbye
