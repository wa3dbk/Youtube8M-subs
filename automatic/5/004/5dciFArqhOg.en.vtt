hello everyone welcome back to part two
of<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.389> replay<00:00:03.720> drones<00:00:04.470> are<00:00:04.710> still<00:00:05.040> mining

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
of this replay drones are still mining

of this replay drones are still mining
out<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.730> here<00:00:05.879> very<00:00:06.089> very<00:00:06.210> effectively<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.930> is

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
out of here very very effectively and is

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.509 
out of here very very effectively and is
pretty<00:00:07.350> much<00:00:07.440> saturating<00:00:08.099> both<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.429> these

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
pretty much saturating both of these

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.770 
pretty much saturating both of these
mineral<00:00:08.849> patches<00:00:09.150> should<00:00:09.300> probably<00:00:09.570> try<00:00:09.690> to

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
mineral patches should probably try to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.259 
mineral patches should probably try to
transfer<00:00:10.349> some<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.679> these<00:00:10.889> drones<00:00:11.670> over<00:00:12.030> here

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
transfer some of these drones over here

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.799 
transfer some of these drones over here
to<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.630> north<00:00:12.990> side<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.530> order<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.389> just

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
to this north side in order to and just

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.720 
to this north side in order to and just
get<00:00:16.139> better<00:00:16.289> bang<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:16.710> your<00:00:17.070> buck<00:00:17.130> sin<00:00:17.520> terms

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
get better bang for your buck sin terms

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.700 
get better bang for your buck sin terms
of<00:00:17.850> drone<00:00:18.090> Cal<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.480> yes<00:00:18.660> some<00:00:19.020> drones<00:00:19.320> already

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
of drone Cal and yes some drones already

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.800 
of drone Cal and yes some drones already
being<00:00:19.890> moved<00:00:20.250> out<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.730> nine<00:00:21.000> drones<00:00:21.330> being

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
being moved out so nine drones being

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.390 
being moved out so nine drones being
moved<00:00:22.080> out<00:00:22.230> from<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.650> main<00:00:22.890> mineral<00:00:23.070> patch

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
moved out from that main mineral patch

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.750 
moved out from that main mineral patch
and<00:00:24.090> banelings<00:00:24.600> also<00:00:24.930> being<00:00:25.920> morphed<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.580> as

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and banelings also being morphed in as

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.009 
and banelings also being morphed in as
well<00:00:26.970> as<00:00:27.090> those<00:00:27.269> paintings<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
well as those paintings going to be a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.859 
well as those paintings going to be a
very<00:00:28.199> very<00:00:28.740> difficult<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.730> problem<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.689> any

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
very very difficult and problem for any

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.319 
very very difficult and problem for any
Marines<00:00:31.349> however<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.640> any<00:00:32.850> Marines

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
Marines however I do not see any Marines

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.600 
Marines however I do not see any Marines
at<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.660> stage<00:00:33.870> only<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.469> marine<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.460> that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
at this stage only one marine from that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.610 
at this stage only one marine from that
really<00:00:35.910> part<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.329> game<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.750> those<00:00:36.899> saw

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
really part of that game so those saw

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.470 
really part of that game so those saw
those<00:00:37.739> banelings<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.149> trying<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
those banelings will really be trying to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.819 
those banelings will really be trying to
splash<00:00:39.750> against<00:00:40.110> those<00:00:40.290> perhaps<00:00:40.649> those

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
splash against those perhaps those

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.700 
splash against those perhaps those
Marauders<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.969> dealing<00:00:42.390> 20<00:00:42.780> damage<00:00:43.079> against

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
Marauders the dealing 20 damage against

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
Marauders the dealing 20 damage against
those<00:00:43.800> Marauders<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.550> those<00:00:44.789> stores<00:00:45.149> however

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
those Marauders and those stores however

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.750 
those Marauders and those stores however
that's<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.670> much

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that's not going to really be that much

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.360 
that's not going to really be that much
damage<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.360> Thor<00:00:48.629> dealing<00:00:49.379> 50<00:00:49.829> damage<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
damage as that Thor dealing 50 damage a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.160 
damage as that Thor dealing 50 damage a
shot<00:00:50.610> against<00:00:51.329> those<00:00:51.420> paintings<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.079> those

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
shot against those paintings and those

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
shot against those paintings and those
paintings<00:00:52.530> shoulds<00:00:52.739> pretty<00:00:53.070> much<00:00:53.250> pop<00:00:53.879> before

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
paintings shoulds pretty much pop before

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.959 
paintings shoulds pretty much pop before
they're<00:00:54.660> able<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.100> unleash<00:00:56.100> their<00:00:56.370> acid<00:00:56.789> on

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
they're able to unleash their acid on

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.689 
they're able to unleash their acid on
top<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.420> those<00:00:57.539> stores<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:58.309> Marauders<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.340> do

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
top of those stores as Marauders are do

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
top of those stores as Marauders are do
they<00:00:59.730> have<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> concussion<00:01:00.660> missile<00:01:00.989> yes

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
they have the concussion missile yes

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.720 
they have the concussion missile yes
they<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.829> fact<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.340> concussion
