00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
this trick we're going to need the 1 the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.979 
this trick we're going to need the 1 the
2<00:00:40.130> the<00:00:40.430> three<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:41.630> the<00:00:42.079> fourth<00:00:42.470> ace<00:00:43.900> so<00:00:44.900> we're

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
2 the three and the fourth ace so we're

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.130 
2 the three and the fourth ace so we're
gonna<00:00:45.079> take<00:00:45.350> these<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.660> learn<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:47.840> pattern

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
gonna take these and learn the pattern

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.090 
gonna take these and learn the pattern
of<00:00:48.350> red<00:00:48.739> black<00:00:49.520> red<00:00:49.820> black<00:00:50.739> just<00:00:51.739> remember

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
of red black red black just remember

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.060 
of red black red black just remember
that<00:00:52.220> red<00:00:52.489> black<00:00:52.970> red<00:00:53.180> black<00:00:53.620> so<00:00:54.620> if<00:00:54.680> we<00:00:54.770> square

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
that red black red black so if we square

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.950 
that red black red black so if we square
these<00:00:55.190> up<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.880> we<00:00:55.970> take<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.239> bottom<00:00:56.510> card<00:00:56.750> so

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
these up and we take the bottom card so

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.010 
these up and we take the bottom card so
that's<00:00:57.079> red<00:00:57.380> if<00:00:57.860> we<00:00:58.010> put<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.340> red<00:00:58.989> right<00:00:59.989> there

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
that's red if we put the red right there

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.290 
that's red if we put the red right there
and<00:01:00.530> we<00:01:01.100> take<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.370> next<00:01:01.670> card<00:01:01.940> down<00:01:02.120> which

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
and we take the next card down which

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.439 
and we take the next card down which
would<00:01:02.450> be<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.290> other<00:01:03.410> red<00:01:03.739> Ace<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.070> Hearts<00:01:04.449> to

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
would be the other red Ace of Hearts to

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.719 
would be the other red Ace of Hearts to
base<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.840> hearts<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.259> put<00:01:06.409> that<00:01:06.590> down<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.700> we

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
base of hearts and put that down so we

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.959 
base of hearts and put that down so we
have<00:01:08.030> hearts<00:01:08.869> diamonds<00:01:09.969> spades<00:01:10.969> clubs<00:01:11.329> right

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
have hearts diamonds spades clubs right

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.889 
have hearts diamonds spades clubs right
actually<00:01:13.969> we<00:01:14.149> can<00:01:14.270> actually<00:01:14.420> get<00:01:14.630> them<00:01:14.749> to

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
actually we can actually get them to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.999 
actually we can actually get them to
jump<00:01:15.520> from<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.700> tape<00:01:16.909> or<00:01:17.149> from<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.630> table<00:01:18.079> to

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
jump from the tape or from the table to

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.169 
jump from the tape or from the table to
my<00:01:19.159> hand<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.729> have<00:01:19.909> them<00:01:20.090> switch<00:01:21.520> okay<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:22.759> for
