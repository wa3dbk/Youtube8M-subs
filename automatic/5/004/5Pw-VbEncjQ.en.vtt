full<00:01:42.119> or<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.630> would<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.780> great<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.649> was

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
doubt is just sitting here like right at

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.140 
doubt is just sitting here like right at
the<00:05:33.380> beginning<00:05:33.470> of<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.800> game<00:05:34.000> probably<00:05:35.000> some

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
the beginning of the game probably some

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.969 
the beginning of the game probably some
probably<00:05:35.720> some<00:05:35.870> decent<00:05:36.289> exploring<00:05:36.770> to<00:05:36.860> do

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
probably some decent exploring to do

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.520 
probably some decent exploring to do
like<00:05:37.250> here<00:05:37.430> we<00:05:37.490> go<00:05:37.580> three<00:05:37.820> pink<00:05:38.060> flowers<00:05:38.530> hope

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
like here we go three pink flowers hope

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.210 
like here we go three pink flowers hope
that's<00:05:39.710> four<00:05:40.900> so<00:05:41.900> yeah<00:05:42.229> I'm<00:05:42.680> gonna<00:05:42.919> guess<00:05:43.190> that

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
that's four so yeah I'm gonna guess that

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.770 
that's four so yeah I'm gonna guess that
we<00:05:43.520> might<00:05:43.699> not<00:05:43.849> find<00:05:43.910> these<00:05:44.330> keys<00:05:44.509> for<00:05:44.750> a

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
we might not find these keys for a

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.150 
we might not find these keys for a
little<00:05:44.900> bit<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.199> come<00:05:45.380> but<00:05:45.560> that's<00:05:45.770> okay<00:05:46.130> I

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
little bit to come but that's okay I

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.680 
little bit to come but that's okay I
mean<00:05:46.490> that's<00:05:46.610> what<00:05:46.910> these<00:05:47.030> open<00:05:47.330> world<00:05:47.479> games

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
mean that's what these open world games

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.180 
mean that's what these open world games
are<00:05:47.840> for<00:05:47.990> it<00:05:48.409> would<00:05:48.560> suck<00:05:48.740> if<00:05:48.800> there<00:05:49.039> was<00:05:49.130> only

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
are for it would suck if there was only

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.689 
are for it would suck if there was only
like<00:05:49.340> 10<00:05:49.639> minutes<00:05:49.820> of<00:05:49.970> gameplay<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:51.610> don't<00:05:52.610> even

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
like 10 minutes of gameplay I don't even

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.159 
like 10 minutes of gameplay I don't even
