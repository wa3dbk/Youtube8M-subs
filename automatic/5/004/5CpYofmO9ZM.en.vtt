and<00:06:03.680> then<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:04.770> just<00:06:05.040> broke<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.520> crawls<00:06:05.790> up<00:06:05.940> a

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
and then I just broke the crawls up a

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.650 
and then I just broke the crawls up a
bit<00:06:06.270> with<00:06:06.420> my<00:06:06.450> fingers<00:06:10.880> now<00:06:11.880> to<00:06:11.940> smooth<00:06:12.510> out

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
bit with my fingers now to smooth out

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.420 
bit with my fingers now to smooth out
the<00:06:12.840> section<00:06:13.260> in<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.500> front<00:06:13.680> because<00:06:14.310> I

the section in the front because I

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.160 
the section in the front because I
wanted<00:06:14.700> a<00:06:14.820> bit<00:06:15.000> of<00:06:15.030> a<00:06:15.180> flatter<00:06:15.480> look<00:06:15.780> up<00:06:15.930> there

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
wanted a bit of a flatter look up there

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.710 
wanted a bit of a flatter look up there
I<00:06:16.380> just<00:06:16.890> took<00:06:17.010> my<00:06:17.070> hand<00:06:17.220> a<00:06:17.580> titanium<00:06:17.970> flat<00:06:18.480> iron

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
I just took my hand a titanium flat iron

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.030 
I just took my hand a titanium flat iron
and<00:06:19.050> just<00:06:19.700> smooth<00:06:20.700> out<00:06:20.910> a<00:06:21.180> few<00:06:21.600> pieces<00:06:22.040> towards

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
and just smooth out a few pieces towards

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.490 
and just smooth out a few pieces towards
the<00:06:23.130> front<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.640> base<00:06:23.850> of<00:06:24.060> my<00:06:24.240> hair<00:06:24.270> I

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.270 

don't<00:06:28.500> know<00:06:28.590> if<00:06:28.710> you<00:06:28.830> can<00:06:28.980> tell<00:06:29.190> the

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
don't know if you can tell the

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.460 
don't know if you can tell the
difference<00:06:29.670> between<00:06:29.730> the<00:06:30.510> hair<00:06:31.140> that's<00:06:31.320> in

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
the front and the hair that's in the

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.420 
the front and the hair that's in the
center<00:06:33.570> crown<00:06:34.050> of<00:06:34.290> my<00:06:34.440> head<00:06:34.680> where<00:06:34.980> I<00:06:35.010> had<00:06:35.250> the

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
bit more volume there so that's the
