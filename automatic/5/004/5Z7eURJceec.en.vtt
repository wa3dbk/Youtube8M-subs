to ha to put the anti zero to fix on and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.730 
to ha to put the anti zero to fix on and
the<00:01:07.920> safe<00:01:08.280> config<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:10.729> region-free

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
the safe config and the region-free

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.660 
the safe config and the region-free
should<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.330> not<00:01:15.539> for<00:01:15.840> me<00:01:16.369> but<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
should be on but it's not for me but I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.309 
should be on but it's not for me but I
don't<00:01:18.299> know<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> helped<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:18.899> not<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.229> I

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319 
don't know if it helped or not but I

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.910 
don't know if it helped or not but I
have<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.649> on<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.300> guess<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.690> put

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
have it on and then I guess when you put

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.380 
have it on and then I guess when you put
in<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.190> all<00:01:23.280> these<00:01:23.399> settings<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.500> load<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
in put all these settings on load a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.380 
in put all these settings on load a
normal<00:01:27.390> game<00:01:27.649> through<00:01:28.649> this<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.360> see<00:01:30.360> if

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
normal game through this one and see if

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.210 
normal game through this one and see if
that<00:01:30.630> won't<00:01:30.780> save<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.049> settings<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:31.979> then

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
that won't save the settings and then

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
that won't save the settings and then
after<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> load<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.580> game<00:01:36.030> works<00:01:36.479> come<00:01:36.899> back

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
after you load that game works come back

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
after you load that game works come back
to<00:01:37.470> neo<00:01:37.679> gamma<00:01:37.950> settings<00:01:38.399> and<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> saved

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
to neo gamma settings and then the saved

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.279 
to neo gamma settings and then the saved
config<00:01:39.780> should<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.259> turn<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.310> off<00:01:42.259> go<00:01:43.259> back
