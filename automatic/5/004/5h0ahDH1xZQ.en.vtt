a summon curry but our favorite happens

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.330 
a summon curry but our favorite happens
to<00:02:02.060> be<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.329> pan<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:02.689> curry<00:02:02.899> pen<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:03.920> curry<00:02:04.100> is

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
to be the pan in curry pen and curry is

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.480 
to be the pan in curry pen and curry is
a<00:02:04.369> lot<00:02:04.670> like<00:02:05.119> red<00:02:05.450> curry<00:02:05.719> except<00:02:06.320> it's<00:02:06.490> less

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
a lot like red curry except it's less

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.609

the<00:02:09.950> reason<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.369> like<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:10.759> because<00:02:10.849> it<00:02:11.269> pairs

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
the reason I like it is because it pairs

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.539 
the reason I like it is because it pairs
like<00:02:11.660> peanut<00:02:12.290> butter<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.920> put<00:02:13.190> into<00:02:13.370> this

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
like peanut butter that I put into this

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.300 
like peanut butter that I put into this
recipe<00:02:14.410> that's<00:02:15.410> another<00:02:15.680> ingredient<00:02:16.220> you're

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310
