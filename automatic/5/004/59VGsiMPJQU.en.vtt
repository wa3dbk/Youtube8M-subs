alright<00:00:02.610> here's<00:00:02.879> my<00:00:03.210> new<00:00:03.449> pivot<00:00:04.380> design<00:00:05.009> I

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
alright here's my new pivot design I

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.570 
alright here's my new pivot design I
have<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:06.259> clamped<00:00:07.259> with<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:08.130> little<00:00:08.370> clamp

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
have it clamped with this little clamp

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.009 
have it clamped with this little clamp
on<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> piece<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.210> metal<00:00:09.360> held<00:00:09.690> them<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.900> this

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
on a piece of metal held them to this

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.209 
on a piece of metal held them to this
piece<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.260> metal<00:00:10.410> just<00:00:10.679> so<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.860> lets<00:00:14.040> held

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
piece of metal just so I so lets held

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.620 
piece of metal just so I so lets held
there<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.639> hold<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.880> camera<00:00:15.059> why<00:00:15.389> show

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
there so I can hold the camera why show

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.529 
there so I can hold the camera why show
you<00:00:15.690> how<00:00:15.780> well<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.080> pivot<00:00:17.210> it's<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.390> that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
you how well it pivot it's not that

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.010 
you how well it pivot it's not that
fancy

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.689 

two<00:00:22.020> pieces<00:00:22.439> steel<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.890> act<00:00:23.039> as<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> handle

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
two pieces steel to act as the handle

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.160 
two pieces steel to act as the handle
there's<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:24.330> block<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.080> that's

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
there's a little block back here that's

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.920 
there's a little block back here that's
welded<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.680> these<00:00:25.800> two<00:00:26.010> everything's<00:00:26.400> rounded

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
welded to these two everything's rounded

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.659 
welded to these two everything's rounded
it's<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.019> lot<00:00:28.170> thicker<00:00:28.470> than<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:31.489> it<00:00:32.489> normally

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it's a lot thicker than what it normally

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.200 
it's a lot thicker than what it normally
would<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:34.219> but<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> had<00:00:36.059> at

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
would be but that's just what I had at

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.889 
would be but that's just what I had at
time<00:00:37.820> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.120> ball<00:00:39.360> bearings<00:00:39.690> in

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
time you can see the ball bearings in

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.440 
time you can see the ball bearings in
there<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:43.079> two<00:00:43.579> button<00:00:44.579> head<00:00:44.789> screws<00:00:45.180> on

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
there and the two button head screws on

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.200 
there and the two button head screws on
the<00:00:45.570> either<00:00:45.719> side<00:00:46.070> I've<00:00:47.070> got<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.760> made<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the either side I've got that I made a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.760 
the either side I've got that I made a
tube<00:00:48.510> that's<00:00:48.719> threaded<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> set<00:00:49.530> screw

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
tube that's threaded with the set screw

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
tube that's threaded with the set screw
inside<00:00:50.190> I'll<00:00:50.820> show<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.300> how<00:00:51.570> well<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.989> pivots

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
inside I'll show you how well it pivots

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.260 
inside I'll show you how well it pivots
so<00:00:52.850> if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.960> swing<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.969 

can<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.510> how<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:02.090> works<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.539> well<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
can see how it works really well and of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280 
can see how it works really well and of
course<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> Nitta<00:01:05.760> kit<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.080> tune

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
course you to Nitta kit can you can tune

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.190 
course you to Nitta kit can you can tune
it<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.850> however<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.360> want

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.990 

but<00:01:13.200> yeah<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.650> got<00:01:14.010> hardly<00:01:14.250> any<00:01:14.369> friction<00:01:14.909> on

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
but yeah it's got hardly any friction on

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.080 
but yeah it's got hardly any friction on
it<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.520> there's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.440 

no<00:01:22.759> play<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.179> at<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.109> not<00:01:26.450> it's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
no play in it at all like it's not it's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
no play in it at all like it's not it's
not<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.469> know<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.619> don't<00:01:28.859> have<00:01:28.979> any<00:01:29.189> jiggle

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
not you know you don't have any jiggle

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.330 
not you know you don't have any jiggle
nests<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.319> my<00:01:31.319> bobblehead<00:01:31.740> giggles<00:01:32.219> I'm

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
nests in it my bobblehead giggles I'm

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.590 
nests in it my bobblehead giggles I'm
going<00:01:32.429> to<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.700> now

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.969 

but<00:01:36.600> yeah<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.380> solid<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.829> don't

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
but yeah it's really solid you don't

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.770 
but yeah it's really solid you don't
have<00:01:38.130> any<00:01:38.310> movement<00:01:39.179> this<00:01:39.420> way<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:41.659> what<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
have any movement this way and what you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.889 
have any movement this way and what you
said<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.140> pivots<00:01:43.319> just<00:01:44.329> beautifully<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
said it pivots just beautifully and of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.149 
said it pivots just beautifully and of
course<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.530> adjusted<00:01:50.069> by

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
course it can all be adjusted by

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.370 
course it can all be adjusted by
tightening<00:01:50.640> these<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.299> take<00:01:51.329> out<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
tightening these you take out one and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 
tightening these you take out one and
then<00:01:52.829> adjust<00:01:53.189> your<00:01:53.280> set<00:01:53.579> screw<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.090> where<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
then adjust your set screw to where you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.669 
then adjust your set screw to where you
want<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.049> then<00:01:55.170> tighten<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.500> down<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
want it and then tighten it down a

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.620 
want it and then tighten it down a
little<00:01:55.799> bit<00:01:55.979> more<00:01:56.159> thinking<00:01:56.970> about<00:01:57.119> changing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
little bit more thinking about changing

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.149 
little bit more thinking about changing
it<00:01:57.659> maybe<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.989> little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.349> and<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:58.770> between

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it maybe a little bit and then between

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.940 
it maybe a little bit and then between
the<00:01:59.549> set<00:01:59.729> screw<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.239> the<00:02:01.170> button<00:02:01.409> head<00:02:01.619> screw

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the set screw and the button head screw

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.880 
the set screw and the button head screw
maybe<00:02:02.219> putting<00:02:02.489> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> piece<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.890> little

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
maybe putting in the piece of little

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
maybe putting in the piece of little
copper<00:02:05.310> disc<00:02:05.610> or<00:02:06.090> piece<00:02:06.569> of<00:02:06.750> hard<00:02:06.929> rubber

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
copper disc or piece of hard rubber

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.529 
copper disc or piece of hard rubber
something<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.539> even

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
something like that so that you can even

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.969 
something like that so that you can even
though<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.049> set<00:02:10.289> against<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.799> set

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
though you have it set against the set

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
though you have it set against the set
screw<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.340> still<00:02:11.730> gives<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.569> bit

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
screw it still gives you a little bit

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.430 
screw it still gives you a little bit
more<00:02:14.150> ability<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.420> cinch<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.930> down<00:02:15.959> just<00:02:16.319> to

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
more ability to cinch it down just to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.410 
more ability to cinch it down just to
touch<00:02:16.709> more<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.370> don't<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.790> rely<00:02:18.390> on

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
touch more so you don't have to rely on

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.440 
touch more so you don't have to rely on
super<00:02:18.959> fine<00:02:19.170> control<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:20.790> depth<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.269> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
super fine control of the depth of the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.930 
super fine control of the depth of the
set<00:02:21.629> screw<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.319> other<00:02:22.470> than<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.940> everything

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
set screw but other than that everything

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.379 
set screw but other than that everything
instead<00:02:24.510> everything<00:02:24.810> works<00:02:26.150> really<00:02:27.150> good<00:02:27.299> it

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:29.389 
instead everything works really good it

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.030 
instead everything works really good it
it's<00:02:30.389> yeah<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.079> these<00:02:31.500> are<00:02:31.560> ball<00:02:31.769> bearings

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it's yeah and these are ball bearings

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.500 
it's yeah and these are ball bearings
aren't<00:02:32.190> even<00:02:32.370> greased<00:02:32.670> or<00:02:32.880> anything<00:02:33.299> they're

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
aren't even greased or anything they're

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.080 
aren't even greased or anything they're
just<00:02:33.750> they're<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.680> dry<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.519> once<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.819> grease

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
just they're just dry so once you grease

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.449 
just they're just dry so once you grease
some<00:02:36.329> put<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.139> little<00:02:37.260> bit<00:02:37.380> wd-40<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.099> there<00:02:38.220> or

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
some put a little bit wd-40 in there or

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.420 
some put a little bit wd-40 in there or
a<00:02:38.489> little<00:02:38.670> bit<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.000> high<00:02:39.450> pressure<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
a little bit of high pressure a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.819 
a little bit of high pressure a
synthetic<00:02:41.430> lubricant<00:02:42.109> it<00:02:43.109> makes<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:43.530> run

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
synthetic lubricant it makes it just run

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.720 
synthetic lubricant it makes it just run
awesome<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.900> hope<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.769> makes<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.489> can

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
awesome so I hope it makes it so you can

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.180 
awesome so I hope it makes it so you can
able<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:48.680> understand<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.829> doesn't<00:02:50.069> really

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
able to understand it doesn't really

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.360 
able to understand it doesn't really
focus<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.849> well<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.239> there<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:52.099> yeah<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
focus that well in there but yeah in the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.330 
focus that well in there but yeah in the
real<00:02:53.669> knife<00:02:54.209> they'll<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.870> less<00:02:55.739> spacing<00:02:56.190> than

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
real knife they'll be less spacing than

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.970 
real knife they'll be less spacing than
this<00:02:56.519> but<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.480> my<00:02:57.750> drawing<00:02:58.079> on<00:02:58.410> line<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.650> have

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
this but in my drawing on line I have

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.520 
this but in my drawing on line I have
about<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.579> know<00:03:00.000> 10,000<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.139> that's<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.380> how

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
about I know 10,000 but that's just how

about I know 10,000 but that's just how
I<00:03:01.560> drew<00:03:01.859> it<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.190> was<00:03:02.700> planning<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.090> anywhere

I drew it I was planning on anywhere

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:08.750 
I drew it I was planning on anywhere
between<00:03:03.599> 20<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.079> 30<00:03:06.169> but<00:03:07.169> yeah<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.950> works<00:03:08.190> works

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
between 20 to 30 but yeah it works works

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.420 
between 20 to 30 but yeah it works works
amazingly<00:03:09.209> well<00:03:09.329> so<00:03:10.230> hope<00:03:10.919> that<00:03:11.099> answers<00:03:11.370> your
