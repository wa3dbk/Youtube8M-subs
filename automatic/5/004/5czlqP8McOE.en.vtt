00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the next or two and here's an artist's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.380 
the next or two and here's an artist's
rendering<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.820> looks<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.119> when

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
rendering of what it looks like when

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880 
rendering of what it looks like when
it's<00:01:45.539> done<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.200> roller<00:01:46.440> coaster<00:01:46.770> will

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it's done the roller coaster will

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
it's done the roller coaster will
actually<00:01:47.190> go<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.880> under<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> track<00:01:48.960> our

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
actually go up and under the track our

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.350 
actually go up and under the track our
fourth<00:01:49.500> dimension<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.550> most<00:01:50.729> call

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
fourth dimension is one of the most call

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.059 
fourth dimension is one of the most call
I<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.690> call<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.869> most<00:01:52.110> extreme<00:01:52.500> coaster<00:01:52.770> in

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
I think call the most extreme coaster in

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.100 
I think call the most extreme coaster in
the<00:01:53.099> world<00:01:53.190> this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.179> a<00:01:54.360> prototype<00:01:54.599> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the world this is just a prototype of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.249 
the world this is just a prototype of
course<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.220> real<00:01:56.399> thing<00:01:57.170> hopefully<00:01:58.170> I'm

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.980 
good thing it's a short ride there is
the<00:02:34.220> theory<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:35.270> can<00:02:35.480> build<00:02:35.750> something

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
the theory that you can build something

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.920 
the theory that you can build something
too<00:02:36.980> extreme<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> challenge<00:02:38.180> make<00:02:38.780> it

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
too extreme so the challenge make it

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.540 
too extreme so the challenge make it
thrilling<00:02:39.200> enough<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.680> bring<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.920> scare<00:02:40.310> but

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
thrilling enough to bring a scare but

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.130 
thrilling enough to bring a scare but
not<00:02:40.820> scary<00:02:41.210> enough<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.510> keep<00:02:41.720> people<00:02:42.050> from

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
not scary enough to keep people from

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.840 
not scary enough to keep people from
riding<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.770> that's<00:02:43.220> why<00:02:43.400> they<00:02:43.550> build

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
riding and that's why they build

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.540 
riding and that's why they build
prototypes<00:02:44.420> right<00:02:45.200> here<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:46.070> open<00:02:46.370> range
