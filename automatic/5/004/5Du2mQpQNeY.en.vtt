the character Fagin the criminal coach

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.200 
the character Fagin the criminal coach
he<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.440> constantly<00:02:37.770> referred<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.910> Jew

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
he is constantly referred to as the Jew

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.150 
he is constantly referred to as the Jew
and<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.810> read<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.200> Dickens<00:02:40.500> defended<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and I read that Dickens defended this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.040 
and I read that Dickens defended this
stereotype<00:02:41.730> by<00:02:42.270> saying<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.660> he<00:02:42.750> was<00:02:42.840> trying

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
stereotype by saying that he was trying

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.320 
stereotype by saying that he was trying
to<00:02:43.200> lampoon<00:02:43.650> several<00:02:44.280> corrupt<00:02:44.700> politicians

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
to lampoon several corrupt politicians

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.150 
to lampoon several corrupt politicians
at<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.540> time<00:02:45.780> who<00:02:46.290> happened<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.680> be<00:02:46.770> Jewish

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
at the time who happened to be Jewish

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.180 
at the time who happened to be Jewish
but<00:02:47.720> even<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:48.840> that's<00:02:48.960> true<00:02:49.380> it's<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.740> pretty

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
but even if that's true it's a pretty

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.710 
but even if that's true it's a pretty
weak<00:02:50.460> excuse<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.150> racism

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
weak excuse for racism

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.150 
weak excuse for racism
now<00:02:52.110> another<00:02:52.320> weird<00:02:52.530> thing<00:02:52.590> about<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.980> book

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
now another weird thing about the book

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.980 
now another weird thing about the book
is<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.580> artful<00:02:53.940> dodger<00:02:54.120> has<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> friend

problems<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.500> Dickens<00:03:10.830> was<00:03:11.010> very

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
problems that Dickens was very

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.940 
problems that Dickens was very
passionate<00:03:12.090> about<00:03:12.330> during<00:03:12.720> his<00:03:12.750> lifetime<00:03:13.020> but

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
passionate about during his lifetime but

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.500 
passionate about during his lifetime but
I<00:03:14.010> was<00:03:14.160> pleasantly<00:03:14.340> surprised<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.180> find<00:03:15.360> that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
I was pleasantly surprised to find that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.720 
I was pleasantly surprised to find that
there<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.750> also<00:03:15.990> universal<00:03:16.980> themes<00:03:17.190> about

there is also universal themes about

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.970 
there is also universal themes about
personal<00:03:18.540> environment<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.170> identity<00:03:19.560> it's

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
personal environment and identity it's

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.460 
personal environment and identity it's
very<00:03:20.190> interesting<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:21.540> classic<00:03:22.020> character<00:03:22.350> is
