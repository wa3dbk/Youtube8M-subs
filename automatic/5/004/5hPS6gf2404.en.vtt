00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.679 

now<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.539> tubing<00:01:01.989> should<00:01:02.199> not<00:01:02.379> move<00:01:02.620> at<00:01:02.769> all

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:03.689 
now the tubing should not move at all

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:11.810 
now the tubing should not move at all
however<00:01:05.340> the<00:01:06.340> steel<00:01:06.880> rod<00:01:07.750> inside<00:01:08.759> will<00:01:09.759> move

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
however the steel rod inside will move

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:22.420 
however the steel rod inside will move
slop<00:01:12.820> free

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.890

is go ahead and find a suitable location
where<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.039> want<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.310> mount<00:02:09.399> your<00:02:09.610> tortoise

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
where you want to mount your tortoise

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.770 
where you want to mount your tortoise
keep<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.709> mind<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.930> should<00:02:13.959> keep<00:02:14.379> it

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
keep in mind that you should keep it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.229 
keep in mind that you should keep it
under<00:02:17.069> 18<00:02:18.069> inches<00:02:18.370> away<00:02:18.550> from<00:02:19.500> your<00:02:20.500> actuator

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
under 18 inches away from your actuator

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.050 
under 18 inches away from your actuator
and<00:02:22.239> just<00:02:22.450> line<00:02:22.930> up<00:02:22.959> your<00:02:23.230> tube<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:24.670> give<00:02:24.880> an

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
and just line up your tube to give an

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.820 
and just line up your tube to give an
idea<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:26.069> where<00:02:27.069> it's<00:02:27.250> gonna<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.489> at<00:02:28.680> make<00:02:29.680> sure

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
idea of where it's gonna be at make sure

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.820 
idea of where it's gonna be at make sure
you<00:02:29.950> have<00:02:30.129> enough<00:02:30.370> clearance<00:02:31.019> around<00:02:32.019> the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
you have enough clearance around the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.160 
you have enough clearance around the
mounting<00:02:33.220> plate<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> switch

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
mounting plate so that the switch

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.039 
mounting plate so that the switch
machine<00:02:35.349> will<00:02:35.739> not<00:02:35.890> be<00:02:36.390> striking<00:02:37.390> other

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.039 

switch<00:02:41.049> machines<00:02:41.470> or<00:02:42.180> any<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.329> bench<00:02:43.780> work

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
switch machines or any a bench work

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.259 
switch machines or any a bench work
structure<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:45.239> think<00:02:46.239> in<00:02:47.079> my<00:02:47.230> case<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:49.090> gonna

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
structure I think in my case it's gonna

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.089 
structure I think in my case it's gonna
go<00:02:49.540> right<00:02:49.810> about<00:02:50.019> there

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.339 

so<00:02:55.670> here's<00:02:55.879> a<00:02:55.939> simple<00:02:56.209> explanation<00:02:57.049> of<00:02:57.170> how

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
so here's a simple explanation of how

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.089 
so here's a simple explanation of how
this<00:02:57.499> works<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:58.819> tortoise<00:02:59.920> which<00:03:00.920> was

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
this works the tortoise which was

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.270 
this works the tortoise which was
mounted<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:03.439> base<00:03:04.099> mount<00:03:05.680> will<00:03:06.680> move<00:03:06.859> this

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
mounted on the base mount will move this

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.979 
mounted on the base mount will move this
rod<00:03:08.739> back<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.920> forth<00:03:12.909> the<00:03:13.909> teflon<00:03:14.450> tube<00:03:14.750> is

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
rod back and forth the teflon tube is

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.220 
rod back and forth the teflon tube is
captured<00:03:15.560> here<00:03:18.280> while<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.609> steel<00:03:20.569> inner<00:03:20.900> tube

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
captured here while the steel inner tube

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.270 
captured here while the steel inner tube
is<00:03:21.790> captured<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.969> this<00:03:23.480> plate<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.169> don't<00:03:25.010> know

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
is captured in this plate I don't know

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.490 
is captured in this plate I don't know
if<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.549> could<00:03:25.700> see<00:03:25.939> the<00:03:26.209> grooves<00:03:26.719> the<00:03:27.200> smaller

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
if you could see the grooves the smaller

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.520 
if you could see the grooves the smaller
grooves<00:03:28.810> that's<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.930> difference<00:03:30.260> between

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
grooves that's the difference between

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.990 
grooves that's the difference between
both<00:03:30.739> plates<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.180> need<00:03:32.329> to<00:03:32.419> be<00:03:32.540> careful

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
both plates and you need to be careful

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.289 
both plates and you need to be careful
to<00:03:35.000> use<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.209> correct<00:03:35.689> one<00:03:35.870> as<00:03:36.260> these<00:03:36.560> are<00:03:36.590> keyed

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
to use a correct one as these are keyed

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:46.689 
to use a correct one as these are keyed
in<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:39.530> fit<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:45.079> groove<00:03:45.319> like<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.799> if<00:03:46.549> you

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
in to fit the groove like that if you

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:47.800 
in to fit the groove like that if you
were<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:46.909> put<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.269> one

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
were to put this one

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.110 
were to put this one

all right so here's the assembly all

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.200 
all right so here's the assembly all
built<00:04:07.900> up<00:04:09.000> i've<00:04:10.000> already<00:04:10.210> pre-wired<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:13.120> i

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
built up i've already pre-wired it and i

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.040 
built up i've already pre-wired it and i
am<00:04:13.360> testing<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:15.390> make<00:04:16.390> sure<00:04:16.510> everything<00:04:16.930> works

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.050 
am testing it make sure everything works

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.360 
am testing it make sure everything works
smoothly<00:04:19.020> now<00:04:20.020> all<00:04:20.230> that's<00:04:20.350> left<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.739> do<00:04:20.920> is<00:04:20.950> to

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
smoothly now all that's left to do is to

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.590 
smoothly now all that's left to do is to
install<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.970> in<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.450> layout<00:04:27.150> as<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.270> can<00:04:28.450> see

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
install it in the layout as you can see

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.560 
install it in the layout as you can see
I've<00:04:28.810> mounted<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:30.030> tortoise<00:04:31.030> switch<00:04:31.330> mount

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
I've mounted the tortoise switch mount

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.200 
I've mounted the tortoise switch mount
with<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.320> actuator<00:04:34.110> next<00:04:35.110> step<00:04:35.760> is<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.970> block

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
with the actuator next step is to block

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.250 
with the actuator next step is to block
up<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:38.580> points<00:04:39.580> on<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.940> turnout<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:41.080> it's

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
up the points on the turnout so it's

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.710 
up the points on the turnout so it's
centered<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:43.210> then<00:04:43.540> hook<00:04:44.140> up<00:04:44.290> your<00:04:44.530> wire<00:04:45.720> okay

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
centered and then hook up your wire okay

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.250 
centered and then hook up your wire okay
so<00:04:46.780> you'll<00:04:47.320> Center<00:04:47.710> your<00:04:47.890> wire<00:04:49.020> you'll<00:04:50.020> also

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
so you'll Center your wire you'll also

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.380 
so you'll Center your wire you'll also
Center<00:04:51.510> your<00:04:52.510> switch<00:04:53.170> machine<00:04:53.820> so<00:04:54.820> everything

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
Center your switch machine so everything

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.200 
Center your switch machine so everything
is<00:04:55.510> centered<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.320> turnout<00:04:56.980> on<00:04:57.700> top<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.150> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
is centered the turnout on top of the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.040 
is centered the turnout on top of the
layout<00:04:58.390> in<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:59.560> switch<00:04:59.830> machine<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.340> centered

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
layout in the switch machine is centered

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.310 
layout in the switch machine is centered
and<00:05:02.050> then<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.800> block<00:05:03.070> up<00:05:03.310> your<00:05:03.490> wire<00:05:07.080> at<00:05:08.080> that

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
and then you block up your wire at that

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.480 
and then you block up your wire at that
position<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:10.510> just<00:05:10.780> go<00:05:10.960> ahead<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.500> tighten

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
position and just go ahead and tighten

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.510 
position and just go ahead and tighten
this<00:05:12.580> group<00:05:12.850> right<00:05:13.810> there

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.540 

okay<00:05:19.300> so<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.600> wire<00:05:19.810> has<00:05:19.990> been<00:05:20.020> secured<00:05:20.650> in<00:05:20.919> the

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
okay so the wire has been secured in the

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.860 
okay so the wire has been secured in the
center<00:05:21.850> position<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:23.800> have<00:05:24.009> the<00:05:24.130> wire

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
center position you have the wire

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.200 
center position you have the wire
connected<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:26.020> actuator<00:05:26.789> now<00:05:27.789> we'll<00:05:27.970> see

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
connected to the actuator now we'll see

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.960 
connected to the actuator now we'll see
how<00:05:28.690> it<00:05:28.840> works<00:05:29.050> from<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:29.380> top

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.350 

alright<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.300> here's<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.630> switch<00:05:36.930> machine

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
alright and here's the switch machine

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.790 
alright and here's the switch machine
actually<00:05:39.360> working

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800
