although<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.610> actually<00:03:24.909> think<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.420> works

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
although I actually think it works

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.420 
although I actually think it works
better<00:03:25.840> just<00:03:26.200> by<00:03:26.349> holding<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.250> Wii

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
better just by holding the Wii

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.280 
better just by holding the Wii
controller<00:03:27.819> sideways<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.599> using<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.049> d-pad

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.380 
controller sideways and using the d-pad
to<00:03:29.709> steer<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.519> plays<00:03:30.849> well<00:03:31.060> it's<00:03:31.239> not<00:03:31.329> a

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
to steer it plays well it's not a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.970 
to steer it plays well it's not a
terribly<00:03:31.870> ambitious<00:03:32.019> game<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:32.769> then<00:03:32.860> again

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
terribly ambitious game but then again

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.009 
terribly ambitious game but then again
it<00:03:33.220> doesn't<00:03:33.519> need<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.790> be<00:03:33.819> my<00:03:34.599> only<00:03:34.840> criticism

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
it doesn't need to be my only criticism

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.199 
it doesn't need to be my only criticism
is<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.769> game<00:03:36.099> doesn't<00:03:36.579> run<00:03:36.819> smoothly

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
is that the game doesn't run smoothly

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.420 
is that the game doesn't run smoothly
when<00:03:37.510> you're<00:03:37.689> going<00:03:37.959> really<00:03:38.319> fast

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.759 

other<00:03:43.420> than<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.900> think<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.349> perfectly

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
other than that I think it's perfectly

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.130 
other than that I think it's perfectly
playable<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.700> captures<00:03:46.360> these<00:03:46.510> spirits<00:03:47.019> of

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
playable and captures these spirits of

playable and captures these spirits of
the<00:03:47.290> outrageous<00:03:47.739> made-up<00:03:48.519> Hot<00:03:48.760> Wheels<00:03:49.090> cars
