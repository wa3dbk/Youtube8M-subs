00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
company updated the design well it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.210 
company updated the design well it
wasn't<00:03:48.180> my<00:03:48.420> idea<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.840> oneth<00:03:49.230> researcher<00:03:50.040> than

this partner they looked round for it
but<00:03:52.440> we<00:03:52.620> totally<00:03:52.830> modified<00:03:53.490> it<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.940> works<00:03:54.360> now

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
but we totally modified it it works now

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.730

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
100 degrees the stabilization lakes are

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.200 
100 degrees the stabilization lakes are
critical<00:05:12.410> in<00:05:12.620> this<00:05:12.860> balancing<00:05:13.460> act<00:05:13.580> they're

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
critical in this balancing act they're

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.780 
critical in this balancing act they're
carrying<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.930> entire<00:05:15.290> weight<00:05:15.620> of<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:16.340> bridge

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
carrying the entire weight of the bridge

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.010 
carrying the entire weight of the bridge
system<00:05:17.300> so<00:05:17.750> we<00:05:18.230> Jack<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:19.120> we<00:05:20.120> use<00:05:20.330> this<00:05:20.570> level

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
system so we Jack and we use this level

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.780 
system so we Jack and we use this level
here<00:05:21.200> to<00:05:21.380> basically<00:05:21.740> balance<00:05:22.280> it<00:05:22.430> out<00:05:22.550> because

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
here to basically balance it out because

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.000 
here to basically balance it out because
we<00:05:23.030> can't<00:05:23.270> have<00:05:23.480> the<00:05:23.600> truck<00:05:23.870> leaning<00:05:24.680> right<00:05:24.830> or

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
we can't have the truck leaning right or

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.500 
we can't have the truck leaning right or
left<00:05:25.220> because<00:05:25.520> of<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.760> stability<00:05:26.270> of<00:05:26.300> the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
left because of the stability of the

bridge<00:05:26.750> we<00:05:26.990> want<00:05:27.170> to<00:05:27.260> make<00:05:27.410> sure<00:05:27.440> that

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
bridge we want to make sure that

everything stays nice and square and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.230 
everything stays nice and square and

straight so we don't pop it over and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.740 
straight so we don't pop it over and
