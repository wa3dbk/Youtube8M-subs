00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.820 

yeah<00:00:08.220> definitely<00:00:08.700> both<00:00:08.880> aye<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.719> love<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.530> I

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
yeah definitely both aye I love the I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.220 
yeah definitely both aye I love the I
love<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.639> amino<00:00:12.000> acid<00:00:12.300> profile<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.840> red<00:00:13.049> meat

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
love the amino acid profile of red meat

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.530 
love the amino acid profile of red meat
I<00:00:13.349> think<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.769> great<00:00:14.610> protein<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.360> rate

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
I think it's great protein the rate

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.980 
I think it's great protein the rate
limiting<00:00:15.900> amino<00:00:16.740> acid<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.300> really

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
limiting amino acid is this is really

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.810 
limiting amino acid is this is really
high<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.170> know<00:00:19.439> rate<00:00:19.980> limiting<00:00:20.310> amino<00:00:20.400> acid

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
high you know rate limiting amino acid

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.980 
high you know rate limiting amino acid
like<00:00:20.939> something<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.359> corn

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
like something like corn

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.269 
like something like corn
I<00:00:22.460> think<00:00:24.320> ll<00:00:25.320> tryptophan<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> rate

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
I think ll tryptophan is the rate

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.620 
I think ll tryptophan is the rate
limiting<00:00:26.400> amino<00:00:26.699> acid<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.359> really

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
limiting amino acid and it's really

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.650 
limiting amino acid and it's really
really<00:00:27.779> low<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.470> might<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.539> you<00:00:30.539> know

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
really low so you might have in you know

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.150 
really low so you might have in you know
in<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.820> one<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.450> gram<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.020> corn<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.010> might

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
in a in one one gram of corn you might

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.549 
in a in one one gram of corn you might
have<00:00:35.630> 100<00:00:36.630> milligrams<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.230> 100

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
have 100 milligrams of this 100

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.750 
have 100 milligrams of this 100
milligrams<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.070> hundred<00:00:38.309> milligrams<00:00:38.610> of

milligrams of this hundred milligrams of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.049 
milligrams of this hundred milligrams of
this<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.239> only<00:00:39.360> two<00:00:39.629> milligrams<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.440> of

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
this and then only two milligrams of of

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.340 
this and then only two milligrams of of
l-tryptophan<00:00:42.059> low<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.200> rate

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
l-tryptophan low and the the rate

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.840 
l-tryptophan low and the the rate
limiting<00:00:43.680> amino<00:00:43.829> acid<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.460> essential

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
limiting amino acid is an essential

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.569 
limiting amino acid is an essential
amino<00:00:44.879> acid<00:00:45.090> that's<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.590> maximum<00:00:47.280> amount<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
amino acid that's the maximum amount of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
amino acid that's the maximum amount of
protein<00:00:47.940> synthesis<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.629> occur<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
protein synthesis that can occur is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
protein synthesis that can occur is
whatever<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> rate<00:00:50.550> limiting<00:00:50.879> essential

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
whatever that rate limiting essential

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.689 
whatever that rate limiting essential
amino<00:00:51.510> acid<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.020> well<00:00:52.410> red<00:00:52.680> meat<00:00:52.890> has<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> great

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
amino acid is well red meat has a great

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.310 
amino acid is well red meat has a great
amino<00:00:54.030> acid<00:00:54.390> spectrum<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> don't<00:00:54.960> ever<00:00:55.110> have

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
amino acid spectrum you don't ever have

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.590 
amino acid spectrum you don't ever have
a<00:00:55.350> real<00:00:55.590> low<00:00:55.829> essential<00:00:56.340> amino<00:00:56.489> acid<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.120> then

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
a real low essential amino acid and then

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
a real low essential amino acid and then
so<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> only<00:00:58.410> problem<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.739> red<00:00:58.859> meat<00:00:59.039> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
so the only problem with red meat is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.740 
so the only problem with red meat is
it's<00:00:59.309> high<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.489> fat<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.690> many

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it's high in fat and it's got so many

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.180 
it's high in fat and it's got so many
benefits<00:01:01.140> high<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.350> iron<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.980> great

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
benefits high in iron and it's great

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
benefits high in iron and it's great
amino<00:01:02.430> acid<00:01:02.789> profile<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.019> generally

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
amino acid profile but it's generally

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.600 
amino acid profile but it's generally
higher<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.680> fat<00:01:04.920> well<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.369> something

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
higher in fat well you get something

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.380 
higher in fat well you get something
like<00:01:05.700> bison<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:07.530> buffalo<00:01:08.369> generally<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
like bison or a buffalo generally and it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
like bison or a buffalo generally and it
and<00:01:09.600> generally<00:01:09.900> they're<00:01:10.080> free<00:01:10.590> range<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and generally they're free range to so

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.950 
and generally they're free range to so
that<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.090> grass-fed<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.840> have

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that you know grass-fed so they have

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
that you know grass-fed so they have
really<00:01:13.409> low<00:01:13.619> fat<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> red<00:01:14.970> meat

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
really low fat so you have a red meat

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
really low fat so you have a red meat
great<00:01:15.720> all<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> benefits<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.680> red<00:01:16.830> meat<00:01:17.009> but

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
great all the benefits of red meat but

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.550 
great all the benefits of red meat but
you<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.820> low<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.060> fat<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.330> chicken<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.930> mean

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
you know as low in fat as chicken I mean

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
you know as low in fat as chicken I mean
if<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.310> only<00:01:20.520> downfall<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.390> are

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
if the only downfall is there they are

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
if the only downfall is there they are
more<00:01:21.689> expensive<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> could<00:01:22.530> find<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
more expensive but if you could find a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280 
more expensive but if you could find a
good<00:01:23.040> local<00:01:23.790> source<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.479> they're<00:01:25.170> the

all those benefits but primarily a great

all those benefits but primarily a great

amino acid profile the only downfall for
red<00:01:50.880> meat<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.090> diet<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.869> higher<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.020> fat

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
red meat for diet is it's higher in fat

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
red meat for diet is it's higher in fat
and<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> account<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.729> those

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and you have to account for those

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490 
and you have to account for those
calories<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.420> fat<00:01:54.689> has<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:55.140> than<00:01:55.290> twice

does<00:01:57.270> well<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.469> bison<00:01:58.860> or

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
does well you get you know bison or

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.359 
does well you get you know bison or
Buffalo<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.969> get<00:02:00.619> really<00:02:01.619> low<00:02:01.950> especially

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
Buffalo you get really low especially

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.550 
Buffalo you get really low especially
when<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> grass-fed<00:02:02.759> or<00:02:03.180> free-range<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.409> get

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
when the grass-fed or free-range you get

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.889 
when the grass-fed or free-range you get
really<00:02:04.799> low<00:02:05.100> fat<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.579> basically<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
really low fat so you basically have the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
really low fat so you basically have the
fat<00:02:07.110> level<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.500> chicken<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> fish<00:02:08.250> like

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
fat level of chicken or a fish like

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.850 
fat level of chicken or a fish like
tilapia<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.530> positive<00:02:11.039> benefits<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
tilapia but all the positive benefits of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.460 
tilapia but all the positive benefits of
of<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.190> red<00:02:12.370> meat<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.000> mean<00:02:13.210> it's<00:02:13.470> it's

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
of the red meat so that I mean it's it's

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.230 
of the red meat so that I mean it's it's
a<00:02:14.560> great<00:02:14.800> protein<00:02:15.070> source<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.520> like<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:15.970> said<00:02:16.030> if

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
a great protein source I like I said if

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.930 
a great protein source I like I said if
I<00:02:16.720> could<00:02:16.780> find<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.790> low-cost<00:02:20.340> Buffalo<00:02:21.340> or<00:02:21.550> any

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
I could find a a low-cost Buffalo or any

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.280 
I could find a a low-cost Buffalo or any
kind<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.240> red<00:02:22.390> meat<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.600> happened<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.080> be<00:02:23.170> as

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
kind of red meat that happened to be as

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.350 
kind of red meat that happened to be as
low<00:02:23.470> as<00:02:23.500> fat<00:02:23.920> as<00:02:24.100> chicken<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.640> would<00:02:25.090> use<00:02:25.300> that

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
low as fat as chicken I would use that

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.930 
low as fat as chicken I would use that
as<00:02:25.480> my<00:02:25.720> primary<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.710> mean<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.550> would<00:02:27.700> eat<00:02:27.790> that

as my primary I mean I would eat that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.520 
as my primary I mean I would eat that
for<00:02:28.060> every<00:02:28.330> meal<00:02:28.480> as<00:02:28.660> my<00:02:28.780> protein<00:02:29.110> source<00:02:29.380> if<00:02:29.470> I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
for every meal as my protein source if I

favorite tasting cut that's relatively
low<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.520> fat<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:45.880> it's<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.270> little<00:02:46.480> bit<00:02:46.600> higher

low in fat but it's a little bit higher

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.500 
low in fat but it's a little bit higher
cost<00:02:47.140> probably<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.310> best<00:02:48.520> fat<00:02:48.760> best<00:02:49.240> cut

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510

lowest cost cut as well it depends on

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.600 
lowest cost cut as well it depends on

then<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.890> cook<00:03:15.190> whatever's<00:03:15.760> easiest

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
then I just cook whatever's easiest

then I just cook whatever's easiest
I<00:03:16.390> always<00:03:16.870> add<00:03:17.140> salt<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.620> but<00:03:17.950> if<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.670> you

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
know if I have if motivation to cook it

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.340 
know if I have if motivation to cook it
I'll<00:03:21.700> grill<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.330> love<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.780> within<00:03:23.019> the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
I'll grill it and I love it within the
