00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
box of Enfamil and Gerber you know

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.750 
box of Enfamil and Gerber you know
Gerber<00:01:20.870> GMO<00:01:22.520> riddled<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:25.070> GMOs<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.460> it's

Gerber GMO riddled with GMOs and it's

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.650 
Gerber GMO riddled with GMOs and it's
baby<00:01:27.000> formula<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.870> have<00:01:28.400> Enfamil<00:01:29.660> Similac

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
baby formula so you have Enfamil Similac

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.910 
baby formula so you have Enfamil Similac
and<00:01:31.820> Gerber<00:01:32.870> and<00:01:33.870> what<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> need<00:01:34.800> to
