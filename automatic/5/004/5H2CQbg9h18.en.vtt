00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.340 
it's fairly large for this kind of work
but<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:09.940> will<00:02:10.030> function<00:02:10.450> pretty<00:02:10.929> well<00:02:11.140> as<00:02:11.319> a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
but it will function pretty well as a

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.910 
but it will function pretty well as a
fanny<00:02:11.620> pack

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
fanny pack

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.400 
fanny pack
not<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:12.790> much<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.150> ski<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.630> but<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:14.200> in

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
not so much to ski with but to get in

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.990 
not so much to ski with but to get in
to<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.530> collapsed<00:02:15.070> structure<00:02:15.520> or<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:15.880> an

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
need to is you can increase the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.699 
need to is you can increase the
organizational<00:03:43.150> capability<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.900> these<00:03:44.110> by

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
organizational capability of these by

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.240 
organizational capability of these by
attaching<00:03:45.340> some<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.970> our<00:03:46.120> other<00:03:47.250> moving

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
attaching some of our other moving

attaching some of our other moving
organizing<00:03:48.880> systems<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:53.730> then<00:03:54.730> those

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
organizing systems to it and then those

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.590 
organizing systems to it and then those
act<00:03:55.239> as<00:03:56.220> fold-out<00:03:57.220> wings<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.090> be<00:03:58.209> folded
