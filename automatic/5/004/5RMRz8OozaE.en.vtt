00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
that I want to talk about is the new

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.260 
that I want to talk about is the new
killed<00:04:49.530> recurring<00:04:49.980> feature<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.520> it

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
killed recurring feature and it

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.250 
killed recurring feature and it
basically<00:04:51.419> allows<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.020> put<00:04:52.169> your

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
basically allows you to put your

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.560 
basically allows you to put your
information<00:04:52.530> into<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.190> system<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:54.060> everybody

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
information into a system that everybody

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.020 
information into a system that everybody
can<00:04:54.750> view<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.139> they<00:04:56.040> can<00:04:56.220> find<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.520> guilt<00:04:56.729> that

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
can view and they can find a guilt that

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.240 
can view and they can find a guilt that
suits<00:04:57.389> their<00:04:57.540> needs<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.530> know<00:04:58.650> if<00:04:58.800> your

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
suits their needs and you know if your

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.620 
suits their needs and you know if your
guilt<00:04:59.550> happens<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.000> be<00:05:00.090> what<00:05:00.210> they're<00:05:00.330> looking

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
guilt happens to be what they're looking

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.320 
guilt happens to be what they're looking
for<00:05:00.660> them<00:05:01.080> no<00:05:01.860> it's<00:05:02.130> just<00:05:02.250> an<00:05:02.460> extra<00:05:02.790> tool<00:05:03.000> for

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
for them no it's just an extra tool for

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.060 
for them no it's just an extra tool for
the<00:05:03.419> recurrent<00:05:03.840> process<00:05:04.260> very<00:05:04.650> big<00:05:04.800> feature

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
the recurrent process very big feature

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.650 
the recurrent process very big feature
that<00:05:05.400> they've<00:05:05.580> implemented<00:05:06.060> with<00:05:06.300> this<00:05:06.419> patch

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
that they've implemented with this patch

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.320 
that they've implemented with this patch
that's<00:05:07.020> going<00:05:07.350> to<00:05:07.410> affect<00:05:07.680> everybody<00:05:07.950> is<00:05:08.370> that

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
that's going to affect everybody is that

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.170 
that's going to affect everybody is that
all<00:05:09.860> nondamaging<00:05:10.860> interrupts<00:05:11.610> now<00:05:12.000> will

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
all nondamaging interrupts now will

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.850 
all nondamaging interrupts now will
always<00:05:12.389> hit<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.630> target<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.560> like

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
always hit the target so like

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.830 
always hit the target so like
counterspell<00:05:14.460> silencing<00:05:15.000> child<00:05:15.240> skull<00:05:15.630> bash

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
counterspell silencing child skull bash

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.990 
counterspell silencing child skull bash
all<00:05:16.350> those<00:05:16.620> abilities<00:05:16.830> they'll<00:05:17.580> always<00:05:17.760> hit

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
all those abilities they'll always hit

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.820 
all those abilities they'll always hit
and<00:05:18.210> that<00:05:18.389> really<00:05:18.660> makes<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:19.080> easier<00:05:19.440> for

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
and that really makes it easier for

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.580 
and that really makes it easier for
especially<00:05:20.760> at<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:21.030> meeting<00:05:21.300> killed<00:05:21.479> who<00:05:21.690> for

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
especially at a meeting killed who for

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.350 
especially at a meeting killed who for
example<00:05:22.919> on<00:05:22.979> harbor<00:05:23.340> pherion<00:05:23.789> and<00:05:24.000> phase<00:05:24.180> 2

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
example on harbor pherion and phase 2

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.240 
example on harbor pherion and phase 2
when<00:05:24.600> you're<00:05:24.690> on<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.810> platforms<00:05:25.380> it's<00:05:25.950> really

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
when you're on the platforms it's really

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.980 
when you're on the platforms it's really
difficult<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.700> have<00:05:26.820> a<00:05:27.180> lot<00:05:27.539> of<00:05:27.570> interrupt

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
difficult to have a lot of interrupt

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.750 
difficult to have a lot of interrupt
errs<00:05:28.140> on<00:05:28.229> each<00:05:28.380> one<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.860> you'd<00:05:29.340> have<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.580> rely

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
errs on each one and you'd have to rely

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.270 
errs on each one and you'd have to rely
on<00:05:29.789> tanks<00:05:30.270> and<00:05:30.479> prior<00:05:31.229> to<00:05:31.260> this<00:05:31.440> patch<00:05:31.740> you

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
on tanks and prior to this patch you

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.860 
on tanks and prior to this patch you
know<00:05:32.370> you<00:05:33.090> wouldn't<00:05:33.360> always<00:05:33.450> get<00:05:33.660> every

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
know you wouldn't always get every

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.150 
know you wouldn't always get every
interrupt<00:05:34.200> just<00:05:34.320> because<00:05:34.530> tank<00:05:34.800> interrupt

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
interrupt just because tank interrupt

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.500 
interrupt just because tank interrupt
will<00:05:35.430> miss<00:05:35.610> sometimes<00:05:36.000> because<00:05:36.240> I'm<00:05:36.360> not<00:05:36.450> a

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.630 
will miss sometimes because I'm not a
cat<00:05:36.840> so<00:05:37.169> I<00:05:37.410> think<00:05:37.830> it's<00:05:38.039> great<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.310> they've

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
cat so I think it's great that they've

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.880 
cat so I think it's great that they've
done<00:05:38.970> this<00:05:39.150> in<00:05:39.419> it<00:05:39.510> you<00:05:40.200> know<00:05:40.289> it<00:05:40.500> was

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
done this in it you know it was

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.940 
done this in it you know it was
necessary<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:42.200> lastly<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.260> wanted<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.590> go<00:05:43.710> over

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
necessary and lastly I wanted to go over

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.760 
necessary and lastly I wanted to go over
is<00:05:43.979> that<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:45.200> rarely<00:05:46.200> ma<00:05:46.500> culpa<00:05:47.160> situs<00:05:47.669> in<00:05:47.970> the

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
is that the rarely ma culpa situs in the

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.620 
is that the rarely ma culpa situs in the
shimmering<00:05:49.770> expands<00:05:50.130> I<00:05:50.370> believe<00:05:50.550> he<00:05:51.240> now

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
shimmering expands I believe he now

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.580 
shimmering expands I believe he now
drops<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.350> reins<00:05:52.710> of<00:05:53.070> his<00:05:53.669> ibis<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.810> what

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
drops the reins of his ibis and what

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.379 
drops the reins of his ibis and what
they<00:05:55.740> are<00:05:55.889> is<00:05:56.039> just<00:05:56.490> an<00:05:56.669> underwater<00:05:57.060> mount

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
they are is just an underwater mount

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.279 
they are is just an underwater mount
that<00:05:57.539> can<00:05:57.690> be<00:05:57.780> used<00:05:57.900> outside<00:05:58.139> of<00:05:58.550> that<00:05:59.550> and

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
that can be used outside of that and

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.570 
that can be used outside of that and
it's<00:06:01.289> boe<00:06:01.650> so<00:06:02.010> you<00:06:02.100> can<00:06:02.220> put<00:06:02.340> it<00:06:02.430> on<00:06:02.520> the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
it's boe so you can put it on the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.070 
it's boe so you can put it on the
auction<00:06:02.729> house<00:06:03.060> so<00:06:03.389> it's<00:06:03.570> probably<00:06:03.810> in<00:06:03.990> a

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
auction house so it's probably in a

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.900 
auction house so it's probably in a
skull<00:06:04.260> for<00:06:04.440> a<00:06:04.500> lot<00:06:04.680> of<00:06:04.710> money<00:06:04.830> so<00:06:05.190> by<00:06:05.700> how<00:06:05.880> you

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
skull for a lot of money so by how you

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.390 
skull for a lot of money so by how you
see<00:06:06.150> just<00:06:06.330> camping<00:06:06.840> pesados<00:06:07.400> immediately

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
see just camping pesados immediately

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.650 
see just camping pesados immediately
does<00:06:08.760> he<00:06:08.880> probably<00:06:09.060> be<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.330> lot<00:06:09.450> of<00:06:09.570> people

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
does he probably be a lot of people

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.540 
does he probably be a lot of people
doing<00:06:10.020> it<00:06:10.139> but<00:06:10.350> if<00:06:10.919> you<00:06:10.979> manage<00:06:11.160> to<00:06:11.310> get<00:06:11.430> your

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
doing it but if you manage to get your

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.820 
doing it but if you manage to get your
hands<00:06:11.729> on<00:06:11.880> me<00:06:12.030> either<00:06:12.630> get<00:06:12.960> in<00:06:13.229> a<00:06:13.380> really<00:06:13.680> cool

mount that you can use elsewhere you
know<00:06:15.690> outside<00:06:15.930> of<00:06:16.110> ash<00:06:16.350> or<00:06:16.650> you<00:06:16.800> can<00:06:16.919> sell<00:06:17.130> it

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
know outside of ash or you can sell it

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.860
