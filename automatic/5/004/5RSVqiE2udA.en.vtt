00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
Brewers and it seems like it's the same

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.900 
Brewers and it seems like it's the same
story<00:00:13.320> every<00:00:13.710> year<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> lot<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.340> good<00:00:14.490> talent<00:00:14.670> on

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
story every year a lot of good talent on

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.490 
story every year a lot of good talent on
the<00:00:15.000> major<00:00:15.179> league<00:00:15.420> level<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.839> no<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the major league level but no one in the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.189 
the major league level but no one in the
farm<00:00:16.740> system<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.660> might<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:19.020> make

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
farm system and I know it might not make

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.660 
farm system and I know it might not make
a<00:00:19.260> big<00:00:19.560> difference<00:00:19.800> if<00:00:20.220> we're<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.430> gonna<00:00:20.520> be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
a big difference if we're not gonna be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.640 
a big difference if we're not gonna be
playing<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.000> lot<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.420> seasons<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.930> plan<00:00:22.350> with

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
playing a lot of seasons but I plan with

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.890 
playing a lot of seasons but I plan with
the<00:00:22.680> quick<00:00:22.980> counts<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.750> got

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the quick counts to get going and we got

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.359 
the quick counts to get going and we got
some<00:00:25.080> guys<00:00:25.289> here<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> could<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.830> good<00:00:26.039> trade

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
some guys here it could be good trade

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.040 
some guys here it could be good trade
bait<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.359> some<00:00:27.539> guys<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:28.019> just

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
bait and we got some guys are just

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.200 
bait and we got some guys are just
overpaid<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:29.130> may<00:00:29.310> never<00:00:29.460> trade<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:29.939> but

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
overpaid and we may never trade them but

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.139 
overpaid and we may never trade them but
one<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> reasons<00:00:31.529> why<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.920> Brewers<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
one of the reasons why the Brewers are a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.569 
one of the reasons why the Brewers are a
good<00:00:33.930> choice<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.710> franchise<00:00:35.280> mode

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
good choice for a franchise mode

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.130 
good choice for a franchise mode
especially<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.450> rebuilding<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
especially if you like rebuilding is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.810 
especially if you like rebuilding is
because<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.649> some<00:00:38.280> guys<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.700> can

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
because they have some guys you can

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.819 
because they have some guys you can
trade<00:00:39.059> away<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.050> major<00:00:40.230> league<00:00:40.440> level<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
trade away on the major league level and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.139 
trade away on the major league level and
they<00:00:41.010> don't<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> lot<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> good

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
they don't really have a lot of good

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.110 
they don't really have a lot of good
farm<00:00:42.510> guys<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.469> mean<00:00:44.250> most<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:44.640> guys<00:00:44.879> are

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
to fight off these pitches and he just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.240 
to fight off these pitches and he just
does<00:01:50.340> manage<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
does manage to

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.890 
does manage to
this<00:01:51.490> one<00:01:51.700> off<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.390> that's<00:01:52.570> one<00:01:52.720> of<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.870> things

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
this one off so that's one of the things

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.780 
this one off so that's one of the things
about<00:01:53.140> quick<00:01:53.470> counts<00:01:53.890> its<00:01:54.070> first<00:01:54.490> time<00:01:54.640> I'm

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
about quick counts its first time I'm

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.970 
about quick counts its first time I'm
using<00:01:54.940> quick<00:01:55.270> counts<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:55.900> I<00:01:56.200> struggled<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.830> lot

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
using quick counts and I struggled a lot

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.560 
using quick counts and I struggled a lot
with<00:01:57.040> quick<00:01:57.430> counts<00:01:59.910> but<00:02:00.910> here<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.120> get<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.330> full

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
with quick counts but here I get a full

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.330 
with quick counts but here I get a full
count<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.170> okay<00:02:02.650> it's<00:02:02.800> looking<00:02:02.890> pretty<00:02:03.190> good

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
count and okay it's looking pretty good

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.040 
count and okay it's looking pretty good
so<00:02:03.610> I've<00:02:03.729> only<00:02:03.880> seen<00:02:04.120> two<00:02:04.300> pitches<00:02:04.510> thus<00:02:04.840> far

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
so I've only seen two pitches thus far

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.140 
so I've only seen two pitches thus far
so<00:02:05.320> normal<00:02:05.650> situation<00:02:06.370> this<00:02:06.490> would<00:02:06.640> be<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.729> 1-1

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
so normal situation this would be a 1-1

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.120 
so normal situation this would be a 1-1
count<00:02:07.180> but<00:02:07.630> 32<00:02:08.110> count<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.560> either<00:02:08.770> could<00:02:09.009> get

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
count but 32 count I either could get

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.250 
count but 32 count I either could get
locked<00:02:09.369> or<00:02:09.640> I'm<00:02:10.240> gonna<00:02:10.330> fall<00:02:10.600> off<00:02:10.630> another<00:02:11.020> one

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
locked or I'm gonna fall off another one

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.220 
locked or I'm gonna fall off another one
and<00:02:11.410> keep<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.920> pitch<00:02:12.100> count<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.550> or<00:02:12.850> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and keep the the pitch count going or I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.650 
and keep the the pitch count going or I
might<00:02:14.230> strike<00:02:14.500> out<00:02:14.680> right<00:02:14.970> or<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.030> could<00:02:16.510> just

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
might strike out right or I could just

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.810 
might strike out right or I could just
get<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.140> bacon<00:02:17.530> bomb<00:02:17.709> who<00:02:18.040> knows<00:02:18.280> what<00:02:18.610> might

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
get a bacon bomb who knows what might

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.250 
get a bacon bomb who knows what might

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
counts guys I've noticed that the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.640 
counts guys I've noticed that the
scoring<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.630> much<00:02:34.840> higher<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.260> strike<00:02:35.500> up

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
scoring is much higher the strike up

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.900 
scoring is much higher the strike up
counts<00:02:36.040> sent<00:02:36.250> tend<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> little<00:02:36.790> bit

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
counts sent tend to be a little bit

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.130 
counts sent tend to be a little bit
higher<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.270> walks<00:02:37.510> tend<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.020> little

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
higher the walks tend to be a little

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.690 
higher the walks tend to be a little
higher<00:02:38.350> everything's<00:02:38.860> kind<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.160> inflated

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
higher everything's kind of inflated

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.400 
higher everything's kind of inflated
