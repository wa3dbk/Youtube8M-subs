00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
head just like that and full range is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.460 
head just like that and full range is
usually<00:00:34.920> back<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.490> their<00:00:35.670> hip<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.870> they<00:00:37.110> start

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
usually back to their hip if they start

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.530 
usually back to their hip if they start
to<00:00:37.650> tip<00:00:38.070> their<00:00:38.430> nose<00:00:40.820> see<00:00:41.820> she<00:00:42.060> gets<00:00:42.240> pretty

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
to tip their nose see she gets pretty

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.140 
to tip their nose see she gets pretty
far<00:00:42.930> without<00:00:43.320> tipping<00:00:43.980> her<00:00:44.190> nose<00:00:44.430> when<00:00:45.030> they

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
far without tipping her nose when they

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.730 
far without tipping her nose when they
start<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> tip<00:00:45.630> their<00:00:45.840> nose<00:00:46.080> they're<00:00:46.440> trying

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
start to tip their nose they're trying

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.660 
start to tip their nose they're trying
to<00:00:46.800> evade<00:00:48.410> some<00:00:49.410> area<00:00:49.740> of<00:00:49.770> restriction<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to evade some area of restriction to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.240 
to evade some area of restriction to
kind<00:00:50.880> of<00:00:50.910> move<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.360> also<00:00:51.600> pick<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.140> each<00:00:53.040> of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
kind of move we can also pick up each of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.640 
kind of move we can also pick up each of
their<00:00:53.370> legs<00:00:53.700> we'll<00:00:54.090> start<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> front

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
their legs we'll start with the front

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.790 
their legs we'll start with the front
and<00:00:56.150> see<00:00:57.150> what<00:00:57.510> their<00:00:57.690> range<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.140> motion<00:00:58.200> is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and see what their range of motion is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.520 
and see what their range of motion is
like<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.430> their<00:00:59.640> front<00:00:59.940> end<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:01.440> gonna

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
like in their front end so we're gonna

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.880 
like in their front end so we're gonna
lift<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.950> leg<00:01:02.190> forward<00:01:02.640> full<00:01:03.510> range<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.530> if

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
lift the leg forward full range is if

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.810 
lift the leg forward full range is if
this<00:01:05.100> line<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.909> parallel<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.560> ground<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
this line is parallel to the ground so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.800 
this line is parallel to the ground so
she's<00:01:08.999> not<00:01:09.240> bad<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.759> then<00:01:11.759> full<00:01:12.119> range<00:01:12.390> on

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
she's not bad and then full range on

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.160 
she's not bad and then full range on
your<00:01:12.869> average<00:01:13.170> horse<00:01:14.479> see<00:01:15.479> how<00:01:15.600> she<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:16.020> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
your average horse see how she kind of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.779 
your average horse see how she kind of
guards<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.130> she<00:01:17.249> pulls<00:01:17.490> her<00:01:17.579> leg

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
guards there and she pulls her leg

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.359 
guards there and she pulls her leg
forward<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.390> telling<00:01:18.810> us<00:01:18.899> something<00:01:19.369> so

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
forward that's telling us something so

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
forward that's telling us something so
she<00:01:20.429> gets<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.789> about<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.600> isn't<00:01:21.780> too

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
she gets to about here which isn't too

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
she gets to about here which isn't too
bad<00:01:22.079> full<00:01:22.469> range<00:01:22.710> fruits<00:01:23.069> average<00:01:23.490> horse<00:01:23.789> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
bad full range fruits average horse is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.779 
bad full range fruits average horse is
if<00:01:24.149> you<00:01:24.240> draw<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> line<00:01:24.749> down<00:01:25.079> from<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.409> flank

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
if you draw a line down from the flank

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:33.559 
if you draw a line down from the flank
go<00:01:26.789> to<00:01:26.850> back<00:01:27.270> leg<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:31.700> also<00:01:32.700> pay<00:01:33.060> attention<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
go to back leg I also pay attention to

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.749 
go to back leg I also pay attention to
when<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.960> hold<00:01:34.229> their<00:01:34.469> leg<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.219> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
when they hold their leg up like that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.279 
when they hold their leg up like that
and<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.030> takes<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.389> a<00:01:36.509> few<00:01:36.780> minutes<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> let

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
and it takes them a few minutes to let

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.989 
and it takes them a few minutes to let
it<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.920> kind<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> telling<00:01:41.609> us<00:01:41.789> that

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
it down it's kind of telling us that

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.440 
it down it's kind of telling us that
they're<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.450> bit<00:01:43.289> stuck<00:01:44.119> ok<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.299> once

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
they're a bit stuck ok and then once

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.809 
they're a bit stuck ok and then once
they<00:01:45.630> relax<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.380> leg<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.039> can<00:01:47.280> bring<00:01:47.429> it<00:01:47.579> back

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
they relax the leg you can bring it back

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.789 
they relax the leg you can bring it back
and<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.569> want<00:01:48.749> to<00:01:48.810> keep<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.079> leg<00:01:49.289> in<00:01:49.530> its

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.599 
and you want to keep the leg in its
track<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.639> natural<00:01:51.090> track<00:01:51.359> of<00:01:51.539> movement<00:01:52.609> so

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
track it's natural track of movement so

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.209 
track it's natural track of movement so
she's<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:53.819> little<00:01:54.030> bit<00:01:54.299> stiff<00:01:55.130> bringing<00:01:56.130> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the leg forward full range is

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.020 
the leg forward full range is
up<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.970> here<00:02:14.239> basically<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:15.050> their<00:02:15.170> front<00:02:15.349> leg

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
up to here basically to their front leg

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.020 
up to here basically to their front leg
and<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.840> run<00:02:18.140> your<00:02:18.380> hand<00:02:18.709> from<00:02:19.280> back<00:02:19.580> here

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
and so you run your hand from back here

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.240 
and so you run your hand from back here
and<00:02:20.330> you're<00:02:20.900> looking<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> reaction<00:02:21.800> it's<00:02:22.130> a

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
and you're looking for a reaction it's a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.640 
and you're looking for a reaction it's a
reflex<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.150> want<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.870> reflex<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.349> see<00:02:24.530> how

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
reflex so we want a reflex so see how

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.800 
reflex so we want a reflex so see how
she's<00:02:24.890> kind<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.130> tucking<00:02:25.849> her<00:02:26.150> bum<00:02:26.360> underneath

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
she's kind of tucking her bum underneath

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.610 
she's kind of tucking her bum underneath
her<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.470> now<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.970> next<00:02:29.180> step<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.930> we<00:02:30.230> want<00:02:30.260> her

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
her and now the next step is we want her

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.550 
her and now the next step is we want her
to<00:02:30.650> duck<00:02:31.269> as<00:02:32.269> she<00:02:32.510> kind<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.750> ducks<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.170> hip

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
to duck as she kind of ducks that hip

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.259 
to duck as she kind of ducks that hip
down<00:02:33.590> that's<00:02:34.340> telling<00:02:34.730> us<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:34.970> she<00:02:35.120> has<00:02:35.239> a

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
down that's telling us that she has a

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.900 
down that's telling us that she has a
nice<00:02:35.569> reflex<00:02:36.170> through<00:02:36.470> her<00:02:36.560> hip<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:37.040> would<00:02:37.730> be

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
nice reflex through her hip I would be

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.290 
nice reflex through her hip I would be
worried<00:02:38.269> if<00:02:38.450> she<00:02:38.510> was<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> bit<00:02:39.170> more<00:02:40.300> reactive

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
worried if she was a bit more reactive

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.030 
worried if she was a bit more reactive
in<00:02:41.480> one<00:02:41.720> area<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.230> general<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.709> tells<00:02:42.920> me

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
in one area in general that tells me

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.320 
in one area in general that tells me
that<00:02:43.130> she's<00:02:43.370> having<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.670> bit<00:02:43.819> more<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.060> pain

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
that she's having a bit more of a pain

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.289 
that she's having a bit more of a pain
response<00:02:44.920> or<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.549> other<00:02:46.970> end<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.209> the

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
response or the other end of the

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.900 
response or the other end of the
spectrum<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.989> if<00:02:48.260> there<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.739> no<00:02:48.890> reaction<00:02:49.340> if

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
spectrum is if there is no reaction if

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.030 
spectrum is if there is no reaction if
you<00:02:50.120> can't<00:02:50.360> get<00:02:50.510> anything<00:02:50.750> then<00:02:51.440> your<00:02:51.739> horse

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
you can't get anything then your horse

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.500 
you can't get anything then your horse
has<00:02:52.220> likely<00:02:52.459> had<00:02:52.730> something<00:02:52.970> going<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.239> for<00:02:53.450> a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
has likely had something going on for a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.289 
has likely had something going on for a
bit<00:02:53.540> longer<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.530> they're<00:02:55.489> having<00:02:55.730> less<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.239> a

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
bit longer and they're having less of a

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.729 
bit longer and they're having less of a
pain<00:02:56.540> response<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.260> they're<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.590> bit

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
pain response and they're just a bit

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.960 
pain response and they're just a bit
more<00:02:57.920> stuck<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.780> then<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.080> can<00:03:00.200> continue<00:03:00.530> on

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
more stuck so then you can continue on

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.180 
more stuck so then you can continue on
so<00:03:01.970> she<00:03:02.030> has<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> pretty<00:03:02.630> nice<00:03:03.010> reaction<00:03:04.010> there

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
so she has a pretty nice reaction there

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.210 
so she has a pretty nice reaction there
and<00:03:04.370> we'll<00:03:04.760> go<00:03:04.880> down<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.239> little<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.989> back<00:03:06.220> and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
and we'll go down a little the back and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.610 
and we'll go down a little the back and
so<00:03:07.430> right<00:03:07.610> there<00:03:07.970> she<00:03:08.420> has<00:03:08.599> a<00:03:08.630> very<00:03:09.049> kind<00:03:09.530> of

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
so right there she has a very kind of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.850 
so right there she has a very kind of
dramatic<00:03:10.340> pain<00:03:10.670> response<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:12.590> kind<00:03:12.799> of

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
dramatic pain response it kind of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.120 
dramatic pain response it kind of
changes<00:03:13.430> from<00:03:13.549> a<00:03:13.700> normal<00:03:14.120> reflex<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.799> right

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
changes from a normal reflex and right

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.280 
changes from a normal reflex and right
in<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.459> area<00:03:16.819> -<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.880> I<00:03:20.120> do<00:03:20.420> pay<00:03:20.720> attention<00:03:21.170> to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
in this area - and I do pay attention to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.860 
in this area - and I do pay attention to
that<00:03:21.440> as<00:03:21.739> well<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.880> flinching

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
that as well that that flinching

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.410 
that as well that that flinching
so<00:03:24.739> she<00:03:24.799> could<00:03:25.100> have<00:03:25.250> something<00:03:25.609> going<00:03:25.760> up<00:03:26.030> on

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
so she could have something going up on

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.170 
so she could have something going up on
up<00:03:26.930> in<00:03:27.049> her<00:03:27.140> shoulder<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> bit<00:03:27.799> more<00:03:30.730> yes<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.880> saw

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
up in her shoulder a bit more yes I saw

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.180 
up in her shoulder a bit more yes I saw
the<00:03:32.239> difference<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.260> made<00:03:33.530> for<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.100> many

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
the difference that it made for so many

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.979 
the difference that it made for so many
horses<00:03:34.579> I<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.299> want<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.540> be<00:03:35.600> able<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.780> make
