00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.789
 welcome to innovate crafts in 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.740
 this video I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.380
 a heart- shaped box for 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.050
 wrap small gifts we are 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.930
 next to valentine and this little box is 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.900
 ideal for that special day is very 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.050
 easy to make these are the materials 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.309
 Metallized cardboard or normal sheet 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.340
 paper a glass a cedÃ© that you do not use a 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.460
 punch or some sharp pricking object 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.370
 double-sided or glue pencil ruler 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.630
 ribbon or ribbon scissors and some detail 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.000
 to decorate look how it's done 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.170
 to make the template we doubled by 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.170
 half the sheet of paper 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.200
 and this corner here we're going to double it 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200
 towards this bowl 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.480
 then we measure the diameter of the 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.150
 glass 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.170
 and we mark that measure on the edge of the 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.170
 sheet that we have folded 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.400
 now we align the ruler to the edge and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.180
 we make a line from the brand that 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.180
 we had done 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.260
 we take the glass and put it in such 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.820
 so that the line is in the center and 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.820
 we draw half a circle 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.329
 we cut it and we have the template 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.329
 completed 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.300
 as you have seen is a very template 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.640
 easy to do with which we get two 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.640
 exact hearts linked together 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.569
 I have chosen metallic card but 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.569
 It can be done with normal cardboard 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.770
 I have already drawn the template and now 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.090
 we are going to mark some reference points 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.090
 that will serve us later 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.670
 at the bottom edge we will mark the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.660
 union of the two hearts and the lines 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.660
 of the two semicircles 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.890
 in the heart of the right we are going to 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.160
 draw by eye a margin of one centimeter 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.160
 approximately 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.290
 now with the cde let's draw a 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.290
 flaps to open and close the box 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.620
 let's take as reference the 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.620
 brands that we have done previously 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.900
 we do it again inside but 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.900
 we 're just going to mark it with the punch 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.550
 now we mark the union of the two 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.550
 hearts 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.680
 and we're also going to mark all the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.680
 contour of the heart on the right 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.400
 we have finished putting all the 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.940
 details and we can already cut the 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.940
 template 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.439
 now with a pair of scissors we are going to do 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.370
 small cuts in the entire margin that 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.680
 we had drawn 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.270
 will serve us at the time of assembly and 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.270
 so that it is hollow inside 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.020
 then we are going to fold it towards 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.020
 in 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.920
 we also double the two flaps 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.539
 in this part of here we can do two 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.009
 slits with the scissors so you do not 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.009
 use in the opening of the box 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.370
 and has put the double adhesive tape 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:54.410
 face in the left heart and already 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.410
 we can start to assemble the box 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.400
 and finally we put the gift the 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.400
 we close and decorate it 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.499
 ah 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.289
 have you seen how easy it is to make a box in 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.180
 heart shape 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:15.119
