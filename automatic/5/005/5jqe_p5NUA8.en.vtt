00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.899
 Well , firstly, this procedure costs 200 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.749
 thousand won earlier it cost 100 thousand 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:33.460
 there is this old man there 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:35.870

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.640
 that is, first one name suggests if 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.980

 half Russian 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.880
 but somehow Russian is half Korean 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.270
 they wanted a name that would be in tune 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.840
 with a European name astrologers this is not 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.409
 love is very important for them is not beauty 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.020
 name as far as that name is affected 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.439
 man that is, they calculate 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.109
 on the elements submit birth on time they 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.920
 calculate what verses look and 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:21.549
 dominated by what is missing or 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.090
 depending on this already chooses the name 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.670
 name poems that are lacking but to 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.509
 somehow balance this and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.929
 it somehow affects later on 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:39.859
 affects the whole life of a Komi person 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.329
 count until they say that's every name 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.490
 she means something 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.450
 yes besides what it refers to 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.350
 different elements 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.259
 she still means something and by the way 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.270
 wrote in the comments about him that 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.680
 Koreans choose 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.380
 now European names really 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.490
 Can my friend say these names 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.390
 Korean 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.060
 same eugene town daughter eugene is 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.540
 korean name is she just consonant with 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.990
 European yes and there are names which 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.670
 very similar with European and now 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.920
 prefer especially mestizo 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.680
 prefer to give such names 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.670
 and to be able to use in different 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.130
 countries to make it easy to remember but 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.250
 in fact well that's how she is at 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.750
 at least she said it was Korean and 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.750
 mean something 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.670
 here differently here so here them not 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.239
 calculated by the European on there not 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:45.260
 come in and here they chose a name 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.800
 yes and by the way in seoul as he said yes 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.170
 all summer is worth a million but apparently in 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.100
 overall he had one pair which 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.769
 wanted a very beautiful name he is all that 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.190
 he suggested they didn't like him 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.480
 pissed off and sent them all walk 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.459
 done for a million 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.660
 there they will give you a name that you like 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:15.549
 if beauty of a name is important to you than life 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:19.850
 child over pissed off and sent in 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:24.310
 general that in my opinion all these things 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.310
 everything seems so far
