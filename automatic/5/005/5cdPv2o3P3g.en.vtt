00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
to get to this point what we have to do

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.210 
to get to this point what we have to do
is<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.230> case<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.620> concrete<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.130> then

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
is that is in case the concrete and then

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.560 
is that is in case the concrete and then
take<00:01:49.400> that<00:01:49.520> casement<00:01:49.970> away<00:01:50.120> like<00:01:50.300> it<00:01:50.420> like<00:01:50.540> a

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
take that casement away like it like a

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.190 
take that casement away like it like a
