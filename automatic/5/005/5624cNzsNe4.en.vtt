00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.330 
you get better and that's how you learn
and<00:02:39.049> when<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:39.349> were<00:02:39.469> a<00:02:39.500> little<00:02:39.620> tight<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.219> know

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
and when we were a little tight you know

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.110 
and when we were a little tight you know
I<00:02:40.370> think<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:43.010> happens<00:02:43.400> but<00:02:43.639> you<00:02:43.819> know<00:02:43.909> and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
I think that happens but you know and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.860 
I think that happens but you know and
you<00:02:44.209> Russell<00:02:44.510> 58<00:02:44.900> guy<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:46.180> again<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.720> happens

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
you Russell 58 guy so again that happens

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.229 
you Russell 58 guy so again that happens
and<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.290> think<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:49.639> was<00:02:49.760> kind<00:02:49.909> of<00:02:49.939> a<00:02:50.030> sloppy

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
and I think it was kind of a sloppy

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.330 
and I think it was kind of a sloppy
match<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.659> think<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.930> both<00:02:51.049> sides<00:02:51.349> but<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:52.159> know

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
match I think of both sides but you know

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.069 
match I think of both sides but you know
that<00:02:52.489> happens<00:02:52.639> if<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.389> finals<00:02:53.720> week<00:02:53.780> and

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
that happens if it's finals week and

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.990 
that happens if it's finals week and
