00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
forward I mean the only thing I'm most
likely<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:36.119> fight<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.479> someone<00:01:36.900> eats<00:01:37.680> my

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
likely will fight if someone eats my

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
likely will fight if someone eats my
food<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.549> know<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:38.909> sorry<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> see

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
food you know I'm sorry but if you see

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.179 
food you know I'm sorry but if you see
my<00:01:39.840> foot<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.200> fighting<00:01:40.579> I'm<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.700> letting<00:01:42.030> off

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
my foot we fighting I'm just letting off

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.920 
my foot we fighting I'm just letting off

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
so if we're gonna fight make sure it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.910 
so if we're gonna fight make sure it's
for<00:01:46.049> something<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.470> end<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.369> story

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.990 

another<00:01:50.920> thing<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.130> bothers<00:01:51.520> me<00:01:51.520> our

another thing that bothers me our
teachers<00:01:52.480> who<00:01:52.660> think<00:01:52.690> they're<00:01:53.440> always<00:01:53.620> right

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
teachers who think they're always right

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.780
