00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 can you say about the character of this woman 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.410
 but the first thing we can understand here is 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.599
 Here again, we will return the forum of the person that is 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.900
 face shape here is fire and 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.030
 as a double element is water that is this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 man who let's say so confused 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.750
 it occurred in tincture let's say this and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.900
 from this it can be revealed that she is not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.460
 Well, no matter how hard I tried 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.429
 invent a world and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.470
 well how the expiration is applied to on i 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.850
 lived there are no seconds school what 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.590
 it is just a coincidence 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.329
 there is a version not from the diary wrote it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 in Russian not between English and there 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.980
 described 10 murders committed there 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.190
 over the past 15 years this 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.340
 a woman could write it or first 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.350
 commit and then write here I can 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.879
 say what this woman first did 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.379
 Then I just thought, that is, you can from 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.940
 to say that she first killed a 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 then sat and wrote 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 Although I do not really write on 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.140
 why indeed but because the waters are not 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.789
 missing it lacks these but we can 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.430
 see if there is of course you can 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.200
 errors found even in her stuffed more 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.360
 we hope that soon we will succeed them 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.490
 we will be happy to analyze 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.490
 with you these records you think that there is no 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.040
 that this is just such a report as needed for 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.360
 yourself up to yourself what's interesting 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.820
 surely check that version let's 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.450
 let's see how she looked at the trial 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.700
 Tamara Mitrofanovna was arrested yesterday 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.229
 almost two months from time to time 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.079
 We watched it at least like to visit 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.259
 we are a movie and from time to time it is like this 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.420
 here 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.400
 bent over what did she do that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.409
 This movement is generally a man and can 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.120
 say well since she is closed 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.920
 man of nature and 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.500
 tell it to show no one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.990
 will therefore she did so she did not 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.700
 sat so constantly for arm not same 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.400
 and minutes and from time to time just 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 bowed her head well hang handsome like 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.910
 There and there it can show about 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.220
 stealth well and if there are any 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.100
 pain in the back there purred pain in the back 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.720
 of course but died and it is unlikely yes I 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.160
 I will even say that all my roads are all in 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.780
 okay therefore no medical 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.600
 testimony to in season 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.660
 to conclude yesterday there was no look she 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.000
 beginning covers your face did not immediately occur 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.510
 after some time she's already 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.210
 courtroom rule shame insult fear what 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.830
 it could be well if we are here 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.110
 let's see then we can say that 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.280
 man when he covers his face with his hands 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.040
 opportunity but this step can be so 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.330
 say but again here is intentional 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.010
 killing action again she 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.790
 preparing for this in order to 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.970
 do and so she is here but it's the same 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.770
 just shows the thing I lived 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.330
 watched him yesterday was not 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.959
 maybe it just seemed a little she 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.970
 smiles there i don't know no i understand but 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.700
 such a feeling was created about what it is 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.230
 can speak but this is the ultimate 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.330
 stage when a person is very strong 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.800
 experiencing and he is not enough here 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.080
 of those emotions so he just already 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.640
 smiling and laughing understand well 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.070
 let's look further with this 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.780
 Oleg's facial expression and she told 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.459
 then at first everything was so she confessed 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.570
 said really it was i killed my 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.300
 friend with whom she lived 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.920
 and after that after himself what 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.380
 she will spend in prison almost two 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.510
 of the month she began to our journalists 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.110
 talk about the fact that it is not she 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.000
 guilty and not she killed and she here 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.800
 pronoun and she used not 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.340
 called the name of the surname but to me it's all she 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.030
 it is she with a man she is very self-serving 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.930
 she is very cleverly true did she speak 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.260
 this is exactly that moment 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.420
 no here she exaggerated since 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.760
 so again say fire and water in 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.250
 the water here gets bigger so she 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.319
 We are so straight you can too 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.340
 come up and go straight conditionally 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.760
 saying here and here again we see that 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.459
 chin right here is a crown 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.299
 it is here well here that is 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.069
 in the center here is plus another tilting of the head itself 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.280
 head tilt and yes that is to us so far 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.129
 shows that she is now well 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.659
 think right on the go and remembers 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.629
 past things because head tilt 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.359
 is there that is she contact us 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.009
 memories live but for now 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.560
 she tells a lie 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.609
 all the dough is goose me right now 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.289
 when you said that she 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.389
 remembers that was because 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.340
 should literally practically to she 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.900
 starts listing all the killings she doesn't 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.449
 just says that she is 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.340
 deft describes suicides which is all 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.250
 it committed she calls numbers 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.349
 apartments damn people who allegedly killed 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.599
 not she and so on that is well I just 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.280
 you did not talk about it and you are here 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.919
 photos said she had something 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.050
 remembers at that moment she called in 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.940
 she really called my facts 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.240
 last with him and colleagues let's yes on 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:57.000
 let's see him 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:00.050
 listened to the lawyers listened to the judge 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.640
 what can you say in what condition is she 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.700
 was in the courthouse after all 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.660
 she is funny or she understands that 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.420
 committing 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.820
 but if we look carefully then and 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.820
 here here is the century she has closed and 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.740
 Now I will say here is very small 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.580
 moment here there is a nucleolus on the top 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.610
 on the eyebrows here are the centuries closed here 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.580
 shows that she is in herself and 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.470
 any outcome now 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.110
 no matter how surprised and she is ready for 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.120
 Anything she can , but this one 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.639
 dyspnea by the way shows that she 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.389
 already 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.580
 well she's already going on like this 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.199
 it say forgetfulness this time 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.240
 able memory is a split personality and 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.979
 so on so on then we can say 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.330
 that after all this is a person who is behind 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.499
 some kind of mental illness 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.020
 possibly schizophrenia to schizophrenia 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:58.969
 even the expert agreed on the job 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.919
 thank you very much thank you in 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.629
 once again for the help thank you very much 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.629
 Oleg we are waiting for you in our studio
