I<00:04:34.820> just<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.270> was<00:04:35.300> awful<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.870> was<00:04:35.990> so

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
I just it was awful it was so

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.140

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.540 

I<00:04:49.470> think<00:04:50.470> they're<00:04:50.620> loud<00:04:50.800> people<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.160> confuse

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
I think they're loud people you confuse

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.550 
I think they're loud people you confuse
with<00:04:51.760> race<00:04:51.970> based<00:04:52.240> training<00:04:52.510> making<00:04:53.230> then

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
with race based training making then

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.930 
with race based training making then
it's<00:04:53.710> just<00:04:54.010> you<00:04:54.310> know<00:04:54.370> you<00:04:54.430> get<00:04:54.670> in<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:54.910> you

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
it's just you know you get in and you

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.210 
it's just you know you get in and you
just<00:04:55.000> race<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:56.170> it's<00:04:56.350> not<00:04:56.590> that<00:04:56.770> at<00:04:56.860> all<00:04:57.010> it's

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
just race and it's not that at all it's

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.790 
just race and it's not that at all it's
about<00:04:57.490> being<00:04:57.940> specific<00:04:58.690> for<00:04:58.960> each<00:04:59.170> race<00:04:59.560> that

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
about being specific for each race that

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.480 
about being specific for each race that
you<00:04:59.890> perform<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:00.880> for<00:05:01.030> example<00:05:01.980> hundred<00:05:02.980> we're

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
you perform so for example hundred we're

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.540 
you perform so for example hundred we're
specific<00:05:04.000> for<00:05:04.180> a<00:05:04.210> hundred<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:05.260> then<00:05:05.290> for<00:05:05.980> 200

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
specific for a hundred and then for 200

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.270 
specific for a hundred and then for 200
we<00:05:07.120> swung<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.960> pace<00:05:08.200> for<00:05:08.230> the<00:05:08.500> 200<00:05:08.980> test<00:05:09.160> not

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
we swung the pace for the 200 test not

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.010 
we swung the pace for the 200 test not
just<00:05:09.340> getting<00:05:10.000> in<00:05:10.210> there<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.420> summing<00:05:10.810> up<00:05:10.900> and

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
just getting in there and summing up and

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.990 
just getting in there and summing up and
down<00:05:11.110> as<00:05:11.230> fast<00:05:11.500> as<00:05:11.680> you<00:05:11.800> can<00:05:12.040> because<00:05:12.670> because

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
down as fast as you can because because

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.850 
down as fast as you can because because
that<00:05:13.030> would<00:05:13.270> make<00:05:13.450> no<00:05:13.480> sense<00:05:13.690> at<00:05:14.110> all<00:05:14.230> when

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
that would make no sense at all when

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460

over speed because if we're training for

over speed because if we're training for
a<00:05:57.960> 50<00:05:58.259> oh<00:05:58.440> it<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:58.830> it's<00:05:59.190> all<00:05:59.370> out<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.789> that's

a 50 oh it is it's all out and that's

a 50 oh it is it's all out and that's
real<00:06:00.449> life<00:06:00.750> before<00:06:00.960> racing<00:06:01.590> but<00:06:02.009> then<00:06:02.160> how<00:06:02.340> we

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
real life before racing but then how we

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.529 
real life before racing but then how we
do<00:06:03.000> may<00:06:03.599> be<00:06:03.630> real<00:06:04.440> for<00:06:04.800> fun<00:06:05.699> don't<00:06:06.000> feel<00:06:06.270> good

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
do may be real for fun don't feel good

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.620

because<00:06:07.110> that's<00:06:07.380> how<00:06:07.530> exhausting<00:06:08.509> you<00:06:09.509> know

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
because that's how exhausting you know

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.570 
because that's how exhausting you know
once<00:06:09.900> if<00:06:10.259> we<00:06:10.470> hold<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.830> pace<00:06:11.099> like<00:06:11.340> nine

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
once if we hold the pace like nine

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.899 
once if we hold the pace like nine
seconds<00:06:12.150> for<00:06:12.449> the<00:06:12.599> 25<00:06:13.470> and<00:06:13.500> over<00:06:13.830> speed<00:06:14.220> once

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
seconds for the 25 and over speed once

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.620 
seconds for the 25 and over speed once
he<00:06:15.360> goes<00:06:15.960> 925<00:06:16.949> there<00:06:17.190> to<00:06:17.340> fail<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:18.090> he's<00:06:18.300> tired

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
he goes 925 there to fail and he's tired

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.390 
he goes 925 there to fail and he's tired
so<00:06:18.930> we've<00:06:19.139> done<00:06:19.349> otherwise<00:06:19.949> we're<00:06:20.190> training

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
so we've done otherwise we're training

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.100 
so we've done otherwise we're training
to<00:06:20.580> go<00:06:20.669> slower<00:06:20.940> on<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.150> 50<00:06:21.599> and<00:06:21.720> that<00:06:21.840> wouldn't

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
to go slower on the 50 and that wouldn't

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.870 
to go slower on the 50 and that wouldn't
make<00:06:22.229> any<00:06:22.289> sense<00:06:22.500> so<00:06:23.310> you<00:06:23.370> know<00:06:23.460> you<00:06:23.520> only<00:06:23.669> do

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
make any sense so you know you only do

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.920 
make any sense so you know you only do
very<00:06:24.090> few<00:06:24.360> of<00:06:24.449> those

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
very few of those

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.110 
very few of those
now<00:06:25.319> the<00:06:25.380> other<00:06:25.770> speed<00:06:26.009> race<00:06:26.370> pace<00:06:26.639> all<00:06:26.940> out

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
now the other speed race pace all out

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.879 
now the other speed race pace all out
but<00:06:27.720> that's<00:06:27.930> about<00:06:28.139> it<00:06:28.319> you<00:06:28.500> know<00:06:28.620> otherwise

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
but that's about it you know otherwise

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.030 
but that's about it you know otherwise
everything<00:06:29.370> is<00:06:29.490> really<00:06:29.759> specific

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
everything is really specific

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.460 
everything is really specific
and<00:06:31.130> you<00:06:31.520> know<00:06:31.640> whence<00:06:31.880> you<00:06:32.060> to<00:06:32.480> go<00:06:32.660> to<00:06:32.720> your<00:06:32.960> MA

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
and you know whence you to go to your MA

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.160 
and you know whence you to go to your MA
we<00:06:33.890> break<00:06:34.460> and<00:06:34.700> rest<00:06:35.150> because<00:06:35.840> there's<00:06:36.020> no

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
we break and rest because there's no

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.530 
we break and rest because there's no
point<00:06:36.470> to<00:06:36.650> train<00:06:36.950> to<00:06:37.130> go<00:06:37.250> slow<00:06:37.490> right<00:06:37.540> one

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
point to train to go slow right one

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.450 
point to train to go slow right one
other<00:06:38.690> thing<00:06:38.840> I<00:06:38.900> also<00:06:38.930> feel<00:06:39.380> like<00:06:39.560> when<00:06:39.830> when

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
other thing I also feel like when when

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.520 
other thing I also feel like when when
other<00:06:40.610> people<00:06:41.120> or<00:06:41.600> other<00:06:41.660> teams<00:06:42.230> or<00:06:42.500> other

coaches kind of state of implementing
usrpt<00:06:46.100> I<00:06:46.460> feel<00:06:47.120> like<00:06:47.360> there<00:06:47.870> a<00:06:48.170> lot<00:06:48.440> of<00:06:48.530> them<00:06:48.620> go

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
usrpt I feel like there a lot of them go

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.820 
usrpt I feel like there a lot of them go
at<00:06:48.950> it<00:06:49.070> by<00:06:49.220> doing<00:06:49.580> like<00:06:49.790> so<00:06:50.090> many<00:06:50.210> 100s<00:06:51.170> at<00:06:51.410> 100

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
at it by doing like so many 100s at 100

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.470 
at it by doing like so many 100s at 100
pace<00:06:52.010> which<00:06:52.580> is<00:06:52.730> really<00:06:53.030> I<00:06:53.060> mean<00:06:53.150> it's<00:06:53.390> not

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
pace which is really I mean it's not

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.020 
pace which is really I mean it's not
possible<00:06:53.870> you<00:06:53.930> can't<00:06:54.170> hold<00:06:54.380> you<00:06:54.530> 100<00:06:54.830> pace<00:06:55.030> for

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
possible you can't hold you 100 pace for

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.970 
possible you can't hold you 100 pace for
an<00:06:56.090> entire<00:06:56.360> practice<00:06:57.020> I<00:06:57.320> mean<00:06:57.470> it's<00:06:57.560> not<00:06:57.770> the

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:57.980 
an entire practice I mean it's not the

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.220 
an entire practice I mean it's not the
same<00:06:58.190> as<00:06:58.370> limitations<00:06:59.060> plus<00:06:59.570> do<00:06:59.840> it<00:06:59.960> over<00:07:00.140> and

same as limitations plus do it over and
over<00:07:00.320> it's<00:07:00.710> really<00:07:00.950> so<00:07:01.580> you<00:07:01.670> have<00:07:01.820> to<00:07:01.970> break<00:07:02.090> it

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
over it's really so you have to break it

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.870 
over it's really so you have to break it
down<00:07:02.360> into<00:07:02.540> smaller<00:07:02.930> like<00:07:03.800> proportions<00:07:04.760> with

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
down into smaller like proportions with

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.120 
down into smaller like proportions with
all<00:07:05.090> our<00:07:05.210> forces<00:07:05.450> of<00:07:05.690> an<00:07:05.780> event<00:07:06.020> and<00:07:06.260> you<00:07:07.040> know

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130 
all our forces of an event and you know

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.240 
all our forces of an event and you know
the<00:07:07.610> fraction<00:07:07.940> of<00:07:08.030> the<00:07:08.090> time
