00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
usual um I guess that's it next is the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.870 
usual um I guess that's it next is the
shape<00:00:48.079> testify

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.180 

as<00:00:55.060> you<00:00:55.780> can<00:00:55.930> see<00:00:56.320> their<00:00:58.560> shape<00:00:59.560> is<00:00:59.830> really

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
as you can see their shape is really

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.040 
as you can see their shape is really
nice<00:01:00.340> about<00:01:00.730> medium<00:01:01.330> kicks<00:01:01.630> in<00:01:01.840> mellow

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
nice about medium kicks in mellow

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.680 
nice about medium kicks in mellow
concave<00:01:02.590> which<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.070> almost<00:01:03.610> identical<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.540> my

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
concave which is almost identical to my

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.750 
concave which is almost identical to my
preference<00:01:06.420> no<00:01:07.420> work<00:01:07.720> being<00:01:07.960> whatsoever

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
preference no work being whatsoever

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.190 
preference no work being whatsoever
consistent<00:01:09.760> and<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.700> I<00:01:13.030> check<00:01:13.780> this<00:01:13.960> out<00:01:14.170> I

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
consistent and it's I check this out I

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.440 
consistent and it's I check this out I
measured<00:01:14.800> it<00:01:14.920> um<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:16.300> nose<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:17.470> tail<00:01:17.650> are

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
measured it um the nose and tail are

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.150 
measured it um the nose and tail are
symmetrical<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:20.590> kick<00:01:20.770> eyes<00:01:20.950> are

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
symmetrical and the kick eyes are

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.590 
symmetrical and the kick eyes are
symmetrical<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:21.940> could<00:01:22.090> ride<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:22.420> either

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
symmetrical so you could ride it either

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.120 
symmetrical so you could ride it either
way<00:01:22.870> and<00:01:23.320> not<00:01:24.130> no<00:01:24.340> difference<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:26.560> it's

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
way and not no difference because it's

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.070 
way and not no difference because it's
an<00:01:27.280> identical<00:01:27.820> board<00:01:28.060> which<00:01:28.510> is<00:01:28.690> really<00:01:28.840> cool

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
an identical board which is really cool

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.670 
an identical board which is really cool
I<00:01:29.580> like<00:01:30.580> those<00:01:31.050> next<00:01:32.050> I'm<00:01:32.200> going<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.380> look<00:01:32.500> at

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
I like those next I'm going to look at

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.090 
I like those next I'm going to look at
concave<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:37.119> you<00:01:37.720> can<00:01:37.869> see<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:38.950> you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
concave I know you can see that but you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.890 
concave I know you can see that but you
can<00:01:39.280> see<00:01:39.430> by<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.670> shadow<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.240> pen<00:01:40.509> there's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
can see by the shadow of the pen there's

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.210 
can see by the shadow of the pen there's
concave<00:01:41.410> in<00:01:41.560> there<00:01:42.810> okay<00:01:43.810> that's<00:01:44.160> cool<00:01:45.160> I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
concave in there okay that's cool I

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.600 
concave in there okay that's cool I
guess<00:01:45.340> so<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:46.360> not<00:01:46.450> just<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.750> flat<00:01:47.020> board

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
guess so it's not just a flat board

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.440 
guess so it's not just a flat board
rounding<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:48.790> absolutely<00:01:49.300> perfect<00:01:54.060> no<00:01:55.060> flaws

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
rounding is absolutely perfect no flaws

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.490 
rounding is absolutely perfect no flaws
whatsoever

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.560 

sanding<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.670> would<00:02:00.880> have<00:02:00.970> used<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.240> little<00:02:01.270> bit

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
sanding I would have used a little bit

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.900 
sanding I would have used a little bit
finer<00:02:02.020> sanding<00:02:02.680> along<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.100> edges<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.610> finish

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
finer sanding along the edges to finish

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.450 
finer sanding along the edges to finish
it<00:02:04.530> well<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.680> also<00:02:05.830> could<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:06.280> be<00:02:06.370> the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
it well that also could just be the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.010 
it well that also could just be the
lacquer<00:02:08.399> other<00:02:09.399> than<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:10.090> shape<00:02:10.780> is

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
lacquer other than that the shape is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.880 
lacquer other than that the shape is
wonderful<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.910> perfect<00:02:13.440> oval<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.650> side

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
wonderful of the perfect oval one side

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.570 
wonderful of the perfect oval one side
isn't<00:02:15.070> thicker<00:02:15.900> thinner<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.980> really<00:02:18.280> really

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
isn't thicker thinner it's really really

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.960 
isn't thicker thinner it's really really
really<00:02:18.790> nice<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.470> bottom<00:02:20.800> part<00:02:20.830> lacquer<00:02:21.580> as

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
really nice the bottom part lacquer as

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.120 
really nice the bottom part lacquer as
you<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.050> see<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.350> has<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.500> little<00:02:23.740> bit<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:23.980> a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
you can see it has a little bit of a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.480 
you can see it has a little bit of a
shine<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.950> would<00:02:26.950> if<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.220> were<00:02:27.340> you
