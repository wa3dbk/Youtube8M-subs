00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450

in<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.900> beginning<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.590> said<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.459> there<00:04:11.670> is

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
in the beginning I said that there is

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.880 
in the beginning I said that there is

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
basically no improvement in the second

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.390 
basically no improvement in the second
base<00:04:14.130> on<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:15.329> want<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.780> explain<00:04:16.140> why<00:04:16.470> as<00:04:16.739> you

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
base on and I want to explain why as you

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.400 
base on and I want to explain why as you
can<00:04:17.579> see<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.180> two<00:04:18.359> rigs<00:04:18.539> are<00:04:18.750> quite<00:04:19.049> similar

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
can see the two rigs are quite similar

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.370 
can see the two rigs are quite similar
so<00:04:20.039> let's<00:04:20.280> focus<00:04:20.850> on<00:04:21.030> their<00:04:21.299> core<00:04:21.570> components

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
so let's focus on their core components

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.190 
so let's focus on their core components
which<00:04:22.560> are<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.010> CPU<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:24.150> system<00:04:24.570> memory<00:04:24.810> and

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
which are the CPU the system memory and

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.240 
which are the CPU the system memory and
the<00:04:25.310> GPU<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.750> 7400<00:04:27.750> k<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.320> faster<00:04:28.950> than<00:04:28.979> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
the GPU the 7400 k is faster than the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.180 
the GPU the 7400 k is faster than the
5350<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.690> we<00:04:30.960> can<00:04:31.169> mark<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.470> as<00:04:31.770> an

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
5350 so we can mark that as an

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.090 
5350 so we can mark that as an
improvement<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:33.450> x<00:04:33.660> zone<00:04:33.930> 2<00:04:34.229> point<00:04:34.500> 0<00:04:34.710> has

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.240 
good solution for these budget builds as
you<00:06:45.030> can<00:06:45.240> see<00:06:45.510> my<00:06:45.840> built<00:06:46.110> has<00:06:46.350> four<00:06:46.740> gigabytes

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
you can see my built has four gigabytes

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.670 
you can see my built has four gigabytes
less<00:06:47.610> rent<00:06:47.970> than<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.480> bus<00:06:48.690> on<00:06:48.960> two<00:06:49.230> point<00:06:49.470> oh

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
less rent than the bus on two point oh

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.580 
less rent than the bus on two point oh
but<00:06:50.340> that<00:06:50.820> is<00:06:51.030> not<00:06:51.240> one<00:06:51.480> hundred<00:06:51.660> percent<00:06:51.870> true

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
but that is not one hundred percent true

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.700 
but that is not one hundred percent true
remember<00:06:53.520> the<00:06:53.790> integrated<00:06:54.540> GPU<00:06:54.930> doesn't<00:06:55.530> have

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
remember the integrated GPU doesn't have

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.520 
remember the integrated GPU doesn't have
its<00:06:55.890> own<00:06:56.040> memory<00:06:56.520> so<00:06:57.210> it<00:06:57.510> will<00:06:57.840> take<00:06:57.870> up<00:06:58.260> up<00:06:58.470> to

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
its own memory so it will take up up to

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.260 
its own memory so it will take up up to
2<00:06:59.040> gigabytes<00:06:59.550> of<00:06:59.730> the<00:07:00.000> system<00:07:00.419> one

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
2 gigabytes of the system one

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.050 
2 gigabytes of the system one
so<00:07:01.360> in<00:07:01.630> reality<00:07:01.900> my<00:07:02.500> system<00:07:03.040> has<00:07:03.340> about<00:07:03.640> two

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
so in reality my system has about two

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.480 
so in reality my system has about two
gigabytes<00:07:04.570> less<00:07:05.020> memory<00:07:05.500> I<00:07:05.710> am<00:07:05.950> using<00:07:06.370> the

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
gigabytes less memory I am using the

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.000 
gigabytes less memory I am using the
