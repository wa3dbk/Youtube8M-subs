guys welcome again to smarter than that
where<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.240> explain<00:00:12.630> scientific<00:00:13.230> concepts<00:00:13.769> in

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
where we explain scientific concepts in

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.609 
where we explain scientific concepts in
an<00:00:14.009> easy<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.719> experimental<00:00:15.719> way<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.500> all

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
an easy and experimental way so we all

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.189 
an easy and experimental way so we all
know<00:00:16.859> today<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.220> our<00:00:17.670> world<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.330> round

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
know today that our world is round

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.279 
know today that our world is round
well<00:00:19.580> spherical<00:00:20.730> well<00:00:21.300> almost<00:00:21.900> spherical

it's<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.980> little<00:00:23.189> squished<00:00:23.550> anyways<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:25.109> know

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
it's a little squished anyways we know

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.220 
it's a little squished anyways we know
it's<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:25.590> flat<00:00:25.980> right<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.939> know<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.090> even<00:00:27.990> if

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
it's not flat right we know that even if

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.980 
it's not flat right we know that even if
we<00:00:28.439> go<00:00:28.680> far<00:00:29.279> far<00:00:29.699> away<00:00:29.849> into<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> ocean<00:00:30.660> we

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
we go far far away into the ocean we

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.889 
we go far far away into the ocean we
won't<00:00:31.260> fall<00:00:31.619> off<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.099> edge<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.630> we're<00:00:33.630> not

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
won't fall off the edge but we're not

the<00:00:34.140> first<00:00:34.280> to<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> world<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the first to know that the world is

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
the first to know that the world is
round<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.829> didn't<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.340> wait<00:00:38.550> for

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
round and we didn't have to wait for

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.270 
round and we didn't have to wait for
satellites<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.020> tell<00:00:40.230> us<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.129> it's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
satellites to tell us that so it's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.440 
satellites to tell us that so it's
around<00:00:41.340> 300<00:00:42.210> BC<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.840> man<00:00:43.170> named<00:00:43.559> Eratosthenes

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
around 300 BC a man named Eratosthenes

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.680 
around 300 BC a man named Eratosthenes
found<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.110> circumference<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.160> earth

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
found out the circumference of the earth

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.869 
found out the circumference of the earth
how<00:00:48.690> did<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:50.219> back<00:00:50.610> then

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
how did he do that then back then

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.569 
how did he do that then back then
without<00:00:51.329> satellites<00:00:52.320> without<00:00:52.770> anything

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
without satellites without anything

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.939 
without satellites without anything
really<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.180> look<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.350> above<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> see

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
really to look up from above and see

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
really to look up from above and see
that<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.670> fact<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> horizon<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that the fact that we see the horizon is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.950 
that the fact that we see the horizon is
flat<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> misleading<00:00:59.480> today<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.719> know<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
flat is misleading today we know that

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
flat is misleading today we know that

that's<00:01:07.380> great<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.100> he<00:01:08.490> did<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.970> with

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that's great but he did that with

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.600 
that's great but he did that with
nothing<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> sort

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
Egypt one day I heard that on the around

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.550 
Egypt one day I heard that on the around
20th<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> June<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.720> summer<00:01:18.990> solstice

he<00:01:35.970> heard<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> sounded<00:01:37.619> really

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
he heard that but it sounded really

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
he heard that but it sounded really
weird<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.430> where<00:01:38.970> he<00:01:39.270> lived<00:01:39.509> in

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
weird because where he lived in

weird because where he lived in
Alexandria<00:01:40.049> sticks<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> ground<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
Alexandria sticks on the ground and the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.670 
Alexandria sticks on the ground and the
same<00:01:42.030> day<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> same<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:43.020> dead<00:01:43.439> had<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
same day at the same time dead had a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.399 
same day at the same time dead had a
shadow<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:45.090> he<00:01:45.180> started<00:01:45.540> thinking<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:46.200> could

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
shadow so he started thinking what could

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.859 
shadow so he started thinking what could
possibly<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.240> why<00:01:49.759> not<00:01:50.759> too<00:01:50.970> far<00:01:51.210> away<00:01:51.509> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
possibly do this why not too far away in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.830 
possibly do this why not too far away in
another<00:01:51.960> city<00:01:52.970> sticks<00:01:53.970> don't<00:01:54.149> make<00:01:54.360> shadows

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
another city sticks don't make shadows

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.069 
another city sticks don't make shadows
and<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.470> his<00:01:55.649> home<00:01:55.950> own<00:01:56.250> city<00:01:56.700> sticks<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.899> make

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and in his home own city sticks to make

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.100 
and in his home own city sticks to make
shadows<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.270> then<00:02:00.270> he<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.540> thinking<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
shadows and then he was thinking the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.260 
shadows and then he was thinking the
only<00:02:01.500> way<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.860> could<00:02:02.070> happen<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
only way this could happen is if the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.320 
only way this could happen is if the
earth<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:03.960> flat<00:02:04.159> but<00:02:05.159> round<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
earth was not flat but round and

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.900 
earth was not flat but round and
some<00:02:06.600> point<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.170> stick<00:02:07.710> makes<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.100> shadow<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.729> at

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
some point a stick makes a shadow and at

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969 
some point a stick makes a shadow and at
the<00:02:09.030> other<00:02:09.150> point<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.720> doesn't<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.740> all

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the other point it doesn't and it all

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.880 
the other point it doesn't and it all
has<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> way<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> Sun<00:02:12.890> sheds

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
has to do with the way the Sun sheds

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.760 
has to do with the way the Sun sheds
light<00:02:14.130> on<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.430> earth<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:16.110> he<00:02:16.230> did<00:02:16.470> more<00:02:16.710> than

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
light on the earth but he did more than

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.420 
light on the earth but he did more than
that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.090 
that
he<00:02:17.730> calculated<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:19.170> circumference<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
he calculated the circumference of the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.320 
he calculated the circumference of the
earth<00:02:20.160> using<00:02:21.030> these<00:02:21.240> shadows<00:02:22.700> but<00:02:23.700> instead<00:02:24.210> of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
earth using these shadows but instead of

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.590 
earth using these shadows but instead of
me<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.510> explaining<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:26.300> theoretically<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
me just explaining it theoretically and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.650 
me just explaining it theoretically and
going<00:02:27.900> over<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.860> trigonometry<00:02:29.760> forget

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
going over it and trigonometry forget

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.330 
going over it and trigonometry forget
all<00:02:30.810> about<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.320> let's<00:02:31.890> start<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
all about that let's start the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.060 
all about that let's start the
experiment<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.140> all<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.350> need<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.770> this

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
experiment and all you need to do this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.310 
experiment and all you need to do this
time<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.540> big<00:02:37.050> fruit<00:02:38.040> i<00:02:38.460> but<00:02:39.320> this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
time is just have a big fruit i but this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.530 
time is just have a big fruit i but this
is<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> red<00:02:40.890> pomelo<00:02:41.430> which<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.970> actually<00:02:42.390> pretty

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
is a red pomelo which is actually pretty

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.260 
is a red pomelo which is actually pretty
good<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.020> by<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.200> way<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:45.060> will

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
good for you by the way this will

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.510 
good for you by the way this will
simulate<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.440> earth<00:02:46.590> even<00:02:47.070> though<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.400> not

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
simulate the earth even though it's not

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.020 
simulate the earth even though it's not
really<00:02:47.640> round<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.450> we'll<00:02:49.050> work<00:02:49.290> with<00:02:49.500> it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
really round but we'll work with it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.330 
really round but we'll work with it
you<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.210> source<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.170> light<00:02:52.230> I'm<00:02:52.890> gonna<00:02:53.160> get

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
you have a source of light I'm gonna get

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.210 
you have a source of light I'm gonna get
a<00:02:53.550> little<00:02:53.790> light<00:02:54.060> bulb<00:02:54.650> we're<00:02:55.650> leaving<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.980> book

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
a little light bulb we're leaving a book

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.920 
a little light bulb we're leaving a book
this<00:02:56.460> will<00:02:56.640> simulate<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.360> Sun<00:02:58.340> two<00:02:59.340> sticks<00:02:59.930> to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
this will simulate the Sun two sticks to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.350 
this will simulate the Sun two sticks to
simulate<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.500> 206<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:03.170> sharpie<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:05.360> the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
simulate this 206 a sharpie and the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.660 
simulate this 206 a sharpie and the
ruler<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.260> that's<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:08.070> is<00:03:08.190> all<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.520> need

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
ruler and that's it this is all you need

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.360 
ruler and that's it this is all you need
to<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:08.990> further<00:03:09.990> our<00:03:10.260> experiment<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:10.980> with

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
to have further our experiment so with

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.440 
to have further our experiment so with
no<00:03:11.489> further<00:03:11.520> ado<00:03:12.440> let's<00:03:13.440> start<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.209> first

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
no further ado let's start so the first

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.110 
no further ado let's start so the first
thing<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:15.840> need<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.020> do<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.530> know<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.310> size<00:03:17.700> of

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
thing we need to do is know the size of

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.949 
thing we need to do is know the size of
our<00:03:18.560> nails<00:03:19.560> as<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:20.880> see<00:03:21.030> here<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.480> marked

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
our nails as you can see here I marked

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.740 
our nails as you can see here I marked
my<00:03:22.200> nails<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.100> they<00:03:23.459> each<00:03:23.700> have<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
my nails so that they each have the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.280 
my nails so that they each have the
length<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.290> three<00:03:26.010> centimeters<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:27.209> what<00:03:28.200> I'm

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
length of three centimeters and what I'm

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.229 
length of three centimeters and what I'm
going<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.920> when<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> stick<00:03:29.640> them<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
going to do is when I stick them and the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.940 
going to do is when I stick them and the
fruit<00:03:30.510> I'm<00:03:30.810> going<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.320> make<00:03:31.440> sure<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.770> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
fruit I'm going to make sure that the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.610 
fruit I'm going to make sure that the
blackened<00:03:32.640> out<00:03:32.730> part<00:03:33.150> here<00:03:33.630> my<00:03:33.810> marking<00:03:34.380> is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
blackened out part here my marking is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.580 
blackened out part here my marking is
totally<00:03:35.250> inside<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.970> fruit<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.590> outside

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
totally inside the fruit so that outside

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.940 
totally inside the fruit so that outside
the<00:03:38.160> part<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:38.700> producing<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:40.350> shadow<00:03:40.590> is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
the part that is producing the shadow is

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.940 
the part that is producing the shadow is
three<00:03:41.700> centimeters<00:03:42.390> long<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.230> we're<00:03:43.739> going

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
three centimeters long and we're going

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.220 
three centimeters long and we're going
to<00:03:44.010> need<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.370> for<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.790> calculation<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:45.570> we

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
to need that for the calculation so we

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.330 
to need that for the calculation so we
have<00:03:46.440> our<00:03:46.620> fruit<00:03:47.070> standing<00:03:47.970> by<00:03:48.150> for<00:03:48.180> us

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
have our fruit standing by for us

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.930 
have our fruit standing by for us
nice<00:03:50.340> little<00:03:50.700> fruit<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.680> we<00:03:52.680> have<00:03:52.920> our<00:03:53.520> light

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
nice little fruit and we have our light

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.690 
nice little fruit and we have our light
source<00:03:54.239> which<00:03:54.690> will<00:03:54.959> simulate<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.709> Sun<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.190> I

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
source which will simulate the Sun and I

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.240 
source which will simulate the Sun and I
will<00:03:56.910> project<00:03:57.209> lights<00:03:57.720> directly<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.680> this

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
will project lights directly in this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.400 
will project lights directly in this
direction<00:03:59.489> to<00:04:00.239> really<00:04:00.720> simulate<00:04:01.020> what

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
direction to really simulate what

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.740 
direction to really simulate what
happens<00:04:01.800> with<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.310> earth<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.420> we're<00:04:03.570> going<00:04:03.660> to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
happens with the earth so we're going to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.370 
happens with the earth so we're going to
turn<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.140> light<00:04:04.320> on<00:04:04.489> there<00:04:05.489> we<00:04:05.610> go<00:04:06.320> now<00:04:07.320> we

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
turn the light on there we go now we

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.540 
turn the light on there we go now we
have<00:04:08.780> simulation<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.290> earth<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:11.280> Sun

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
have simulation of the earth and the Sun

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.069 
have simulation of the earth and the Sun
and<00:04:11.970> we<00:04:12.810> take<00:04:13.050> our<00:04:13.739> two<00:04:14.070> nails<00:04:14.960> right<00:04:15.960> here

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
and we take our two nails right here

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.319 
and we take our two nails right here
and<00:04:17.259> as<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:18.009> can<00:04:18.159> see<00:04:18.220> they're<00:04:18.579> both<00:04:18.609> marked

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
and as you can see they're both marked

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.409 
and as you can see they're both marked
and<00:04:19.959> I'm<00:04:20.079> going<00:04:20.319> to<00:04:20.349> stick<00:04:20.680> them<00:04:20.889> in<00:04:21.039> now<00:04:21.789> I'm

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
and I'm going to stick them in now I'm

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.529 
and I'm going to stick them in now I'm
going<00:04:22.629> to<00:04:22.810> try<00:04:23.319> and<00:04:23.680> have<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.009> first<00:04:24.340> one<00:04:24.639> with

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
going to try and have the first one with

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.399 
going to try and have the first one with
no<00:04:26.259> shadow<00:04:26.590> on<00:04:26.889> it<00:04:27.389> so<00:04:28.389> as<00:04:28.599> you<00:04:28.659> can<00:04:28.810> see<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:29.050> have

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
no shadow on it so as you can see I have

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.100 
no shadow on it so as you can see I have
my<00:04:29.590> first<00:04:29.889> nail<00:04:30.159> stuck<00:04:30.940> inside<00:04:31.150> now<00:04:31.569> I'm<00:04:31.810> going

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
my first nail stuck inside now I'm going

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.490 
my first nail stuck inside now I'm going
to<00:04:32.259> move<00:04:32.620> just<00:04:32.979> a<00:04:33.190> little<00:04:33.220> bit<00:04:33.569> the<00:04:34.569> fruit<00:04:34.900> to

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
to move just a little bit the fruit to

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.070 
to move just a little bit the fruit to
make<00:04:35.650> sure<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:35.979> my<00:04:36.190> first<00:04:36.550> nail<00:04:36.840> barely<00:04:37.840> has

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
make sure that my first nail barely has

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.850 
make sure that my first nail barely has
any<00:04:38.110> shadow<00:04:38.789> so<00:04:39.789> this<00:04:40.150> is<00:04:40.539> right<00:04:41.379> here<00:04:41.710> we<00:04:41.830> have

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
any shadow so this is right here we have

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.820 
any shadow so this is right here we have
a<00:04:42.009> very<00:04:42.400> very<00:04:42.550> small<00:04:42.849> shadow<00:04:43.659> it's<00:04:44.110> really<00:04:44.650> on

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
a very very small shadow it's really on

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.399 
a very very small shadow it's really on
top<00:04:45.159> and<00:04:45.370> it's<00:04:45.490> only<00:04:45.759> created<00:04:46.720> because<00:04:47.080> the

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
top and it's only created because the

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.529 
top and it's only created because the
nail<00:04:47.590> has<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.889> little<00:04:48.699> round<00:04:49.000> head

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
nail has a little round head

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.040 
nail has a little round head
so<00:04:50.110> my<00:04:50.710> first<00:04:50.949> nail<00:04:51.219> has<00:04:51.789> no<00:04:52.000> shadow<00:04:52.330> this<00:04:52.870> is

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
so my first nail has no shadow this is

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.980 
so my first nail has no shadow this is
simulating<00:04:53.349> what<00:04:53.979> happened<00:04:54.340> in<00:04:54.550> Syene<00:04:55.180> now

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
simulating what happened in Syene now

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.129 
simulating what happened in Syene now
let's<00:04:56.409> see<00:04:56.560> what<00:04:56.710> happened<00:04:57.039> in<00:04:58.080> Alexandria

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
let's see what happened in Alexandria

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.209 
let's see what happened in Alexandria
with<00:04:59.949> my<00:05:00.129> other<00:05:00.159> nail<00:05:00.669> as<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.449> can<00:05:01.629> see<00:05:02.219> it's

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
with my other nail as you can see it's

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.869 
with my other nail as you can see it's
marked<00:05:03.759> and<00:05:04.530> now<00:05:05.530> I'm<00:05:06.129> going<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.490> go<00:05:06.639> directly

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:06.879 
marked and now I'm going to go directly

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:16.070 
marked and now I'm going to go directly
on<00:05:07.539> top<00:05:08.409> of<00:05:08.440> it<00:05:10.979> and<00:05:12.090> put<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.719> in<00:05:14.669> there<00:05:15.669> we<00:05:15.819> go

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
on top of it and put that in there we go

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.950 
on top of it and put that in there we go
so<00:05:17.080> as<00:05:17.259> you<00:05:17.379> can<00:05:17.500> see<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:18.340> have<00:05:18.550> one<00:05:19.300> nail<00:05:19.599> with

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
so as you can see we have one nail with

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.110 
so as you can see we have one nail with
no<00:05:20.199> shadow<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.830> one<00:05:21.699> nail<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.599> shadow<00:05:23.349> and

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
no shadow and one nail with shadow and

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.640 
no shadow and one nail with shadow and
this<00:05:25.120> is<00:05:25.330> created<00:05:25.750> because<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:26.229> fruit<00:05:26.469> is

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
this is created because the fruit is

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.990 
this is created because the fruit is
round<00:05:27.279> so<00:05:27.750> now<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:28.810> next<00:05:29.050> step<00:05:29.229> is<00:05:29.699> marking<00:05:30.699> up

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
round so now the next step is marking up

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.019 
round so now the next step is marking up
with<00:05:31.479> my<00:05:31.659> Sharpie<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:35.520> we're<00:05:36.520> going<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.759> mark

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
with my Sharpie so we're going to mark

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:41.279 
with my Sharpie so we're going to mark
the<00:05:37.389> position<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:39.130> first<00:05:39.400> nail<00:05:40.289> we're

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
the position of the first nail we're

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.719 
the position of the first nail we're
gonna<00:05:41.409> have<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:41.590> little<00:05:41.800> hole<00:05:42.130> there<00:05:42.400> so<00:05:42.639> I'm

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
gonna have a little hole there so I'm

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.730 
gonna have a little hole there so I'm
not<00:05:42.940> worried<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:44.310> we're<00:05:45.310> going<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.610> draw<00:05:46.740> how

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
not worried and we're going to draw how

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.850 
not worried and we're going to draw how
far<00:05:49.349> this<00:05:50.349> shadow<00:05:50.969> is<00:05:51.969> going<00:05:52.500> so<00:05:53.500> this<00:05:53.680> is

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
far this shadow is going so this is

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.980 
far this shadow is going so this is
going<00:05:54.039> up<00:05:54.310> to<00:05:54.370> here<00:05:57.419> there<00:05:58.419> we<00:05:58.599> go

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
going up to here there we go

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.920 
going up to here there we go
so<00:05:59.469> I<00:05:59.770> took<00:06:00.340> out<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:00.819> nails<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.330> now<00:06:01.690> all

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
so I took out the nails and now all

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.070 
so I took out the nails and now all
that's<00:06:02.139> left<00:06:02.319> is<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:03.580> marking<00:06:04.029> this<00:06:04.779> is<00:06:04.990> the

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
that's left is the marking this is the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.680 
that's left is the marking this is the
location<00:06:05.440> of<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:06.250> first<00:06:06.490> nail<00:06:06.699> this<00:06:07.389> is<00:06:07.569> the

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
location of the first nail this is the

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.749 
location of the first nail this is the
location<00:06:07.990> of<00:06:08.259> the<00:06:08.349> second<00:06:08.710> nail<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.129> this<00:06:09.610> is

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
location of the second nail and this is

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.659 
location of the second nail and this is
the<00:06:09.849> shadow<00:06:10.560> the<00:06:11.560> next<00:06:11.800> step<00:06:12.009> is<00:06:12.279> to<00:06:12.460> measure

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
the shadow the next step is to measure

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.129 
the shadow the next step is to measure
so<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.419> distance<00:06:13.900> between<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.620> two<00:06:14.860> holes

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
so the distance between the two holes

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.059 
so the distance between the two holes
three<00:06:17.139> point<00:06:17.500> one<00:06:17.979> centimeters<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:20.830> length

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
three point one centimeters the length

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.149 
three point one centimeters the length
of<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.430> shadow<00:06:22.590> two<00:06:23.590> point<00:06:23.860> three

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
of the shadow two point three

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.360 
of the shadow two point three
centimeters<00:06:25.409> so<00:06:26.409> what<00:06:26.919> do<00:06:26.979> we<00:06:27.070> do<00:06:27.190> with<00:06:27.250> all

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
centimeters so what do we do with all

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.490 
centimeters so what do we do with all
the<00:06:27.520> data<00:06:27.639> we<00:06:27.849> collected<00:06:28.270> let's<00:06:29.169> take<00:06:29.349> another

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
the data we collected let's take another

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.570 
the data we collected let's take another
look<00:06:29.830> at<00:06:30.009> the<00:06:30.099> earth

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
look at the earth

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.700 
look at the earth
and<00:06:30.669> the<00:06:30.819> Sun<00:06:31.090> as<00:06:31.479> you<00:06:32.169> can<00:06:32.289> see<00:06:32.439> from<00:06:32.590> this

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
and the Sun as you can see from this

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.409 
and the Sun as you can see from this
picture<00:06:32.889> we<00:06:33.129> can<00:06:33.370> treat<00:06:33.639> the<00:06:33.849> light<00:06:34.060> from<00:06:34.240> the

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
picture we can treat the light from the

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.869 
picture we can treat the light from the
Sun<00:06:34.599> as<00:06:34.780> straight<00:06:35.050> lines<00:06:35.080> that<00:06:35.949> produce<00:06:36.280> the

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:36.879 
Sun as straight lines that produce the

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.890 
Sun as straight lines that produce the
shadows<00:06:37.500> the<00:06:38.500> angle<00:06:38.949> from<00:06:39.280> the<00:06:39.819> stick<00:06:40.120> to<00:06:40.689> its

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
shadows the angle from the stick to its

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.869 
shadows the angle from the stick to its
shadow<00:06:41.289> or<00:06:41.680> from<00:06:42.069> the<00:06:42.189> stick<00:06:42.400> to<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.639> light

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:42.879 
shadow or from the stick to the light

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:45.629 
shadow or from the stick to the light
beam<00:06:43.120> is<00:06:43.389> the<00:06:43.990> same<00:06:44.259> angle<00:06:44.710> that<00:06:45.009> is<00:06:45.219> produced

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
beam is the same angle that is produced

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.510 
beam is the same angle that is produced
by<00:06:45.759> the<00:06:45.969> arc<00:06:46.930> that<00:06:47.530> is<00:06:47.680> the<00:06:47.800> distance<00:06:48.219> between

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
by the arc that is the distance between

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.420 
by the arc that is the distance between
the<00:06:48.819> two<00:06:49.000> sticks<00:06:49.360> if<00:06:49.599> we<00:06:50.319> can<00:06:50.500> find<00:06:50.800> out<00:06:50.979> this

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
the two sticks if we can find out this

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.300 
the two sticks if we can find out this
angle<00:06:51.729> we<00:06:52.569> can<00:06:52.840> produce<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.740> circumference

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
angle we can produce the circumference

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.730 
angle we can produce the circumference
of<00:06:54.550> the<00:06:54.699> circle<00:06:54.969> or<00:06:55.389> for<00:06:55.780> that<00:06:55.870> matter<00:06:55.930> of<00:06:56.409> the

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
of the circle or for that matter of the

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.980 
of the circle or for that matter of the
earth<00:06:56.889> all<00:06:57.729> you<00:06:57.759> need<00:06:58.060> to<00:06:58.180> do<00:06:58.300> is<00:06:58.509> just

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
earth all you need to do is just

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.390 
earth all you need to do is just
remember<00:06:59.319> a<00:06:59.530> little<00:06:59.770> bit<00:06:59.919> of<00:07:00.039> your<00:07:00.189> high

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
remember a little bit of your high

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.240 
remember a little bit of your high
school<00:07:00.430> geometry<00:07:01.080> now<00:07:02.080> a<00:07:02.110> circle<00:07:02.469> is<00:07:02.710> 360

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
school geometry now a circle is 360

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.399 
school geometry now a circle is 360
degrees<00:07:03.969> if<00:07:04.240> we<00:07:04.419> found<00:07:04.659> that<00:07:04.780> our<00:07:04.960> angle<00:07:05.379> is

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 
degrees if we found that our angle is

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.589 
degrees if we found that our angle is
thirty-seven<00:07:06.400> point<00:07:06.639> forty<00:07:07.030> eight<00:07:07.180> degrees

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 
thirty-seven point forty eight degrees

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.719 
thirty-seven point forty eight degrees
then<00:07:08.139> by<00:07:08.440> finding<00:07:08.889> its<00:07:09.069> relative<00:07:09.490> fraction

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
then by finding its relative fraction

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.450 
then by finding its relative fraction
out<00:07:10.150> of<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.389> entire<00:07:10.629> circle<00:07:11.259> we<00:07:11.590> can<00:07:11.919> multiply

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
out of the entire circle we can multiply

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.200 
out of the entire circle we can multiply
it<00:07:12.699> and<00:07:13.060> get<00:07:13.360> the<00:07:13.659> entire<00:07:14.080> circumference

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
it and get the entire circumference

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.490 
it and get the entire circumference
remember<00:07:16.210> we<00:07:16.509> have<00:07:16.719> the<00:07:16.900> distance<00:07:17.319> between

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
remember we have the distance between

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.499 
remember we have the distance between
the<00:07:17.800> two<00:07:17.949> sticks<00:07:18.250> so<00:07:18.669> we<00:07:18.819> do<00:07:19.000> have<00:07:19.180> the<00:07:19.360> arc

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:19.509 
the two sticks so we do have the arc

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.580 
the two sticks so we do have the arc
length<00:07:19.690> and<00:07:20.110> it<00:07:20.349> really<00:07:20.590> is<00:07:20.800> that<00:07:21.069> easy<00:07:22.319> so<00:07:23.319> we

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
length and it really is that easy so we

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.409 
length and it really is that easy so we
found<00:07:23.949> the<00:07:24.099> circumference<00:07:24.580> of<00:07:24.819> a<00:07:24.909> red<00:07:25.060> pomelo

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:25.419 
found the circumference of a red pomelo

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.959 
found the circumference of a red pomelo
but<00:07:26.110> Eratosthenes<00:07:26.409> found<00:07:27.370> the<00:07:27.490> circumference

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:27.969 
but Eratosthenes found the circumference

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:31.619 
but Eratosthenes found the circumference
of<00:07:28.240> the<00:07:28.569> entire<00:07:28.840> earth<00:07:29.169> so<00:07:30.069> apparently<00:07:30.639> my<00:07:30.909> red

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:31.629 
of the entire earth so apparently my red

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.779 
of the entire earth so apparently my red
pomelo<00:07:31.990> had<00:07:32.409> a<00:07:32.439> much<00:07:32.800> bigger<00:07:33.069> circumference

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:33.789 
pomelo had a much bigger circumference

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:38.189 
pomelo had a much bigger circumference
before<00:07:34.599> I<00:07:34.629> appealed<00:07:35.080> it<00:07:35.289> then<00:07:35.500> after<00:07:36.330> but<00:07:37.330> the

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 
before I appealed it then after but the

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:54.719 
before I appealed it then after but the
way<00:07:38.319> I<00:07:38.349> see<00:07:38.710> it<00:07:39.060> when<00:07:40.060> in<00:07:40.180> doubt<00:07:40.360> try<00:07:40.979> it<00:07:41.979> out

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:54.729 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:08:02.600 

a<00:07:55.080> name<00:07:56.080> and

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:02.610 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.100 

don't<00:08:03.270> think<00:08:03.539> that<00:08:03.720> I<00:08:03.900> am<00:08:04.439> against<00:08:05.430> you<00:08:06.080> when<00:08:07.080> I

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.110 
don't think that I am against you when I

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.349 
don't think that I am against you when I
like<00:08:08.009> crazy<00:08:08.479> you<00:08:09.479> say<00:08:09.780> hey
