00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello everyone we meet for the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.309
 Monday quinté that will be disputed on 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.320
 the straight line of fontainebleau that goes 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.089
 oppose his age competitors well 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 known to the turfists on the distance of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.960
 12 100 m a straight line where the numbers 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.070
 the rope places often plays a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.020
 leading role 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.359
 and to point you in this quinté 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.699
 we are going to listen to christophe 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.220
 Hello hello flon hello who will us 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.140
 give his favorite in this quinté 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
 relatively open die to start 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 we will ask you do you have any 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.180
 bases in this test out of the basics 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 as you said it's extremely 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.710
 difficult a handicap on these already 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 delicate handicap over 1200 meters still 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.370
 plus and fontainebleau add one 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.000
 additional difficulty the arrival 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.680
 now being often side stands where 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 we fight for the best place 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.219
 so pay attention to expectations there are 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 often they are often unhappy 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.940
 horses who want to go too new 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.770
 years can also burned a bit of 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.359
 kerosene at the start so must do 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.649
 extremely difficult attention 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.870
 however good me I have a choice that 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.470
 I like it and I think you like it 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.049
 good too 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.400
 it's obs to suspicions that I have 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.290
 loved to deauville it's a horse that has 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.030
 well finished rope side is not necessarily 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.900
 the place where spin faster to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.850
 deauville 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.740
 I think in a race like 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 this one despite his weight he has a good 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.140
 rope number I believe he has 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.520
 many things for him me for me 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.049
 it's the basis of the race 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.580
 especially that it is confirmed at this level 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.750
 it is very constant and rats 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.700
 logically be mounted in condition on 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.530
 his comeback with his number two at the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.110
 rope time is really holding him back 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 this is me I think toxo wa attention 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 handicap 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.530
 we said we must remain cautious but 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.130
 good it's true that that one he brings 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.110
 guarantees 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.479
 then I like it a lot if they or 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.350
 three mister ryan smyth late ariane i 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.450
 believe besides it will be my stroke of 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.189
 heart for this for this race mr 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.360
 ryan it's a horse that made a 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.409
 good return entrusted olivier peslier good 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.110
 Corsican is not bad I think 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.850
 it's the tightrope on May 7th so I 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.020
 think we can ask for 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.030
 training in the form of henri 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.550
 alex pantall exactly and there are two 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.380
 workouts besides fit 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.670
 in this in this ordeal that there is 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.920
 also workout from mathieu boutin 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.420
 match where they are officials 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.940
 currently with on fire of all wood he 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.860
 will have to follow them again and precisely 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.240
 I know how to fall back on wii it's 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.440
 because there is a horse I tell you 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.030
 gives a little in the mess but I 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.950
 think about his candidacy right away these 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.110
 calls his name is kharrazi years 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.660
 kharazi years a horse who last 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.310
 times florent I think you saw it 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.990
 also the patient is in a race 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.330
 that is there was no train 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.920
 the action to finish me I liked her 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.120
 fleet is almost certain withdrawal but he 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.680
 did better than significantly better 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.520
 that no tenons place agreements back 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.350
 this time on the grass 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.900
 I think it'll be okay 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.850
 be an advantage because can return 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.500
 more easily on the grass finally he 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.180
 will have to find the worm 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.860
 enough trains also save it 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.630
 but here it is but it will have the train 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.770
 this time because there is a horse that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.680
 like to do the train even though the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.600
 numbers outside it's free to the times 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.790
 free time that likes to animate the races 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.410
 novel another one in front of alex 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.750
 notebook that he may be better on 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.340
 the ca on the other hand so here I 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.490
 recap because we have a little bit 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.020
 skipped the lalas steps for me it's 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.510
 a toxo is the basis 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.090
 my favorite one where three mr yade 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.140
 who has just made a good comeback 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.970
 then we did not talk about a choice that 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.290
 fact that is back but I think 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.360
 it must be full of lines 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.390
 interesting at this level it will be great 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.700
 confirmed also danced danced sprint it's 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.989
 Murcielago also the euro zone is 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.130
 the same I think you go there yeah 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.560
 it is a horse that has healed in this 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.910
 kind of tournament after you have to know if 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.040
 the he has enough work for 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.540
 to be competitive right off the bat but let's do 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.040
 trust his skilled mentor who has 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.340
 certainly prepared with care and then 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.930
 1200 m I think 1200 m here it is 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.360
 must of course their freshness 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.920
 yeah and then if that is I find that the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.510
 back to school plays a role it's less 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.470
 important that out of 8 6 5 he inherited the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.300
 number 12 on the rope but it's 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.500
 maybe by a benefit exactly and 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.060
 unfortunately I still have 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.560
 retained horses which had like the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.900
 outside number but I'm counting on 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.160
 their pilots for not doing for 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.480
 to make the right choices at the right 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.280
 Well here we have to make the right choices 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.890
 must not surrender one full track 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.760
 saw that it was often 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.350
 it's true in this test 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.630
 relatively open have you are you 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.340
 still managed to 2 do you have any 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.830
 impasses which is always difficult 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.120
 I really have the fluff and the list 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.610
 and I found a horse that's going to be 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.480
 badminton which in my opinion we stay here 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.080
 number 13 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.700
 for me dull autumn run 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.020
 I'm waiting to see him again 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.940
 I'm waiting to see him again, I think 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.310
 it's a tempting stalemate we'll say 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.890
 here besides just I just wanted 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.510
 also at we will talk about the processors of 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.340
 mathieu boutin there are two I talked 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.770
 kharrazi years ago there is also a horse that 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.420
 is called gore is then he has a 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.550
 little problem is that he has the number 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.800
 the rope outside her but it's a 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.470
 horse which is extremely confirmed at this 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.480
 level on horseback that carries weight 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.900
 who had seen his value a little bit reviewed 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.240
 on the rise 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.620
 but the device on champenoise is on 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.620
 this straight line of fontainebleau and 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.540
 over 1002 more is not all 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.280
 to actually influence the weight is not 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.200
 like the on the mile or on the water of a 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.910
 hard millimeter that's it's less 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.350
 important the weight less importance and 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.490
 in addition we can note who will be associated with 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.750
 stéphane pasquier who always knows 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.970
 a great success in events 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.590
 so just to make you a little 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.550
 little an idea we will see a race 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.460
 reference of the crois it is with the assse 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.830
 toxo who finished second round in the psf 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.290
 of deauville his body sides that's it and the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.880
 horse who had taken the lead who 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.990
 animated it was precisely it's free 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.000
 as much as they had led in front 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.450
 montalban who had a course on 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.050
 measured 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.370
 and then to finish toxo finished 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.290
 well second place 1 show 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.520
 German is needed is courageously and 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.170
 unlike montalba and more 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.240
 toxic made its comeback in this 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.710
 opportunity exactly so montalban must 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.930
 the knowledge you proceed title holders 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.010
 okay so obviously he loses 61 who 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.020
 play there we could be reviewed at the 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.130
 rise in journals up but here we go 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.660
 so without a single horse that is in 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.610
 great shape he inherited from number one 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.690
 in the ropes with the pardon rope will have to 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.920
 quickly occupy a place of choice 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.840
 she can certainly go far a 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.040
 again so here we go 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.780
 try to do a little bit around 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.110
 those competitors also soul in 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.120
 this event where I also like the 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.910
 number 9 it's my choice 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.370
 I think that yann boarder 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.630
 barberot and on the other hand the reading of his 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.000
 most confirmed performances on the 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.890
 sand a priori exact I liked 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.850
 his return anyway yeah it was very 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.800
 own a good fourth place 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.540
 now will she be so 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.860
 performing on the grass is done for 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.840
 that's in tension then it's true 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.090
 than four years ago but that's so m 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.850
 that can spice things up a bit 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.990
 reports finally is part of the odds 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.000
 undeniable of this race as 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.020
 besides, I made a stalemate 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.670
 but there is absolutely the right to be 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.660
 this is a check guy in four 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.860
 checks but he too a resident 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.780
 of pantale rex who made a good meeting 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.490
 in Cannes who just invested unsa 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.870
 place me in deauville now him 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.940
 also his best performances have 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.500
 been recorded on the sand he has 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.970
 inherited a good rope number the case 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.139
 very little benefit also from the form 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.550
 of his entourage to aim for a place 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.330
 but they are a lot to be able to aim 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.100
 a place in this quinté 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.020
 it's very open as robert the devil 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.310
 also sees the resident of didier 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.260
 Prod'homme that should display 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.120
 progress on his return he has the advantage 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.450
 to have pulled the number 3 the rope is 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.760
 associated with christophe soumillon 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:59.010
 I took the risk of dismissing it because 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.060
 that it was his first handicap because 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.630
 that it came back was still very 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.919
 discreet 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.210
 yes it's true it's a job but the 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.410
 finishing others to first ones 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.540
 so good it's a risk 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.280
 so that's okay I had a 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.570
 As summarized selection by that 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.550
 must therefore 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:16.890
 las le 3 the 14 the 2 the 4 the 5 the 9 sept 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.060
 and if you had a pardon excuse me 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.040
 a non-starter among the right 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.419
 Greek this is it will be the 15 Czech tanga 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.430
 and if you had a game board has 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.870
 given to then sees in a test 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.460
 also open I'll settle for a 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.889
 in the couple and and I will do the field 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.389
 of this in coupled winning because we 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.830
 are not small players we will play 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.300
 we will try to win a little bit 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.710
 of money and the coupled winning returns 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.630
 still it can be interesting for 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.820
 big odds behind the field of 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:42.050
 the without cutting win okay thanks 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.050
 christophe and good game to all
