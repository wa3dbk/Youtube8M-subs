00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
calves made sure that your knees are

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.720 
calves made sure that your knees are
really<00:03:57.500> relaxed<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.069> you've<00:03:58.160> done<00:03:58.340> some<00:03:58.580> leg

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
really relaxed that you've done some leg

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.870 
really relaxed that you've done some leg
bends<00:03:59.030> because<00:04:00.019> while<00:04:00.950> doing<00:04:01.310> like<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.670> ball

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
bends because while doing like the ball

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.520

changes<00:04:02.450> you're<00:04:02.930> going<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.110> be<00:04:03.230> really

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
changes you're going to be really

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.470 
changes you're going to be really
putting<00:04:03.860> some<00:04:03.890> strain<00:04:04.400> on<00:04:04.640> your<00:04:04.790> calf<00:04:05.000> muscle

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
putting some strain on your calf muscle

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.270 
putting some strain on your calf muscle
and<00:04:05.660> if<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.080> not<00:04:06.230> stretched<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.860> could<00:04:07.099> hurt

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
and if it's not stretched you could hurt

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.430 
and if it's not stretched you could hurt
yourself<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:07.790> this<00:04:08.690> would<00:04:08.930> be<00:04:09.050> kind<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.349> a

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
yourself so this would be kind of a

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.470 
yourself so this would be kind of a
final<00:04:09.920> warm-up<00:04:10.130> for<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.610> do<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:11.269> you<00:04:11.360> can

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
final warm-up for you to do so you can

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.600 
final warm-up for you to do so you can
start<00:04:11.660> building<00:04:11.989> up<00:04:12.050> your<00:04:12.230> speed<00:04:12.560> before<00:04:13.310> you

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
start building up your speed before you

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.900 
start building up your speed before you
go<00:04:13.790> into<00:04:13.970> learning<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.540> routine
