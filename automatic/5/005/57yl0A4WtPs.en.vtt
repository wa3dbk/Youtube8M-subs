00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.330
 car 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.570
 First of all 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.570
 Is a water tax 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.610
 5g in 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.610
 I'm in the middle of thinking that I will meet with the number in 5g just entering 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.600
 It's too slippery if it's too light 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 Well It is to some extent want weight 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.710
 I 'm already out of line now 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.400
 I wrote a great award 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.050
 It began to break per that way that slack in the line is eliminated 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.050
 N great shot this guy in another prefecture 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.180
 I'm not going to go to Korea 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.030
 By all means 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.030
 I do not know whether it is the daytime It is a tremendous short byte 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.170
 It's so fast to spit 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.460
 If you do n't take it early at the festival, there is no way 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.750
 Has been taken in line around anymore because 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.750
 I see it because it is colored 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.080
 By the strength of the wind it's carved in slightly aircraft 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 I'm changing 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.950
 Webber nor'm all brother Ru 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.950
 Group e 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.490
 I'm coming through the wind 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.720
 This peliah 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.720
 Bella 6 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.870
 It was Asia of taste not just taste 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.790
 Hmm 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:00.690
 It's attached to such Fu scattered there 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.690
 Oh 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.710
 You like this fishing 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.710
 If the wind was not strong, there were more ways, but for a moment 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.730
 Pretty cba 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.100
 Range is different 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.420
 The range is different . 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.690
 I 'm a magician 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.120
 Wow cba a Goichira 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.730
 Let's go very much 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:46.530
 For example, when there is something like this , the taste is already localized to the middle class 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:51.959
 It is not useless and Well would pass the range at that time 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.210
 It is useless even if it counts up and goes up from the range too much , and the wind is strong considering it 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.580
 Sato 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.720
 It's why you just balance the weight of the jig head 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.790
 And let's make it decide there 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.730
 so 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.610
 I will position it, but at that time I feel myself by hitting the weight of the jig head 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.870
 It is to say that kept constant 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:18.250
 That the jig head may become lighter or heavier is not is out of the range 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.760
 I 'm going to coordinate it with that number notation who 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.760
 For example 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.830
 At that time though it is why the wind is blowing from the front now 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.400
 I'll throw it up and expand the line amount 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.640
 In the bloated state 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.790
 I will adjust this slack in the bloated state 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.090
 I'd just be awkward little or alive deleted 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.550
 I can not expand this all the time like this 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.940
 I 'm holding it up and the same range is swept away by the wind all the time 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:53.250
 I 'm getting this tension all the time 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:57.860
 All you have to do is say in front of you 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:03.370
 This at least you'll make when you put extra and have inflated this 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:08.140
 You can also feel through your visit as increasing the adjustment called sink poultry 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:12.400
 Anotada line together at you for at inflated the I inevitably delay 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.640
 I say a little way but I do not go unless or not to meet as soon as possible with God's delay Island 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.580
 Even if it swells, the hit will be connected 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.320
 so 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:23.610
 Even if a little late even swollen a little in it come out of quite good of the square at the time such thoroughly 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.610
 It is often in time 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.430
 Is not it active earlier 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.420
 I'm receiving a line and I'm Brett that day 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.220
 It is not as the one swing love shining not make remember 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.330
 I'm not trying to begin with this should be in such a relationship 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.840
 I think it's okay to say laundry 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.550
 I really like it, but I like light travel 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.870
 Disturbing to me Rutteyuu 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.870
 I 'm going to live in pro-soul in this state 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.569
 Ahha ah ah 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.300
 It is a level 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.720
 Yuttan 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.660
 Standing Hankyu 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.030
 There is no 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.050
 It is not a mon was already 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:55.020
 But it is because of my Kyu 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:59.630
 It's just about to be carried and this 4 is considered to be Japan a little while ago 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:04.060
 That's exactly what the pattern is like 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.310
 I have Bataan Weber's Fish 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.600
 Masu Tei 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.600
 I think it's Kabuki Renobe 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.390
 pandan 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:36.270
 par 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:39.020
 If it is my 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.020
 Shooting 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.990
 ben 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.190
 Hmm 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.190
 tan
