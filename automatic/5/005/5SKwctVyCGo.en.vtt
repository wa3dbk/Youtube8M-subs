00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
twice this doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:50.830

because<00:01:49.970> I'm<00:01:50.149> going<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.329> go<00:01:50.420> over<00:01:50.599> the<00:01:50.689> top

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:00.190 
because I'm going to go over the top
again<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:58.700> I'm<00:01:59.479> just<00:01:59.599> gonna<00:01:59.750> go<00:01:59.929> like<00:02:00.049> this

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
and cap them with the paint now I might

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.580 
and cap them with the paint now I might
add<00:02:04.310> two<00:02:04.729> coats<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.299> topcoat<00:02:05.599> to<00:02:06.080> these<00:02:06.229> ends

add two coats of topcoat to these ends

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.940

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
because paint it fought it wears off but

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.140 
because paint it fought it wears off but
because<00:02:10.369> there's<00:02:10.549> so<00:02:10.670> much<00:02:10.759> polish

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
because there's so much polish

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.550 
because there's so much polish
underneath<00:02:11.390> it'll<00:02:11.750> wear<00:02:11.870> off<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.230> real<00:02:12.410> nice
