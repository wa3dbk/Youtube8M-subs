00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:06.220
 On Monday evening, July 6, the Ajax Members' Council met to meet with 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.349
 the candidates for the new supervisory board 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.219
 most striking is the return of Johan Cruijff and the role of every Davids 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.650
 intended chairman is professor and business strategy 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.130
 against ten have 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.819
 equally important what do you have with ajax 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.389
 Well with the latter to start what I have at Ajax I am Ajax supporter 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.199
 I have all been this from an early age 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.930
 no more and no less bad I would say 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.310
 during the conversations people were a bit of ajaxied and then I said yes 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.210
 heart is 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.660
 But yes if you talk to all the people who live in this environment then modesty fits 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.950
 you talk to people who have your trigion it matches at all levels 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.650
 played 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.810
 who have great earnings for the club 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.310
 there are people in their 60s who are members of one of the associations 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.640
 those are the unadulterated and earned ajaxis the remaining candidate 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.070
 commissioners marjan olfers paul römer 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.000
 the chorus that you meet each other naturally 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.160
 for the last time a little weird 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.050
 how the portfolios are divided among themselves because they are alcohol 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.470
 if you look at the profiles it is true that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.770
 right of course a big sail there when it comes to entrepreneurship 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.220
 in the media landscape 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.090
 he has worked at and the mole among others there he has a number one 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.990
 pioneering concept 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.100
 he is ultimately responsible manager, a driver but also one 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.110
 entrepreneur in all good meanings of mine of the word 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.750
 and that is actually a pre-announcement of what he will do here too 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.720
 they look but jan olfers it is true that they are in the field of course 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.750
 sport and law 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.980
 really is a crack 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.750
 she will be awarded a PhD, she will soon also be professors at the free university 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.410
 to become 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.170
 It is expected and in addition there is also home from the side shows we have 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 will of course 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.380
 supervising the financial management of ajax 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.180
 as an important topics in addition to other things coming from the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.710
 expertise is obvious 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.850
 and of course it is so in Johan Cruyff I will not explain further 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.140
 with done naturally like to say something about 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.600
 but of course he has enormous merits as long as she is playing football 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.850
 That also means that he has a lot more to offer in addition, he is an entrepreneur 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.150
 has its own clothing brand that operates internationally what it owns 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.599
 the legs has a golf course 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.240
 in addition, the esso is that they too 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.749
 and the study does one and diet 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.219
 he will write a dissertation about a thesis about it 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.169
 he allows himself to be the difference between managing a company that 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.919
 is a football company and to a company that is not one 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.649
 example company is one that in very natural it is one of the subjects 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.259
 for this environment 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.049
 and the rest he does in collaboration with, for example, the Ministry 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.489
 street football tournament a lot of social work 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.719
 He would also become a national coach of 10 of early school leavers 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.170
 has a lot to offer and is also an administrative person 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.560
 He has a lot to know about you once again when he has not been discussed 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.469
 football experience then you have a fantastic candidate 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.019
 and helped a lot 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.580
 their own role is that of course from the president's mean that you have a lot 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.820
 You are always busy with the organization of the supervisory board 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.150
 with a view to the interests of ajax and the proper serving of supervision 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:11.129
 we must ensure that we say late to stimulate organization and where necessary 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.529
 disciplining 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.840
 it is the art i think to operate it at the roc 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.510
 but at the same time also have that authority remotely and know your place 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.110
 and to be of service 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.310
 but the thing that really matters and that is the club, that's what the teams are 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.349
 are players and that there are the performances great absentee was also 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.829
 yes but of course we have to deal with that and that goes for the members but that 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.179
 also applies, for example, to a nomination committee that also applies to 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.699
 the supervisory board that will become baltus 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.589
 those are all people with busy agendas so you can't finish it 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:45.029
 he has a busy schedule but the fact is that he naturally has choices 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:45.959
 had to make 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.499
 and we said from last week have invested well in it 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.740
 team the race that has all been busy 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.330
 Have a good conversation and we said with all due respect 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.270
 the people here 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.900
 because it is in no way intended not to eat that respect 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.190
 if a choice is and he made a choice to be out a week ago 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.710
 when you actually got off to a good start as a supervisory board 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.240
 and that leads to the absence of something here that is not what you want 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.520
 then that is also regrettable 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.029
 and we also apologize at the front 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.590
 but should it be seen as a perspective it is often not just something like 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.129
 you sit on the board with someone like Johan Cruijff 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:21.809
 original thinking 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:26.979
 accustomed to present thoughts from mainly that not then we often see 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.080
 that it withdraws yes 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.880
 well I think we get wise people with them and that's a good thing they too 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.800
 are all familiar with the field 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.669
 Johan Cruijff stare exceptionally in that it is beyond any discussion but 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.970
 I would point to the fact that he has now taken the step to join that council 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.120
 Commissioner, he has really taken away responsibility 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.030
 You don't do that just like that and besides that you can argue to him what that 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.520
 also involves having the mind jumps that make him so special and 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.490
 at the same time 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.830
 and that also applies to having the other discipline 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.229
 to speak with a technician and to maintain a line in that regard 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.629
 but if you were to discipline that then you assume you don't actually have it 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:09.800
 the talent of Tintin from the oven 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.870
 I would like to ask the supporters 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.469
 pelé call to actually do the same 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:19.820
 to an even greater extent what we are not actually trying to give in front 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.580
 and that is all behind ajax looking positively at the future 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.420
 to give the past a place but also to close it in a certain sense 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.770
 and especially to look at what we now have because we now have a chance 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.440
 I think that is unique to start with the involvement of Johan Cruijff 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.880
 presence of it goes there bike 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.830
 the chance to build some new things again good to the 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.289
 youth education 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.520
 and where a good basis lies I can go much more naturally 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.779
 develop and in that way basically just for stability cooperation 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.270
 towards the future, the worries of the thought became an ajax
