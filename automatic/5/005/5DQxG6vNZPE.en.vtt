 Where's the astringent and bitter taste so strong and it's like you got it 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.800
 Is very oc carbonate stronger 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:03.840
 Because bitterness falls because it is carbonation of strength 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.840
 And there are 4 minutes so it's very close to beer . 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.440

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.980

 Although I said it, I compared it to all but drinking 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.980
 After all I feel that it is close to the dry zero child market beer of this morning's cat 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.470
 And carbonation is strong 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.790
