with<00:00:21.750> some<00:00:21.900> really<00:00:22.170> deep<00:00:22.710> problems<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.609> think<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
with some really deep problems I think a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.390

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.759 
lot of the issues in interstellar stem
from<00:00:26.519> how<00:00:26.760> Nolan<00:00:27.210> seems<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.810> pace<00:00:28.080> his<00:00:28.410> films

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
from how Nolan seems to pace his films

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.130

and by that I mean he wants to set up

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700
