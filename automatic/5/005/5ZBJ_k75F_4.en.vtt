00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.390
 is my beloved 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.600
 every week new things happen on our planet 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.680
 new news circulates 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.740
 potential media by the media and by 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.390
 extra-official forms by the alternative media that today has 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.739
 Internet 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.739
 and even the dvds also in that which is an example of them 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:33.550
 at every discovery of ours we are thus more sensitive to find 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.210
 and everything can be premeditated 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.810
 for you to have an idea 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.300
 this fall of the plane and was thus with four 4 7 with recipients 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.310
 You have not seen any radio and newspaper 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.760
 tell 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.100
 could at least 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 would be something that was not natural 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.440
 you have not seen anyone or an expert on the subject for example 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.090
 associating with the attack 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.500
 they can not put this possibility 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.210
 but in front of everything we know 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 of everything we've been there, there's also 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.150
 said 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.900
 analyze the facts well 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 and also consider 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.150
 waters for which the United States has 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.720
 now with the proposal to do so 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.070
 but we do not know, much less have they done 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.140
 the possible weapons used are 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.450
 the leisure 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.790
 the plasma 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.380
 and the electromagnetic pulse 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.770
 I jumped to be an old acquaintance 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.700
 but with new technologies employed it can be coupled to an airplane 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.110
 in this simulation the missile 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.150
 is being directed and targets a passenger plane 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.110
 the violence 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.810
 directs your beam into cadu 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.250
 for a missile 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.250
 and manages to destroy it before it reaches the target 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.760
 although it is a state-of-the-art technology 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.029
 this effect can be achieved even at home 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.159
 with the cost of payment 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.350
 of cake-king on the internet and various videos 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.689
 explain how to do an analysis 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.249
 with the functionality of the mind, which 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.389
 the American 17 gun 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.349
 of course 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.609
 and with a much lower firepower 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.680
 to melt an insulating tape, for example to light a 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.799
 phosphorus but the technology is the same although here small scale 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.400
 Plastic gun seems to have come straight out of fiction films 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.069
 scientific 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.659
 it is launched by a missile and is suspended in the air exactly the way 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.299
 which must pass through the avenue at the moment the aircraft passes through the 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.049
 a place where something like a cloud or dust 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.779
 all electronic contacts are to tomatoes off automatically 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.180
 I cut the circuit 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.180
 can even generate an explosion 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.069
 the rock weapon 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.759
 electromagnetic pulse 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.769
 can be activated from space o earth 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.919
 a concentrated beam of energy 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.289
 is thrown towards the target 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:19.919
 the same energy that makes your radio works makes your television work 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.319
 only it a much larger scale 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.779
 when this beam of electromagnetic energy hit its target 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:32.479
 inevitably everything is turned off whether a car is in the building or a city 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.479
 be 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.219
 let's hope 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.209
 solar energy 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.499
 came from the bush 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.289
 has 15% 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.349
 explained that you were present 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.349
 in a statement the company says customers 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.699
 now it's weird 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:11.079
 keita even at home using the 9-volt battery a coil the 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.479
 transient 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.479
 you can manufacture a detected of electromagnetism 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.509
 and that works very well 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.069
 in this video you watch an example 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:22.770
 did not exist 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.279
 on the air france plane 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.439
 a simple equalizer and ac 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.439
 the questions are in the air 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.699
 the conclusions you have 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.129
 as a matter of fact 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.650
 a lot of things are clear 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.340
 benediction to esamc 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.270
 the fall 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.309
 that supposed loss 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:46.739
 the pervert's plane
