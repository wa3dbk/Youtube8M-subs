00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
standard now so it should be a

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.770 
standard now so it should be a
no-brainer<00:02:46.859> get<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.970> intel<00:02:48.480> dual<00:02:48.750> core

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
no-brainer get the intel dual core

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.750 
no-brainer get the intel dual core
that's<00:02:49.410> what<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.829> geeks<00:02:50.069> gonna<00:02:50.370> tell<00:02:50.609> you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
that's what the geeks gonna tell you

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.809 
that's what the geeks gonna tell you
yeah<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.420> Congo<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.200> above<00:02:52.560> cores<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:53.340> so

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
yeah the Congo and above cores are so

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.149 
yeah the Congo and above cores are so
much<00:02:54.060> better<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:54.780> tablet<00:02:55.379> not<00:02:55.739> just<00:02:56.040> because

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
much better for tablet not just because

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.920 
much better for tablet not just because
they're<00:02:56.489> faster<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.090> they<00:02:57.209> totally<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:57.659> for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
they're faster and they totally have for

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.750 
they're faster and they totally have for
anything<00:02:58.049> else<00:02:58.319> right<00:02:58.470> now<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:58.950> there's<00:02:59.640> some

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760
