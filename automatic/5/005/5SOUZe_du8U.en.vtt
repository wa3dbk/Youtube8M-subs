00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.380 
Reese Culp ting uh some of the parks
into<00:00:26.470> it<00:00:26.590> so<00:00:27.010> what<00:00:27.789> I'm<00:00:27.880> going<00:00:28.000> to<00:00:28.030> do<00:00:28.180> down

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
into it so what I'm going to do down

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.859 
into it so what I'm going to do down
actually<00:00:29.200> is<00:00:29.289> cut<00:00:29.500> this<00:00:29.619> thing<00:00:29.800> in<00:00:29.860> half

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
actually is cut this thing in half

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.729 
actually is cut this thing in half
simply<00:00:31.869> because<00:00:32.020> you<00:00:32.169> need<00:00:32.379> to<00:00:32.439> be<00:00:32.500> able<00:00:32.650> to

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
simply because you need to be able to

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.640 
simply because you need to be able to
bend<00:00:32.950> your<00:00:33.070> foot<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:34.390> for<00:00:35.230> better<00:00:35.380> traction

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
bend your foot just for better traction

00:00:35.650 --> 00:02:39.199 
bend your foot just for better traction
so<00:00:36.070> you<00:00:36.310> wouldn't<00:00:36.760> cut<00:00:36.910> it<00:00:37.000> right<00:00:37.090> now

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.920 

all<00:02:40.209> right<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.510> should<00:02:40.659> be<00:02:40.750> good<00:02:40.870> enough

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
all right and that should be good enough

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.209 
all right and that should be good enough
mr.<00:02:41.590> mank<00:02:41.739> Papas<00:02:42.129> apart<00:02:42.459> now<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:44.829> reason<00:02:45.099> I'm

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
mr. mank Papas apart now the reason I'm

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.490 
mr. mank Papas apart now the reason I'm
doing<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.489> is<00:02:45.909> just<00:02:46.239> because<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.170> you

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
doing this is just because of that you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.589 
doing this is just because of that you
want<00:02:47.680> some<00:02:47.950> flexibility<00:02:48.670> when<00:02:48.819> you're<00:02:48.939> you're

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
want some flexibility when you're you're

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.220 
want some flexibility when you're you're
stepping<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:51.299> I'm<00:02:52.299> going<00:02:52.629> to<00:02:52.689> go<00:02:52.900> ahead<00:02:52.989> and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
stepping so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.550 
stepping so I'm going to go ahead and
make<00:02:53.439> these<00:02:53.620> parts<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.810> they<00:02:56.019> fit<00:02:56.230> into<00:02:56.349> each

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
make these parts so they fit into each

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.920 
make these parts so they fit into each
other<00:02:56.769> so<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.489> need<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.760> carve<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.599> inside<00:02:58.840> of

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
other so I need to carve the inside of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.110 
other so I need to carve the inside of
this<00:02:59.049> out<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.439> then<00:02:59.590> obviously<00:03:00.519> put<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.909> hinge

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
this out and then obviously put a hinge

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.539 
this out and then obviously put a hinge
here<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.719> fill<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.139> out<00:03:02.349> here<00:03:02.769> so<00:03:03.430> they

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
here and fill this out here so they

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.399 
here and fill this out here so they
connect<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.989> then<00:03:05.139> they'll<00:03:05.260> be<00:03:05.379> a

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
connect and then they'll be a

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.500 
connect and then they'll be a
chicago-style<00:03:06.340> bolt<00:03:06.730> here<00:03:06.939> that<00:03:07.090> holds<00:03:07.329> their

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
chicago-style bolt here that holds their

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.039 
chicago-style bolt here that holds their
what<00:03:07.659> not<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:09.069> then<00:03:09.879> it's<00:03:10.030> off<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
what not so and then it's off the

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.020 
what not so and then it's off the
casting<00:03:11.530> now<00:03:11.680> what<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.099> plan<00:03:12.519> on<00:03:12.549> doing<00:03:12.909> is

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030
