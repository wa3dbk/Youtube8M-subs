00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
little bit of right there in the you've

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.650 
little bit of right there in the you've
seen<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:58.699> there's<00:03:58.940> some<00:03:59.060> black<00:03:59.299> wash

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660

throughout<00:04:00.169> I'm<00:04:00.680> not<00:04:00.919> sure<00:04:01.190> if<00:04:01.340> that's

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
throughout I'm not sure if that's

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.770 
throughout I'm not sure if that's
supposed<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.849> be<00:04:01.910> wash<00:04:02.180> or<00:04:02.599> if<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:02.750> just

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
supposed to be wash or if it just

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.809 
supposed to be wash or if it just
smeared<00:04:03.319> on<00:04:03.590> there<00:04:03.889> there's<00:04:04.220> some<00:04:04.370> quality

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
smeared on there there's some quality

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.640 
smeared on there there's some quality
control<00:04:04.849> I<00:04:05.419> bet<00:04:05.629> it<00:04:05.750> was<00:04:05.840> quality<00:04:06.109> control

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
control I bet it was quality control

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.720 
control I bet it was quality control
issues<00:04:07.129> but<00:04:07.849> very<00:04:08.510> minor<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:10.250> kind<00:04:10.489> of<00:04:10.549> looks

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
issues but very minor it kind of looks

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.369 
issues but very minor it kind of looks
good<00:04:11.000> though<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.449> think<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.900> kind<00:04:12.049> of<00:04:12.079> gives<00:04:12.290> it

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
good though I think it kind of gives it

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.619 
good though I think it kind of gives it
that<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.709> know<00:04:12.799> cuz<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.099> black<00:04:13.699> lines<00:04:14.120> is

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
over here had a swivel you know so you

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.519 
over here had a swivel you know so you
can<00:06:13.979> rotate<00:06:14.159> it<00:06:14.580> at<00:06:14.839> you<00:06:15.839> know<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.169> kind<00:06:16.500> of

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529 
can rotate it at you know the kind of

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.439 
can rotate it at you know the kind of
mid<00:06:16.740> forearm<00:06:17.039> section<00:06:17.789> that<00:06:17.909> would<00:06:18.000> be<00:06:18.089> really

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
mid forearm section that would be really

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.260
