00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
in I'm keeping these pieces quite big

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.949 
in I'm keeping these pieces quite big
but<00:02:44.849> if<00:02:45.150> your<00:02:45.269> little<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:45.540> doesn't<00:02:45.840> like

but if your little one doesn't like
larger<00:02:46.319> pieces<00:02:46.530> then<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.100> always<00:02:47.250> cut

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
larger pieces then you can always cut

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.890 
larger pieces then you can always cut
them<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.790> because<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.450> cooked<00:02:48.660> though

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900

stand over this pan in fact if you stand
stirring<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.359> end<00:03:24.510> up<00:03:24.600> with<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.750> real<00:03:24.900> bloop

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
stirring you end up with a real bloop

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.660 
stirring you end up with a real bloop
you'll<00:03:25.590> bring<00:03:25.709> out<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.950> starch<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.519> oats

and then it with a real gloopy storge so

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.410 
and then it with a real gloopy storge so
give<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.400> good<00:03:29.579> mix<00:03:29.640> thing<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.120> make<00:03:30.269> sure
