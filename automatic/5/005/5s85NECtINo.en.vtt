00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
just going to tilt it downwards and like

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.840 
just going to tilt it downwards and like
wrap<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.040> around<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.459> barrel<00:03:22.519> I'm<00:03:23.519> just<00:03:23.700> going

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
wrap it around the barrel I'm just going

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.850 
wrap it around the barrel I'm just going
to<00:03:23.880> hold<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.239> for<00:03:24.330> about<00:03:24.540> three<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.470> five

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
to hold it for about three to five

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.780 
to hold it for about three to five
seconds<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.560> now<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:28.680> pretty<00:03:28.860> good<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.670> we

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
seconds so now it's pretty good and we

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.880 
seconds so now it's pretty good and we
take<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.060> out<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.540> should<00:03:30.690> look<00:03:30.810> like<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.200> but

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
take it out it should look like this but

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.070 
take it out it should look like this but
I'm<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.130> gonna<00:03:32.250> let<00:03:32.489> all<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.060> heat<00:03:33.450> soak

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
I'm just gonna let all that heat soak

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.270 
I'm just gonna let all that heat soak
into<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> hair<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.709> I'm<00:03:34.769> not<00:03:34.860> going<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.070> touch

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
into the hair so I'm not going to touch

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.830 
into the hair so I'm not going to touch
it<00:03:35.340> or<00:03:35.730> tamper<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.239> until<00:03:36.510> it's

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
it or tamper with it until it's

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.750 
it or tamper with it until it's
completely<00:03:37.320> cooled<00:03:37.739> off<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.370> way<00:03:38.580> it'll

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
completely cooled off this way it'll

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.250 
completely cooled off this way it'll
also<00:03:38.970> hold<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.420> curl<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.660> little<00:03:39.750> bit<00:03:40.080> longer

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
also hold a curl a little bit longer

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.040 
also hold a curl a little bit longer
because<00:03:41.100> hair<00:03:41.430> tends<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.970> style<00:03:42.300> when<00:03:42.930> it's

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
because hair tends to style when it's

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.410 
because hair tends to style when it's
being<00:03:43.290> heated<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.220> if<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.580> cools<00:03:44.760> down<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
being heated so if it cools down the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.300 
being heated so if it cools down the
style<00:03:45.660> won't<00:03:45.930> change<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.769> then<00:03:46.920> again<00:03:47.160> i'm

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
style won't change so then again i'm

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.310 
style won't change so then again i'm
going<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.519> do<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.790> start<00:03:48.120> at<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.330> part<00:03:48.600> work

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
going to do that start at the part work

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.220 
going to do that start at the part work
my<00:03:49.590> way<00:03:49.769> down<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.730> end<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.180> hair<00:03:51.390> line

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
my way down to the end of the hair line

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.810 
my way down to the end of the hair line
down<00:03:52.530> there<00:03:52.739> i'm<00:03:53.040> going<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.280> pull<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.489> straight

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
down there i'm going to pull it straight

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.020 
down there i'm going to pull it straight
out<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.290> take<00:03:56.250> my<00:03:56.370> curling<00:03:56.670> iron<00:03:56.790> and

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
out like this take my curling iron and

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.130 
out like this take my curling iron and
it<00:03:57.239> works<00:03:57.420> easier<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:57.870> you're<00:03:57.930> just<00:03:58.019> gonna

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
it works easier if you're just gonna

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.810 
it works easier if you're just gonna
wrap<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.440> around<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.769> barrel<00:03:59.070> by<00:03:59.310> tipping<00:03:59.700> it

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
wrap it around the barrel by tipping it

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.360 
wrap it around the barrel by tipping it
downward<00:04:00.209> like<00:04:00.360> this<00:04:00.570> tip<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.290> down<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.800> wrap

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
downward like this tip it down and wrap

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.040 
downward like this tip it down and wrap
it<00:04:02.580> around<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.030> barrel<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.570> hold<00:04:03.930> it

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
it around the barrel and hold it

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.750 
it around the barrel and hold it
throughout<00:04:04.230> three<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.800> five<00:04:04.950> seconds<00:04:05.400> and

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
throughout three to five seconds and

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.240 
throughout three to five seconds and
again<00:04:06.239> if<00:04:06.450> your<00:04:06.570> hair<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.750> harder<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.170> curl<00:04:07.500> go

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
again if your hair is harder to curl go

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.340 
again if your hair is harder to curl go
ahead<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.820> just<00:04:09.150> leave<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.930> in<00:04:10.019> there<00:04:10.140> for<00:04:10.200> a

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
ahead and just leave it in there for a

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.199 
ahead and just leave it in there for a
little<00:04:10.470> bit<00:04:10.560> longer<00:04:10.799> no<00:04:11.370> sorry<00:04:11.760> my<00:04:11.910> quarters

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
right in the camera ok so right about

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.380 
right in the camera ok so right about
now

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.210 

okay<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.780> also<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.380> just<00:04:22.500> noticed<00:04:22.980> that<00:04:23.040> my

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
okay and also I just noticed that my

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.040 
okay and also I just noticed that my
industrial<00:04:23.490> was<00:04:24.060> right<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.420> the<00:04:24.450> view<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.930> as

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
industrial was right in the view and as

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.450 
industrial was right in the view and as
you<00:04:25.170> can<00:04:25.320> see<00:04:25.350> it's<00:04:25.770> pretty<00:04:25.920> gross<00:04:26.160> because<00:04:26.340> I

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
you can see it's pretty gross because I

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.210 
you can see it's pretty gross because I
have<00:04:26.580> these<00:04:26.730> um<00:04:27.350> bumps<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.560> because<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:29.070> did

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
have these um bumps on it because I did

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.280 
have these um bumps on it because I did
I<00:04:29.430> just<00:04:30.090> never<00:04:30.210> clean<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:30.930> have<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.200> go

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
I just never clean it so I have to go

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.780

little bit and also I don't curl my
bangs<00:06:47.289> because<00:06:47.620> I<00:06:47.710> just<00:06:47.889> kind<00:06:48.039> of<00:06:48.069> like<00:06:48.220> them

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
bangs because I just kind of like them

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.159

flowing<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.240> just<00:06:49.419> sweeping<00:06:49.810> off<00:06:49.930> to<00:06:50.080> the

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
flowing and just sweeping off to the

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.510
