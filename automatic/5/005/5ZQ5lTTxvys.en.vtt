00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
sim card when you upgrade this but

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.330 
sim card when you upgrade this but
there's<00:02:02.049> ways<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.380> getting<00:02:02.649> around<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.979> I'll

put<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.729> link<00:02:03.970> also<00:02:04.210> for<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.930> can<00:02:05.649> get<00:02:05.770> it

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
put a link also for that I can get it

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.590
