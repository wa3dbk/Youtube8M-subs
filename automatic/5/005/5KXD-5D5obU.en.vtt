00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
my favorite one ever so far and pretty

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.950 
my favorite one ever so far and pretty
much<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.250> defining<00:00:23.699> feature<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.390> me<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
much the defining feature for me is the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.630 
much the defining feature for me is the
battery<00:00:25.410> life<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> that's<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> reason<00:00:26.460> I

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
battery life and that's the reason I

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.480 
battery life and that's the reason I
want<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> talk<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.750> today<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.279> an

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
want to talk to you today so just for an

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.209 
want to talk to you today so just for an
example<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.480> used<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.019> charge<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
example I have used this charge on the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.959 
example I have used this charge on the
iPad<00:00:32.610> Mini<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.420> 21<00:00:34.079> hours<00:00:34.500> usage<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> 22

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
iPad Mini for 21 hours usage and 22

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.840 
iPad Mini for 21 hours usage and 22
minutes<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.260> been<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.620> standby<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.460> 3

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
minutes and it's been on standby for 3

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
minutes and it's been on standby for 3
days<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.480> 7<00:00:40.410> hours<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.399> 8<00:00:41.579> percent

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
days and 7 hours and it's got 8 percent

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
days and 7 hours and it's got 8 percent
battery<00:00:42.030> left<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.110> pretty<00:00:43.350> insane

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
battery left so that is pretty insane

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
battery left so that is pretty insane
when<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:44.910> iPhone<00:00:45.210> 5<00:00:45.570> for

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
when you think that an iPhone 5 for

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.100 
when you think that an iPhone 5 for
example<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.950> has<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.430> around<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.110> 1400

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
example it has a around about of 1400

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.400 
example it has a around about of 1400
milliamp<00:00:49.440> hour<00:00:49.590> battery<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.489> has<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:51.410> 4400

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
milliamp hour battery this has a 4400

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.680 
milliamp hour battery this has a 4400
milliamp<00:00:52.770> hour<00:00:52.949> battery<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.539> last

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
milliamp hour battery and it can last

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
milliamp hour battery and it can last
for<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.110> long<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> iPad<00:00:55.980> iPhone<00:00:56.399> fires

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
for that long and the iPad iPhone fires

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
for that long and the iPad iPhone fires
a<00:00:56.699> lot<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.360> lot<00:00:57.719> smaller<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> charge

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
a lot a lot smaller and I have to charge

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.049 
a lot a lot smaller and I have to charge
that<00:00:58.949> around<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.340> after<00:00:59.699> about<00:00:59.850> eight

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that around about after about eight

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.279 
that around about after about eight
hours<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.750> even<00:01:00.930> straight<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
hours that's not even straight a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.729 
hours that's not even straight a
straight<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.309> usage<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:03.270> around<00:01:03.539> free<00:01:04.500> for

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
straight to usage that's around free for

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
straight to usage that's around free for
four<00:01:04.949> hours<00:01:05.159> straight<00:01:05.430> usage<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.360> long

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
four hours straight usage and a long

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.920 
four hours straight usage and a long
time<00:01:06.900> standby<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.100> bearing<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.880> mind<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
time standby so bearing in mind that the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
time standby so bearing in mind that the
iPad<00:01:10.229> Mini<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.590> only<00:01:10.799> about<00:01:11.070> triple<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
iPad Mini is only about triple the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.359 
iPad Mini is only about triple the
capacity<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:13.140> has<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.320> much<00:01:13.590> larger<00:01:13.770> screen<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
capacity it has a much larger screen to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.370 
capacity it has a much larger screen to
power<00:01:14.580> fewer<00:01:15.270> pixels<00:01:15.540> due<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> fact<00:01:16.320> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
power fewer pixels due to the fact that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
power fewer pixels due to the fact that
it<00:01:16.530> does<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> lack<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> Retina<00:01:17.670> display

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
it does have a lack of Retina display

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.730 
it does have a lack of Retina display
but<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> compare<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> something

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
but when you compare this to something

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
but when you compare this to something
like<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> Nexus<00:01:20.369> 7<00:01:20.520> ayah<00:01:20.850> again<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.570> owned

not<00:01:24.479> knocking<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.049> however<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.680> are<00:01:25.710> Nexus<00:01:26.159> 7

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
not knocking it however they are Nexus 7

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.480 
not knocking it however they are Nexus 7
you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.210> rarely<00:01:28.049> use<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> day

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you can rarely use for you know a day

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.030 
you can rarely use for you know a day
and<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> half<00:01:29.930> around<00:01:30.930> about<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.350> well<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and a half around about that well you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.039 
and a half around about that well you
would<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> charge<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.840> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
would then have to charge it and this is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.030 
would then have to charge it and this is
just<00:01:34.200> insane

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
just insane

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.399 
just insane
I<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.280> regularly<00:01:35.759> use<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> whole<00:01:37.110> day

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
I can regularly use this for a whole day

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
I can regularly use this for a whole day
be<00:01:37.920> using<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.460> around<00:01:38.670> about<00:01:38.909> half

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
be using it on around about half

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
be using it on around about half
brightness<00:01:39.750> that's<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.350> generally<00:01:40.530> used

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
brightness that's what I generally used
