say

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.920 

it<00:02:17.590> looks<00:02:17.980> like<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.310> focus<00:02:18.850> with<00:02:19.180> slightly

even though it's not my back seats it

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.219 
even though it's not my back seats it
might<00:05:12.069> work<00:05:12.250> we<00:05:12.460> this<00:05:12.639> modest<00:05:13.629> touch<00:05:13.810> on<00:05:13.990> I

might work we this modest touch on I

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:14.640 
might work we this modest touch on I
think

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
think

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.070

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
Renault should be applauded for being a

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.159 
Renault should be applauded for being a
mainstream<00:05:17.530> manufacturer<00:05:18.190> we<00:05:18.900> brave<00:05:19.900> enough

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
mainstream manufacturer we brave enough

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.779 
mainstream manufacturer we brave enough
to<00:05:20.349> do<00:05:20.470> something<00:05:20.710> honest<00:05:21.099> approach<00:05:21.400> first

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
to do something honest approach first

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.330 
to do something honest approach first

that is well done Renault first one of

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.360 
that is well done Renault first one of
practical<00:05:28.780> clothes<00:05:29.080> have<00:05:29.770> they<00:05:29.919> want<00:05:30.099> to<00:05:30.190> step

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
practical clothes have they want to step

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.420 
practical clothes have they want to step
too<00:05:30.580> far

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
too far

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.890 
too far
I<00:05:31.460> wonder<00:05:31.760> if<00:05:31.850> they<00:05:32.000> have<00:05:32.030> even<00:05:32.570> if<00:05:32.630> you<00:05:32.690> don't

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
I wonder if they have even if you don't

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.540 
I wonder if they have even if you don't
have<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.170> cage<00:05:33.380> you<00:05:33.590> can't<00:05:33.830> have<00:05:34.010> rear<00:05:34.220> seats

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
have the cage you can't have rear seats

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.090 
have the cage you can't have rear seats
and<00:05:34.790> I<00:05:34.970> think<00:05:35.240> that<00:05:35.480> that<00:05:36.080> does<00:05:36.410> reduce<00:05:36.740> the

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
and I think that that does reduce the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.360 
and I think that that does reduce the
capacity<00:05:38.060> is<00:05:38.360> this<00:05:38.630> car<00:05:38.900> so<00:05:39.350> much<00:05:39.380> with<00:05:40.070> a<00:05:40.130> lot

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
capacity is this car so much with a lot

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.010 
capacity is this car so much with a lot
of<00:05:40.400> paper<00:05:40.670> form<00:05:41.000> you<00:05:41.210> know<00:05:41.360> it's<00:05:41.540> just<00:05:41.690> a<00:05:41.810> step

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
of paper form you know it's just a step

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.549 
of paper form you know it's just a step
too<00:05:42.260> far<00:05:42.290> but

00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:43.559 
too far but

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:46.230 
too far but
so

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
so

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.090 
so
not<00:05:47.240> for<00:05:47.420> me<00:05:47.540> to<00:05:47.690> tell<00:05:47.750> their<00:05:48.680> car<00:05:48.860> they

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
not for me to tell their car they

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.620 
not for me to tell their car they
clearly<00:05:49.370> made<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.700> brilliantly<00:05:50.150> but<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.480> has

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
clearly made the brilliantly but it has

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.570 
clearly made the brilliantly but it has
to<00:05:50.780> be<00:05:50.810> acknowledged<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.560> having<00:05:52.070> no<00:05:52.220> radio

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
to be acknowledged that having no radio

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.870 
to be acknowledged that having no radio
with<00:05:52.880> no<00:05:53.030> back<00:05:53.270> seats<00:05:53.570> does<00:05:54.550> restoring<00:05:55.550> people

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
with no back seats does restoring people

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.110 
with no back seats does restoring people
to<00:05:56.240> use<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.570> car

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:14.559 

today<00:05:59.660> the<00:05:59.720> big<00:06:00.020> teams

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:14.569 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.469 

twitchy<00:06:15.569> is<00:06:16.469> the<00:06:16.650> best<00:06:16.860> way<00:06:17.069> to<00:06:17.099> describe<00:06:17.610> the

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
twitchy is the best way to describe the

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.439 
twitchy is the best way to describe the
new<00:06:18.689> Cooper<00:06:19.229> works<00:06:19.759> because<00:06:20.759> like<00:06:20.909> the<00:06:21.030> Subaru

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
new Cooper works because like the Subaru

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:29.330 
new Cooper works because like the Subaru
and<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:21.689> Ford<00:06:21.960> it<00:06:22.199> loves<00:06:22.770> to<00:06:23.180> oversteer<00:06:28.340> it's

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
and the Ford it loves to oversteer it's

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.980 
and the Ford it loves to oversteer it's
a<00:06:29.520> smaller<00:06:29.789> car<00:06:30.060> than<00:06:30.240> all<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.449> others<00:06:30.749> and

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
a smaller car than all the others and

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.260 
a smaller car than all the others and
that<00:06:31.289> makes<00:06:31.529> it<00:06:31.680> more<00:06:32.009> agile<00:06:32.669> but<00:06:33.120> the

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
that makes it more agile but the

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.399 
that makes it more agile but the
steering<00:06:33.719> has<00:06:33.930> an<00:06:34.050> aggressive

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
steering has an aggressive

self-centering effect so recovering a

keep pulling for the limiter okay it's

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.350 
keep pulling for the limiter okay it's
not<00:06:49.500> quite<00:06:49.949> as<00:06:50.189> cute<00:06:50.580> as<00:06:50.729> the<00:06:50.849> old<00:06:51.000> car<00:06:51.330> and

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
not quite as cute as the old car and

those air vents around the rear look

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.360 
those air vents around the rear look

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
like genital warts but who cares when

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.629 
like genital warts but who cares when
it's<00:06:56.520> so<00:06:56.819> much<00:06:57.029> fun<00:06:57.590> it<00:06:58.590> even<00:06:58.860> has<00:06:59.009> a<00:06:59.039> party

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
it's so much fun it even has a party
