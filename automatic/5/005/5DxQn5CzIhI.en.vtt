 full of the kind you went 2 here 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:55.380
 luminous baranets back now 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.380
 look knows course will be properties or 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:09.090
 what will happen bloom server 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.240
 here is the beginning of flowering 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.460
 new varieties of this plant do it for 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:32.590
 care and entered that year early spring he 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.070
 was 23 centimeters at the spring plant vymahal 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.090
 almost on us more than 3 meters and here begin 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:45.520
 flowering on the third year pusik because of this 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.890
 homemade mascot of sorts did you 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.050
 performed here transplanted let's see 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.520
 what will and 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:58.120
 flower bisexual flowers 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.720
 rather large cup through the stock on 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.840
 foliage 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.489
 such dark red eyes and young as 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:15.670
 once said that it will be possible 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:23.230
 blue go see lamp 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:30.400
 worth most varieties of spears 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:33.880
 showed tits that began to bloom on 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.620
 the second year the key collector I grew up in 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:43.060
 10 to this plant which is already 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.760
 the beginning of flowering is this lamp 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.470
 and a little stretched it will probably produce 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.319
 beast berry varieties 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.310
 when the flower is a little pull it 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.140
 characteristic feature 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.980
 let's see what will grow out of this yet 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:06.880
 wind wind wind but it contributes 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:12.989
 flowering pollination glad to 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.989
 it was specifically I came up with this little thing 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:22.900
 well complements the bloom of this such 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:33.300
 thing this sort of Saturn Larissa tour 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:38.040
 and this is a sort of a mixture of pollen and dusting 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:43.240
 other varieties here so pollinated 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:46.740
 went bullets let's say from this drying and all 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.960
 and so on here it is with us 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.270
 extra pollination and give birth to those 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:59.550
 varieties that are specifically female 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:05.520
 flower repeat red or victoria 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.520
 popular and we get more
