00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.760
 now let's go back to the format menu and 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.870
 Consider the item font notebook program 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.309
 does not allow 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.400
 mount text that is, we cannot 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 change 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
 styles for individual fragments 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 text but we can change the font 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.529
 which will be displayed text 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.520
 open notepad for this program 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.919
 window 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.550
 font and choose the font that us 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.189
 like 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 we can set here not only the grinding but 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.699
 and outlines and font size we choose 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.570
 But in this window we can then choose 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.540
 tracings 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.830
 this is both bold italic and bold and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.750
 various combinations 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.570
 a combination that is for example bold 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.360
 italics either and there itâ€™s very fat oblique 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.510
 and so on and so forth we can still choose 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.570
 size that will be displayed click 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.510
 ok and here you see that i have 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.640
 changed the font for the entire document but 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.080
 here be careful you choose not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 font of your text 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.159
 and the font that your text will be 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.590
 show in notebook 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.780
 if you then open this file in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.130
 some other editor then the font 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.409
 the text will be completely different 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.740
 pay attention to this now 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.450
 let's go back to the file menu when 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 work in any programs not only 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.820
 black in notebook and in general 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 any programs 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.920
 save as often as possible for this you 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.540
 can either use the option 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.060
 save which is usually located 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.920
 in the file menu program or use 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 already known combination 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.600
 keys of contra that works 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 in almost all programs 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 thereby reducing the risk of losing 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.940
 the information you have gained since 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.370
 may be a computer crash 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.040
 either barbarians in the work program and you 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.870
 You lose all the information that is 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 you have worked out yes since the past 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.940
 save if you created a text 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.430
 document and then want to create on it 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.100
 based on another text then use 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.930
 option save as this option will allow 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.970
 you create the exact same document 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.240
 the exact same text document in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.250
 in our case, but under a different name 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.920
 there is if your document is called text 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.980
 then you can select the save as option 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.470
 and here for example write the text 2 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.600
 if we click now save then 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.880
 we have a first name changed here 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.460
 this text document on text 2 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.310
 well, respectively, our document and 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.010
 Now I will press the button to open these two 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.110
 document they are absolutely identical then 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.080
 have they contain exactly the same 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.080
 text now we can take and change 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.970
 our document text is two steps do you can 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.410
 you will change to keep with us already 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.810
 get two different text 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.640
 documents if we want to start 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.860
 work on a new document that is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.200
 start work with a clean slate then us 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.810
 you must select the file menu option 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.630
 create either control in key combination 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.959
 will cause the exact same action in 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.480
 In this case, we will have to close our file. 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.130
 which was open last time since 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.610
 Notepad program can only work 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.530
 in one window and create a new file with 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.010
 where we can start working with clean 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.570
 sheet 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.610
 Well, respectively, if we want 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.240
 open the document to which we already 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.180
 worked 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.850
 use the options open and select one 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.410
 the file with which we want to work it 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.150
 us will open programs by opening in 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.310
 program notebook and we can 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.630
 perform any actions that we are with 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.239
 we speak you 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.810
 edit somehow change copy 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.519
 delete information from the file and I also want 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.170
 a little stop here on these two 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.850
 menu items this menu view and help me 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.489
 menu view usually contains tools 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.510
 that allow you to customize the look 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.310
 program windows 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.799
 for example, enable or disable some 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.870
 toolbars or some 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.840
 additional information areas 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.120
 windows program program notepad very 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.299
 so simple menu view 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.940
 only one point is this way 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.709
 called the status bar when 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.380
 turning on the status bar at the bottom 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.330
 the program window area will be displayed 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.440
 information on the number of rows and columns 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.170
 document 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.030
 but there is one nuance to 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.790
 enable status bar we need 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.890
 first disable transfer mode by 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.220
 According to the words we can now use 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.169
 status bar and here you see what 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.500
 here I have the number of rows 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.210
 and columns in my document and for 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.400
 creating columns is necessary 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.169
 use tab keys 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.460
 they we talked in when I 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.000
 talked about the keyboard 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.000
 if I want to create, for example, let's 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.030
 create a new text document if i 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.130
 I want to create for example some kind of numeric 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.780
 sign so let's say yes that is it will be 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.240
 text document but just it will 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.759
 be perceived by the program as consisting 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.520
 of several rows and columns for this 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.470
 i can point some character to press 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.449
 tab key enter next 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.100
 tab character next character 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:13.949
 tabs and that's how I can 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:16.530
 enter the character here and you see here that 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.590
 I have now displayed here and 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.440
 number of rows with columns if by 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.110
 for some reason I get here 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.960
 number of columns 6 honestly say with 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.150
 this thing and did not work so I can not 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.729
 tell why he is interpreted that way 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.440
 tab key after all we have here on 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.710
 actually three columns of this whole row 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.110
 but it doesn't matter that way you can here 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.139
 to create such 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.000
 information and copy and for example 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.000
 other programs like excel program 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.530
 and one more thing I wanted 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.360
 tell it will not save 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.820
 there are additional keys that us 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.389
 allow you to work with documents 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.570
 for example, there are home keys and 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.979
 and what are these keys for example if i 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.500
 now open full screen 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.220
 This window and here I have here 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.770
 pointer 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.909
 Cursor text cursor is somewhere 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.909
 in the middle of a sentence 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:16.770
 if i press the home key then u 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.300
 me cursor will be automatically 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.990
 moved to the beginning of the line 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.870
 if i press the and the key at the end 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.590
 the lines have the page up and page keys 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.889
 down 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.479
 These keys allow you to scroll 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:34.139
 document when we have a very big 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.970
 document then it doesn't fit in height 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.210
 one screen and a key respectively 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.159
 the page about will shift our text so that we 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.840
 Seen on the screen the next part of it a 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:44.550
 page down keys respectively 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.130
 shift the text in such a way that 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.780
 have seen the bottom of this text but 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.910
 these keys you can try 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.770
 independently opening any 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.770
 quite long text document
