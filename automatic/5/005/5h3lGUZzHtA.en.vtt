00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
 yes 

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.859
 it was time to do the second 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.760
 craft that is another memory other 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.650
 memory 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.480
 It is always good memories and apart 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.580
 that are useful that's the way it is, we 're going 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.460
 to see the list of materials 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.029
 for the cinnamon cross we need 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.759
 cinnamon sticks cellophane bags 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:27.160
 curl ribbon and cross to decorate flower 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:30.650
 ribbon shines all silicone cold scissors 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.870
 came and we have the cinnamon and sergio the 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.060
 dancer also to the first communion 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.620
 of the child this fruit is missing the uncle 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:43.020
 drunk no no it is not true that here 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.730
 nobody takes and what we are going to do more or 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 less so 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.710
 how pretty having remember here 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 It still lacks the brightness 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.170
 I will be putting while good 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.640
 also to pure cross because either we have 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.920
 the usual thing already hits because maybe 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.160
 be more natural also to the best what 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.840
 you want to make yourself that you know no longer 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.770
 then kill two birds with one stone 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 the check 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.380
 let's put the two pieces if one is 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.900
 bigger then nothing more cutting the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.780
 other years 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.880
 and without the need for silicon and nothing 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.880
 more we make the knots 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.930
 and there it is 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.930
 and we are going from one place to another 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.350
 you never went to the boy scouts 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.410
 if they taught us according to the worlds 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.510
 the sailor's knot and the double knot and 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.979
 that and then they take you from camp and 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.990
 You will see the refuge and apply your 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.390
 knowledge of knots and holy god where 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.659
 it would rain and if you go down the shelter 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.970
 for the flight I also think that we 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.210
 they taught to make bonfires for 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.740
 cooking meat as we put the wood 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.900
 as well as a whole side and then action 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.900
 as a guy the game east of the woods 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.130
 well answered out there but we're not going 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.130
 ok but no but you know which one 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.720
 here we are giving another touch 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.580
 completely different from cinnamon 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.110
 without varnish if they do not look very good I have 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.019
 that invite you to be a sponsor and so on 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.909
 chin I'm going to spend the millions on 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.950
 Sunday of the child all life what 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.620
 outrageous and then invite him to the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.560
 breakfast in the Christmas gifts 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.580
 no to improvements and nothing goes 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.960
 from bowling 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.940
 it's very nice and then we have these 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.130
 and we have not had much for everyone 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.720
 those many greetings to our 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.700
 community on facebook have asked us 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.450

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:58.430
 can apply in different I do not know what 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:01.209

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.209
 check 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.360
 we have flowers here because 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:12.120
 they want to add to the flowers we make 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.850

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.900
 be one with flower and another with clay with 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.769

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.040
 communion 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.870
 It is very cute and can match 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.420
 the decoration that we make 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.250

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.129
 generational here every time they count 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:59.189

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.130
 the cross with the help of silicone and 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.590
 then it entangles the ribbon but the cross 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.720
 smaller in the center or the base with 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.490
 a little bit of brightness expected to dry and 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.080
