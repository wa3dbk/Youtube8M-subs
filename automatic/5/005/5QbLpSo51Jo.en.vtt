00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
here we go now right off the bat here's

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.990 
here we go now right off the bat here's
some<00:00:19.199> general<00:00:19.619> info<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.369> both<00:00:20.699> pairs<00:00:23.000> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
some general info on both pairs and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
some general info on both pairs and
let's<00:00:24.180> get<00:00:24.359> right<00:00:24.510> into<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.109> we'll<00:00:25.890> start

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
let's get right into it so we'll start

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.349 
let's get right into it so we'll start
off<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.490> outsoles

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
off with the outsoles

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.660 
off with the outsoles
and<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.199> see<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.619> color<00:00:28.890> blocking<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and as you can see the color blocking is

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.150 
and as you can see the color blocking is
identical<00:00:30.539> we're<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.470> few<00:00:31.830> slight

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
identical we're just a few slight

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.700 
identical we're just a few slight
differences<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.790> shade<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.530> case

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
differences in shade and just in case

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
differences in shade and just in case
that<00:00:34.770> does<00:00:35.160> not<00:00:35.340> show<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.090> camera<00:00:36.390> I'll

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that does not show up all on camera I'll

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.950 
that does not show up all on camera I'll
point<00:00:37.380> those<00:00:37.620> things<00:00:37.860> out<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.750> with

the jump man on the CDP pair it is a
little<00:00:42.930> lighter<00:00:43.170> than<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:44.629> 2015's<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.100> also

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
bit of the lime green on the CDP pair

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.340 
bit of the lime green on the CDP pair
it's<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.320> duller<00:00:55.770> than<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.340> 2015<00:00:57.350> here

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
it's a bit duller than the 2015 here

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.770 
it's a bit duller than the 2015 here
they<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> bit<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.309> pop<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> them<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
they have a bit more pop to them but you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.360 
they have a bit more pop to them but you
wouldn't<00:01:01.050> really<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.649> said<00:01:01.920> unless

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
wouldn't really know what I said unless

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.030 
wouldn't really know what I said unless
you<00:01:02.430> were<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.910> right<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> shoe<00:01:04.049> but

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you were like right up to the shoe but

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.330 
you were like right up to the shoe but
you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.580> either<00:01:05.820> way<00:01:06.110> neither<00:01:07.110> pair<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you can go either way neither pair is a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.450 
you can go either way neither pair is a
deal-breaker<00:01:08.689> in<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.960> respect<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.280> let's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
deal-breaker in this respect so let's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.940 
deal-breaker in this respect so let's
move<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:11.670> along<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> tongue

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
move right along now as for the tongue

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.920 
move right along now as for the tongue
on<00:01:14.310> each<00:01:15.240> shoe<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.200> color<00:01:16.490> combination<00:01:17.490> is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
on each shoe the color combination is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.130 
on each shoe the color combination is
different<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.210> type<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> neoprene

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
different and the type of neoprene

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.719 
different and the type of neoprene
material<00:01:22.200> used<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.960> identical<00:01:25.400> now<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
material used is identical now on the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.080 
material used is identical now on the
back<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.450> colors<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> same<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.939> way

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
back the colors are the same and the way

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.590 
back the colors are the same and the way
that<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> sevens<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.560> facing<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.460> well<00:01:32.600> as

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that the sevens are facing as well as

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.499 
that the sevens are facing as well as
the<00:01:33.900> way<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> 23's<00:01:35.070> are<00:01:35.280> leaning<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.939> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the way that the 23's are leaning as you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
the way that the 23's are leaning as you
can<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.860> same<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.610> both<00:01:39.390> sides<00:01:40.909> now

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
can see it's the same on both sides now

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.899 
can see it's the same on both sides now
here<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.630> stitched<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.590> Jumpman<00:01:44.189> now

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
here we have the stitched in Jumpman now

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.030 
here we have the stitched in Jumpman now
on<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> CDP<00:01:45.899> pair<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.710> lighter<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.899> the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
on the CDP pair it is lighter but the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
on the CDP pair it is lighter but the
2015<00:01:50.040> pair<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:51.240> stitching<00:01:51.869> has<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> lot<00:01:52.470> more

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
2015 pair the stitching has a lot more

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.730 
2015 pair the stitching has a lot more
detail<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.590> can

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
detail to it as you can see here you can

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.580 
detail to it as you can see here you can
see<00:01:55.979> each<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.219> his<00:01:56.670> fingers<00:01:57.240> whereas<00:01:58.110> here<00:01:58.409> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
see each of his fingers whereas here you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.370 
see each of his fingers whereas here you
just<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.280> thumb<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.020> does<00:02:01.350> look

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
just see the thumb so this one does look

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.910 
just see the thumb so this one does look
a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:02.009> better<00:02:02.340> than<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> CDP<00:02:03.420> pair<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
a lot better than the CDP pair so just a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
a lot better than the CDP pair so just a
few<00:02:05.130> more<00:02:05.189> things<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> point<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
few more things to point out and the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660 
few more things to point out and the
next<00:02:07.020> two<00:02:07.500> are<00:02:07.799> what<00:02:07.979> most<00:02:08.160> people<00:02:08.610> are

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
next two are what most people are

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.479 
next two are what most people are
curious<00:02:09.239> about<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.289> first<00:02:10.590> being<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> white

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
curious about the first being the white

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.940 
curious about the first being the white
leather<00:02:11.730> upper<00:02:12.239> now<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.440> mm

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
leather upper now on the mm

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.900 
leather upper now on the mm
fifteen<00:02:14.489> pair<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.420> slightly<00:02:16.379> softer<00:02:17.340> but

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
fifteen pair it is slightly softer but

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.130 
fifteen pair it is slightly softer but
not<00:02:18.209> by<00:02:18.420> much

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
not by much

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.009 
not by much
barely<00:02:20.069> noticeable<00:02:20.610> between<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> two<00:02:21.690> pairs

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
barely noticeable between the two pairs

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.800 
barely noticeable between the two pairs
in<00:02:22.379> terms<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.640> quality<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.599> white

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
in terms of the quality of the white

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.850 
in terms of the quality of the white
leather<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:26.040> second<00:02:26.730> thing<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:28.230> new<00:02:28.560> buck

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
leather the second thing is the new buck

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.520 
leather the second thing is the new buck
now<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.819> both<00:02:30.120> pairs<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.840> new<00:02:31.019> buck<00:02:31.290> is

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
now on both pairs the new buck is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.400 
now on both pairs the new buck is
buttery<00:02:32.010> smooth<00:02:32.459> really<00:02:33.450> impressive<00:02:34.290> I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
buttery smooth really impressive I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.710 
buttery smooth really impressive I
thought<00:02:34.620> they<00:02:34.739> did<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> great<00:02:35.250> job<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.849> but

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
thought they did a great job with it but

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.589 
thought they did a great job with it but
the<00:02:36.870> slight<00:02:37.230> edge<00:02:37.530> goes<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.610> CDP<00:02:39.090> pair

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
the slight edge goes to the CDP pair

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.949 
the slight edge goes to the CDP pair
because<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:40.739> just<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:42.060> bit<00:02:42.269> softer

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
because it's just a little bit softer

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.850 
because it's just a little bit softer
and<00:02:43.280> smoother<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:46.140> last<00:02:46.380> thing<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.650> wanted

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
and smoother and the last thing I wanted

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.430 
and smoother and the last thing I wanted
to<00:02:46.950> mention<00:02:47.099> in<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.610> shot<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.239> these<00:02:48.959> Peaks

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
to mention in this shot is these Peaks

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.059 
to mention in this shot is these Peaks
the<00:02:50.430> white<00:02:50.700> Peaks<00:02:51.090> as<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.319> see<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:52.799> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
the white Peaks as you can see on the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.800 
the white Peaks as you can see on the
CDP<00:02:53.610> pair<00:02:54.120> they<00:02:54.329> used<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:55.140> pearl<00:02:56.130> white<00:02:56.810> gloss

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
CDP pair they used a pearl white gloss

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.319 
CDP pair they used a pearl white gloss
on<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:59.250> peaks<00:03:00.260> whereas<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.910> 2015<00:03:02.910> pair

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
on the peaks whereas on the 2015 pair

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.500 
on the peaks whereas on the 2015 pair
it's<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.410> simple<00:03:04.950> white<00:03:05.190> paint<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.970> match

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
it's just simple white paint to match

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.870 
it's just simple white paint to match
the<00:03:06.840> white<00:03:07.019> midsole<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.280> definitely<00:03:08.489> give

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
the white midsole so I definitely give

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.309 
the white midsole so I definitely give
the<00:03:09.060> edge<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.290> CDP<00:03:10.680> pair<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:12.090> one<00:03:12.329> so

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
the edge to the CDP pair on that one so

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.140 
the edge to the CDP pair on that one so
the<00:03:13.470> last<00:03:13.739> two<00:03:14.069> things<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.549> wanted<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.910> point

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the last two things I wanted to point

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.440 
the last two things I wanted to point
out<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.799> CDP<00:03:17.190> pair<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:18.420> have

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
out is that on the CDP pair you have

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.069 
out is that on the CDP pair you have

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
that concludes my comparison video now I

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.330 
that concludes my comparison video now I
was<00:04:00.239> asked<00:04:00.810> which<00:04:01.019> pair<00:04:01.349> do<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.620> prefer<00:04:01.829> more

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
was asked which pair do I prefer more

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.789 
was asked which pair do I prefer more
and<00:04:02.609> I<00:04:03.060> have<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.450> give<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.780> slight<00:04:04.170> edge<00:04:04.470> to

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
and I have to give the slight edge to

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.089 
and I have to give the slight edge to
the<00:04:05.459> CDP<00:04:05.910> pair<00:04:06.480> only<00:04:07.260> because<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.829> few

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
the CDP pair only because of the few

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.699 
the CDP pair only because of the few
slight<00:04:08.430> differences<00:04:08.900> like<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.049> use<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.590> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
slight differences like the use of the

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.400 
slight differences like the use of the
chrome<00:04:11.040> laced<00:04:11.370> tips<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.780> pearl<00:04:13.109> white

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
chrome laced tips and the pearl white

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.990 
chrome laced tips and the pearl white
paint<00:04:13.829> on<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:15.090> peaks<00:04:15.590> but<00:04:16.590> all<00:04:16.889> in<00:04:17.070> all<00:04:17.280> both

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
paint on the peaks but all in all both

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.569 
paint on the peaks but all in all both
pairs<00:04:18.389> were<00:04:18.660> really<00:04:18.959> well<00:04:19.169> done<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:20.099> can't<00:04:20.400> go

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
pairs were really well done you can't go

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.399 
pairs were really well done you can't go
wrong<00:04:20.849> with<00:04:21.150> either<00:04:21.389> pair<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.079> it<00:04:22.169> just

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
wrong with either pair and it just

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.820 
wrong with either pair and it just
depends<00:04:22.950> on<00:04:23.070> your<00:04:23.340> personal<00:04:24.030> preference<00:04:24.659> so<00:04:25.200> I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830
