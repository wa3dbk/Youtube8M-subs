line<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.859> see<00:00:17.010> ad<00:00:17.160> vixen<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.910> under

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
line here you see ad vixen get to under

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.720 
line here you see ad vixen get to under
the<00:00:18.570> 10-yard<00:00:19.020> line<00:00:19.170> they<00:00:19.740> automatically<00:00:20.430> went

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the 10-yard line they automatically went

for<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.939> field<00:00:21.210> goal<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.769> obviously

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
for the field goal so this is obviously

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.759 
for the field goal so this is obviously
some<00:00:23.550> sort<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.789> AI<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.779> hopefully<00:00:25.619> is

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
some sort of AI which and hopefully is

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.130 
some sort of AI which and hopefully is
just<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.070> demo<00:00:26.340> problem<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> not<00:00:27.539> something

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
just a demo problem and not something

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
getting the game when he touched down so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.319 
getting the game when he touched down so
it's<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.640> they've<00:00:44.789> won<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> game

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
it's not like they've won the game

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
it's not like they've won the game
because<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.899> Google<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> game<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
because of that Google I in the game the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.549 
because of that Google I in the game the
touchdown<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.410> whatever

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
touchdown just that they for whatever

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.900 
touchdown just that they for whatever
reason<00:00:50.010> went<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> field<00:00:50.489> goals<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.879> I

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
reason went for the field goals so I

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880 
reason went for the field goals so I
decided<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.629> was<00:00:51.780> gonna<00:00:51.899> recreate<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.710> same

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
decided I was gonna recreate the same

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
decided I was gonna recreate the same
situation<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.059> was<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> lead<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
