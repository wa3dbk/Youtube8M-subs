 "I want to hold you" 

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:23.300
 Close the story that two young people in love at the beach close their eyes and open their chest 

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:37.700
 Love is the southern island, it's a dazzling coral show 

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:52.700
 I love you from the bottom of my heart, but I want to hug you

 Two shy people have no words to talk and if they finger the sandy beach, they wait for a kiss 

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:21.500
 I know all the stars I have and only you 

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:39.000

 Only you

 The eboshi rock is full of tears in the distance 

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:29.600
