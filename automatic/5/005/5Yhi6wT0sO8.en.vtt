00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.450
 hello how are you in my name is Monica 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.840
 of the channel are going to do and today I come to 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.870
 give a tip or advice as they want to call 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.660
 but this one that helped me a lot 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.339
 then this guy is to tell you 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.819
 how to make celebrities right now 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:29.390
 my cut for nails is very fashionable 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:32.149
 my car collections for 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.750
 to make up the almond and the good 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:39.920
 simple I do not know correct me if I'm wrong 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.100
 I do not know but I think a lot of what 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.699
 it's about these issues of makeup 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.239
 almond and all that is more marketing 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:55.190
 I do not know, I'm telling you, but I'm wrong 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:58.030
 but for example the acrylic rose that 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.030
 I bring right here 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.730
 and 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.460
 okay 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.830
 I always saw the videos of organic and 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.340
 I told them I want that acrylic I 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.350
 I want it everyone uses it all 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.170
 the world uses it, father, I want this 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.200
 acrylic and when I buy it the truth I 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.020
 I said it does not have anything fantastic 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.330
 neither in special nor of wow so 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.730
 I was watching, I do not know, I do not remember 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:37.120
 what video and how was this done? 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.710
 shadows in acrylics but 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.140
 something somewhere I saw it 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.570
 and you know not me I do not like to stay 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.360
 with the doubt with the little worm 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.210
 like to experience then I said then 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.540
 I'm going to do the test to see how and what 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.590
 I put on being my own canon girls 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.300
 own mike hub for nails quite simple 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.890
 ok easy use this shadow 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.700
 this shadow that is a beautiful shadow 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.700
 mantel 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.789
 but it's dark then I made several 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.090
 tests 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.600
 then this the only thing I did was 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.020
 grab the broach and drag a 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.020
 bit 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.490
 and the makeup 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.760
 where they do not need much anymore is the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.240
 truth this I put a quantity 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.230
 small and it was very dark then 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.530
 nothing else is a matter of seeing more part and 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:44.260
 they are fixed here and that amount was already 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.900
 then you can already add 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.330
 the acrylic and we are seeing myself 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.600
 I put a little bit of another shadow 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.990
 orange or you can use some makeup 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.660
 that already 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.270
 that already have also 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.760
 this is a little bit more rosy just like 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.560
 the same way we're going 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.560
 and we add to make polvito 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.220
 and be there they are giving you a 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.010
 idea from the first attempt I made 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.100
 more or less were these for my taste 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.160
 they were very dark 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.700
 I'm going to put it so that 20 well 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.700
 they are less 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.770
 they left me a little dark then I 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.010
 I added white acrylic to do it 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:41.150
 the famous acrylic for ccoo 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:46.060
 and then I put a little more white 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.060
 and I 'm already this after 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.370
 is this mix I just did it and I 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.660
 I loved so much I wanted a mix 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.770
 towards blue 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.140
 but there he was in the almond without drinking 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.670
 it's not there but I still 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.460
 I'm very dark then and I'm going to 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.180
 put a little more white here already 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.239
 I have the mixture that I made 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:18.470
 I did little to experience what I said 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:22.200
 I 'm going to experiment, I 'm going to see how 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.040
 this works this 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.040
 I 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.450
 and since I put the target to him he has already stayed 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:37.070
 well a little more pink a little more 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.830
 clear more or less as I wanted and 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.300
 and nothing at all girls and nothing else is 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.360
 question of you going 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.360
 Trying to go testing is a tips 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.700
 and as you want to see a piece of advice that 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.720
 to people who can not get these 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.880
 make-ups these your make up for nails or 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.220
 to make up the almond and this is a 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.120
 good option truth tell them I wanted 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.200
 experience in myself because to me 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.960
 like a lot 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.940
 experiment and see what can be done 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.190
 then I say there are people who in 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:17.740
 places where they live because no no they do not have 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.890
 so many things to buy and they 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.620
 I say it occurred to me to do it like this for some 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.870
 I saw it on the side but I said well 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.740
 I put the makeup to make it 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.160
 magical for almond then then that 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.310
