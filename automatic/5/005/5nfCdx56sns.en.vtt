00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.000
 for a brand new video in this 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.540
 video I unveiled the ipad 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.289
 r2 so this ipad this material has been loaned 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.640
 so by friends here I am thank you 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.070
 Besides, we will not be able to do this 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.990
 test with you unpacking live this 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.400
 who can make you for example a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.660
 christmas gift idea is going to make a 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.150
 little shot the owner's turn 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.790
 so the box looks like that so 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.550
 ipad r to mark on the side we have 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 we really do not have much in 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.530
 apart from presenting the ipad 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.890
 side view show you a little bit the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.730
 delicacy of the object here are otherwise others 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.590
 side there's nothing the side has no air of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.789
 mark I will name a little bit you 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.239
 see but here it is impeccable and here 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.070
 64 gigabits 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 so that's about the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.449
 presentation of a friend it was at 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.260
 the opening of the box of the good little 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.260
 Swiss army knife that goes well 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:22.619
 only here are live with you your 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:28.800
 eyelashes opening the ipad r 2 so 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:36.210
 normally it's always like that 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:42.330
 we do not know live douvres and that's it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:49.220
 the beast so the little tongue here 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.220
 to open or gently take the ipad 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:02:00.080
 so here is very fine very design 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:11.130
 I sing it foul plastic that's 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:12.329
 because tearing it up anyway 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.920
 it's just like a cover like 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.850
 it's still pretty good that they 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.829
 really think of any call and that's it 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.000
 and frankly it's just 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:28.650
 heavy is really great scientist 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.790
 beautiful is really I can not find 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.269
 not my words so much he is that and 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.380
 bad so we can see here so the key 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.760
 because he hears this is a 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.530
 novelty so 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.709
 it's the fingerprint key 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.640
 for fingerprints 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.860
 we have two speakers 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.239
 I recommend with only one stick to 2 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.200
 so that's well seen we also have the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.200
 alli lightning 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.840
 what did we take jack here so 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.260
 here for it are more - there it is thought 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.150
 that's the little hook here is so 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:19.739
 above so the little button for 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:24.239
 light up and hurt to make illusion of 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:28.260
 the device here and then and then 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.909
 what they fired apparently so the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.319
 small which actually allowed to do 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.599
 of m your silence so apparently that 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.389
 that's it bull me I did not already have a 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.349
 ipad mini and peace min that and we're going 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.349
 set the recipe in motion 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.860
 we really see the activity of 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:59.030
 the device but my first 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.170
 impressions as long as the device is 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.550
 around we'll look at what we have in the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.600
 box 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:08.300
 so we still have this catch so 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.200
 usb game murray the usb is what we 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.840
 would not also have a little notebook 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.850
 so with the guarantees of apple that I 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.959
 I'm not going to open it because before 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.150
 shares to me so we're still going 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.730
 try to wc the happiness of the person 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.990
 who bought it to be able to discover and 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:29.450
 that's the famous so the cable oriented 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.390
 USB and lightning promotions oils 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.140
 of pc so lightning to put it 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.220
 directly on the ipad 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.330
 that's about taking and 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.250
 that's what the presentation is 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.180
 we can not be much of 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.350
 more than other ipods but I think 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.300
 that he's doing both the strength of apple 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.810
 it's still a product 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.580
 she really goes it's apple what 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.360
 it's beefy then it's 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.580
 really quality 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.289
 so that's it so it puts a little bit 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.499
 all the languages 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:05.569
 play the ipad I will choose so 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:12.710
 French for me the change I 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:14.089
 configure the beast and deep time we have 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.439
 all the time you are not pissed off at 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:20.509
 here is to choose a grid a region 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:25.219
 that I'm leaving and I'm counting on France 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:27.729
 also here are France here these nectar loans 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:32.180
 is one thing is sure our network ok 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:35.389
 so we'll put this in between and wifi so 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.629
 after activated mechanization toc like 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.860
 new ipad identifying a minor this 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:45.409
 step because it's just for you 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:49.729
 to show a little said here we accept 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:52.309
 these guarantees accepted so here is so 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.619
 I configure it affected to combine more 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:56.080
 late it's really a presentation 

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:58.039
 overall device 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.779
 I unpacked and made you the 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.120
 presentation I can not go back a little 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:03.469
 more in detail because of 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.800
 unpacking detail of the rails in a 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.809
 a lot 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.300
 the demonstrations of the ipad are there at 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:10.699
 really really on the internet so I 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.659
 will just be content to show you 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:18.289
 not since roughly like a wing in 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:20.620
 my video created one like we do not want 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.419
 that I continue 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.789
 here is what series we do not care 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.309
 do not use series we do not see anything 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:31.309
 because when we send prediagnosis 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:34.430
 it costs batteries so we do not care 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:36.050
 and we have it and here we are 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.169
 that he is really very very responsive 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.019
 that's the great strength of apple is 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.310
 it's really impressive 

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:46.510
 as it goes it's 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.600
 I authorize the year so much of course 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:56.380
 so the hap and we can do everything 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.820
 move and here they are are where this is 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.710
 not bad I think it's pretty good 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.600
 done for me it's very convenient and the 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.880
 frankly the superlatives spent a 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.740
 crazy thing nothing to say 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.440
 so that's what was 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.830
 unpacking the ipad r2 and so so 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.450
 this novelty me for what I have to 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.540
 to say my side I think it's 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.230
 really a very very beautiful device me 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.030
 I am quite a fan 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.710
 so here's a little bonus could not 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.930
 leave tomorrow on without doing you a 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.130
 little demonstration of the photo 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.480
 photo that has passed and now at 8 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.640
 megapixels so and we really do 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.130
 a big effort for ipad because 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.510
 generally it was something like that 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.960
 in 3 or 4 megapixels I do not know 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.870
 exactly 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.730
 Well, it was really bad 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.040
 all so there we really come to a 

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:48.490
 level of photos that was close to 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.960
 the iphone 6 of today what's so it's 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.990
 very good job so I make you a 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.310
 small picture to show you aulas is 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.210
 very very responsive 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.540
 we can take several pictures 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.370
 in a row and to care so here is so 

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.650
 seduces megapixels for photos and 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.770
 then full hd for all that is 

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.330
 video here for the presentation of 

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.040
 the ipad r that shot I really have you 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.240
 let me wish you a good 

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.240
 day and see you soon
