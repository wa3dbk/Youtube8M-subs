00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.089
 Saturday boys are two dresses and today 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.010
 I'm here with a new video a little more 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.559
 fast different than usual 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.650
 we are therefore talking about black ops 3 and in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.830
 particular is the map of the giant la 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.840
 new map precisely remedies of the res that is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.920
 been announced and of which we have 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.410
 shown the trailer 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
 a few days ago I have on my page 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 facebook where invites you to put me 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.560
 like it if you haven't already done it 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.689
 zombie and vesta page I have already published 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 the Italian subtitled version of 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.770
 this trailer and before going precisely 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.770
 to talk to us about monster sailing 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.390
 in conclusion 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.390
 dad plays 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.930
 and 6 free duck are round trulli 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:21.250
 21 or have his freedom 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:33.060
 6 networks 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:33.060
 research in motion and one itself 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:13.260
 hello hello luca lobby che to comment 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.260
 creative not kodaly 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.050
 key that work and tommy we turn e 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.210
 right from 6 Jan. 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:55.840
 wins mine was a third changed my one 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.840
 no it was closed 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.490
 then apart from the icecream expense that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680
 we all have finally reviewed i 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.570
 old characters and knowing that the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.670
 history will somehow reconnect 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.470
 origins and just wanted to go 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.140
 analyze this aspect of history 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.270
 when I published it on facebook and ho 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.370
 asked for some of your opinions 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.570
 I would like to read one in 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.510
 particular 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.790
 written by luigi and spanish luigi 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.260
 indeed argues that as demonstrated by the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.720
 final video of origins if you remember 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.870
 where samantha said tomorrow will be yours 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.880
 round and here he claims that tomorrow 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.570
 that this tomorrow has arrived and that 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.690
 now it's edward's turn to 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.460
 rewrite history then this 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.080
 go back in time as we have 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.430
 seen in the giant's trailer e 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.320
 kill himself 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.690
 ric.tof andy origins that comes from 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.700
 teleportation and the cid and the fendi ritual 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.040
 of the rais would therefore be a way to 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.540
 rewrite history to start over from 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.620
 zero 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.700
 it would even seem that i 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.320
 characters 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.300
 this is another theory advanced by 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.320
 another person does not have the same 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.490
 Nicolai behavior is not for example 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.770
 connected to vodka and things like that 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.810
 may be that the character of the 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.239
 characters also totally change why 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.950
 maybe being a story 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.470
 completely different 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.420
 the course of history will continue 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.310
 in a totally different way and 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.960
 characters could therefore also have 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.660
 these different behaviors 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.970
 what is it that we must therefore expect 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.190
 maybe another story that runs 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.910
 parallel story we have already seen 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.090
 but designed by the right film instead of by 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.970
 we still do n't know samantha too 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.610
 because the trailer begins to sit right there 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.140
 radio as you will have understood of the rais 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.000
 so there is this this memory of 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.700
 samantha maxis that are locked up in the 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.820
 teleporting fans right into the action 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.400
 which greets maxis and then alri 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.230
 sport roof drive appears however 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.260
 the turn was then advanced as well 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.760
 a theory that actually opens up that 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.729
 the transporter appeared from the transporter 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.059
 origins 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.279
 both the rite Ven but the maxis incarnato 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.650
 in quotation marks in the body of ric.tof 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:22.719
 this advanced theory is a little less 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.370
 credible compared to the previous one 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.259
 precisely of going back in time 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.330
 to rewrite history or at least one 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.309
 theory that I absolutely wanted to 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.169
 mention one last thing I noticed in the 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:34.419
 trailer is that irritated that after having 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.219
 killed himself up to a moment on 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.740
 his body as if he had to recover 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:41.289
 something something will be 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.150
 I think it will be something attributable to 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.189
 some easter eggs but unfortunately not 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.439
 I can advance theory of any kind 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:49.949
 and this was a little what I wanted 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:53.020
 tell you my general ideas guys me 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.969
 I think this black ops 3 will come the 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.669
 at least I really am zombie mode 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.669
 very confident 90 zombies I'm sure 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.680
 that will satisfy all of us and the trans 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.509
 however he always did a good job and 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.360
 is continuing from what we are seeing 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.009
 to do a job in my opinion exceptional 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.870
 I hope you are also convinced how 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.120
 I'm down here in the comments you can 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.370
 tell me your opinions to advance 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.990
 hypothesis tell me what you think in 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.080
 generals this black ops 3 zombies 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.629
 you guys are all quiet because 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.729
 you will see that we will have a great time there 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:27.279
 treyarch really has many servants 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.080
 many surprises for us is different for 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:32.339
 Today I thank you and we are all there 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.339
 hear you at the next video 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.910
