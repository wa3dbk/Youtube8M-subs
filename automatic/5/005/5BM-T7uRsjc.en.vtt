00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 I was crazy at the bomb after Santana 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.080
 crazy welcome to the public the pocket that 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.170
 explains the pocket will be focused on 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.120
 superman and the dc universe at the cinema 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.299
 everyone already knows this year will have as 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.609
 superman man of steel and he is already 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.560
 almost ready and only missing now 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.779
 some finalizations is one thing 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.939
 specials and when film arrives in this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 stage they have the custom out there 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 do movie test views for 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 to know what people are finding is 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.960
 type a colossal thermometer display 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.149
 views tests and latino review it is 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 He jumped a little people's opinions 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.800
 who attended the exhibitions and public 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.320
 website there what people found them 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 They said the movie is a nolan movie. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.579
 but as the sun and good naide we can 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.809
 come to the conclusion that we have a road map 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.879
 more elaborate than the name that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.420
 worries about this part of his movies 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.360
 huh 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.430
 the script and we will have the look of the sniper 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.199
 that he aesthetic nightmare puts a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.660
 time thing that has a half music video thing 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.609
 those slow cameras that whole thing 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.899
 dirty everything you already know the world already has three 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.700
 months, a great 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.110
 Another thing they were talking about is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.590
 that the movie filled with action scenes 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.330
 forget I promise 11 movies to 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.920
 attention from start to finish and superman 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.009
 breaks in all of them 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.470
 and you wonder - 3 show my god 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.210
 so it was an hour tactic did not show 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.549
 no fantastic action scene in the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.100
 workout because because she wants you to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.640
 Arrive always be surprised or order up 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.320
 which at last because I hate everything is kind 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 watch a movie and all the best and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.259
 he is in the guild so it seems like 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.229
 now we have a priori are something else that 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.150
 I'm not a little worried, is that 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.829
 Superman cover will be made in 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.829
 computer graphics and this already 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.320
 Remember Paul who did not see is a movie. 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.170
 based on the character all over and beyond 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.970
 in the movie the cover of the spawn was all in 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.220
 and this initial and if 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.260
 it annoyed me to bother 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.330
 the trailer causes an impression that the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.330
 film is very vain and intimate 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.400
 many people compared the superman yesterday 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.980
 The first Batman Begins training that is 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.240
 very similar indeed and this is the climate is 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.190
 totally different has nothing to do 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.380
 with Batman Begins is a Movie and Respect 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.090
 super mexico does not need to realize 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.310
 that does not beat the character I do not know there anymore 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.470
 So let's say, then, exile. 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.780
 the movie does not have this is worth more 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.610
 heavy that has the Batman movies by 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.800
 For example, this news makes me very 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.570
 excited to see the movie and other news 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.420
 that bombed week that the phenomenon would be 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.270
 responsible for dc universe in film and 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.600
 that he is he is bringing a chambel 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.360
 to live the new batman in the friend and I 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.980
 I think it's very good because you're not strange. 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.080
 imagine they will make an end of the league 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.630
 with another doing batman 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.660
 I do not know, this debate did not work. 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.760
 very successful people so what? 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.980
 calls in the middle with a process in 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.990
 to make a movie of the league bacon mattress 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.730
 batman and continue because the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.320
 universe that already makes success so I think 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.970
 which was a hit on behalf of warner if 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.019
 this is really true what for 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.489
 while the tumor 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.890
 Good folks if the bope is already getting 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.200
 This way, I asked you for a drink. 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.750
 feel that nerd friend that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.310
 comics that cinema recommends 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.930
 climbed to it and I'm sure he 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.280
 You'll like it because you already know if 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.000
 Do you want to have more news like 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.280
 these 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.620
 I discovered games and technology culture 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.420
