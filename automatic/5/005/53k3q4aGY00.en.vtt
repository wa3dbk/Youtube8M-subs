00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.039
 hello my students of the salle 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.380
 3 the entities cristian arias 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680
 graphic designer by profession 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.680
 with specialty in 3d 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.290
 let's start 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.440
 with the fabulous world of maya and in 3d 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 as benny wallpaper is from a video game has been massacred 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.880
 and that we can also use maya when doing it 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.840
 we see that they have lights and many other textures issues whatever 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
 if we want to create things of this kind 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.130
 we are not using maya 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.650
 in this case the company authors 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190
 fainting 2009 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.220
 so I ask you please that there will be vallés assured of properties 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.990
 and then to the menu 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.170
 and please, let's talk 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.130
 in this case I can not open omar pointed I have open because 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.430
 the program does not allow me 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.390
 Record 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.640
 and do both things not times and maya was not open 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.240
 previously 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.270
 then little I will do is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.740
 have open maya 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 The first thing that appears is a window that says a lemom 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.830
 to this window please 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 only from the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.000
 and there is also another window that is vitiated by windows 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.440
 this window is important because here it is going to be here everything is coming out 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.700
 what are we doing rendering 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 but please with culture 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.220
 continued 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.520
 here I have an interface of maya 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 if we go in the east and hold a gray 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:10.340
 is where are we going to 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.549
 to be able to model everything we believe 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.519
 or we create 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.139
 the following 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.869
 that in order to move well what we are going to use that end 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.539
 the left button of the magicians 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.309
 and the key before 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:25.380
 and they will see how their 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.380
 as it rotates and moves in all directions 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:30.680
 remember 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.429
 left button 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:33.689
 of the magicians 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.959
 the key to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.439
 the next 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.449
 is that we see and intuit 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.819
 burning already has different 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.259
 if we go to the top left we will notice that we have animation 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.999
 polygons 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:54.979
 if the countries 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.489
 dynamic 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.529
 in verín 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.059
 in and dynamic 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.469
 and with its roots 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.609
 that we will not use it right now 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.049
 so 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.359
 what we are going to see we are polygons 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.730
 while we are changing the controls they are also changing the same 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:13.969
 above 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.599
 let's not lose sight of how they are changing 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.390
 now as in this semester 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.549
 the first thing we're going to see is modeled then we're going to leave the 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.849
 polygons 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.259
 you take they will have to do the same 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.449
 now if we leave the left wing 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.269
 we will see let's see the Turkish octopus 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.690
 in this box we will have this object 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.809
 it's to touch 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.559
 Any object that we have created 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:40.329
 and they can not be the basic tools 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.169
 will be mind and showed 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.549
 that allows us to move the objects 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.409
 whether they are in x 17 a 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.909
 we also have 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.699
 broken and everything that allows us to rotate them too 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.249
 in them 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.699
 x I arrived iceta 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.630
 I also want is that the tour 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.359
 allows us 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.790
 make bigger or smaller objects also the dn the directions 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.279
 xd iceta 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.300
 is these elements are very important I will never forget them 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.329
 and we always have open awnings 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.929
 if we go below 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:16.209
 and if it's intel 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.319
 that means that here you have only one perspective that we're going 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.419
 losing in this case is 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.529
 perspective 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.790
 and even further down 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.699
 let's notice 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.789
 we have four views 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:28.789
 means 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:29.750
 that we are going to be able to 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.659
 to novelize it 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.180
 and see us two objects 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.150
 from any of these views from the whole view 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.620
 from the front view 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.620
 comes from the side view 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.889
 if we want 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.110
 go to a view in this case let's continue we have a southern box 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.129
 that means we're 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.129
 in the top list 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:53.110
 if we want the top list to occupy all 6 simply we do what 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.009
 we select the one we touch 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.669
 we threw space bar 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:58.990
 and here we will be 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.620
 now if we want to go to another view 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.259
 now we can go our from xaki alto albox 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.139
 down 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.639
 select the four views 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.639
 touch the view and again 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.659
 and so on with all the views 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.729
 it's in the first part 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.539
 now too 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.710
 below we have 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.710
 another option that separates the Indian spot 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.479
 if we touch it 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.930
 we will see that opens another window here 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.870
 that tells us that we have a kaman perspective a camera in all 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.360
 a camping in the sun 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.059
 a call to hope 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:41.610
 and we also have default 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.839
 a dream that everyone 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.650
 and anti for which in seat lights 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.650
 what afternoon we are going to use later 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.150
 now any object that we believe 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.259
 we will not have here also in the nou pla years with oscar bouquets delete it 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.529
 here what we do is erase it with the ips key 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.529
 now let's go back to the perspective 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.300
 we have down 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.879
 a timeline 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.580
 if we move it 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.580
 about dreams 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.029
 now this can get bigger 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:21.319
 or smaller 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.249
 depending on the use that is given 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.450
 here we have marked up to 48 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.979
 but we can increase it 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.909
 if we put a zero more 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.300
 and also more leisure in the other 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.569
 they will see how they grow 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.349
 now we have 480 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:37.530
 more options 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.520
 for nilmar 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.369
 now another of the important reasons to see 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:45.550
 know the tea party closes 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.529
 of stress 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:52.249
 we have the chanel vox merchán the box we can see several things we chose this 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:53.349
 1st 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:55.789
 We see that the screen 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.749
 crescenti the option disappears 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:59.110
 if we want to see her again 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.509
 we click on another neighbor and here it appears 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.550
 and here it is very important because 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.919
 in the bottom 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.099
 we have 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:09.180
 The laws 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.759
 here the voters laws 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.139
 if we give 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.089
 we press like tony deer 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:15.759
 for the option 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.369
 in chile arrives 

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:21.189
 and it does not look like a heller 

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:23.589
 if I who see him double click 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:26.059
 and a window appears, the option of carl eller 

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:28.649
 here I'm going to put names 

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.479
 in this case 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:32.069
 modeling 

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:34.110
 and I can also give it a color 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.909
 to differentiate it from the others 

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:40.080
 and here what we have created also I have the option 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.719
 if at any time I want to remove the den 

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:43.819
 bilic laws 

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:45.219
 and disappear it 

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.290
 this time the kings got in stop 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.080
 separate objects that sometimes hinder us to 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.210
 modeling created a good otan object to be a render 

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:58.029
 so 

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:00.909
 This is the first part 

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:02.330
 i hope to see 

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.000
 second video
