00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
powered rail road tracks i figured how

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
powered rail road tracks i figured how
to<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.910> three<00:02:09.239> goals<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.810> little

to do it you do three goals on a little

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.440 
to do it you do three goals on a little
at<00:02:10.200> left<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.709> go<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> right<00:02:11.239> stick<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
at left you go to the right stick in the
