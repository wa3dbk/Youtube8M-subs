00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 increase 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.170
 and who is where you want to go is today the day 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.300
 I bring my clothes from the book 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.910
 although it was the week that just happened 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.920
 and like I 'm not very satisfied with 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.349
 how to conclude button muscle but 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.050
 I do not feel bad either because I really 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.990
 it complicated me a lot week 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 I wanted to read five books and I finished 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.359
 reading three books and half almost the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.629
 truth is not so much and a half because they were 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.460
 like two chapters of my fourth book 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.049
 but it really complicated me 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.239
 very much that is working a course 

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:41.250
 of summer taking care of children and the first 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 weeks I only had eight children to my 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.870
 charge but already this week the bust more 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.940
 with I had like 30 children and positively 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.850
 in the moments that I could read to very 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.100
 little ones and when I got to my house 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.320
 I arrived very tired, I did not feel like it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.159
 to read I just went to bed and we 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.820
 I was going to see 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.110
 how you know that I am one 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.060
 then I had a good time 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.630
 wet 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.790
 and I did not read anything I say 30 million to me 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.490
 I do not have two people who are 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.040
 supporting them that are also there 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.470
 working but anyway from 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.390
 that take them to eat take them to the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.000
 alberca takes the next activity and 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.490
 all of us tell you finished very 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.310
 very tired and did not give me want to read 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.440
 more than anything I like to get to bed 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.510
 see forged and from there also receive 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.180
 her newest boyfriends from the collection of 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.690
 ten that I did manage to do because I've 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.390
 achieved 10 so yes and well I started 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.080
 much more are reading without end for now 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.910
 give you 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.820
 and I really liked the book 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.590
 it was very tender to me very 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.400
 realistic by the fact that the now I 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.140
 I do if he talks about the sexual topic that 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.570
 really tell us about your things 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.460
 in love things that teeth well 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.470
 then make the decisions to do or not 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.720
 do these sexual acts 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.060
 then the truth still with much that 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.400
 she another one raises that obviously if 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.490
 It happens like other books that bears 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.770
 they say it's going to happen or they give it to you 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.330
 understand here if we talk a lot about 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.800
 that is what is happening at the moment 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.770
 what is our feeling 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.780
 protagonist that is network and our 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.570
 protagonist gray and let's talk 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.280
 about they see that it's a china that all the 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.860
 life has been like that the daughter 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.650
 perfect she is only daughter so 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.390
 more pressure is put on her by 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.730
 their parents because those parents have 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.680
 as many expectations of them 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.380
 she is right now from the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.170
 university has a scholarship of the diverse 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.090
 that her mom works and how she does not 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.950
 is comfortable with that decision to go to 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.470
 sleep 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.849
 and she wants to do other things that are not 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.680
 I want to say good because I feel that 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.810
 it would be spurred on you to tell it like 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.790
 that in the programs chapters but of 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.489
 every way I think it's better than one 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.800
 find out by itself and not other things 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.840
 process time is afraid to disappoint 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.390
 santella tooth the pressure of them 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 they expect a lot from her and she never 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.260
 has had no boyfriend has ever come out 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.060
 with nobody I tell them he devoted himself a lot to 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.860
 the studios been a best friend yes 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.110
 Well, I'm telling you how you're going to get to 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.209
 end of school and she is not 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.340
 sure of what he's going to do but if he knows 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.830
 who wants to do something different than what 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.349
 they have planned for her and for another 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.450
 side we have the crisis is a guy who 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.510
 all life has been in love with 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.849
 hermine but he has a past me which 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.970
 he does not feel very comfortable and feels that he 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.280
 It is not the person who deserves and not 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.620
 have any chance with a girl 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.110
 like you this last summer in which 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.150
 they finished school they 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.700
 they know and they start to have a story 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.040
 very very loving father to me the truth I 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.020
 really liked the love story how 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.170
 he is facing 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.000
 and like chris learn to love each other 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.520
 same because I had many problems 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.190
 because of his past where he came from 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.810
 all those accomplishments very father and told him 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.690
 that 455 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.580
 I loved it and if this book complies with the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.020
 chance to read a genre that you have not 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.090
 read a lot of me in this case and in 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.450
 almost contemporary reality if read 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.790
 but it is what he least heard him generally 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.860
 is the book of a sangoy de jordi menus 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.960
 this is the second book the theory 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.350
 impele and because already law that we had in 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.650
 the internet trilogy and the truth I gave 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.630
 four of five because he did not fascinate me and 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.120
 if I tell them what it is about, I could enter 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.760
 in spoilers why I do not want to say 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.690
 very sensitive of double 45 and this 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.550
 book fulfilled more than half of Chavez 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.100
 determine a trilogy 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.500
 I read how to train your dragon ' 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.730
 greece ko is the first book of the saga of 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.710
 how to enter your golden 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.009
 This book meets the challenge of having a 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.949
 book with my picture is x 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:59.430
 and the truth I liked a lot was dedicated to 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.080
 4 sordid ended very tender me very much 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.849
 the movie but there's nothing wrong with it 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.149
 I really liked the truth see that 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.159
 example here guy has a friend and that 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.990
 the dragons here we talk about team 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.059
 they have the ability to talk to the 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.270
 dragons and to understand them then that 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:17.939
 I liked it a lot but then the movie 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.339
 it does not look almost like a book but 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:22.889
 so I really like the book and I gave it 52 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:25.199
 fixed mutis good supposed that he was going to 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.270
 read the hundred is going to be the challenge of the 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.159
 adaptation of the movie book or this 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.379
 case of serial book but as they can not 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.960
 read it I realized that alessio this 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.699
 book was being the book's challenges 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.370
 'the movie because its his book 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.069
 has a movie then I can do 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.740
 the charly if I wanted to but finally 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.289
 I read the three or more chapters of infinite 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.020
 de jodi - and third book and last in the 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.479
 trilogy in flesh and it is this as a 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.520
 little bit faster really and then what 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.379
 we did not do more because this joy 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.260
 I started it on Saturday in the backpack on 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:01.560
 Sunday I did not read anything because if you guys 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.730
 and now you know that on Sunday I had 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.730
 an event in which 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:12.030
 if my girlfriend knows my dad and he showed 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.030
 already the official act that we're going to 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.860
 get married and if that's where I normally did not have 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.220
 I want to read nothing more than anyone was 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.900
 very nervous about this event of 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.360
 that they were going to know more than anything 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.580
 our families and that's why there's nothing 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.720
 and in the night I really arrived very late 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:35.060
 because I went for a walk and if we did not have 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:39.150
 really after I could not anymore 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:43.050
 are all those who read are taking a 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.120
 total of 969 pages is no longer the great 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.630
 thing comparing that many people coming out 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:53.970
 like a thousand pages a day but then they 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:56.220
 I say really can not because it 's 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.830
 working but I'm still pretty forward 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.120
 and I think I'm going to continue now with 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.560
 this book that I stayed in the 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.919
 infinity move forward with it and already 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.380
 finish my July idea will end with 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:09.970
 its from where I'm going to use it to people and jane 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.440
 hung and then and that 's all 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.360
 comments giving to god and you 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.230
 participated in the book thomas mann and 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.150
 how did it go 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:20.430
 and everything that they want to say to me here 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.430
 down the first loyal comments 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:28.050
 in the future here below you are imagining 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.050
 with shootings or and Adriano
