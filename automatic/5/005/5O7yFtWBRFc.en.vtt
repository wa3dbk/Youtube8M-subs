00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.760
 servants say anything that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.829
 There were six jars of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.129
 stone for the purifications of 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.910
 Jews that each contained two or three 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.160
 goals jesus told them to fill the jars 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.730
 of water and filled them up 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.120
 then he told them now take out and take 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.730
 to the master maestresala and they took him 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.560
 when the room master tested the water 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.840
 converted into wine whose provenance 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.320
 I was ignorant even though they knew her 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 servant 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.690
 who had drawn the water called the groom 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.120
 and told him everyone serves first the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.150
 good wine and then when they have drunk 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.220
 well at least the least good but you have 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 preserved the good wine until this 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.369
 such moment was the beginning that gave 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.800
 jesus those miracles in canÃ¡ de galilea and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.850
 he manifested his glory and his disciples 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.549
 they believed in him 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.340
 after this he descended to capernaum 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.979
 with his mother his brothers and his 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.799
 disciples and they stayed there not many 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.670
 days the Passover of the Jews was 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.770
 next and jesus went up to jerusalem in the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.590
 temple found the merchants of 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.530
 oxen of sheep and pigeons and 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.110
 money changers sitting at their tables and 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.270
 making a string whip threw the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.909
 temple to all with the sheep and the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.759
 oxen scattered the coins of the 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.210
 changers and overturned their tables and 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.429
 pigeon sellers told them removes from 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.550
 this here do not make of my house 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.980
 father a market and his disciples were 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.100
 they agreed that the zeal of 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.950
 your house devours me then the Jews will 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.330
 said signal samples since we 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.310
 you do these things Jesus answered them 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.370
 destroy this temple and in three days I 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.519
 I will raise it again and the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.430
 Jews have been employed for 46 years in 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.940
 build this temple and you in three days 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.510
 you will raise it again 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.130
 but he talked about the temple of his body 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.070
 and when he was resurrected from among 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.260
 dead his disciples remembered 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.600
 who had said this and believed the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.050
 writing and to the word that jesus had 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.630
 saying 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.420
 while he was in Jerusalem during 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.080
 Easter party many believed in 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.510
 his name seeing the miracles they did 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.240
 But Jesus did not trust them because 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.030
 everyone knew them and did not need to 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.980
 reports about the man knowing 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.980
 by itself what is in man
