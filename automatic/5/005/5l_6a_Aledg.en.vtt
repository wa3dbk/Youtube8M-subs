 wants to learn how to install and tune 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 tv channels 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.300
 I'll show you, look at the first thing. 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.290
 to do is to place the antenna cable in the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.509
 input channel for the hf vhf or 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 Good thing in case you have tv by 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.830
 signature now that the cable is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.830
 connected, just start searching 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.439
 of channels let's go there until the menu button 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.240
 the on-screen channel option will appear 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.269
 then just choose the programming 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.910
 and select to start 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 done this the TV will show a bar of 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 status or percentage indicating that the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 process started after scanning 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.800
 all channels will appear 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.930
 found 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 there it is only to see if the stations that you 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.690
 like were found and start to enjoy 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.789
 now if your tv goes without signal 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.129
 check some aspects gives a 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 if the coaxial cable that is 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.140
 between the antenna and the tv is broken 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.480
 if you are replacing it with another cable or 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.409
 it is loose or loose 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.470
 put it on again and tighten well saw but have 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.820
 a detail and its antenna is internal and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.369
 It does not work 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.100
 in this case try to change the antenna of place 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.400
 and if they do not resolve, they seek 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.930
 antenista is now very good watch 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.570
 a movie on dvd, right? 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.570
 it looks like it's very easy to install if the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.850
 rsa connection device is only to place 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.909
 the pins in the same color inputs 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
 both dvd and tv after that already 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.350
 is ready to use 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.810
 curiosity and yellow color is for 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.570
 the images appear and the white and red 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.119
 are for audio now if the two 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.220
 hdmi input is 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.380
 better yet because in addition to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.700
 digital audio quality for the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.890
