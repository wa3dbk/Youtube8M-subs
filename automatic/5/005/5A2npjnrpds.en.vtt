Netflix exclusive stand-up special it's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.300 
Netflix exclusive stand-up special it's
called<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.630> greats<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.680> I'm<00:00:29.130> not

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
called one of the greats and I'm not

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.400 
called one of the greats and I'm not
sure<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.789> exactly<00:00:30.269> lives<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.140> that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
sure that it exactly lives up to that

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.030 
sure that it exactly lives up to that
title<00:00:31.740> nor<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.180> even<00:00:33.600> supposed<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.440> maybe<00:00:34.710> I

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
title nor is it even supposed to maybe I

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
title nor is it even supposed to maybe I
think<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.760> title<00:00:35.969> itself<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> pun

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
think the title itself is kind of a pun

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.229 
think the title itself is kind of a pun
and<00:00:37.590> that's<00:00:37.739> kind<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:37.980> explained<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.910> upon

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and that's kind of explained not upon

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.639 
and that's kind of explained not upon
necessarily<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.140> supposed<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.500> kind

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
necessarily but it's supposed to be kind

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.520 
necessarily but it's supposed to be kind
of<00:00:40.770> ironic<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.879> sense<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.270> she<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> kind

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.100 
brutally honest I mean she's not really
afraid<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:50.040> speak<00:01:50.310> her<00:01:50.490> mind<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.390> she's<00:01:51.930> not

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
afraid to speak her mind and she's not

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.080 
afraid to speak her mind and she's not
afraid<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:52.770> push<00:01:53.130> borders<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.909> feel

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
afraid to really push borders I feel

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
afraid to really push borders I feel
like<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> lot<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.509> people<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.130> sensitive

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
like a lot of people are so sensitive

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
like a lot of people are so sensitive
and<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.579> hurt<00:01:57.180> these<00:01:57.450> days<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.170> think

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and so hurt these days and I think

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.649 
and so hurt these days and I think
stand-up<00:01:58.770> comedy<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.369> somewhere<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.329> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
stand-up comedy is somewhere that you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.969 
stand-up comedy is somewhere that you
should<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:01.020> able<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.409> kind<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.680> put<00:02:01.890> it

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
should be able to just kind of put it

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.440 
should be able to just kind of put it
out<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> no<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:03.420> not

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.260 
out there and know that no I'm not
necessarily<00:02:03.750> being<00:02:04.469> 100%<00:02:05.130> serious<00:02:05.729> this

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
necessarily being 100% serious this

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.419 
necessarily being 100% serious this
isn't<00:02:06.659> exactly<00:02:06.719> how<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.290> necessarily<00:02:07.710> feel

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.669 
isn't exactly how I necessarily feel
about<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> situation<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.899> when<00:02:10.080> she<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.440> say

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
about a situation but when she can say

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.160 
about a situation but when she can say

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
but no one will say it because everyone

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.280

is<00:02:19.920> afraid<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.460> say<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.450> work<00:02:21.630> day<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.200> a

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
but I thought the funniest part of that

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.460 
but I thought the funniest part of that
was<00:03:23.820> whenever<00:03:24.060> she<00:03:24.360> said<00:03:24.720> she<00:03:25.080> was<00:03:25.230> speaking

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
was whenever she said she was speaking

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.500 
was whenever she said she was speaking
with<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.890> French<00:03:26.280> accent<00:03:26.820> whenever<00:03:27.209> she<00:03:27.390> was

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
with a French accent whenever she was

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.720 
with a French accent whenever she was
