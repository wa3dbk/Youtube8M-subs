00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 what black wave in my previous top them 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.879
 I asked if they wanted me to do the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.589
 counterpart of the worst films of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.139
 superheroes and thanks to his great 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.910
 answer here I am with a top 11 the one that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.580
 I will show you what I believe are the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.470
 best superhero movies but 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.539
 eye remember that this is my mere 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.140
 opinion are what I think are the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.050
 top 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.090
 My opinion admits I hope you have 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 that data was clear, so for 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 avoid conflicts leave comments 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.279
 what you think are the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.649
 top 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.530
 well now without more let's start with the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.329
 count good first I want to start the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.399
 video with a small honorable mention 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.489
 where I recommend this great 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.070
 documentary called superheroes deals 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.410
 about an initiative in the us of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.120
 people who dress like superhero to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.949
 impart the good in the streets of your 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.899
 city helping people in their 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.750
 needs or if the occasion arises 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.030
 to fight crime the truth of me 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.949
 this documentary and I just stayed 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.690
 surprised by the actions of these 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.880
 people that despite not having 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 superpowers like the heroes of the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.640
 comic books 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 these people do their best for 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.530
 make this world a better place is a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.690
 documentary that to finish seeing it you 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.180
 stop thinking and maybe it prompts you to 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.670
 make a better person if they want to see it 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.750
 look it up on youtube there it is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.750
 totally in Spanish 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.789
 Now, let's go with the 11th place 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.520
 that you earn nothing less than the 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.649
 hancock movie first of all I know 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.689
 that this movie is not the big deal and 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.060
 it's far from being the best movies 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.369
 that has starred will smith but I 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.920
 He entertained this filming quite a bit though 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.259
 however , it is acceptable, since 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.850
 there are several problems one of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.459
 they are having a story nothing 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.770
 novelty very simple to say true but what 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.659
 compensate with some comedy but it's not 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.179
 so frequent and the action scenes 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.890
 they are very few besides that they are not so 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.110
 good as for a movie of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.689
 superheroes the secondary characters 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.729
 They are totally marked by our 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.610
 hero hancock since they have almost nothing 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.200
 of importance certainly not here 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.720
 find a villain for sure 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.819
 they only solve hancock problems 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.459
 with society and they explain the origin 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.709
 of our hero despite all of these 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.319
 bad points mentioned above 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.239
 it's a movie like I said at the beginning 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.599
 dry acceptable but has the potential 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.549
 to entertain you already finally I want 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.600
 mention that a sequel is approaching 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.390
 of this film 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.880
 2016 I hope that for that second part 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.300
 improve all the characteristics in which 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.300
 failed 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.780
 the number 10 place earns it nothing 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.700
 less than the trilogy of the x-men one 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.490
 of so many superhero groups that are 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 of my favorites I have to admit that 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.870
 from start to finish this saga pleased me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.790
 quite as well as they hear it the so 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.100
 hated exm in the final battle I 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.290
 loved a first part that we 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.600
 they showed a nice start with good 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.480
 audience response where actors like 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.130
 hugh jackman won recognition 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.630
 good effects special effects 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.180
 that despite having passed the time 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.100
 they are still good but action maybe 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.260
 not so well made but the errors of the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.510
 first or aspects that could be still 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.610
 more good several things were improved in 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.920
 his second part but what do you think if 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.920
 better we focus on the hated film 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.810
 by many exm in the final battle this 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.060
 third and last part suffered several 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.310
 radical radical changes by the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.110
 absence of Bryan Singer but equal 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.150
 Brett Gardner's changes were not 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.480
 all bad since it also brought us 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.550
 good things like your story script 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.430
 with sub-frames that were exploited well 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.560
 some 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.659
 the main ones end up being the plot 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.549
 of the cure for the mutants and the plot 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.739
 of the phoenix but in itself the story is 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.500
 deep giving us to play more emotion 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.510
 feeling and action giving us that touch 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.329
 of epic because everything will end in 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.829
 this last part here fits to stand out of 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.139
 that each character is given to his 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.150
 prominence although a very serious factor 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.280
 in this saga was to have a large amount 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.709
 of mutants and several were 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.450
 unnecessary being super flat and 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.879
 very secondary to be pure filler 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.489
 happening the same in this third part 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.200
 let's now touch the subject that many hate 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.660
 which is the death of some 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.430
 characters such as the cyclops I know 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.859
 that maybe for many this is their 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.139
 favorite mutant but let's go on these 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.389
 movies turned out very secondary I think 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.520
 that the best thing was that they will kill him and 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.229
 death of Professor Charles Xavier that 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.449
 the truth was I made a very scene 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.979
 emotional and the most important since 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.830
 contributed a lot to the story 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.990
 it just became effective but good 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.759
 I already talked a lot about the x-men 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.759
 so let's move on to the next post 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.469
 position number 9 takes it 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.349
 surprisingly the movie of the 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:52.060
 incredible a simple but effective film 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.340
 which I find to be the best that has 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.319
 produced pixar and we have to admit 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.599
 that lacks originality in terms of 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.849
 your characters since they contain powers 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.159
 typical but that does not mean that 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.229
 are well prepared to the contrary every 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.479
 one has his personality and they are not for 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.550
 nothing flat this lack of originality 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.039
 they compensate with a great animation 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.990
 thrilling soundtrack and action 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.360
 incredible all this makes a movie 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.520
 super entertaining for the whole family 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.500
 a pity that so far 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.569
 pixar is not encouraged to make a sequel to 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.669
 the incredible ones that have great potential 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.949
 and prefer to make way for sequels 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.129
 mediocre such as lava sofÃ­a de cars 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.129
 two 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.339
 position number 8 is taken by 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.129
 first part of the trilogy of man 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.989
 iron I have to be honest that 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.449
 the sequels that this movie had 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:42.849
 they were at least convincing so 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.189
 that I decided to place ironman 1 in this top 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.319
 giving them to notice that for me this is the 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:49.809
 best of the trilogy I know that in my 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.969
 analysis ironman three I said that for me 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:54.550
 that was the best but analyzing the 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.379
 points I decided to change my mind but 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.199
 well let's talk about the movie 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:01.209
 who won to be in this top story 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.429
 very well elaborated I loved it as 

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:05.800
 they handled the kidnapping of Tony on the 

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:07.869
 of terrorists give us pure action 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.149
 besides that they give us a good comedy 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:12.189
 contributed I know that maybe this comedy does not 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:14.860
 be as good as those of his successors 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:17.019
 but eye friends comedy is not everything 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.759
 in a movie I certainly do not know 

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:21.039
 they were wrong in choosing Robert Downey 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.989
 junior to represent our hero 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.089
 since the character fits like a ring 

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:27.489
 to the finger reincarnating the slob and 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:29.589
 Billionaire of Tony Stark besides 

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:31.599
 that together with the director jon favreau we 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:33.999
 they narrate very well the origin of the man of 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:36.190
 iron of the few bad points that 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:38.620
 I felt it was the absence of charisma in him 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.930
 or main but from there on out the 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.360
 movie is certainly very good yes 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.430
 Ironman 3 turned out to be a box office 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.380
 it matters a shit to have many 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.050
 sales does not mean it's a big 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.940
 movie up here the video in the 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.070
 Second part, I will talk about the positions 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.500
 are missing remember to follow me in my networks 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.290
 social all the links will be in the 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.280
 description with nothing more to say to me 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.280
 goodbye goodbye
