00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.509
 in both times I think that in 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:15.480
 the current conditions the cut because 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:17.520
 that it's going to be very special 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.660
 who what the players at home looks like 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.110
 not good because the last 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.130
 years 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.140
 I think they want to say 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.890
 heat the key anyway we 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.290
 know now that it is in match 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.420
 or hard and they tried to play us 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.600
 have loaded by ten days stresses 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.190
 always 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 a lot of question marks 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.089
 in the end it's a match that in 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.769
 practically a year the championship lineup 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.000
 since the players should 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.440
 logically get free take a lot 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.659
 initiatives and especially to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.239
 public right now I'm thinking of winning 1 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.350
 like the whole team and I hope that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 will come true 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.899
 it makes us scared I 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.699
 you are writing soon there is of course a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.409
 European team all teams way 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.739
 you see moment there are two teams on the 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.930
 ground 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.570
 she is one who must win one is 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.420
 not sure this is another tactic 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.610
 particular to the tactical series 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.009
 special 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.929
 practice it's a big problem when 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.460
 I think that we must above all avoid 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:16.740
 what theologians are saying in 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.759
 the spaces and especially with us from 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.950
 the moment we have an opportunity 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.750
 favored benefited mostly boys 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.500
 such as dominguez and larsson that are 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.000
 relatively quickly 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.850
 we'll see this on the ground because a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.630
 match and can not judge himself had his 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.830
 little bit that it does not scare you no 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.080
 you have what we thought years 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.360
 we are a little feverish at the moment when 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.310
 contacts and yes oddly 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.259
 casual men in black if they do not 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.350
 not hide their game of course a trio of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.570
 Southerners physically prepare 19:55 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.119
 the boccassian cauldron ignites 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.369
 the atmosphere was created since 18h 30 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.369
 upper decibels on the Var side 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.040
 heifers in red and black who 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.110
 reverse the trend to kick off

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.500
 of tit for tat love 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.930
 ricort delio onnis and his series of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.150
 dribbling tanoh stays true to his legend 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.129
 amitrano the guardian begins his 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.530
 brilliant number 5 minutes françoise

 as they say for what he cashes the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.060
 stimulating for the authors so it's 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.819
 seriously engaged the defensive curse 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.500
 alfano boissier was not exempt from 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.500
 blame idle accuse him 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.300
 10th minute the eagles dominate 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.370
 seriously but amitrano remarkable 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.900
 prevents ricort from marking the fever and 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.900
 kerberos being let go 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.860
 14th minute dominguez that will not be 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.630
 spared from the assaults during this 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.239
 match is the best of the lot 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.500
 Lefebvre launches brutality and paperboard 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.360
 courbis 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.069
 the Argentinian has made dizzy to 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.840
 Var defenders 20th minute the 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.790
 the Riviera continue their pressure but 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.209
 in mitrano contracts stands out 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.050
 always here in front of this 42nd minute 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.970
 always 1-0 the unexpected this product 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.230
 curiously it's calm 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.230
 it was nearing it 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.940
 20 minutes to see the projectors 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.760
 warm up the question arises 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.470
 the actors stay on the spot the game 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.840
 resumes without notable facts as in 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.020
 any recovery resting on this 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.090
 advantage largely justified in favor 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.710
 of the gym chart change after the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.690
 pause the sporting takes the match to his 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.090
 account is the guardian Nice who is 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.750
 the first to work on center of 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.220
 hate everything because in front of the inevitable aunis 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.440
 60th minute it still heats up in the 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.120
 Nice camp action confused driving 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.920
 a corner of albert émon several 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.190
 tests returned by a consolidated defense 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.970
 but amitrano bay the lobed alpha shot 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.010
 we do not find the skylight 65th minute 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.200
 paganelli decent and airtight 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.730
 Amitrano still ruins the hopes 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.730
 Toulon with about 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.189
 in turn in May comes in front of 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:43.139
 snow alerted by dominguez to ten minutes 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:46.229
 from the end it seems finished yet 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.680
 should he bow to the 90th minute on 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:52.949
 this attack very clear snow lefebvre 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.990
 on the right snow an anthology goal 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.240
 as you will see an action has 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.520
 shown in training centers 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.919
 it's delirium we guess in the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.110
 camp niçois the disappointment in the plan 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.129
 azure and gold a logical victory will say 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.530
 the specialists 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.259
 on the physiognomy of the party and for 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.759
 pleasure a return to this 90th minute 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.280
 this victorious attitude is 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:17.840
 remarkable fabrice snow all 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.840
 little after a good evening 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:36.240
 is it because his patients have 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:42.850
 announced the editions and how it is 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.380
 stupid and that's good I think we 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.540
 have played several times ie 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.220
 twice in the league and once in 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.900
 friendly match at the beginning of season one 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.370
 knew like their rollers on 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.960
 their strengths and their weaknesses I 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.070
 believe that today it's true they 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.780
 were willing but we knew 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.120
 crisscross the ground and I think we 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.220
 especially prevented them from expressing themselves 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.200
 suffers from bad tactic with one 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.860
 purpose of advanced to fall back from not I 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.840
 I am famous 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.340
 here I tell him about this game it has us 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.080
 succeeded perhaps on other matches on 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.040
 will go through I think tonight 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.740
 it was the right solution 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.090
 so now to choose a big or a 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.800
 little big burgundy nantes we took a 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.300
 entrance goal that made us who's got us 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.360
 hurts a lot we ran after for 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.610
 all 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.439
 because the whole party for the 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.060
 second goal let's say that under the effect 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.189
 a substitution bad luck contest 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.099
 we let the forced to let a bound 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.449
 in nice today maybe well played 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.229
 but also was luckier than us 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.819
 let's win 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.830
 I think it's the spirit kick it's 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:40.189
 the spirit of the cup is a year yes 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.110
 maybe it was a momentum like that but 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.219
 I think now we are talking 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.870
 talk about us as a team of 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.479
 buddies as a team that has always 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.389
 the morale in life had there are some 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:52.580
 moments that are easy and there tonight 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.620
 it is one that is very difficult to 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.539
 swallow ccit now that he's going 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.800
 have to prove if that's all we 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:02.800
 said about us a good is this really 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.800
 real second match
