the box and then you guys are going to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.540 
the box and then you guys are going to
assess<00:00:21.539> whether<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.170> think<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.740> may<00:00:23.519> be

with<00:00:38.760> your<00:00:38.969> foundation<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.079> would<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.469> use

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
with your foundation you would just use

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.819 
with your foundation you would just use
probably<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.399> pumps<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.960> this

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
probably about two pumps on this

foundation<00:00:44.520> by<00:00:44.670> Mac<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.780> liquid<00:00:46.289> fluid<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
foundation by Mac is a liquid fluid and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
foundation by Mac is a liquid fluid and
I<00:00:47.370> would<00:00:47.579> say<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.780> got<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> bottle

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
I would say it's it's got in the bottle

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.180 
I would say it's it's got in the bottle
30<00:00:50.579> nil<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> okay<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.559> price<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.070> quite

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
30 nil which is okay the price is quite

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.560 
30 nil which is okay the price is quite
expensive<00:00:53.699> though<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:55.309> 20<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.489> pound<00:00:56.789> 50<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
expensive though is 20 one pound 50 and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
expensive though is 20 one pound 50 and
then<00:00:57.660> you've<00:00:57.780> got<00:00:57.989> buy<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.590> pump<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> can

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
then you've got buy a pump but you can

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
then you've got buy a pump but you can
reuse<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.809> old<00:01:00.930> pump<00:01:01.320> from<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.710> last<00:01:01.920> Mac

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
reuse the old pump from your last Mac

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.219 

this<00:02:01.979> foundation<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.299> good<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.990> would

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
this foundation is really good I would

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.600 
this foundation is really good I would
say<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.439> cover<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:04.860> acne<00:02:05.390> any<00:02:06.390> red<00:02:06.899> patches<00:02:07.610> or

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
say to cover up acne any red patches or

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.059 
say to cover up acne any red patches or
any<00:02:08.849> unwanted<00:02:09.410> coloring<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.590> your<00:02:10.739> face

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
any unwanted coloring on your face

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.020 
any unwanted coloring on your face
because<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.910> light<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.620> nearly<00:02:14.580> white

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
because it's so light it is nearly white

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.240 
because it's so light it is nearly white
I<00:02:15.090> wouldn't<00:02:15.630> say<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.870> was<00:02:16.080> white<00:02:16.470> because<00:02:16.980> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
I wouldn't say it was white because I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.370 
I wouldn't say it was white because I
think<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.940> winter<00:02:18.390> my<00:02:18.599> skin<00:02:18.959> time<00:02:19.200> would

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
think in the winter my skin time would

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.920 
think in the winter my skin time would
be<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.030> Sun<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.630> actually

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
be like so because the Sun is actually

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.740 
be like so because the Sun is actually
lighting<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.680> up<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.849> have<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.540> Mac

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
lighting it up but I do have the Mac

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.979 
lighting it up but I do have the Mac
face<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.110> body<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.620> white<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.280> add<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
face and body and white to add to it and

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.820 
face and body and white to add to it and
