00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.710
 Turn around and I want to share some 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.599
 thing about my smartphone with TV but only 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.490
 to think of the sacrifice of doing this 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.490
 connection I'm already excited 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.900
 formerly to the expert was 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.730
 complicated to make this connection between 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.500
 smartphone and tv 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.800
 but the LG has been improving this scenario for 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.600
 some time on your new smart tv lg all 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.680
 this process is very simple and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.800
 goal 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.980
 thanks to the functions of smart card am and I 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.960
 I will prove to you because you are now seeing and 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.210
 quoted there on your table have been 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.250
 it has a chip that stores several 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.920
 information from your TV brands and 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.079
 makes it easy to connect your smartphone to 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.850
 so just put the smartphone is that in 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.869
 top of the adhesive to connect with 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.020
 smart tv 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.330
 this is now the easiest win of the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.759
 to connect smartphone to smart tv 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.760
 is to share content between them 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.260
 literally just play the content of 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.750
 one with the other 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.909
 so now I can record the videos 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.950
 smartphone knowing that I will be able 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.070
 watch on screen 10 more tv 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.600
 that's it and you do not even need cables 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.600
 router and if that the internet 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.860
 but Rodrigo this video here like that 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.729
 that woman took the video was 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.369
 passing on smart tv to smartphone 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.200
 lg smart tv also lets you pull 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.240
 even open for your smartphone 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.569

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.790

 taking advantage of what we are talking about 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.579
 share content and the smarttv relationship 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.440
