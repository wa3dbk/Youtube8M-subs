breaking down the original trailer into
every<00:00:13.920> individual<00:00:14.429> shot<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.849> had<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.210> figure

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
every individual shot I had to figure

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.760 
every individual shot I had to figure
out<00:00:15.599> what<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.929> would<00:00:16.020> take<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.230> accomplish

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
out what it would take to accomplish

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
out what it would take to accomplish
each<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.760> trick<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> really<00:00:18.240> getting<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
each one the trick is really getting the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.750 
each one the trick is really getting the
overall<00:00:18.990> angles<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.890> positions<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.490> things

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
overall angles and positions of things

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.099 
overall angles and positions of things
in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> frame<00:00:21.240> then<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.810> doesn't<00:00:22.020> really

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
in the frame then it doesn't really

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.630 
in the frame then it doesn't really
matter<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.769> location<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.279> totally

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
matter that the location is totally

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.370 
matter that the location is totally
wrong<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.300> obviously<00:00:24.570> my<00:00:25.080> living

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
a bunch of little buildings I could

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.700 
a bunch of little buildings I could
arrange<00:01:57.720> them<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.050> sorts<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> different<00:01:58.619> ways

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and that's pretty simple but it took

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
and that's pretty simple but it took
like<00:02:03.000> an<00:02:03.119> hour<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.540> draw<00:02:03.750> those<00:02:03.930> windows<00:02:04.290> what

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
