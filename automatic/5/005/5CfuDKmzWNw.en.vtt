 completely new region improved graphics 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.820
 and catch a lot of new pokémon 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.130
 altogether there are 649 im already 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.380
 October 2013 will be the new worldwide 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 editions xy for the nintendo 3ds 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.350
 appear 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.830
 what is there for renewal can give 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.140
 you surely think yourself 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.780
 Let's continue with the chili pokémon 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.250
 fans in pokémon with special color the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.230
 only very rarely appear 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.760
 they dive in every generation though 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.560
 are only since the second as such 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.120
 recognizable from the first to the third 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.070
 generation probably even has 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.720
 higher status values ​​and were 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.010
 so that sometimes much stronger than any 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.540
 do not divorce versions 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.100
 the odds seem to be the pokémon too 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.490
 It is really very small 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.000
 to be exact, chance is 1 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.890
 8192 but there are a few exceptions in 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.170
 pokémon gold silver crystal and its 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.830
 You will meet remakes in the lake of the 20 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.830
 Gardos 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.510
 in pokémon black white 2 you get in 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.459
 the white tree cave or on the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.440
 decide to decide black skyscraper either 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.410
 the frattini or ingenico month 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.150
 donated since the fourth generation 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.010
 But there is also a trick of the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.840
 chance on his pokemon at the breeding 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.670
 increases it concerns the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.230
 so-called masuda method 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.920
 This increases the chance of decisive 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.660
 koopmann get to one in 1000 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.440
 365 if you 're a pokemon for the breed 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.150
 used from another country 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.100
 I still remember my childhood back then 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.300
 it is a myth many to us 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.310
 stories tendrils 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.260
 There were many potential solutions 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.690
 but it is never any of us 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.220
 managed to catch the legendary new 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.630
 but it is now known 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.430
 with whose help you look - 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.459
 can snap and I'll show you 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.230
 like first you have to go to her afterwards 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.630
 go to city and from there on you the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.600
 nugget bridge fight until you get good 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.400
 25 since then you go in the grass and 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.720
 found by an apparatus but struggles 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.620
 no case with the trainer in the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.230
 rat is starting now it will be a bit 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.060
 more complicated as you can see in the video here 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.680
 her the sight of the trainers in the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.340
 grass and press immediately 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.680
 begin 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.390
 then sat with apparat teleport 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.930
 to go back to azzurri city 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.930
 get 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.569
 there you can not for the time being your menu 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.000
 Now it's time to go over 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.980
 nugget bridge on good 25 and fight 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.690
 against the walker hold one 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.790
 step distance from him otherwise plunging the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.500
 play if you have defeated him 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.150
 you against the beetle collector if you 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.950
 also has defeated this is apa 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.849
 such as the tele a port to New York 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.849
 city to come back 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.750
 Now you go again direction margit 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.670
 bridge and when you enter good 25 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.670
 automatically open in the menu 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.870
 as soon as this concludes the fight begins 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.670
 against new but be warned despite his 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.880
 low levels is damn hard too 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.880
 to catch 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.650
 and last but not least the classic 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.760
 par excellence that laura syndrome 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.800
 this myth becomes one of the very first 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.140
 pokémon editions in green and red out 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.460
 It was associated with Japan 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.320
 namely the rumor set in the world 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.390
 that more and more children in the age of 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.370
 ten to fifteen years have died 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.320
 because you have the music from labbadia 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.630
 asked which one made her ill 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.430
 it should have been a few tones 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.230
 which frequency reaches lino of 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.710
 be treatable to children at this age 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.660
 should 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.340
 if children should hear this music 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.570
 they have so burned that it 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.740
 even some suicidal 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.960
 should have 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.880
 however, there is nothing in this myth 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.770
 so far there was no evidence that the 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.630
 Suicide rate among children in Japan too 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.100
 this time should have increased 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.530
 Although this is due to sounds 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.270
 However, it was not influenced in this 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.730
 what would happen with this sequence of 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.570
 facts about facts about facts 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.340
 facts 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.930
 if you liked it let one 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.750
 to know me through a thumb or 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.280
 comment or even an abo and then 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.590
 Hopefully we'll see each other in the next one 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.590
 issue again then bite and ciao
