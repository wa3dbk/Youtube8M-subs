nice<00:02:03.330> erect<00:02:03.690> position<00:02:04.070> over<00:02:05.070> your<00:02:05.190> hips<00:02:05.400> nice

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
nice erect position over your hips nice

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.470 
nice erect position over your hips nice
and<00:02:05.940> straight<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.730> want<00:02:08.730> to<00:02:09.360> be

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
and straight because we don't want to be

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.710 
and straight because we don't want to be
doing<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.050> when<00:02:11.040> we<00:02:11.220> run<00:02:11.460> this<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.510> very

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
doing this when we run this is very

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.290 
doing this when we run this is very
inefficient<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.830> causes<00:02:14.070> your<00:02:14.850> gait<00:02:15.090> to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
inefficient and it causes your gait to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.240 
inefficient and it causes your gait to
swivel<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.320> uses<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.650> lot<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.010> upper-body

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
swivel and it uses a lot of upper-body

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.210 
swivel and it uses a lot of upper-body
energy<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:19.040> balance<00:02:20.040> yourself<00:02:20.870> one<00:02:21.870> foot

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
energy so balance yourself one foot

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.850 
energy so balance yourself one foot
other<00:02:23.220> foot<00:02:23.430> up<00:02:23.640> nice<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.380> nice<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.620> straight

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
can emulate it a little bit and become a

00:06:27.220 --> 00:07:15.670 
can emulate it a little bit and become a
much<00:06:27.430> better<00:06:27.640> for<00:06:27.940> quit<00:06:28.150> striker<00:06:28.450> here<00:06:28.900> we<00:06:28.990> go
