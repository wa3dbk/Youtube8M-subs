fourteen<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.709> definitely<00:01:50.250> thinking<00:01:50.610> that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
fourteen so I'm definitely thinking that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.999 
fourteen so I'm definitely thinking that

you'll be able to get somewhere around

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.770 
you'll be able to get somewhere around
forty<00:01:53.490> millimeters<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.149> some<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> heavier

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
forty millimeters on some of the heavier

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.870 
forty millimeters on some of the heavier
bats<00:01:55.050> because<00:01:55.709> they<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.069> have<00:01:56.429> this<00:01:56.640> dual

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
bats because they do have this dual

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.199 
bats because they do have this dual
spine<00:01:57.209> which<00:01:57.420> reduces<00:01:57.780> weight<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.259> well<00:01:59.209> but

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
spine which reduces weight as well but

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.880 
spine which reduces weight as well but
as<00:02:00.390> far<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.750> bows<00:02:00.990> concerned<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.709> got<00:02:01.740> a

bonus toe is slightly tapered which

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.350 
bonus toe is slightly tapered which
means<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.290> got<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> slight<00:02:16.740> angle<00:02:17.240> for<00:02:18.240> when
