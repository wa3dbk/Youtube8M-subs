00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.679
 for 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.810
 of each commune survived that explosion 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.180
 there are no traces of diaz 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.160
 have evaporated 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.710
 Pandora's box has been shattered and we can not finish with the creatures 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.740
 but we still have the star 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.970
 this stamp is our last hope I remember the analyzes we did in 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.730
 vigo 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.990
 your seal contains codified instructions to build a new 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.130
 box 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.130
 we just have to know with those instructions 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.940
 I'm so sorry remember it's for the good of humanity 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.160
 christie's very aware and turned against dic 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.400
 he did not have the possibility to volunteer 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.470
 they locked him in a cell 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.650
 to analyze it like a rat 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.610
 of course they assumed that he had died during the explosion of the box 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.440
 He also mentioned that he could hardly escape 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.460
 and they were wrong in both cases 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.460
 which would bring terrible consequences in the future 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.220
 especially when they discovered the truth about Pandora's box 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.780
 tivit identity was determined to the islands 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.790
 as everyone expected
