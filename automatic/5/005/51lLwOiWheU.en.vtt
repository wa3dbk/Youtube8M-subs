I'm gonna show you all three of course
but<00:00:44.309> let's<00:00:44.489> start<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.870> trick<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
but let's start the trick here is that I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.400 
but let's start the trick here is that I
utilize<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.500> open<00:00:49.980> g<00:00:50.280> string<00:00:50.390> with<00:00:51.390> five<00:00:52.110> on

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
utilize the open g string with five on

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130 
utilize the open g string with five on
the<00:00:52.590> D<00:00:52.770> string<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.309> create<00:00:53.789> two<00:00:54.629> different

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the D string to create two different

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.170 
the D string to create two different
colors<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.190> same<00:00:56.489> note<00:00:58.610> okay<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.730> then<00:00:59.969> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
colors of the same note okay and then I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.840 
colors of the same note okay and then I
can<00:01:00.629> create<00:01:00.980> a<00:01:01.980> tremolo<00:01:02.670> feel<00:01:03.030> by<00:01:04.850> utilizing

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
can create a tremolo feel by utilizing

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.460 
can create a tremolo feel by utilizing
these<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.300> strings<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> played<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.320> my

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
these two strings now I played with my

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.020 
these two strings now I played with my
fingers<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.009> can<00:01:08.160> play<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.399> with<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.550> pick<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
works fine with a pick and just a finger

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.700 
works fine with a pick and just a finger
picker<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:11.520> death<00:01:11.820> use<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> pick<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.320> I

string or both and that's it and then

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.420 
string or both and that's it and then
right<00:04:00.660> before<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.170> play<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:01.830> remember

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
right before I play it just remember

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.660 
right before I play it just remember
that<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:02.640> didn't<00:04:03.120> talk<00:04:03.269> about<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.569> palm<00:04:03.780> mute

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
that I didn't talk about the palm mute

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.009 
that I didn't talk about the palm mute
you<00:04:05.670> palm<00:04:06.030> mute<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.780> palm<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.709> D<00:04:08.069> string

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
you palm mute I palm you the D string

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.380 
you palm mute I palm you the D string
so<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.049> get<00:04:10.349> two<00:04:10.590> different<00:04:11.130> two<00:04:11.580> completely

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
so I get two different two completely

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.080 
so I get two different two completely
different<00:04:12.630> colors<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.620> G<00:04:13.830> note<00:04:14.069> but<00:04:14.730> you

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
different colors of the G note but you

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.750 
different colors of the G note but you
can<00:04:15.299> mute<00:04:15.540> both<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:16.049> them<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.979> then<00:04:20.430> let<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.639> go

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
can mute both of them and then let it go

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.480 
can mute both of them and then let it go
when<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.479> play<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.139> slide<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:23.070> can<00:04:23.220> mute<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
when you play the slide you can mute the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.980 
when you play the slide you can mute the
D<00:04:23.880> string<00:04:24.090> by<00:04:24.300> itself<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:30.090> then<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.479> get<00:04:30.720> a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
D string by itself and then you get a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.370 
D string by itself and then you get a
half<00:04:31.800> muted<00:04:32.220> sound<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:33.479> whatever<00:04:33.660> sounds<00:04:34.110> good

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
half muted sound do whatever sounds good

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.860 
half muted sound do whatever sounds good
and<00:04:34.680> after<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.490> practice<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.479> can<00:04:36.660> take

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
and after you practice this you can take

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.330 
and after you practice this you can take
it<00:04:37.020> two<00:04:37.169> frets<00:04:37.410> up<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.830> try<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.070> on<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:40.220> yeah<00:04:41.220> it

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
it two frets up and try it on a yeah it

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.950 
it two frets up and try it on a yeah it
sounds<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.669> little<00:04:41.789> bit<00:04:41.970> different<00:04:42.780> because

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
sounds a little bit different because

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.180 
sounds a little bit different because
it's<00:04:43.169> a<00:04:43.410> different<00:04:43.440> harmony<00:04:44.990> but<00:04:46.100> it's<00:04:47.100> a

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
it's a different harmony but it's a

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.529 
it's a different harmony but it's a
variation<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.880> can<00:04:47.910> try<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.270> on<00:04:48.330> different

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
variation you can try it on different

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:56.810 
variation you can try it on different
strings<00:04:48.990> let's<00:04:49.289> say<00:04:49.590> strings<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.760> D<00:04:50.940> on<00:04:55.820> 5c

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
strings let's say strings a and D on 5c

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.290 
strings let's say strings a and D on 5c
works<00:04:57.210> let's<00:04:57.720> write<00:04:57.960> here

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.720 

see<00:05:02.300> it's<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.870> pattern<00:05:03.260> that<00:05:03.470> you<00:05:03.620> can<00:05:03.650> use<00:05:04.010> you

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
see it's a pattern that you can use you

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.210 
see it's a pattern that you can use you
can<00:05:04.910> also<00:05:05.120> use<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:05.690> you<00:05:05.900> can<00:05:06.050> use<00:05:06.230> a<00:05:06.680> part<00:05:06.950> of<00:05:07.040> it

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
can also use it you can use a part of it

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.310 
can also use it you can use a part of it
and<00:05:07.430> solo<00:05:08.000> that<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.270> play<00:05:10.630> right<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.810> can<00:05:12.020> use

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
and solo that you play right you can use

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.090 
and solo that you play right you can use
it<00:05:12.560> as<00:05:12.710> a<00:05:13.190> pattern<00:05:13.400> to<00:05:13.880> add<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.360> solos<00:05:14.750> just

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
it as a pattern to add to solos just

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.040 
it as a pattern to add to solos just
take<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.250> pattern<00:05:16.460> play<00:05:17.210> around<00:05:17.450> with<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:17.840> and

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
take the pattern play around with it and

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.720 
take the pattern play around with it and
see<00:05:18.110> what<00:05:18.290> you<00:05:18.470> come<00:05:18.650> up<00:05:18.680> with<00:05:18.980> before<00:05:19.280> you<00:05:19.610> go
