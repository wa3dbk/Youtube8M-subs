energy<00:00:08.880> into<00:00:09.410> chemical<00:00:10.410> energy<00:00:11.150> so<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
photons packets of light energy and this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.540 
photons packets of light energy and this
will<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.810> captured<00:00:28.109> by<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.710> leaf<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.400> what

these<00:01:01.829> bonds<00:01:02.870> are<00:01:03.870> formed<00:01:04.519> by<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> sharing<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
these bonds are formed by a sharing of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.679 
these bonds are formed by a sharing of
electrons<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.369> for<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.400> sharing<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> car

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
electrons and for that sharing to a car

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.740 
electrons and for that sharing to a car
we're<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> need<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:11.040> energy<00:01:11.600> which<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
we're going to need some energy which of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.490 
we're going to need some energy which of
course<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.290> where<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> photons<00:01:14.580> come<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.500> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
course is where the photons come in so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
course is where the photons come in so
we<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> chemical<00:01:17.729> bonds<00:01:18.150> as

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
we can think of the chemical bonds as

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190 
we can think of the chemical bonds as
electrons<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.820> energy<00:01:21.270> giving<00:01:21.720> us<00:01:21.840> three

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
electrons for energy giving us three

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
different ways to talk about the bonds

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.260 
different ways to talk about the bonds
within<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.770> molecules<00:01:28.670> now<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.409> require

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
within the molecules now the we require

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.080

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
pigment chlorophyll and chlorophyll has

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.220 
pigment chlorophyll and chlorophyll has
the<00:03:17.040> ability<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.879> absorb<00:03:18.840> light<00:03:20.959> trap<00:03:21.959> that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the ability to absorb light trap that

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.789 
the ability to absorb light trap that

light and carry out that conversion into

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.520 
light and carry out that conversion into
chemical<00:03:26.459> energy<00:03:26.549> which<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.299> fact<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
chlorophyll this case is the ejection of

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.130 
chlorophyll this case is the ejection of
electrons<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.730> these<00:03:32.909> electrons<00:03:33.540> here<00:03:33.870> are

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
electrons and these electrons here are

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.860 
electrons and these electrons here are
responsible<00:03:34.950> ultimately<00:03:35.420> for<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.450> formation

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
of the bonds that we described

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.190 
of the bonds that we described
previously<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.890> this<00:03:44.069> diagram<00:03:44.959> we<00:03:45.959> have

previously so in this diagram we have

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.530 
previously so in this diagram we have
carbon<00:03:46.950> dioxide<00:03:47.430> molecules<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.269> water

for light energy the need for a

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.899 
for light energy the need for a
