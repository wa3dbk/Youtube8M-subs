00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.590
 and what's up everybody talks to them mark mex 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.719
 and a boy I brought a video about 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.210
 zombies that consists of a strategy 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.889
 to raise the cable very fast if not 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.690
 you know it's the cable is basically the 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.520
 relationship between our casualties and our 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.650
 sometimes knocked down as you can see in the 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.689
 low I have hundreds 6000 1535 that what 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.930
 let's divide between the times shot 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.300
 which in my case is 593 as you can see what 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.730
 which gives us an average of 179 points 35 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.920
 zombies for each game and I think that 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.170
 the shotgun nor are we up 200 or 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.090
 much more so good strategy 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.219
 basically consists of going to games 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.200
 Customized selections within 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.030
 the first maps the town that is 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.370
 just the second we select 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.110
 very important survival and here in 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.120
 the difficulty we will lower it to easy and 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.000
 in the round the most important thing of all is 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.309
 put him 15 so we started the game 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.039
 and good as you can see let's start 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.600
 with a little pistol and we're going to 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.670
 reappear side of the pakea punches with 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.859
 7000 fifth points the first thing is to put 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.260
 the gun to the enhancer are going to 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.220
 2500 points left and as you can see we 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.790
 a sample comes out 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.100
 ansaldi and the trick here consist 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.140
 basically wait to put together a good 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.990
 amount of zombies do not have to play either 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.730
 not too much because we do not have 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.410
 juggernaut so how can you see here 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.030
 nothing else this one was trying to put together 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.640
 a few zombies and we went up here 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.990
 much much much much eye here because 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.940
 do not open the door that is at the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.200
 right because if we open it we're going to 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.260
 cast will lose this part of the 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.360
 strategy so what's important here is 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.250
 survive wait for the zombies not 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.410
 they played it too much because they see no 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.820
 We still have Bernal so good 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.160
 here you have to wait for basically the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.410
 zombies to come have to take care of a 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.700
 little bullets and all that unless you 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.950
 out 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.539
 the lemon and good here as you can see 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.759
 I decided to stay until round 18 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.469
 I saw that I already had enough points so 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.329
 I decided to open the door and I went for the 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.509
 journal of the first thing to see that 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.890
 he also had other perks so he's very 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.530
 very important 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.840
 let 's do so in this order and then 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.579
 make us some casualties and others the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.959
 next part of the strategy is 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.420
 basically here you have to ride in this 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.680
 part of the magic box later when 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.590
 we see that there are many men we go down 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.720
 and here is let's say the center of the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.280
 strategy that is basically wait and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.890
 wait and wait and try to gather 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.540
 the most zombies possible let's say there 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.370
 to give just this same route 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.230
 in the same part of the map as 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.540
 after doing it many times 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.769
 I discovered that this part is let's say the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.660
 more open where we have more 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.640
 possibility of enclosing enemies without 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.099
 play with those too much as you can see 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.200
 Well, here I'm basically waiting for 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.569
 that the largest number of zombies gather 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 and let's say it's a more compact group 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.440
 here let's say the only thing that was 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.299
 doing was compacting it for what 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.580
 will see below and then nothing else I give 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.440
 one more lap 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.780
 that the compact was well 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.720
 group and here is exactly where it continues 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.240
 the next point that basically there was 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.280
 once they are well compact you have to 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.170
 shoot them two or three bullets from mohamed 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.450
 Ali and as you can see we will kill 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.610
 enough zombies so there's basically 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.740
 that repeat this the most amount of 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.450
 possible times without letting us down 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.610
 so good what happens if we are going to 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.170
 beat or something like that basically what 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.810
 we do here as you can see and it's coming 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.450
 closed it was already in red and what I did 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.100
 was to finish the game and finish the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.450
 heading as you can see I killed 254 and not 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.230
 they beat me down once so in 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.050
 theory and practically that round or that 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.600
 departure was like 254 radio so 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.160
 is very well above the 179 that 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.720
 I had assigned guys this is 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.580
 basically the strategy I hope that they 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.810
 serve is a strategic and I knew 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.550
 for a long time however 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.260
 I barely even thought about bringing the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.060
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.459
 for now supports and by sulay share the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.110
 video I am marcan mex and see you in 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.110
 the next video bye bye 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.720
 yes 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.890
 this
