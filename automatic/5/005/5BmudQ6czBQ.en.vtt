00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
okay here's the new file let's place our

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.180 
okay here's the new file let's place our
sketch<00:00:05.549> here

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.749 

that<00:00:11.370> suggested<00:00:12.209> we<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.679> size<00:00:14.339> that<00:00:14.700> we

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
that suggested we have the size that we

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.770 
that suggested we have the size that we
wanted<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.150 

and<00:00:18.050> this<00:00:18.740> later<00:00:19.100> I<00:00:19.520> will<00:00:20.000> double-click<00:00:20.600> its

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
and this later I will double-click its

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.070 
and this later I will double-click its
options<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.670> converted<00:00:23.270> to<00:00:23.450> a<00:00:23.480> template

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
options and converted to a template

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.010 
options and converted to a template
layer<00:00:24.290> which<00:00:25.190> will<00:00:25.430> lock<00:00:25.700> it<00:00:26.029> handle<00:00:26.750> them<00:00:26.990> the

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
layer which will lock it handle them the

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.880 
layer which will lock it handle them the
images<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.800> 50%<00:00:28.689> so

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
images to 50% so

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.799 
images to 50% so
now<00:00:31.039> this<00:00:31.430> will

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
now this will

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.750 
now this will
like<00:00:33.020> up<00:00:33.170> on<00:00:33.289> Google

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
like up on Google

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.180 
like up on Google
and<00:00:34.910> I<00:00:35.300> will<00:00:35.480> make<00:00:35.630> a<00:00:35.660> new<00:00:35.989> layer<00:00:36.200> this<00:00:36.980> is

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
and I will make a new layer this is

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.750 
and I will make a new layer this is
where<00:00:37.370> I'll<00:00:37.550> do<00:00:37.760> all<00:00:38.360> of<00:00:38.420> my<00:00:38.600> belt<00:00:39.020> work<00:00:39.760> change

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
where I'll do all of my belt work change

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.670 
where I'll do all of my belt work change
the<00:00:40.970> color<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.600> light<00:00:41.629> blue<00:00:42.020> that's<00:00:42.500> a

the color to a light blue that's a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.910 
the color to a light blue that's a
personal<00:00:43.160> preference<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:44.629> I<00:00:45.170> will<00:00:45.350> import<00:00:45.650> my

personal preference and I will import my
graphic<00:00:46.400> styles<00:00:47.350> which<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:48.620> don't<00:00:48.829> have<00:00:48.980> to

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
graphic styles which you don't have to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.670 
graphic styles which you don't have to
but<00:00:50.120> if<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.900> have<00:00:51.080> a<00:00:51.110> preference<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.860> do<00:00:52.070> that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
but if you have a preference to do that

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.670 
but if you have a preference to do that
the<00:00:54.680> belt<00:00:55.129> will<00:00:55.760> have<00:00:56.269> no<00:00:56.480> film<00:00:56.900> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the belt will have no film and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.350 
the belt will have no film and
stroke<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.840> 0.5<00:01:00.840> points<00:01:01.560> and<00:01:02.130> of<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> start

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
stroke of 0.5 points and of the start

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.749 
stroke of 0.5 points and of the start
which<00:01:03.570> anti<00:01:03.960> color<00:01:05.720> so

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
which anti color so

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.940 
which anti color so
this<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.509> kind<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.869> like<00:01:09.079> using<00:01:09.500> your<00:01:09.680> pencil

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
this is kind of like using your pencil

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.440 
this is kind of like using your pencil
they<00:01:10.820> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
they just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.320 
they just
build<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.170> instead<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> sketching<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> but

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
build it instead of sketching it but

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.760 
build it instead of sketching it but
everything<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.910> uniform<00:01:17.910> and<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.750> want<00:01:19.110> color

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
everything is uniform and of want color

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.890 
everything is uniform and of want color
so<00:01:20.840> let's<00:01:21.840> start<00:01:22.350> by<00:01:22.800> building<00:01:23.550> this<00:01:24.120> head

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so let's start by building this head

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.790 
so let's start by building this head
shape<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.220> use<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> pan<00:01:27.480> tool<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.050> just<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.440> free

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
shape I use the pan tool it just be free

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.450 
shape I use the pan tool it just be free
shortcut<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.300> I<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:31.020> place<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.530> points<00:01:32.040> on

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
shortcut and I just place the points on

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.710 
shortcut and I just place the points on
peaks<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.750> valleys<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.410> corners<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.480> can<00:01:36.480> make

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
peaks and valleys and corners I can make

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.370 
peaks and valleys and corners I can make
smooth<00:01:37.650> points<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.150> hold<00:01:39.360> down<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.990> left

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
smooth points if I hold down the left

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.580 
smooth points if I hold down the left
mouse<00:01:41.130> button<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:42.240> drag<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> side<00:01:43.230> I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
mouse button just drag to the side I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.830 
mouse button just drag to the side I
have<00:01:44.370> to<00:01:44.550> do<00:01:44.730> it<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.300> can<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.840> build<00:01:46.260> or<00:01:47.130> your

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
have to do it you can just build or your

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.040 
have to do it you can just build or your
anchor<00:01:48.840> points<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.310> worry<00:01:51.240> about<00:01:51.360> smoothness

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
anchor points and worry about smoothness

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.120 
anchor points and worry about smoothness
later

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
later

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.780 
later
let's<00:01:54.700> close<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.300> path<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:57.250> select<00:01:57.490> the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
let's close this path now I select the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.310 
let's close this path now I select the
direct<00:01:58.479> selection<00:01:58.600> tool<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.280> hotkeys<00:02:00.760> 8<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
direct selection tool the hotkeys 8 and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.860 
direct selection tool the hotkeys 8 and
I<00:02:02.500> select<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:03.190> anchor<00:02:03.729> point<00:02:03.820> because<00:02:04.720> this

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
I select this anchor point because this

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.800 
I select this anchor point because this
where<00:02:05.260> it's<00:02:05.650> really<00:02:06.010> messed<00:02:06.340> up<00:02:06.520> right<00:02:06.729> now

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
where it's really messed up right now

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.670 
where it's really messed up right now
now<00:02:07.810> if<00:02:07.960> I<00:02:08.200> drag<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:09.039> handle<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:10.300> will<00:02:10.690> affect

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
now if I drag this handle it will affect

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.870 
now if I drag this handle it will affect
the<00:02:12.490> other<00:02:12.640> handle<00:02:13.180> as<00:02:13.360> well<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.880> which

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the other handle as well this one which

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.540 
the other handle as well this one which
in<00:02:16.390> turn<00:02:16.690> means<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.560> I'm<00:02:17.890> affecting<00:02:18.400> not

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
in turn means that I'm affecting not

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.600 
in turn means that I'm affecting not
only<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:19.150> segment<00:02:19.870> but<00:02:20.290> also<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:21.040> one<00:02:21.340> I

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
only this segment but also this one I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.940 
only this segment but also this one I
don't<00:02:22.270> want<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.810> happen<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.410> used<00:02:23.709> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
don't want that to happen so I used the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.750 
don't want that to happen so I used the
converter<00:02:24.550> tool<00:02:25.090> should<00:02:26.020> see<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.489> drag

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
converter tool should see and I drag

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.790 
converter tool should see and I drag
this<00:02:28.060> handle<00:02:28.330> separately

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
this handle separately

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.740 
this handle separately
once<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.640> do<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.480> can<00:02:33.230> use<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:34.750> direct

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
once I do it I can use the direct

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.260 
once I do it I can use the direct
selection<00:02:35.870> tool<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.980> drag<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.000> handle

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
selection tool and drag this handle

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.380 
selection tool and drag this handle
without

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
without

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.780 
without
movement<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.659> the<00:02:41.959> other<00:02:42.140> ones<00:02:44.739> then<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:46.189> do<00:02:46.519> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
movement on the other ones then I do the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.490 
movement on the other ones then I do the
same<00:02:46.819> for<00:02:47.510> all<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.590> other<00:02:49.510> anchor<00:02:50.510> points<00:02:51.109> and

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
same for all the other anchor points and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.550 
same for all the other anchor points and
handles<00:02:52.129> I<00:02:52.459> just<00:02:52.790> kind<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.500> fix<00:02:54.579> everything

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:13.690 

let's<00:03:06.490> fix<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.240> one<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.780> use

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.670 

and<00:03:14.050> that's<00:03:15.050> close<00:03:15.349> enough<00:03:18.160> perfect<00:03:19.239> good

you can add anchor points and remove

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.620 
you can add anchor points and remove
them<00:03:29.750> anytime<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.860> want<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:32.150> let's<00:03:32.420> use

happiness plus if you click anywhere on
the<00:03:45.610> path<00:03:45.880> but<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:46.630> too<00:03:46.930> will<00:03:47.650> add<00:03:47.830> anchor

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
the path but this too will add anchor

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.680 
the path but this too will add anchor
points<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:49.770> remove<00:03:50.770> anchor<00:03:51.459> points<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.150> use

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
points to remove anchor points you use

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.920 
points to remove anchor points you use
the

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
- which is - erupted and just click on

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.430

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.500 

that's<00:04:04.440> kind<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.860> bad<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.510> point-by-point

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
that's kind of bad for point-by-point

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.119 
that's kind of bad for point-by-point
building<00:04:07.500> that's<00:04:08.040> how<00:04:08.250> I'm<00:04:08.610> going<00:04:08.879> to<00:04:10.129> fill

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
building that's how I'm going to fill

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
but I'm not going to worry about it

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.099 
but I'm not going to worry about it
being<00:04:18.410> perfect<00:04:18.709> out<00:04:19.669> of<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:20.060> gate<00:04:20.269> because<00:04:20.630> I

being perfect out of the gate because I
will<00:04:21.380> be<00:04:21.560> readjusting<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.760> whole<00:04:23.030> bunch<00:04:23.210> of

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
will be readjusting a whole bunch of

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.659 
will be readjusting a whole bunch of
stuff<00:04:23.630> later<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.490> with<00:04:26.530> Pathfinder<00:04:27.530> tools<00:04:29.620> but

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
stuff later on with Pathfinder tools but

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.120 
stuff later on with Pathfinder tools but
the<00:04:31.669> most<00:04:32.090> important<00:04:32.570> thing<00:04:32.840> for<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:34.100> to

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
the most important thing for you is to

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.150 
the most important thing for you is to
understand<00:04:35.000> where<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:36.020> place<00:04:36.320> where<00:04:37.040> you

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
understand where the place where you

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.550 
understand where the place where you
need<00:04:37.370> to<00:04:37.580> place<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.210> anchor<00:04:38.900> points<00:04:39.380> and

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
need to place the anchor points and

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.680 
need to place the anchor points and
worked<00:04:40.070> with<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.490> handles<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.330> make<00:04:41.389> the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
worked with the handles to make the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.470 
worked with the handles to make the
curves<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.919> way<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.130> want<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.639> it's<00:04:44.180> really

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
curves the way you want to it's really

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.360 
curves the way you want to it's really
easy<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.750> see<00:04:45.080> when<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:45.470> already<00:04:45.830> have<00:04:46.160> a

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
easy to see when you already have a

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.970 
easy to see when you already have a
sketch<00:04:46.790> you<00:04:47.060> just<00:04:47.330> kind<00:04:47.870> of

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
sketch you just kind of

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.300 
sketch you just kind of
place<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.880> points<00:04:50.300> on<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:51.170> corners<00:04:51.890> and

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
place the points on the corners and

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.020 
place the points on the corners and
peaks<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.150> valleys<00:04:53.240> if<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:54.580> think<00:04:55.580> of<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.880> as

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
peaks and valleys if you think of it as
