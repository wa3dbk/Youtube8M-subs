white<00:01:23.440> people<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.250> can<00:01:24.430> only<00:01:24.640> knock<00:01:25.030> them<00:01:25.300> out

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.190

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
difference from the way this campaign

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.509 
difference from the way this campaign
started<00:04:14.380> when<00:04:14.500> he<00:04:14.650> first<00:04:14.890> ran<00:04:15.040> for<00:04:15.190> president

started when he first ran for president
he<00:04:15.970> actually<00:04:16.660> did<00:04:16.870> not<00:04:17.079> have<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.739> kind<00:04:18.070> of

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
he actually did not have that kind of

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.400 
he actually did not have that kind of
support<00:04:18.400> not<00:04:18.850> nearly<00:04:19.269> in<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.419> polls<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.049> the

support not nearly in the polls and the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.980 
support not nearly in the polls and the
reason<00:04:20.739> we<00:04:20.859> were<00:04:21.010> told<00:04:21.280> was<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.330> blacks<00:04:22.720> did

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990
