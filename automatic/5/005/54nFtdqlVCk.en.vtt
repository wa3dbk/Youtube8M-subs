know about the history of the shredder
at<00:00:28.630> this<00:00:28.779> point<00:00:29.080> but<00:00:29.439> what<00:00:29.650> we<00:00:29.769> do<00:00:29.980> know<00:00:30.189> is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
at this point but what we do know is

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.119 
at this point but what we do know is
that<00:00:30.519> he's<00:00:30.880> a<00:00:30.910> very<00:00:31.330> powerful<00:00:31.720> very<00:00:32.710> skilled

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
that he's a very powerful very skilled

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.150 
that he's a very powerful very skilled
very<00:00:33.460> intimidating<00:00:34.210> very<00:00:35.079> scary<00:00:35.530> individual

very intimidating very scary individual

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.470 
very intimidating very scary individual
I<00:00:41.010> think<00:00:42.010> it's<00:00:42.129> somewhat<00:00:42.489> distressing<00:00:43.000> to<00:00:43.360> the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
I think it's somewhat distressing to the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.299 
I think it's somewhat distressing to the
other<00:00:43.629> three<00:00:43.960> turtles<00:00:44.320> when<00:00:44.500> Leo<00:00:44.649> goes<00:00:44.949> off<00:00:45.100> on

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
other three turtles when Leo goes off on

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.099 
other three turtles when Leo goes off on
his<00:00:45.430> own<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:45.879> especially<00:00:46.180> when<00:00:46.690> he<00:00:46.780> goes<00:00:46.930> off

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
his own and especially when he goes off

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.040 
his own and especially when he goes off
to<00:00:47.320> talk<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.710> Saki<00:00:47.980> because<00:00:48.850> they<00:00:49.629> view<00:00:50.020> him

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
to talk to Saki because they view him

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.369 
to talk to Saki because they view him
and<00:00:50.920> rightly<00:00:51.789> so<00:00:52.030> as<00:00:52.329> sort<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.719> their<00:00:53.019> rudder

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
and rightly so as sort of their rudder

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.920 
and rightly so as sort of their rudder
their<00:00:54.010> lynchpin<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:55.719> kind<00:00:55.840> of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
their lynchpin and it is that kind of

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.750 
their lynchpin and it is that kind of
weird<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.260> see<00:00:56.410> him<00:00:56.500> going<00:00:56.710> off<00:00:56.949> and<00:00:57.190> possibly

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
weird to see him going off and possibly

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.689 
weird to see him going off and possibly
going<00:00:58.030> down<00:00:58.269> a<00:00:58.300> wrong<00:00:58.570> path<00:00:58.649> by<00:00:59.649> at<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.519> very

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
going down a wrong path by at the very

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.180 
going down a wrong path by at the very
least<00:01:00.850> meeting<00:01:01.420> with<00:01:01.600> Saki<00:01:02.109> and<00:01:02.289> possibly

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
least meeting with Saki and possibly

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.130 
least meeting with Saki and possibly
joining<00:01:03.640> up<00:01:03.760> with<00:01:03.910> him<00:01:04.030> we<00:01:04.869> have<00:01:05.110> been

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
joining up with him we have been

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.990 
joining up with him we have been
fighting<00:01:05.710> each<00:01:05.860> other<00:01:06.009> when<00:01:06.580> we<00:01:06.729> should

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
fighting each other when we should

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.719 
fighting each other when we should
actually<00:01:07.270> be<00:01:07.780> on<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.110> same<00:01:08.439> side<00:01:08.799> fighting

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
actually be on the same side fighting

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.520 
actually be on the same side fighting
against<00:01:10.119> our<00:01:10.240> true<00:01:10.659> enemy

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
against our true enemy

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.740 
against our true enemy
we'll<00:01:12.100> probably<00:01:12.400> would<00:01:12.759> not<00:01:12.909> have<00:01:12.970> gone<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.659> a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
we'll probably would not have gone to a

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.450 
we'll probably would not have gone to a
meeting<00:01:14.110> with<00:01:14.229> Saki<00:01:14.710> if<00:01:15.040> he<00:01:15.189> had<00:01:15.280> not<00:01:15.400> been

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
meeting with Saki if he had not been

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.520 
meeting with Saki if he had not been
upset<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.240> he<00:01:16.540> would<00:01:16.900> certainly<00:01:17.079> have<00:01:17.350> taken

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
upset and he would certainly have taken

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.800 
upset and he would certainly have taken
his<00:01:17.799> brothers<00:01:18.070> with<00:01:18.310> him<00:01:18.430> part<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.360> reason

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
his brothers with him part of the reason

his brothers with him part of the reason
that<00:01:20.100> Leo<00:01:21.100> is<00:01:21.369> almost<00:01:22.119> taken<00:01:22.600> in<00:01:22.750> by<00:01:22.930> what<00:01:23.110> Saki

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
almost brings Leo to the point of

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.710 
almost brings Leo to the point of

first<00:04:08.940> time<00:04:09.209> flying<00:04:09.690> first<00:04:10.620> superhero

first time flying first superhero
team-up<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:12.170> think<00:04:13.170> one<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.410> reasons<00:04:13.739> that

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
team-up I think one of the reasons that

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.490 
team-up I think one of the reasons that
Michelangelo<00:04:14.430> has<00:04:14.940> this<00:04:15.270> attitude<00:04:16.019> or

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
Michelangelo has this attitude or

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.720 
Michelangelo has this attitude or
approach<00:04:16.859> is<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.150> all<00:04:18.390> four<00:04:18.840> Turtles

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
approach is that of all four Turtles

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.760 
approach is that of all four Turtles
he's<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.940> most<00:04:21.209> fascinated<00:04:22.140> by<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.350> human

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
world and if he could he would spend a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.500 
world and if he could he would spend a
