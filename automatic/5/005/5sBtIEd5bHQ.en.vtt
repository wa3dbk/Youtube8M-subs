00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
off another thing is i would recommend

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.360 
off another thing is i would recommend
doing<00:03:51.960> this<00:03:52.080> on<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> second<00:03:52.920> account<00:03:53.100> where<00:03:53.340> you

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
doing this on a second account where you

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.920 
doing this on a second account where you
could<00:03:53.580> just<00:03:53.700> easily<00:03:53.970> transfer<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.720> coins

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
could just easily transfer the coins

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.460 
could just easily transfer the coins
from<00:03:55.730> one<00:03:56.730> account<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.090> another<00:03:57.180> account<00:03:57.630> go

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
from one account to another account go

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.530 
from one account to another account go
so<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.800> way<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.010> are<00:03:59.250> probably<00:03:59.580> less<00:04:00.060> likely
