00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
this video I'm going to cover how to use

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.270 
this video I'm going to cover how to use
a<00:00:06.390> hole<00:00:06.870> saw<00:00:08.300> in<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:10.080> situation<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.800> we're

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
a hole saw in the situation that we're

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.999 
a hole saw in the situation that we're
in<00:00:11.309> I'm<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> use<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> one-inch<00:00:13.019> one<00:00:13.230> from

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
in I'm going to use a one-inch one from

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.300 
in I'm going to use a one-inch one from
this<00:00:14.190> kit<00:00:14.429> here<00:00:15.260> what<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.650> do<00:00:16.859> is

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
this kit here what we're going to do is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.290 
this kit here what we're going to do is
I'm<00:00:18.090> putting<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.720> new<00:00:19.699> faucet<00:00:20.699> which<00:00:21.090> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
I'm putting in a new faucet which is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.450 
I'm putting in a new faucet which is
actually<00:00:22.020> another<00:00:22.350> video<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.830> upload<00:00:23.250> on

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
actually another video going upload on

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.420 
actually another video going upload on
how<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> install<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.330> faucet<00:00:24.800> in<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.949> case<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
how to install a faucet in this case I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.550 
how to install a faucet in this case I
need<00:00:26.580> another<00:00:26.849> hole<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.109> old<00:00:28.289> faucet

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
need another hole here the old faucet

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.400 
need another hole here the old faucet
didn't<00:00:29.010> use<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.779> what<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.869> looking<00:00:31.140> for

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
didn't use it and what I'm looking for

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.340 
didn't use it and what I'm looking for
is<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:32.279> make<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.640> hole<00:00:32.969> same<00:00:33.390> size<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.020> so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
is to make a hole same size as this so

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.770 
is to make a hole same size as this so
I've<00:00:34.500> taken<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:35.130> different<00:00:36.030> holes<00:00:36.210> Oz<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I've taken my different holes Oz and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.150 
I've taken my different holes Oz and
obviously<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.420> proper<00:00:39.420> fit<00:00:40.160> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
obviously that one is the proper fit so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.900 
obviously that one is the proper fit so
go<00:00:41.489> back<00:00:41.640> over<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.149> our<00:00:42.230> kit<00:00:43.730> we're<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
go back over to our kit we're going to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.400 
go back over to our kit we're going to
drill<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> pilot<00:00:45.180> hole<00:00:45.570> which<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> be

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
drill a pilot hole which is going to be

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.560 
drill a pilot hole which is going to be
just<00:00:46.649> basically<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.399> small<00:00:47.640> hole<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.559> the

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
just basically just a small hole for the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
just basically just a small hole for the
mandrel<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.960> actually<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.890> through<00:00:52.920> once<00:00:53.340> we

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
mandrel to actually go through once we

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.119 
mandrel to actually go through once we
put<00:00:54.000> our<00:00:54.030> holes<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> end<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:56.480> so

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
put our holes on the end of this so

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.759 
put our holes on the end of this so
we're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> one-inch<00:01:01.039> hole<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
we're going to do a one-inch hole and

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.170 
we're going to do a one-inch hole and
down<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.010> where<00:01:05.159> our<00:01:05.189> mandrels<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.030> got

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
down here where our mandrels are we got

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.620 
down here where our mandrels are we got
one<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.630> it's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
one here and one here and this it's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.719 
one here and one here and this it's
maybe<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.590> read<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.890> below<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
maybe you can read this below it as the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.630 
maybe you can read this below it as the
mandrel<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.869> 9/16<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:16.340> 3/16<00:01:17.340> inch

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
mandrel for 9/16 to the one 3/16 inch

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.010 
mandrel for 9/16 to the one 3/16 inch
hole<00:01:17.970> saws<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:20.030> that's<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.270> range<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.780> it'll

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
hole saws so that's the range that it'll

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.670 
hole saws so that's the range that it'll
cover<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.680> obviously<00:01:23.340> our<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.600> inch<00:01:24.680> hole

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
cover and obviously our one inch hole

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.499 
cover and obviously our one inch hole
saw<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> fall<00:01:27.780> into<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> range<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
saw is going to fall into the range of

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.880 
saw is going to fall into the range of
this<00:01:30.509> mandrel<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> one

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
this mandrel here so this is the one

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
this mandrel here so this is the one
we're<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> use<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.420> want<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
we're going to use so what you want to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.740 
we're going to use so what you want to
do<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.610> take<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.850> mandrel<00:01:36.299> that's<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
do here is take the mandrel that's the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450 
do here is take the mandrel that's the
proper<00:01:37.079> size<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.619> hole<00:01:37.770> saw<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.280> we

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
proper size for the hole saw which we

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.109 
proper size for the hole saw which we
just<00:01:38.640> discussed<00:01:39.890> put<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> hole<00:01:41.250> saw<00:01:41.549> into<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
just discussed put the hole saw into the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.120 
just discussed put the hole saw into the
mandrel<00:01:43.670> screw<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.860> then<00:01:46.860> take<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
mandrel screw it on there then take a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.330 
mandrel screw it on there then take a
wrench<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.820> side<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.770> mandrel<00:01:50.159> right

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
wrench on one side of your mandrel right

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
wrench on one side of your mandrel right
there<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.020> then<00:01:52.020> there's<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.439> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
there and then there's going to be a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.620 
there and then there's going to be a
flat<00:01:52.970> groove<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:55.200> hole<00:01:55.350> saw<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:56.630> that's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
flat groove on your hole saw here that's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.940 
flat groove on your hole saw here that's
made<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.820> other<00:02:00.030> wrench<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> you're

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
made for the other wrench so you're

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.410 
made for the other wrench so you're
going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> hold<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.880> careful<00:02:03.270> not

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
going to hold out there be careful not

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.240 
going to hold out there be careful not
to<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:03.990> hands<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.590> around<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> end<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
to get your hands up around the end of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.969 
to get your hands up around the end of
that<00:02:05.369> hole<00:02:05.549> saw<00:02:05.790> because<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.149> cut<00:02:06.450> yourself

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
that hole saw because you cut yourself

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.820 
that hole saw because you cut yourself
quite<00:02:07.979> nastily<00:02:08.550> doing<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:10.619> might

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
quite nastily doing this so you might

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.910 
quite nastily doing this so you might
want<00:02:11.099> to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
want to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.210 
want to
put<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.700> vise<00:02:14.000> whatever<00:02:14.600> works<00:02:15.220> anyway

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
put it in a vise whatever works anyway

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.650 
put it in a vise whatever works anyway
just<00:02:17.410> tighten<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.560> up<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:20.240> want<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.510> good

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
just tighten that up you want it good

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.420 
just tighten that up you want it good
and<00:02:20.840> tight<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.440> doesn't<00:02:21.590> come<00:02:22.190> loose<00:02:22.220> in

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and tight so it doesn't come loose in

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.400 
and tight so it doesn't come loose in
your<00:02:22.730> drill<00:02:26.770> okay<00:02:27.770> then<00:02:28.220> take<00:02:28.340> your<00:02:28.460> drill<00:02:29.410> but

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
your drill okay then take your drill but

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.100 
your drill okay then take your drill but
the<00:02:30.530> man<00:02:30.710> drilled<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.130> hole<00:02:31.250> saw<00:02:31.960> into<00:02:32.960> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
the man drilled the hole saw into the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.870 
the man drilled the hole saw into the
drill<00:02:34.180> tighten<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.270> up<00:02:35.330> I'm<00:02:35.990> going<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.880> not

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
drill tighten that up I'm going to not

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.250 
drill tighten that up I'm going to not
be<00:02:38.030> able<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.300> put<00:02:38.450> enough<00:02:38.510> force<00:02:38.810> on<00:02:39.080> and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
be able to put enough force on and

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.560 
be able to put enough force on and
videotape<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.710> so<00:02:40.220> anyway<00:02:41.090> just<00:02:41.240> get<00:02:41.390> that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
videotape that so anyway just get that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.020 
videotape that so anyway just get that
good<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.840> tighten<00:02:42.080> your<00:02:42.110> drill<00:02:42.520> okay<00:02:43.520> once

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
good and tighten your drill okay once

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.880 
good and tighten your drill okay once
you<00:02:44.150> get<00:02:44.270> your<00:02:44.450> pilot<00:02:44.840> hole<00:02:45.020> drilled<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.770> you

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
you get your pilot hole drilled and you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.140 
you get your pilot hole drilled and you
can<00:02:46.010> see<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.370> kind<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.730> screwed<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.060> a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
can see that I kind of screwed up a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.140 
can see that I kind of screwed up a
little<00:02:47.300> bit<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.510> have<00:02:47.750> two<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.170> them<00:02:48.260> because<00:02:48.620> I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
little bit I have two of them because I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.850 
little bit I have two of them because I
drilled<00:02:50.150> my<00:02:50.270> first<00:02:50.630> one<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.260> then<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.500> realized

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
drilled my first one and then I realized

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.830 
drilled my first one and then I realized
that<00:02:51.950> was<00:02:52.040> off<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.310> little<00:02:52.460> bit<00:02:52.790> but<00:02:53.540> anyway

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
that was off a little bit but anyway

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.280 
that was off a little bit but anyway
that'll<00:02:54.170> guide<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:55.670> drill<00:02:55.880> that's<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:57.110> bit

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
that'll guide the drill that's the bit

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.810 
that'll guide the drill that's the bit
that's<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.590> your<00:02:57.710> mandrel<00:02:58.130> they're<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.550> nicely

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
that's in your mandrel they're in nicely

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.230 
that's in your mandrel they're in nicely
so<00:02:59.210> once<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.540> have<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.020> place<00:03:00.730> just<00:03:01.730> get

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
so once you have that in place just get

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.920 
so once you have that in place just get
a<00:03:02.270> good<00:03:02.480> grip<00:03:03.140> on<00:03:03.200> your<00:03:03.500> drill<00:03:04.780> start<00:03:05.780> to

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
a good grip on your drill start to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.650 
a good grip on your drill start to
operate<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.940> before<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.000> actually<00:03:08.120> hits<00:03:08.570> the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
operate it before it actually hits the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.290 
operate it before it actually hits the
surface<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:10.430> going<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.640> be<00:03:10.730> guided<00:03:11.150> in

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
surface the it's going to be guided in

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.650 
surface the it's going to be guided in
by<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.930> bit<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.670> it'll<00:03:13.880> turn<00:03:14.300> in<00:03:14.540> your

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
by the the bit so it'll turn in your

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
by the the bit so it'll turn in your
pilot<00:03:15.320> hole

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.800 

I<00:03:42.579> start<00:03:43.579> at<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.730> talk<00:03:43.939> there<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.329> I<00:03:44.390> realized

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
I start at the talk there and I realized

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.539 
I start at the talk there and I realized
I<00:03:45.079> couldn't<00:03:45.260> be<00:03:45.379> heard<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:45.829> it's<00:03:46.220> basically

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
I couldn't be heard so it's basically

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.130 
I couldn't be heard so it's basically
saying<00:03:46.790> don't<00:03:46.879> get<00:03:47.150> too<00:03:47.269> aggressive<00:03:47.360> just<00:03:47.959> let

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
saying don't get too aggressive just let

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.410 
saying don't get too aggressive just let
it<00:03:48.260> kind<00:03:48.439> of<00:03:48.560> find<00:03:49.400> its<00:03:49.549> way<00:03:49.700> through<00:03:50.000> maybe

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
it kind of find its way through maybe

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.330 
it kind of find its way through maybe
move<00:03:50.659> the<00:03:50.810> drill<00:03:51.049> back<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:51.500> forth<00:03:51.709> slightly

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
move the drill back and forth slightly

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.790 
move the drill back and forth slightly
and<00:03:53.680> that'll<00:03:54.680> basically<00:03:54.769> get<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.340> job<00:03:55.549> done
