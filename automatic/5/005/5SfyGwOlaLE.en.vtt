 a meaning of rep guarantee 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.610
 It came a science software bm &amp; f and 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:54.250
 then we will present and a feedback 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:01:04.800

 biometric is that the same as you 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.620
 can see it gets its led off 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:45.380
 it has sensors on the side 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:48.170
 approaching it switches the sensor on 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.940
 front of the watch we have 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.800

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.760
 the keyboard is composed of a keyboard 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.520
 Numerical here this button one cap edi 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.300
 tax where the press it for five 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:07.760
 second and issued a report of 0 24 hours

 appeared one and two with our watch 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:26.050
 There is one person just to test only for 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.050
 will have alpha the number 1 printer 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.220
 as you can see if I press the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.010

 will ask to put the same floor of 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:02.800
 will register the power of the 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:07.030
 optimal image 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:14.460
 and let's test the user 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:17.550
 the government eyes finally correct 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:22.210

 Here I have a Christmas day. 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:48.039
 presenting the video is a sensor 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.969
 biometric with printer here in the middle 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:55.569
 I have 11,000 cubic meters of funcafÃ© and 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:06:00.060
 proximity to a printer and here I 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:02.879
 I have a biometric process a person 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.919
 It's an interesting thing to see. 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:08.430
 records on two sensors that have a 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.900
 proximity card on own date 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.680
 Can you see how we read? 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.419
 always pretending with two actors to do
