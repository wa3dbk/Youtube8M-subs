00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
some apples and then I'm going to use

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.679 
some apples and then I'm going to use
some<00:01:43.140> butcher<00:01:43.560> string<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.310> tie<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.090> little

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
some butcher string to tie the little

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.649 
some butcher string to tie the little
legs<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.189> now<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.670> baked<00:01:48.000> dish<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
legs there now I have my baked dish and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.420 
legs there now I have my baked dish and
I<00:01:48.869> lined<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.290> foil<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
I lined it with foil you don't have to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
I lined it with foil you don't have to
but<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.759> helps<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.659> cleanup<00:01:51.899> process

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
but it just helps the cleanup process

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.010 
but it just helps the cleanup process
afterwards<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.479> don't<00:01:54.630> want<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> whole

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
afterwards so if you don't want a whole

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.450 
afterwards so if you don't want a whole
lot<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.290> clean<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.829> sure<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.159> line<00:01:56.340> your

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
lot to clean be sure to line your

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.969 
lot to clean be sure to line your
through<00:01:56.700> some<00:01:56.880> foil<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.409> next<00:01:58.680> couple<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
through some foil and the next couple of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
through some foil and the next couple of
steps<00:01:59.100> I'm<00:01:59.430> actually<00:01:59.759> not<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.390> add<00:02:00.600> on
