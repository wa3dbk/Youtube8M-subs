00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.580
 And then it's okay that Miguel 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.529
 Christian would like to address a subject 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.260
 interesting from today's program I am 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.860
 roberto fan that exploration 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.170
 music teacher has a lot of school 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:23.100
 music that even being the owner of the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:25.080
 lot is paying only 30% maximum 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.029
 Teacher, what I think is tremendous. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.960
 exploitation is that the teacher is obliged 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.759
 to do with the mixaria that has and e has 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 some of them even found 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:42.090
 teacher can not work for another 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 ie school to school besides you 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.110
 little talk will not let you look where 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.680
 I'm going to work for lamy in parallel with 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.129
 she 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.910
 that 's a great big big 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.649
 problem yes for people here in our 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.699
 teacher's career 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.500
 the schools and I see and more and more 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.460
 devaluing there 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.070
 the music also because society is 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.900
 devaluing for even more and more 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:20.180
 is a good musician because that our music 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.180
 is in a completely low zone 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:31.229
 I wanted to take the opportunity of the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.479
 program that I had said that the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.250
 Brazilian equipment is expensive I 'm not 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.270
 jury do not touch more or less like 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.590
 it works nowadays because the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.290
 Brazilian equipment ends up leaving a 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.340
 A little more expensive, I'm sorry for who 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.670
 for all that I said this more on 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.740
 most cases the price up just that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.540
 we like the components right here 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.280
 coming back to the subject is the teacher of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.219
 music for us to solve this 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.540
 problem of devaluation, we have 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.360
 who do not agree to work for less than 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.210
 60% 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.060
 the monthly profit margin because 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.700
 if you do agree to work for 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500
 this margin of profit less than 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.660
 40 30% 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.480
 you will be making life difficult for the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.640
 college wanting 60 and 70 percent 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.150
 percent on top of the school which is a 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.220
 fair price at least in the case of those who 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.820
 does the book itself with 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.440
 approximate more than fair 70 is 60 and 70 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.140
 percent out there 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.000
 It's the big problem, there's a lot of 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.240
 People always want to work for values 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.170
 children and what happens is 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.110
 Know how to pay that you pay more than you pay less 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:51.250
 this is what they are uncomplicated of course 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.700
 Of course there are schools that accept 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.930
 more value the musician's work 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.430
 values ​​the work of the teacher of 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.920
 music in general 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.770
 so this is it guys this video that 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.890
 It was too short to leave you 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:11.459
