00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.360
 hello everyone was just going to do 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.180
 now the mix that you have to put to 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.180
 the honey worms and I thought that you 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.880
 I could be interested because I realize that 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.190
 I do not have any video about it and good 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.540
 I prefer not to raise them because I 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.809
 it seems a little cup 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.660
 are the larvae come out minuscule then 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.570
 you need 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.489
 a pot a very tight container pro 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.290
 clear to be watertight you also need 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.220
 open every day for a while 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.670
 that air and do not suffocate wood and 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.950
 do not rot the inside clear then 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.500
 well I mix everything I do 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.450
 in case you bought the worms if 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.090
 you want to keep them worth keeping them in 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.820
 good condition and sanitos from behind 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.220
 you can put in the fridge so they are 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.140
 more inactive and last longer but also 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.450
 they are going to die and they are going to go 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.240
 thinning then this mixture is for 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.130
 that they can feed themselves and if 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.360
 you decide to raise them because it also serves us 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.229
 logically it's worth I say that I as a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 maximum ring that I'm going to make is 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.380
 just feed them okay and I'll go 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.119
 to go consuming surely that leave the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.240
 I will not throw away the container because 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.550
 there are eggs and things like that and you know if 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.970
 in the end he ended up raising no but it's not the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.970
 idea is worth 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.720
 Well the first thing you need and if it is 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.690
 saved I have taken this amount not 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.140
 I'm going to say amounts in quantities 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.979
 I'm going to mix and see how many 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.360
 and you look at that and then 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.100
 that you need saved from this style 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.260
 mine has a little corn mixture 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.720
 but but good, no need 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.060
 that I already have it mixed like that and not what 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.160
 I was going to separate you also need well 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.680
 logically are uses of honey are 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.620
 they feed on honey from well and from this 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.950
 bar and then you also need glycerin 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.600
 and then natural yeast is worth not seen 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.630
 the chemistry has to be natural 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.080
 baker's yeast and good me 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.080
 we started 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.170
 in a container I'm going to use this 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.409
 let's take a good amount of 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.599
 saved as you see here is worth over 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.030
 saved let's take two tablespoons of 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.030
 yeast 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.540
 I am going to take advantage of this yeast 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.510
 It is very old but instead of pulling 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.599
 Well, I'm going to take advantage of it for this 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.790
 If you purchased a termination 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.790
 undo with the hand and has had 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.910
 on top of this we are going to take two 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.910
 spoonfuls 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.360
 now let's go throwing the honey up 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.819
 that the mixture is sticky but I think 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.140
 that has a certain consistency 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.140
 well you know, seeing 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.820
 You will see how it is going 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.209
 i 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.209
 Y 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.210
 you add a good jet of glycerin 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.710
 well and all this you are mixing and 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.710
 mixing until uniform 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.490
 and well we have everything ready this is 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.430
 the mix that remains and is the one that we're going to 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.680
 add in the container so that it 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.349
 feed and be well healthy igor de teas 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.050
 the bran and honey as I say is the 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.470
 base food 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.659
 the yeast would already be a bit to avoid 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.819
 mushrooms and also to make it work 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:54.000
 better the digestive system at least 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.680
 since read vale and glycerin what 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.159
 It does is moisturize it so it does not dry out 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.759
 before 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:02.610
 and is that these worms are parasites 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.770
 let's say of bee hives and everything 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.879
 this then undoes them like the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.879
 Wax function is worth 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.559
 ah 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.270
 i 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:49.840
 and this is so that with little hands 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.090
 Hell 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.970
 so good I say goodbye here 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.820
 have a good day see you in a 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:12.860
 next video and do not forget to take good care 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.860
 of all your biches bye 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:46.209
 yes a hand because 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.209
 that they have given me
