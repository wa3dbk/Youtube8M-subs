about a bunch of really cool things
inversion<00:00:35.800> is<00:00:35.980> a<00:00:36.040> new<00:00:36.370> game<00:00:36.670> that<00:00:36.700> we<00:00:37.150> have

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
inversion is a new game that we have

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.640 
inversion is a new game that we have
coming<00:00:37.540> out<00:00:37.750> can<00:00:37.990> fill<00:00:38.230> them<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.380> on<00:00:38.440> what's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
coming out can fill them in on what's

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.290 
coming out can fill them in on what's
going<00:00:38.710> on<00:00:38.980> in<00:00:39.040> inversion<00:00:39.400> inversion<00:00:40.180> is<00:00:40.270> a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
going on in inversion inversion is a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.210 
going on in inversion inversion is a
third-person<00:00:40.570> shooter<00:00:41.260> allowing<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:42.040> to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
third-person shooter allowing you to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.310 
third-person shooter allowing you to
command<00:00:42.760> gravity<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.780> comes<00:00:44.020> in<00:00:44.110> three

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
command gravity it comes in three

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.960 
command gravity it comes in three
different<00:00:44.350> ways<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.520> first<00:00:45.730> one<00:00:45.940> is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
different ways and the first one is

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.910 
different ways and the first one is
actually<00:00:46.240> called<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.690> gravel<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.560> graveling

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
actually called the gravel the graveling

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.920 
actually called the gravel the graveling
actually<00:00:48.220> allows<00:00:48.490> you<00:00:48.670> pass<00:00:49.330> two<00:00:49.660> different

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
actually allows you pass two different

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.540 
actually allows you pass two different
settings<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:50.740> allows<00:00:50.980> you<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.280> command

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
settings and it allows you to command

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.340 
settings and it allows you to command
gravity<00:00:52.120> in<00:00:52.270> two<00:00:52.600> different<00:00:52.780> ways<00:00:52.990> so<00:00:53.200> the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
gravity in two different ways so the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.020 
gravity in two different ways so the
first<00:00:53.590> way<00:00:53.740> is<00:00:53.770> actually<00:00:54.220> called<00:00:54.400> low<00:00:54.760> gravity

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
first way is actually called low gravity

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.510 
first way is actually called low gravity
so<00:00:55.930> because<00:00:56.290> we're<00:00:56.440> cover<00:00:56.680> streeter<00:00:57.010> when

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
so because we're cover streeter when

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.590 
so because we're cover streeter when
you're<00:00:57.640> playing<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.940> cover<00:00:58.120> shooting<00:00:58.330> game

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
you're playing the cover shooting game

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.210 
you're playing the cover shooting game
is<00:00:59.170> going<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.350> be<00:00:59.410> that<00:00:59.590> enemy<00:00:59.860> that's<00:01:00.010> hiding

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
is going to be that enemy that's hiding

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.770 
is going to be that enemy that's hiding
behind<00:01:00.400> that<00:01:00.550> box<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.060> you<00:01:01.120> can't<00:01:01.390> quite

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
behind that box and you can't quite

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.180 
behind that box and you can't quite
shoot<00:01:02.170> it's<00:01:02.410> going<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.620> keep<00:01:02.770> popping<00:01:03.070> his

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
shoot it's going to keep popping his

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.590 
shoot it's going to keep popping his
head<00:01:03.220> up<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.550> waving<00:01:03.790> at<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.180> trying<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.479> say

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
head up and waving at you trying to say

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.510 
head up and waving at you trying to say
hi<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.110> instead<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.950> trying<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.189> shoot<00:01:06.369> them

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
hi and instead of trying to shoot them

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.890 
hi and instead of trying to shoot them
what<00:01:07.000> you<00:01:07.090> can<00:01:07.180> do<00:01:07.299> is<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:07.509> can<00:01:07.540> use<00:01:07.780> the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
what you can do is you can use the

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.150 
what you can do is you can use the
gravelly<00:01:08.260> device<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.710> actually<00:01:08.980> lower

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
gravelly device to actually lower

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.550 
gravelly device to actually lower
gravity<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.910> this<00:01:10.600> all<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.930> shoot<00:01:11.230> a<00:01:11.320> blast

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
gravity and this all I you shoot a blast

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.350 
gravity and this all I you shoot a blast
of<00:01:11.680> gravity<00:01:12.070> that's<00:01:12.310> concentrated<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:13.270> a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
of gravity that's concentrated in a

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.660 
of gravity that's concentrated in a
small<00:01:13.390> area<00:01:13.810> it'll<00:01:14.650> actually<00:01:14.740> boost<00:01:15.340> them<00:01:15.520> up

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
small area it'll actually boost them up

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.400 
small area it'll actually boost them up
above<00:01:15.940> cover<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.540> then<00:01:16.720> allow<00:01:16.930> you<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.200> get<00:01:17.320> an

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
above cover and then allow you to get an

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:25.340 
above cover and then allow you to get an
easy<00:01:17.530> shot<00:01:17.830> on<00:01:17.890> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.780 

the<00:01:26.350> graveling<00:01:26.740> also<00:01:27.040> allows<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.610> use

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
the graveling also allows you to use

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.969 
the graveling also allows you to use
high<00:01:28.030> gravity<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:29.170> this<00:01:29.350> is<00:01:29.380> actually<00:01:29.890> the

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
high gravity so this is actually the

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.710 
high gravity so this is actually the
exact<00:01:30.399> opposite<00:01:30.850> this<00:01:31.030> will<00:01:31.180> allow<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.540> to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
exact opposite this will allow you to

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.230 
exact opposite this will allow you to
shoot<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.740> blast<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.280> gravity<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:33.880> actually

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
shoot a blast of gravity that actually

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.969 
shoot a blast of gravity that actually
increases<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.750> weight<00:01:35.020> on<00:01:35.259> objects<00:01:35.829> and

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
increases the weight on objects and

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.060 
increases the weight on objects and
enemies<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:38.020> for<00:01:38.229> example<00:01:38.320> if<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:38.740> shoot<00:01:38.920> this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
enemies so for example if I shoot this

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.710 
enemies so for example if I shoot this
guy<00:01:39.280> with<00:01:39.789> heavy<00:01:40.030> gravity<00:01:40.240> he's<00:01:40.570> actually

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
guy with heavy gravity he's actually

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.450 
guy with heavy gravity he's actually
gonna<00:01:40.899> beep<00:01:41.110> into<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.500> ground<00:01:41.740> he's<00:01:42.130> gonna<00:01:42.280> be

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
gonna beep into the ground he's gonna be

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.399 
gonna beep into the ground he's gonna be
struggling<00:01:42.939> you<00:01:43.119> can<00:01:43.240> see<00:01:43.479> them<00:01:43.600> try<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.080> fight

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
struggling you can see them try to fight

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.600 
struggling you can see them try to fight
and<00:01:44.590> try<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.770> put<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.009> but<00:01:45.189> there's<00:01:45.340> too<00:01:45.490> much

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
and try to put it but there's too much

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.310 
and try to put it but there's too much
weight<00:01:45.820> on<00:01:46.030> him<00:01:46.149> it's<00:01:46.360> essentially<00:01:46.810> doubling

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
weight on him it's essentially doubling

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.469 
weight on him it's essentially doubling

features<00:02:12.069> what<00:02:12.489> we<00:02:12.610> call<00:02:12.790> vector<00:02:13.060> ships

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
features what we call vector ships

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.660 
features what we call vector ships
vector<00:02:13.930> ships<00:02:14.170> are<00:02:14.440> what<00:02:15.010> we<00:02:15.130> use<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.310> really

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
vector ships are what we use to really

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.979 
vector ships are what we use to really
keep<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> player<00:02:16.299> on<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.480> toes<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.720> we're

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
keep the player on the toes and we're

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.330 
keep the player on the toes and we're
kind<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.170> flip<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.500> environment<00:02:17.830> back<00:02:18.160> and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
kind of flip in the environment back and

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.979 
kind of flip in the environment back and
forth<00:02:18.549> so<00:02:18.880> an<00:02:19.030> inversion<00:02:19.299> enemies<00:02:19.810> can

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
forth so an inversion enemies can

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.380 
forth so an inversion enemies can
actually<00:02:20.260> come<00:02:20.410> at<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.709> from<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.970> ceilings

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
actually come at you from the ceilings

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
actually come at you from the ceilings
and<00:02:22.569> they<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.750> come<00:02:22.870> up<00:02:22.900> with<00:02:23.140> from<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.349> wall

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
and they can come up with from the wall

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.340 
and they can come up with from the wall
we<00:02:24.670> got<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.850> bunch<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.269> really<00:02:25.570> cool<00:02:25.870> things<00:02:25.930> to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
we got a bunch of really cool things to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.140 
we got a bunch of really cool things to
share<00:02:26.530> with<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.769> strategies<00:02:27.430> gameplays

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
share with you strategies gameplays

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.970 
share with you strategies gameplays
everything<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.049> need<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.590> know<00:02:29.769> about

everything that you need to know about

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.910 
everything that you need to know about
inversion<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.359> stay<00:02:31.570> tuned<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.049> there's<00:02:32.829> a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
inversion so stay tuned and there's a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:46.190 
inversion so stay tuned and there's a
version<00:02:33.100> 101<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.820> see<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.030> guys<00:02:34.120> later
