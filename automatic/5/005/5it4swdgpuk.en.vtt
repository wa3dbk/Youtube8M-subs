good one I you know might have picked
somebody<00:02:02.430> else<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.119> his<00:02:03.240> choice<00:02:03.469> but

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
somebody else but it was his choice but

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.709 
somebody else but it was his choice but
I<00:02:04.799> think<00:02:05.219> Orange<00:02:05.460> County<00:02:05.700> drums<00:02:05.939> did<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.509> really

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719

I think Orange County drums did a really
good<00:02:06.840> job<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.610> overall<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.270> he

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
good job and I think overall I think he

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.390 
good job and I think overall I think he
deserved<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> win<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
deserved the win so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.270 
deserved the win so
