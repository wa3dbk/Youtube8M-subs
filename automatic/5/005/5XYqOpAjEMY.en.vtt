o7 I believe and it's basically what it

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.880 
o7 I believe and it's basically what it
was<00:00:20.460> revealed<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.119> few<00:00:21.270> days<00:00:21.420> ago<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.020> mod

came out literally an hour ago for me
making<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.010> video<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.820> pretty<00:00:26.970> good

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
making this video so it's pretty good

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570

the<00:00:28.109> shape<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> car<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.130> still<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> same

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the shape of the car is still the same

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.550 
the shape of the car is still the same
as<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.760> 2013<00:00:30.269> cars<00:00:30.720> because<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.140> not<00:00:31.260> really

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
as the 2013 cars because it's not really

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.979 
as the 2013 cars because it's not really
any<00:00:31.679> way<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.920> changing<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> shape<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
any way of changing the shape but the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.870 
any way of changing the shape but the
design<00:00:34.410> still<00:00:34.739> looks<00:00:35.040> pretty<00:00:35.190> good<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.610> helps

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
design still looks pretty good and helps

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.840 
design still looks pretty good and helps
they<00:00:36.420> give<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> 2014<00:00:37.380> look<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.520> engine

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
they give it the 2014 look the engine

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
they give it the 2014 look the engine
sound<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.239> still<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> v8s<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.290> I'm<00:00:40.440> sure

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
sound is still the v8s but I'm sure

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410 
sound is still the v8s but I'm sure
there'll<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> model<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.610> changes<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.180> v6

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
there'll be a model that changes with v6

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.190 
there'll be a model that changes with v6
using<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> classic<00:00:43.710> f1<00:00:44.100> cars<00:00:44.719> but<00:00:45.719> yeah<00:00:45.899> apart
