00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello guys today we will draw 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.780
 a nose in an easy way 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.599
 first draw a triangle 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.940
 more or less narrow depending on the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.740
 width of the nose you want now 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.450
 truncating at the top and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.250
 eliminate that point round the part of 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.250
 down as you see I'm doing it 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.750
 and divided into three is clean 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.150
 the middle part will correspond to the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.630
 tip of the nose now draws a 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.360
 species of eyes 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.340
 what are going to do the nostrils are going to 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.370
 have the form as of an eye as of 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.420
 one line 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.649
 and eliminate the guidelines including 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.510
 the line of the tip of the nose 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.850
 contour 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.780
 the fins of the nose such a form 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.780
 more rounded 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.579
 [Music] 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.380
 better defines the nostrils and the 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.140
 fins of the nose 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.990
 now with your draft softens these two 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.560
 superior lines and even leave it almost 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.560
 printed 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.420
 now let's start shading some 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.240
 arches in the upper part of the nose 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.650
 at the height of the shoulders he faded with 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.270
 my finger this case is something very subtle and 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.539
 He remarked a little more 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.359
 I return to blur 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.840
 I continue shading down uniting 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.149
 this shadow on the tip of the nose 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.039
 I do the same on the other side a shadow 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.039
 straight that is a on the tip of the nose 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.130
 and he blurred it with a brush 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.229
 remarked things are such 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.119
 and the nostrils 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.800
 giving them the best shape 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.980
 1 the shadows up to the fins so not a 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.819
 little bit 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.870
 for you that nadal disappeared as much as 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.760
 he says as he told them he got some lights 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.760
 on top of national things 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.460
 to the sides 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.430
 trying to almost see none 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.270
 Thick line outlining sort and yes 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.270
 I take a light on the board and you're done 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.840
 Chinese 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.630
 we have finished with our nose made 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.180
 in a simple way if it seemed easy 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.430
 and they liked it in the little thumb up 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.380
 subscribe send me your suggestions and 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.850
