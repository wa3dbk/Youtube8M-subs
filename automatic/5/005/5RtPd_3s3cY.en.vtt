trilobal black dub this stuff just

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.550 
trilobal black dub this stuff just
throws<00:01:13.909> light<00:01:14.299> all<00:01:14.570> over<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.990> place<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
yep plain holographic silver tinsel I

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.800 
yep plain holographic silver tinsel I
use<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.010> holographic<00:01:31.490> tinsel<00:01:32.060> in<00:01:32.420> place<00:01:32.659> of

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
use the holographic tinsel in place of

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.110 
use the holographic tinsel in place of
plain<00:01:35.810> tinsel<00:01:36.290> but<00:01:36.950> plain<00:01:37.250> tinsel<00:01:37.640> works<00:01:37.820> too

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
plain tinsel but plain tinsel works too

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.840 
plain tinsel but plain tinsel works too
and<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:42.110> use<00:01:42.320> an<00:01:42.500> English<00:01:42.680> style<00:01:43.100> rib<00:01:43.460> which<00:01:43.700> is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
and I use an English style rib which is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.590 
and I use an English style rib which is
like<00:01:44.030> five<00:01:44.330> turns<00:01:45.520> tinsel<00:01:46.520> evenly<00:01:46.970> spaced<00:01:47.299> up

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
like five turns tinsel evenly spaced up

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.980 
like five turns tinsel evenly spaced up
the<00:01:47.900> body

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.039 

and<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.500> part<00:01:56.799> fairly<00:01:57.670> important<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.420> always

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
and this part fairly important I always

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.039 
and this part fairly important I always
put<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.590> hackle<00:02:00.009> on<00:02:00.130> before<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> wings<00:02:01.049> with

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
put the hackle on before the wings with

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.740 
put the hackle on before the wings with
this<00:02:02.259> style<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.799> a<00:02:02.979> fly<00:02:03.310> for<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.270> very<00:02:04.479> simple

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
this style of a fly for the very simple

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.580 
this style of a fly for the very simple
reason<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:06.869> want<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:10.470> hackle<00:02:11.470> to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
reason that I want the hackle to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.430 
reason that I want the hackle to
actually<00:02:12.010> help<00:02:12.450> spread<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.569> wings<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.080> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
actually help spread the wings and the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.979 
actually help spread the wings and the
hackle<00:02:14.770> again<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.280> I'm<00:02:15.489> just<00:02:15.550> using<00:02:16.030> plain

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
hackle again and I'm just using plain

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.280 
hackle again and I'm just using plain
ordinary<00:02:17.350> everyday<00:02:17.709> wigeon<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:19.020> tied<00:02:20.020> him<00:02:20.170> by

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
ordinary everyday wigeon I tied him by

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:41.360 
ordinary everyday wigeon I tied him by
the<00:02:20.350> tip<00:02:20.680> he<00:02:21.100> clipped<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.580> tip<00:02:21.850> out

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.330 

and<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.450> want<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.840> hackle<00:02:43.319> fairly<00:02:44.190> heavy

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.070 

sounds<00:02:50.340> kind<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.730> counterintuitive<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:51.900> you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
sounds kind of counterintuitive but you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.979 
sounds kind of counterintuitive but you
if<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.800> take<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.459> fairly<00:02:54.090> close<00:02:54.300> look<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:54.840> my

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
if you take a fairly close look for my

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.530 
if you take a fairly close look for my
style<00:02:55.349> of<00:02:55.530> time<00:02:55.830> I'm<00:02:56.400> actually<00:02:56.700> crowding<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
style of time I'm actually crowding the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.369 
style of time I'm actually crowding the
I<00:02:57.620> know<00:02:58.620> wrap<00:02:59.239> of<00:03:00.239> hackle<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:00.900> anything<00:03:01.110> else

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
I know wrap of hackle or anything else

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.059 
I know wrap of hackle or anything else
is<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.799> over<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.250> top<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.519> any<00:03:02.879> other<00:03:03.000> wrap

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
is going over the top of any other wrap

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:19.300 
is going over the top of any other wrap
it's<00:03:05.069> actually<00:03:05.459> going<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:05.849> front<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.209> it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.220 

makes<00:03:20.310> kind<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.850> nifty<00:03:21.270> looking<00:03:21.690> body<00:03:21.900> that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
makes kind of a nifty looking body that

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.520 
makes kind of a nifty looking body that
way<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.430> taking<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:24.120> hen<00:03:25.080> neck<00:03:25.770> grizzly

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
way then I'm taking a hen neck grizzly

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.290 
way then I'm taking a hen neck grizzly
this<00:03:28.530> wing<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:29.010> pair<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.400> grizzly<00:03:29.880> hackle

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
this wing is a pair of grizzly hackle

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.810 
this wing is a pair of grizzly hackle
chips<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.930> what<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.040> want<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.370> do<00:03:32.520> is<00:03:32.670> you

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
chips and what you want to do is you

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.150 
chips and what you want to do is you
want<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.170> lean<00:03:34.170> them<00:03:34.320> up<00:03:34.410> against<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.920> hook

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
want to lean them up against the hook

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.840 
want to lean them up against the hook
and<00:03:35.400> kind<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.910> judge<00:03:36.180> their<00:03:36.710> their<00:03:37.710> their<00:03:38.550> size

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
and kind of judge their their their size

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.140 
and kind of judge their their their size
and<00:03:39.330> then<00:03:39.450> what<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:40.020> little<00:03:40.650> trick<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.310> have

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and then what a little trick I have

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.330 
and then what a little trick I have
learned<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.600> before<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.590> tie<00:03:43.800> em<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.160> to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
learned is that before you tie em in to
