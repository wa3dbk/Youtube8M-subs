slide<00:01:20.709> that<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.279> I'm<00:01:21.490> more<00:01:21.819> used<00:01:21.999> to<00:01:22.149> the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
slide that it is I'm more used to the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.929 
slide that it is I'm more used to the
liner<00:01:22.539> lock<00:01:22.840> now<00:01:23.679> it<00:01:23.889> does<00:01:24.100> keep<00:01:24.340> your<00:01:24.579> fingers

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
liner lock now it does keep your fingers

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.699 
liner lock now it does keep your fingers
away<00:01:24.969> from<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:27.399> path<00:01:27.579> of<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.880> blade<00:01:28.709> but

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
away from the path of the blade but

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:31.379 
away from the path of the blade but
again<00:01:29.979> I<00:01:30.009> just<00:01:30.189> kind<00:01:30.639> of<00:01:30.700> got<00:01:30.759> used<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.299> the

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:31.389 
again I just kind of got used to the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:33.569 
again I just kind of got used to the
liner<00:01:31.630> lock<00:01:31.959> so<00:01:32.319> I<00:01:32.679> don't<00:01:33.100> really<00:01:33.159> have<00:01:33.520> a

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
liner lock so I don't really have a

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.760 
liner lock so I don't really have a
problem<00:01:33.850> with<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.299> yeah<00:01:35.139> like<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:35.529> said<00:01:35.740> just

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
problem with it yeah like I said just

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.080 
problem with it yeah like I said just
preference<00:01:36.310> also<00:01:36.999> the<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:38.229> clip<00:01:38.529> is<00:01:39.090> not

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
preference also the the clip is not

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.529 
preference also the the clip is not
reversible<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.849> not<00:01:42.999> the<00:01:43.389> way<00:01:43.509> I

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
reversible and this is not the way I

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.109 
reversible and this is not the way I
normally<00:01:43.719> carry<00:01:44.349> my<00:01:44.590> blades<00:01:44.889> this<00:01:45.789> is<00:01:45.969> the

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
normally carry my blades this is the

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.089 
normally carry my blades this is the
crucial<00:01:46.420> skyline<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.349> I<00:01:47.409> normally<00:01:47.469> carry

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
crucial skyline that I normally carry

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:54.419 
crucial skyline that I normally carry
bleed<00:01:49.029> point<00:01:49.419> down<00:01:51.179> and<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.279> can<00:01:54.399> see

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
bleed point down and as you can see

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.499 
bleed point down and as you can see
blade<00:01:54.909> points<00:01:55.329> up<00:01:55.509> on<00:01:55.689> this<00:01:55.929> Aegis<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:57.159> that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
blade points up on this Aegis so that

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.379 
blade points up on this Aegis so that
wasn't<00:01:58.509> something<00:01:58.959> that<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.319> enjoyed<00:01:59.770> about<00:01:59.799> it

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:00.389

and a half take a look here yup three
and<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> half<00:02:55.680> very<00:02:56.680> sharp<00:02:57.010> holds<00:02:57.460> its<00:02:57.580> edge

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
and a half very sharp holds its edge

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.650

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
was the aegis let's take a look at a

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.590 
was the aegis let's take a look at a
couple<00:03:48.310> of<00:03:48.580> knives<00:03:48.820> here's<00:03:49.150> my<00:03:49.330> dad's

everyday carry the kershaw blur nothing

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.110 
everyday carry the kershaw blur nothing
seems<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.590> knock<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:54.100> out<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.370> carry<00:03:54.850> other

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
seems to knock that out I carry other

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.560 
seems to knock that out I carry other
knives<00:03:55.450> now<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:56.140> there<00:03:56.970> can<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.060> notice<00:03:58.330> any

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
knives now that there can you notice any

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.830 
knives now that there can you notice any
real<00:03:58.810> difference<00:03:59.080> I<00:04:00.000> was<00:04:01.000> like<00:04:01.210> modern<00:04:01.660> right

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
real difference I was like modern right

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.210 
real difference I was like modern right
there<00:04:02.110> yeah<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:04.390> without<00:04:05.200> tearing<00:04:05.710> up<00:04:06.010> too

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
there yeah so without tearing up too

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.770 
there yeah so without tearing up too
much<00:04:06.370> rope<00:04:06.670> we<00:04:06.820> have<00:04:06.910> some<00:04:07.150> heavier<00:04:07.450> wrote

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
much rope we have some heavier wrote

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.700 
much rope we have some heavier wrote
there<00:04:08.170> my<00:04:09.070> guess<00:04:09.400> is<00:04:09.760> it's<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.840> individual

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
there my guess is it's the individual

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
there my guess is it's the individual
handling<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.000> knife<00:04:14.520> getting<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.700> blade

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
handling of the knife getting the blade

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.120 
handling of the knife getting the blade
right<00:04:18.900> cutting<00:04:19.900> from<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.200> back<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.859> blade

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
right cutting from the back of the blade

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.800 
right cutting from the back of the blade
to<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.609> front<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:25.440> trying<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.560> blur<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
to the front and trying to blur the

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.790 
to the front and trying to blur the
sharpness<00:04:29.230> of<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.590> blade<00:04:31.500> look<00:04:32.500> like<00:04:32.650> you

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
sharpness of the blade look like you

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.080 
sharpness of the blade look like you
might<00:04:32.830> have<00:04:33.010> worked<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.400> little<00:04:33.490> harder<00:04:33.640> on

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
might have worked a little harder on

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.970 
might have worked a little harder on
that<00:04:34.120> they<00:04:34.600> get<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:34.870> little<00:04:35.080> bit<00:04:36.750> yep<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:38.350> on

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
that they get a little bit yep the on

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.090 
that they get a little bit yep the on
the<00:04:39.160> thicker<00:04:39.400> rope<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:40.030> serrations<00:04:40.900> did<00:04:41.860> work

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
the thicker rope the serrations did work

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.130 
the thicker rope the serrations did work
a<00:04:42.220> little<00:04:42.400> bit<00:04:42.610> better<00:04:42.850> they've<00:04:43.330> been<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.570> slow

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
a little bit better they've been a slow

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.230 
a little bit better they've been a slow
one<00:04:44.380> stroke<00:04:44.770> for<00:04:45.040> both<00:04:45.220> all<00:04:45.460> yeah<00:04:45.820> they<00:04:46.030> pop

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
one stroke for both all yeah they pop

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.060 
one stroke for both all yeah they pop
they<00:04:46.510> look<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:47.020> be<00:04:47.080> about<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.530> same<00:04:47.710> length

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
they look to be about the same length

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.650 
they look to be about the same length
blade<00:04:50.370> take<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.400> look<00:04:51.640> here<00:04:51.910> cuz<00:04:52.150> blade<00:04:52.390> length

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
blade take a look here cuz blade length

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.270 
blade take a look here cuz blade length
is<00:04:52.870> going<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.200> make<00:04:53.350> a<00:04:53.380> difference<00:04:53.710> how<00:04:54.070> long

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
is going to make a difference how long

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.460 
is going to make a difference how long
it<00:04:54.430> gets<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.790> rattle<00:04:55.390> right<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.960> longer<00:04:56.290> your

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
it gets a rattle right the longer your

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.190 
it gets a rattle right the longer your
pool<00:04:56.680> on<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:58.000> kershaw<00:04:58.600> blur<00:04:58.630> is<00:04:59.169> a

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
pool on that and kershaw blur is a

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.659 
pool on that and kershaw blur is a
little<00:04:59.500> bit<00:04:59.620> shortage<00:05:00.070> three<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.430> a<00:05:00.460> quarter

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
little bit shortage three and a quarter

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.930 
little bit shortage three and a quarter
of<00:05:00.940> actual<00:05:01.570> blade<00:05:01.780> yeah<00:05:02.500> which<00:05:03.220> that's<00:05:03.580> not

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
of actual blade yeah which that's not

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.430 
of actual blade yeah which that's not
going<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.180> really<00:05:04.210> make<00:05:04.540> that<00:05:04.720> difference<00:05:05.050> but

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
going to really make that difference but

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.380 
going to really make that difference but
one<00:05:05.740> of<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.890> reasons<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.340> blur<00:05:06.580> is<00:05:06.760> biting<00:05:07.210> in

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
one of the reasons the blur is biting in

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.880 
one of the reasons the blur is biting in
it's<00:05:07.840> because<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:08.290> belly<00:05:08.530> but<00:05:08.770> we'll

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
it's because of that belly but we'll

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.180 
it's because of that belly but we'll
discuss<00:05:09.280> that<00:05:09.550> more<00:05:09.880> is<00:05:10.600> that<00:05:11.020> g10<00:05:11.740> on<00:05:11.950> that

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
discuss that more is that g10 on that

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.560 
discuss that more is that g10 on that
sog<00:05:12.970> yes<00:05:13.740> yeah<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:14.950> if<00:05:15.100> not<00:05:15.280> close<00:05:16.180> till<00:05:16.480> it

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
sog yes yeah and if not close till it

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.210 
sog yes yeah and if not close till it
right<00:05:16.750> it's<00:05:16.930> some<00:05:17.140> sort<00:05:17.350> of<00:05:17.470> plastic<00:05:17.980> it's<00:05:18.130> a

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
right it's some sort of plastic it's a

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.430 
right it's some sort of plastic it's a
polymer<00:05:18.700> of<00:05:18.730> some<00:05:19.090> sort<00:05:19.450> and<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:22.110> boy<00:05:23.110> there

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
polymer of some sort and the boy there

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.010 
polymer of some sort and the boy there
that's<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:24.030> anodized<00:05:25.030> aluminum<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.720> believe

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
that's a anodized aluminum I believe

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.400 
that's a anodized aluminum I believe
yeah<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:27.130> it's<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.580> heavier<00:05:27.940> knife<00:05:28.229> so<00:05:29.229> that's

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
yeah so it's a heavier knife so that's

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.440 
yeah so it's a heavier knife so that's
the<00:05:29.590> one<00:05:29.740> thing<00:05:29.979> with<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.340> sog<00:05:30.610> for<00:05:31.060> its<00:05:31.180> size

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
the one thing with the sog for its size

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.420 
the one thing with the sog for its size
it<00:05:31.960> doesn't<00:05:32.350> have<00:05:32.410> as<00:05:32.620> much<00:05:32.770> weight<00:05:33.100> now

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
it doesn't have as much weight now

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.120 
it doesn't have as much weight now
that's<00:05:33.790> true<00:05:34.030> yeah<00:05:34.540> now<00:05:35.229> trust<00:05:35.590> me<00:05:35.710> this<00:05:35.890> is<00:05:36.010> in

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
that's true yeah now trust me this is in

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.920 
that's true yeah now trust me this is in
a<00:05:36.220> comparison<00:05:36.910> between<00:05:36.940> these<00:05:37.540> two<00:05:37.750> knives

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930
