 'Cause I'm singing because everything was his song 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:40.980
 I was thrown away by my partner composer, and there were those who abandoned me 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.489
 Many songs just follow the melody 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.970

 I don't think there's any fear of being intercepted. 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.659
 Don't be jealous of being taken over 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:23.920
 I 'm not determined to 4 grams 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.100
 My beloved person's name is Verdy because I will curse if I betray 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.490

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.050

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.050

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:45.560
 I used to take on the floating air of this city 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:50.360
 Staged Why'll let you tell why you ran away 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.590

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.689
 Officials meeting of the so? Olga bought this 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.689
 Do you not know where the girlfriend is 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.180
 Then 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.659
 Women's Masu wear in anticipation of people who say you 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:12.420
 Actually I am a lover 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:18.599
 It's a room or a true story that says good lies I'm Belgium

 Is the composer all have within vowed to love forever, but I can not Kaomuke now

 It 's been 354 songs waiting to lose the score of the 354 song title written to give to her 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.170
 Did you compose so much 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.720
 Because I have been dating for many years, I do not like the idea well 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.910
 No matter what 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.600
 Music comes down from the invisible world just thinking of her 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.430
 It means prefecture bonds 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.299
 Is it natural 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.780
 However , an arm is set in our love 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:57.180
 I 've been robbed of the music of the song with love 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:05.069
 So you know what you want to ask you 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:07.790

 I'm an argument but 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.240
 If you call a pharmacy 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.810

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.610
 It's absolutely not so good to say back 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.610
 It was put to him of the store 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.930
 You are a musician 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.870

 The recovered bag was still one of Belgium 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.400
 It seems that there is a spot on the song he has dedicated to his lover 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.509
 I Come I guess that what song 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.509
 Deliver it quickly 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.020
 The composer of Belgium is an area of pleasure 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.020
 You should be in front of the fountain 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.210

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.029
 Shake my soul 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:18.520

 Thanks for returning him unscathed The artist is delicate and vulnerable 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.120
 The treatment is wildly for that 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:29.560
 It's that kind of love 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:34.300
 Well then I'll gift a special song that sounds to you 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.629
 I'm listening to the request, I sing because it sounds to me 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:43.240
 I was not a bad song as I 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:45.569
 Verdi's song is better at all, but I love it 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.129
 I say he 's sleeping 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.320
