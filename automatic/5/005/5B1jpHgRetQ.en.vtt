stock<00:02:29.319> now<00:02:30.319> we<00:02:30.380> have<00:02:30.800> dashi<00:02:31.790> stock<00:02:32.000> kombu<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
stock now we have dashi stock kombu and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.000 
stock now we have dashi stock kombu and
cut<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.130> she<00:02:34.190> does<00:02:34.640> she<00:02:34.819> stuck<00:02:35.090> here<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:36.010> will

cut so she does she stuck here and will

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.790 
cut so she does she stuck here and will
comment<00:02:37.250> it's<00:02:37.880> been<00:02:38.090> reconstituted<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.739> you

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
comment it's been reconstituted so you

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.729 
comment it's been reconstituted so you
see<00:02:40.130> quite<00:02:40.430> nice<00:02:40.610> green<00:02:41.360> color<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:42.020> the

see quite nice green color of the

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.250 
see quite nice green color of the
becoming<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.030> we<00:02:44.209> just<00:02:44.420> strain<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> water<00:02:47.260> so

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
becoming so we just strain a water so

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.080 
becoming so we just strain a water so
now<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:49.130> dashi<00:02:49.400> stock<00:02:50.140> start<00:02:51.140> boiling<00:02:52.090> then

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
now the dashi stock start boiling then

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.250 
now the dashi stock start boiling then
