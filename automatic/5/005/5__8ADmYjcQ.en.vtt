days<00:00:44.850> yeah<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.210> three<00:00:45.690> games<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.260> today<00:00:47.039> so

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
days yeah like three games on today so

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.490 
days yeah like three games on today so
I'm<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.090> quite<00:00:48.390> sure<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I'm not quite sure how this is going to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
I'm not quite sure how this is going to
work<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.670> no<00:00:51.180> default<00:00:51.719> system

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
work and that one is no default system

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.830 
work and that one is no default system
with<00:00:52.350> white<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.100> days<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:54.210> default

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
with white for two days I think default

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.900 
with white for two days I think default
system<00:00:55.199> probably<00:00:55.680> includes<00:00:56.190> an<00:00:56.340> idea<00:00:56.610> three

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
system probably includes an idea three

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.040 
system probably includes an idea three
and<00:00:57.680> maybe<00:00:58.680> even<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.309> c4<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> guess<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and maybe even one c4 so I guess it's a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.979 
and maybe even one c4 so I guess it's a
four<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.530> other<00:01:02.000> obscure<00:01:03.000> moves<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.870> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
four or other obscure moves if I it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
four or other obscure moves if I it's
not<00:01:04.080> obscure<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.949> let's<00:01:05.640> say<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:06.060> three

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
not obscure but like let's say be three

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.679 
not obscure but like let's say be three
or<00:01:06.570> before<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:07.080> whatever<00:01:07.350> um<00:01:08.540> yeah<00:01:09.540> yeah
