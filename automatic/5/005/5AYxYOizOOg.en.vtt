00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
batteries and one thing I just want to

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.730 
batteries and one thing I just want to
point<00:01:26.150> out<00:01:28.060> inside<00:01:29.080> there's<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.170> wall<00:01:30.530> right

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
point out inside there's a wall right

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.090 
point out inside there's a wall right
here<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:32.690> battery<00:01:33.020> is<00:01:33.110> located<00:01:33.409> in<00:01:33.830> here

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
here and the battery is located in here

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.710 
here and the battery is located in here
see<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.729> wire<00:01:34.880> comes<00:01:35.149> out<00:01:35.299> right<00:01:35.450> here<00:01:37.720> you

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
see the wire comes out right here you

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.389 
see the wire comes out right here you
see<00:01:38.869> inside<00:01:39.259> is<00:01:39.409> much<00:01:39.649> smaller<00:01:40.039> than<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
see inside is much smaller than the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.969 
see inside is much smaller than the
single<00:01:41.270> box<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.810> alpha<00:01:42.110> box<00:01:42.320> versions<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.890> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
single box and alpha box versions of the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:55.350 
single box and alpha box versions of the
8080<00:01:43.399> Walker

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.930 

this<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.140> control<00:01:56.440> they<00:01:56.620> give<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.940> they

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
this is the control they give you they

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.430 
this is the control they give you they
have<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.090> picture<00:01:58.420> of<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.780> snow<00:01:58.960> speeder<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:02.320> the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
have a picture of a snow speeder see the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.590 
have a picture of a snow speeder see the
crosshair<00:02:04.620> and<00:02:05.620> you<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.920> go<00:02:06.040> up<00:02:06.250> or<00:02:06.370> down<00:02:06.430> a

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.860 

forward<00:02:10.600> or<00:02:10.690> back<00:02:10.899> actually<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:13.750> is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
forward or back actually and this is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:03:04.210 
forward or back actually and this is
kind<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.200> noisy<00:02:14.590> but<00:02:14.770> it's<00:02:14.890> still<00:02:15.010> pretty<00:02:15.160> cool

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.150 

so<00:03:05.220> yeah<00:03:05.430> that's<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.820> action<00:03:06.270> fleet

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
so yeah that's the action fleet

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.180 
so yeah that's the action fleet

electronic Imperial hcet Walker overall

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.270 
electronic Imperial hcet Walker overall
I'd<00:03:11.310> probably<00:03:11.460> give<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.790> about<00:03:12.650> maybe<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.770> seven

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
I'd probably give it about maybe a seven

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.570 
I'd probably give it about maybe a seven
and<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> half<00:03:14.460> I<00:03:15.890> like<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> concept<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.490> they

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
and a half I like the concept that they

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.500 
and a half I like the concept that they
tried<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.820> do<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.150> it

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
tried to do with it

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.660 
tried to do with it
it's<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.410> little<00:03:19.770> noisy<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.190> think<00:03:20.460> they<00:03:20.520> could

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
it's a little noisy I think they could

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.720 
it's a little noisy I think they could
have<00:03:20.760> improved<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.240> that<00:03:21.270> part<00:03:21.720> though

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
have improved on that part though

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.910 
have improved on that part though
there's<00:03:23.730> also<00:03:23.880> another<00:03:24.150> version<00:03:24.360> out<00:03:24.690> there

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
there's also another version out there

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.980 
there's also another version out there
that<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.430> controller<00:03:26.850> they<00:03:27.660> give<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.900> a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
that on the controller they give you a

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.400 
that on the controller they give you a
third<00:03:28.200> button<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.030> makes<00:03:30.180> movie<00:03:30.900> noises<00:03:31.290> I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
third button and it makes movie noises I

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.560 
third button and it makes movie noises I
guess<00:03:31.620> I'm<00:03:32.370> still<00:03:32.670> not<00:03:32.850> sure<00:03:32.910> on<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:33.270> one<00:03:33.420> I

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
guess I'm still not sure on that one I

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.720 
guess I'm still not sure on that one I
have<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.810> look<00:03:33.960> into<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.520> but<00:03:35.520> you<00:03:35.580> know

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
have to look into it but you know

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.830 
have to look into it but you know
probably<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.180> seven<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.570> half<00:03:36.600> would<00:03:36.780> be

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
probably on a seven and a half would be

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.130 
probably on a seven and a half would be
good<00:03:37.080> on<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:38.270> so<00:03:39.270> again<00:03:39.540> that's<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.870> action

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
good on this so again that's the action

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.440 
good on this so again that's the action
