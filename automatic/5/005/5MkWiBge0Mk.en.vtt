00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.370
 the bible says that precious treasure and 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.160
 oil is in the house of the wise plus the 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:35.690
 foolish man dispels everything 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.930
 this means that for God came out is 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.579
 who has good things at home because 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:47.469
 he knows how to save and save 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:50.979
 and the fool is that he does not save money 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.060
 everything you earn and in whose house you are missing 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:57.330
 desirable things 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.040
 it's like the saying at home where 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.980
 lack of bread 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.310
 everyone claims and nobody has 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310
 reason 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.760
 but because some families achieve 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.360
 form a reserve fund and other 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.950
 they have so much difficulty for that the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.740
 ability to economize is 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.260
 related among other things with 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.500
 family mandates many people 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.170
 Unconsciously adopt models 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.770
 to economize or spend that exist in 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.750
 the family of origin in some families 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.410
 the demonstrations of affection or the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.350
 search for satisfaction are linked to 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.630
 expenses 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.479
 something else related to the ability of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.150
 economize is the development of the domain 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.420
 own being maybe researchers 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.119
 They offered a chocolate to children of the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.479
 initial degrees with the promise that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.020
 those who waited 20 minutes to eat 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.380
 I would earn it in a second bonus 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.469
 the very few who waited were 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.189
 he followed up for about 30 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:11.410
 years and compared them with those who had 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.570
 immediately eaten the first chocolate 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.870
 the researchers discovered that 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.100
 among those who knew how to wait was 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.950
 elevated way the highest percentage of 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.550
 professional success people 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.450
 liberal judges athletes scientists 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.300
 and others 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.360
 the difficulty to postpone the 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.870
 satisfaction of wishes to live together 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.140
 with immediate losses in exchange for 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.019
 major assets in the future will affect 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.310
 only pocket economies like the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.880
 marriage and the family 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.060
 so that he did not learn self - control in 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.410
 childhood the fight will be much greater 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.660
 now but this is a matter of 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.070
 sentence 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.250
 Paul said everything I can in Christ that 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.250
 it makes me stronger 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:15.340
 what are other reasons to economize 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.470
 the unforeseen events that really should 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.410
 called planned 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:27.630
 pregnancy taxes fines surgery 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.690
 disability moving unemployment unemployment 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.390
 Death arrangement of the automobile are 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.080
 just some of these unforeseen events that 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.240
 they are expected to stop counting on them 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.390
 it's madness 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.780
 and how about buying put off or getting a 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.170
 loan as you need to have 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.020
 the contingencies in your budget do not 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.880
 can compromise the entire eventual surplus 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.190
 in loans it is much better to economize 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.430
 save receive money interests 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.410
 inverted and then with all the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:13.460
 security and self-esteem in high 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:18.739
 buy proudly in plain sight and with 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:22.490
 discount that way you always go 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.700
 to lend yourself from your fund of 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.120
 reserve and return to the fund as 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.810
 fast possible 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.330
 but if in the middle of the road it appears 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.720
 a good business you can choose 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.229
 reevaluate your priorities and take advantage 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.889
 the opportunity who has money makes 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.919
 good business that has no pay anymore 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.729
 clear when you need the good or the 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.050
 service 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:56.539
 now what to do if you just 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.110
 receive a floor and want to start a 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.889
 reserve fund a saving 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.320
 first 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:11.040
 I always calculated the total of entries 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.800
 know how much you earn is very important 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.800
 incredible as it may seem to some 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.250
 people do not know exactly how much 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.230
 win others confuse the gross with the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.160
 liquid 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.160
 second 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.900
 father and I delivered the god part with what 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.229
 that goodbye first before 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.480
 any expense adoring it with 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.409
 tithes and offerings 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.800
 third 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:48.610
 stop and apply to the reserve fund or 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.519
 savings save that money at the beginning 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.909
 of the month before any other expense is 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:56.860
 maybe the most important suggestion 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:06:00.129
 for those who want to start with their feet 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.939
 right remove that money from your sight or 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:07.139
 of your account because money never goes too much 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:09.590
 if people do not do it over 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:14.990
 and now fourth 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:16.270
 Now what's left over is what you can 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.090
 spend 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.480
 this is the money that you really 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.160
 have for expenses and to spend the 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.440
 month 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.010
 some very economizing people 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.090
 because they never want to lose forever 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:38.860
 who are wanting to win but who want 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:41.110
 save will have to lose in quotes 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.670
 some things that I was already 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.190
 used to it can be a way out 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.910
 weekly to a restaurant buy a 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:52.810
 Newer clothes or car or even a trip 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.300
 but there is no price too high 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.849
 for safety and positive self-esteem 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.300
 that a reserve fund can generate 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:04.690
 the word of God says 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:11.310
 better is the little with the fear of jehovah 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:11.310
 that the great treasure where there is disturbance 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.700
 wants the help of the Lord to start 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:20.449
 a reserve fund 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:23.260
 needs more self-control 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.720
 bend your knees now 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.070
 and give your financial life to God 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:33.010
 tell him that you recognize him as 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:36.940
 owner of everything he has and ask him for his 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:40.170
 help to manage what is his and 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.170
 which is in your hands 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.160
 recognize it 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.880
 in all your ways 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.909
 and interest will do 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:54.740
 your paths 

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:54.740
 blessings for your family
