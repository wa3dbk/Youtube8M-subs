as it being DeMarco Murray running the
football<00:04:02.610> has<00:04:03.000> helped<00:04:03.239> this<00:04:03.480> defense<00:04:03.900> because

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
football has helped this defense because

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.110 
football has helped this defense because
they<00:04:04.290> move<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> change<00:04:04.950> they<00:04:05.400> definitely<00:04:05.790> are
