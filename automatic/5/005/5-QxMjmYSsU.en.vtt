00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
here okay so that actually takes them a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
here okay so that actually takes them a
bit<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.840> time<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.380> react<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.040> kind<00:01:53.100> of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
bit of time to react to that kind of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
bit of time to react to that kind of
thing<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.840> I'm<00:01:54.899> gonna<00:01:54.990> be

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
thing and I don't think I'm gonna be

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.780 
thing and I don't think I'm gonna be
able<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> win<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.860> point<00:01:56.159> might<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.700> well

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
able to win at this point might as well

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.459 
able to win at this point might as well
Reese<00:01:57.030> try<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> stage<00:01:57.689> right<00:01:57.990> away<00:01:58.259> I'm

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
Reese try to stage right away I'm

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.139 
Reese try to stage right away I'm
figuring<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.820> extremely

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
figuring that it's going to be extremely

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.609 
figuring that it's going to be extremely
hard<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> sense<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.049> you're<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.380> even

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
hard in the sense that you're not even

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.840 
hard in the sense that you're not even
going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.950> able<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.159> win<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.670> hit

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
going to be able to win if you get hit

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 
going to be able to win if you get hit
once<00:02:03.210> which<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.049> pretty<00:02:04.530> ridiculous

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
once which is pretty ridiculous

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.319 
once which is pretty ridiculous
considering<00:02:05.399> you'd<00:02:05.610> think<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.000> would<00:02:06.210> be

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
considering you'd think that would be

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.510 
considering you'd think that would be
the<00:02:06.450> condition<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.110> something<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.220> getting

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the condition for something like getting

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.760 
the condition for something like getting
a<00:02:08.610> platinum<00:02:09.119> medal

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
a platinum medal

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.740 
a platinum medal
not<00:02:10.130> apparently<00:02:10.910> platinum<00:02:11.330> metals<00:02:11.570> are<00:02:11.720> the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
not apparently platinum metals are the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.570 
not apparently platinum metals are the
tip<00:02:11.990> of<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.170> iceberg<00:02:12.590> with<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.310> by<00:02:13.460> that

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
tip of the iceberg with this and by that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.130 
tip of the iceberg with this and by that
I<00:02:13.610> mean<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.970> non<00:02:14.150> tip<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.570> iceberg<00:02:14.930> can

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
I mean the non tip of the iceberg can

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.380 
I mean the non tip of the iceberg can
you<00:02:15.500> know<00:02:15.590> tip<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> iceberg<00:02:16.670> by<00:02:17.210> that<00:02:17.360> I

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
you know tip of the iceberg by that I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.670 
you know tip of the iceberg by that I
mean<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> tip<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.050> iceberg<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.440> that's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
mean the tip of the iceberg I that's

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.660 
mean the tip of the iceberg I that's
what<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.860> meant

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
what I meant

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.940 
what I meant
as<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.240> didn't<00:02:20.450> know<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.720> at<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:20.870> point<00:02:21.349> kill

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
as you didn't know it at that point kill

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.680 
as you didn't know it at that point kill
this<00:02:22.190> thing<00:02:22.250> kill<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:22.970> thing<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.450> keep

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
this thing kill that thing and keep

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.020 
this thing kill that thing and keep
going<00:02:23.989> you<00:02:24.739> know<00:02:24.770> what<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.010> do<00:02:25.130> think<00:02:25.610> indeed

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
going you know what I do think indeed

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.970 
going you know what I do think indeed
that<00:02:26.239> fighter<00:02:26.480> Kirby<00:02:26.870> might<00:02:27.170> be<00:02:27.380> one<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.830> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
that fighter Kirby might be one of the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.770 
that fighter Kirby might be one of the
Kirby's<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:28.819> going<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.300> cause<00:02:29.510> more

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
Kirby's that is going to cause more

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.870 
Kirby's that is going to cause more
trouble<00:02:29.959> than<00:02:30.230> he's<00:02:30.380> gonna<00:02:30.500> do<00:02:30.709> good<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.310> could

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
trouble than he's gonna do good I could

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.370 
trouble than he's gonna do good I could
have<00:02:31.970> got<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.120> gold<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.870> know<00:02:32.989> getting

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
have got that gold but you know getting

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.559 
have got that gold but you know getting
the<00:02:33.410> gold<00:02:33.709> things<00:02:33.980> are<00:02:34.250> really<00:02:34.459> not<00:02:34.580> the

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
the gold things are really not the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.300 
the gold things are really not the
extreme<00:02:35.989> importance<00:02:36.470> here<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.709> think<00:02:37.160> it's

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
extreme importance here I think it's

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.090 
extreme importance here I think it's
more<00:02:37.670> about<00:02:37.819> beating<00:02:38.360> him<00:02:38.840> oh<00:02:39.020> crap<00:02:39.590> see<00:02:39.890> yeah

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
more about beating him oh crap see yeah

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.770 
more about beating him oh crap see yeah
he<00:02:40.130> does<00:02:40.459> go<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> lot<00:02:41.150> faster<00:02:41.390> than<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.720> one

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
he does go a lot faster than this one

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.949 
he does go a lot faster than this one
and<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.770> whoa<00:02:43.160> whoa<00:02:43.850> whoa<00:02:44.120> whoa<00:02:44.360> whoa<00:02:44.660> whoa

and that whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.000 
and that whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
that<00:02:45.860> was<00:02:46.010> not<00:02:46.160> funny<00:02:47.290> all<00:02:48.290> right<00:02:48.350> Maggie<00:02:48.800> lore

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
that was not funny all right Maggie lore

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.199 
that was not funny all right Maggie lore
wants<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.310> play<00:02:49.489> dirty<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.880> guess<00:02:50.060> we're<00:02:50.180> just

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
wants to play dirty I guess we're just

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.410 
wants to play dirty I guess we're just
gonna<00:02:50.390> have<00:02:50.599> to<00:02:50.630> clean<00:02:51.110> up<00:02:51.140> his<00:02:51.560> act<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:53.390> know

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
gonna have to clean up his act you know

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.120 
gonna have to clean up his act you know
that<00:02:53.660> pun<00:02:53.870> made<00:02:54.080> sense<00:02:54.380> but<00:02:54.620> then<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.800> realized

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
that pun made sense but then I realized

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.620 
that pun made sense but then I realized
that<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.430> water<00:02:55.610> Kirby<00:02:56.000> wasn't<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.300> part<00:02:56.510> of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
that the water Kirby wasn't a part of

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.750 
that the water Kirby wasn't a part of
the<00:02:56.690> choices<00:02:57.080> anyways<00:02:58.010> we're<00:02:58.430> going<00:02:58.640> to

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
the choices anyways we're going to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.940 
the choices anyways we're going to
continue<00:02:59.000> on<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.450> way<00:02:59.530> run<00:03:00.530> over<00:03:00.799> these

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
continue on this way run over these

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.410 
continue on this way run over these
things<00:03:01.190> this<00:03:01.310> time<00:03:01.370> because<00:03:01.790> I'm<00:03:01.910> pretty<00:03:02.269> sure

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
things this time because I'm pretty sure

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.539 
things this time because I'm pretty sure
that<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.690> what<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.380> are<00:03:03.500> expected<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.100> do<00:03:04.370> with

that is what you are expected to do with

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.059 
that is what you are expected to do with

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
not I implore you to do that is what I'm

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.170 
not I implore you to do that is what I'm
trying<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.310> say<00:03:07.459> because<00:03:07.670> they're<00:03:07.880> also<00:03:08.000> gonna

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
trying to say because they're also gonna

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.820 
trying to say because they're also gonna
get<00:03:08.420> hit<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.900> guy's<00:03:09.110> still<00:03:09.500> going

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
get hit and this guy's still going

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.800 
get hit and this guy's still going
ridiculously<00:03:10.549> fast<00:03:10.819> regardless<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.600> whether

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
ridiculously fast regardless of whether

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.390 
ridiculously fast regardless of whether
or<00:03:11.870> not<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.080> did<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.500> right<00:03:12.709> or<00:03:12.890> wrong<00:03:13.040> so

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
or not I did that right or wrong so

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.020 
or not I did that right or wrong so
perhaps<00:03:13.760> there<00:03:13.970> was<00:03:14.150> no<00:03:14.330> right<00:03:14.540> no<00:03:14.780> wrong<00:03:15.080> just
