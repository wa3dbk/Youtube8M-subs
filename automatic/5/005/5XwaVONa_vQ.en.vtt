spoiler<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.509> make<00:01:33.659> sure<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
spoiler to make sure that we get the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.679 
spoiler to make sure that we get the
right<00:01:35.189> aerodynamics<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.450> fine

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
right aerodynamics but that's fine

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.149 
right aerodynamics but that's fine
that's<00:01:36.900> modern<00:01:37.259> technology<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> works

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that's modern technology and it works

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.399 
that's modern technology and it works
now<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.299> come<00:01:39.450> into<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.810> back<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> car

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
now as we come into the back of the car

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
now as we come into the back of the car
the<00:01:40.560> thing<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.799> love<00:01:41.009> about<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.310> car<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.119> as

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the thing I love about this car is as

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.350 
the thing I love about this car is as
much<00:01:42.509> form<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> profile<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.729> there

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
much form in the in the profile as there

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.880 
much form in the in the profile as there
is<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> plan<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.140> very<00:01:46.500> very

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
is in the plan it's very very

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
is in the plan it's very very
three-dimensional<00:01:47.220> all<00:01:48.149> Jagger's<00:01:48.840> must<00:01:49.110> be

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
three-dimensional all Jagger's must be

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.389 
three-dimensional all Jagger's must be
very<00:01:49.439> three-dimensional<00:01:49.680> they're<00:01:50.159> about<00:01:50.340> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
very three-dimensional they're about a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
very three-dimensional they're about a
complete<00:01:50.850> shape<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
complete shape and then just to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.899 
complete shape and then just to
emphasize<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.799> beautiful<00:01:53.399> tail<00:01:53.610> lamps

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
emphasize that with beautiful tail lamps

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.160 
emphasize that with beautiful tail lamps
I<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> say<00:01:54.299> we're<00:01:54.509> very<00:01:54.540> proud<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.990> these

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
I have to say we're very proud of these

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
I have to say we're very proud of these
lamps<00:01:55.409> we've<00:01:55.649> worked<00:01:55.860> very<00:01:56.100> hard<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
lamps we've worked very hard to get the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.660 
lamps we've worked very hard to get the
lamps<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.509> slim<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.079> possible<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.799> can't<00:01:59.490> think

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
lamps to slim as possible I can't think

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.100 
lamps to slim as possible I can't think
of<00:01:59.729> any<00:01:59.880> lamps<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.390> slimmer<00:02:00.719> these<00:02:00.930> in

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
of any lamps that are slimmer these in

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.060 
of any lamps that are slimmer these in
any<00:02:01.200> car<00:02:01.530> today

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
any car today

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.490 
any car today
and<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.750> gives<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.079> emphases

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and I think it just gives the emphases

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.990 
and I think it just gives the emphases
that<00:02:04.530> width<00:02:04.950> across<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.430> back<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> car

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that width across the back of the car

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.459 
that width across the back of the car
when<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.299> see<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> planted<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> road

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
when you see it planted in the road

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.469 
when you see it planted in the road
because<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.310> rear<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.700> car<00:02:08.970> has<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> lot

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
because the rear of this car has a lot

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.050 
because the rear of this car has a lot
of<00:02:09.660> presence<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.170> lot<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.500> power<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.940> always

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
of presence a lot of power and I always

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.309 
of presence a lot of power and I always
say<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> back<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.780> Jag<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.140> very

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
say in the back of a Jag is very

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.420 
say in the back of a Jag is very
important<00:02:13.709> because<00:02:13.800> that's<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.129> part<00:02:14.280> you're

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
important because that's the part you're

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.339 
important because that's the part you're
gonna<00:02:14.550> see<00:02:14.730> more<00:02:14.910> stuff<00:02:15.180> frankly<00:02:15.660> as<00:02:16.200> it

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
gonna see more stuff frankly as it

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.350 
gonna see more stuff frankly as it
overtakes<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.849> come<00:02:18.000> down<00:02:18.030> we've

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
overtakes you as you come down we've

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.059 
overtakes you as you come down we've
slimmed<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> master<00:02:19.200> here<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.800> cuts

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
slimmed out the master here it cuts

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.640 
slimmed out the master here it cuts
under<00:02:20.489> quite<00:02:21.030> unusual<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.660> modern<00:02:21.959> car<00:02:22.170> we

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
under quite unusual for a modern car we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.720 
under quite unusual for a modern car we
accept<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> fact<00:02:23.069> they<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.520> bumper

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
accept the fact they have a bumper

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.580 
accept the fact they have a bumper
offset<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:24.870> culminates<00:02:25.410> this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
offset and that all culminates this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.440 
offset and that all culminates this
beautiful<00:02:25.980> shape<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.400> then<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.970> twin<00:02:27.209> tail

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
beautiful shape and then the twin tail

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.930 
beautiful shape and then the twin tail
like<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> twin<00:02:28.410> exhaust<00:02:28.770> pipes<00:02:29.040> at<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> back

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
like the twin exhaust pipes at the back

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.180 
like the twin exhaust pipes at the back
again<00:02:30.900> slightly<00:02:31.200> reminiscent<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
again slightly reminiscent of that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.460 
again slightly reminiscent of that
Jaguar<00:02:32.849> e-type<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.510> many<00:02:33.629> years<00:02:33.810> ago<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.290> a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
Jaguar e-type and many years ago but a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.580 
Jaguar e-type and many years ago but a
lot<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.069> character<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:36.540> v8<00:02:36.750> gets<00:02:37.080> quite<00:02:37.319> pipes

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
lot of character the v8 gets quite pipes

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.990 
lot of character the v8 gets quite pipes
in<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.769> back<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.190> distinguishes<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.819> car

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
in the back it distinguishes the car

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000 
in the back it distinguishes the car
slightly<00:02:39.239> more<00:02:39.480> differently<00:02:39.900> but<00:02:40.470> both<00:02:40.709> cars

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
slightly more differently but both cars

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.530 
slightly more differently but both cars
equal<00:02:41.459> amount<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.760> character<00:02:42.150> because<00:02:42.420> of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
equal amount of character because of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
equal amount of character because of
that<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:43.440> wanted<00:02:43.800> something<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.190> very

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
that we wanted something that's very

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.790 
that we wanted something that's very

where they should be or not we decided

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.290 
where they should be or not we decided
the<00:03:22.680> sports<00:03:22.950> car<00:03:23.190> should<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.519> analog<00:03:23.940> dials

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
the sports car should have analog dials

the sports car should have analog dials
and<00:03:24.420> not<00:03:24.510> digital<00:03:24.900> dials<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.440> then<00:03:26.040> just

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and not digital dials and then just

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.250 
and not digital dials and then just
finally<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.909> mention<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.299> hood<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
finally I have to mention the hood the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.740 
finally I have to mention the hood the
hood<00:03:28.290> or<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.680> roof<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.670> store<00:03:30.090> weights<00:03:30.330> it

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
hood or the roof is store weights it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.280 
hood or the roof is store weights it
takes<00:03:31.560> up<00:03:31.680> minimal<00:03:31.830> space<00:03:32.220> because<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.060> says

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
takes up minimal space because it says

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.199 
takes up minimal space because it says
what<00:03:34.290> we<00:03:34.319> call<00:03:34.530> zed<00:03:34.830> fault<00:03:35.129> hood<00:03:35.340> z-fold<00:03:35.970> hood

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
what we call zed fault hood z-fold hood

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.050 
what we call zed fault hood z-fold hood
and<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:37.440> comes<00:03:37.680> up<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:38.010> 12<00:03:38.310> seconds<00:03:38.790> flat<00:03:39.000> and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
and it comes up in 12 seconds flat and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.580 
and it comes up in 12 seconds flat and
you<00:03:39.330> can<00:03:39.420> actually<00:03:39.569> use<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:39.959> October<00:03:40.319> at<00:03:40.379> 30

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you can actually use it October at 30

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.470 
you can actually use it October at 30
miles<00:03:40.830> an<00:03:40.980> hour<00:03:41.129> which<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.700> great<00:03:42.060> plus<00:03:42.299> if

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480
