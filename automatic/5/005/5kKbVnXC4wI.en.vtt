00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
acrylic quite close to the cuticle area

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.940 
acrylic quite close to the cuticle area
some<00:01:56.700> people<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.540> further<00:01:57.810> down<00:01:58.110> that

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
some people have it further down that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.039 
some people have it further down that
way<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.399> safety<00:01:59.759> drill<00:02:00.240> bit<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.600> come<00:02:00.930> in

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
way the safety drill bit will come in

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.320 
way the safety drill bit will come in
handy<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.009> me<00:02:02.220> having<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.880> close<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
handy but with me having it so close to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.510 
handy but with me having it so close to
the<00:02:03.479> edge<00:02:03.600> I've<00:02:04.080> tried<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> drip<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> safety

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the edge I've tried to drip the safety

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.039 
the edge I've tried to drip the safety
ones<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.909> they<00:02:05.970> don't<00:02:06.180> work<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.390> me<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.720> can't

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
ones and they don't work for me I can't

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.740 
ones and they don't work for me I can't
get<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> good<00:02:07.530> enough<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.459> file<00:02:08.789> around<00:02:09.300> the
