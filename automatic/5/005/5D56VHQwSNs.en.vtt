been<00:02:11.269> put<00:02:11.569> as<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> real<00:02:11.989> person<00:02:12.290> on<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> front

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
been put as a real person on the front

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.160 
been put as a real person on the front
and<00:02:13.489> then<00:02:13.579> on<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.819> back<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.989> real

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and then on the back it's not a real

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.140 
and then on the back it's not a real
person<00:02:15.409> it's<00:02:15.860> like<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.099> cartoon<00:02:16.430> kind<00:02:16.879> of<00:02:16.970> thing

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
illustrated version which is kind of a

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.360 
illustrated version which is kind of a
shame<00:04:28.270> but<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:29.140> illustrated<00:04:29.710> version<00:04:29.740> was<00:04:30.130> so

so<00:04:30.610> expensive<00:04:31.120> amazon<00:04:31.540> actually<00:04:31.840> i<00:04:31.870> was<00:04:31.990> quite

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
so expensive amazon actually i was quite

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.630 
so expensive amazon actually i was quite
surprised<00:04:32.740> by<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:32.980> price<00:04:33.340> especially

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
surprised by the price especially

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.220 
surprised by the price especially
considering<00:04:34.240> it's<00:04:34.360> quite<00:04:34.510> old<00:04:34.780> book<00:04:35.080> as<00:04:35.200> well

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
considering it's quite old book as well

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.140 
considering it's quite old book as well
all<00:04:35.800> books<00:04:36.070> tend<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.400> be<00:04:36.490> cheaper<00:04:36.850> but<00:04:37.030> it

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
all books tend to be cheaper but it

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.580 
all books tend to be cheaper but it
really<00:04:37.390> wasn't<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.840> case<00:04:38.020> they<00:04:38.380> brought<00:04:38.530> out

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590

down<00:04:51.970> actually<00:04:52.330> died<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.200> she<00:04:53.410> created<00:04:53.920> the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
down actually died and she created the

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.950 
down actually died and she created the
idea<00:04:54.430> of<00:04:54.580> this<00:04:54.760> book<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.270> i<00:04:55.480> think<00:04:55.690> that's<00:04:55.810> so

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
sad that she never got to express it in

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.090 
sad that she never got to express it in
her<00:04:58.330> own<00:04:58.510> words<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.080> then<00:04:59.320> patrick<00:04:59.680> ness<00:04:59.860> took

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
her own words and then patrick ness took

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.070 
her own words and then patrick ness took
on<00:05:00.280> her<00:05:00.490> idea<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.120> made<00:05:01.540> it<00:05:01.660> into<00:05:01.780> something

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
on her idea and made it into something

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.810 
on her idea and made it into something
that<00:05:02.230> she<00:05:02.530> would<00:05:02.710> have<00:05:02.800> liked<00:05:03.100> i<00:05:03.430> can't<00:05:03.760> wait

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
that she would have liked i can't wait

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.610 
that she would have liked i can't wait
to<00:05:04.030> see<00:05:04.180> how<00:05:04.330> Patrick<00:05:04.540> Ness<00:05:04.870> expresses

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
to see how Patrick Ness expresses

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.530 
to see how Patrick Ness expresses
himself<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.310> how<00:05:06.520> he<00:05:06.550> takes<00:05:06.880> on<00:05:07.120> someone

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
himself and how he takes on someone

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.060 
himself and how he takes on someone
else's<00:05:07.810> idea<00:05:08.170> I<00:05:08.380> think<00:05:08.500> I'll<00:05:08.740> probably<00:05:08.860> read

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
else's idea I think I'll probably read

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.620 
else's idea I think I'll probably read
this<00:05:09.250> around<00:05:09.490> Halloween<00:05:09.970> because<00:05:10.180> it's<00:05:10.480> kind

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
this around Halloween because it's kind

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.630 
this around Halloween because it's kind
of<00:05:10.750> creepy<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.200> think<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:12.100> sounds<00:05:12.580> really

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
of creepy I think and it sounds really

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.540 
of creepy I think and it sounds really
good<00:05:13.090> so<00:05:13.600> hopefully<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.560> will<00:05:14.830> be<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.400> final

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
good so hopefully it will be the final

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.190
