00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
today we're going to talk to you guys

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.859 
today we're going to talk to you guys
about<00:00:11.410> Dymatize<00:00:12.150> iso100<00:00:13.150> it's<00:00:13.449> their<00:00:13.629> whey

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:13.869 
about Dymatize iso100 it's their whey

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.990 
about Dymatize iso100 it's their whey
protein<00:00:14.260> isolate<00:00:14.650> product<00:00:14.980> so<00:00:15.520> a<00:00:15.549> lot<00:00:15.760> of<00:00:15.789> what

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
protein isolate product so a lot of what

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.750 
protein isolate product so a lot of what
is<00:00:16.090> it<00:00:16.270> it<00:00:16.930> is<00:00:16.960> first<00:00:17.710> ingredient<00:00:18.220> hydrolyzed

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
is it it is first ingredient hydrolyzed

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.000 
is it it is first ingredient hydrolyzed
whey<00:00:18.939> protein<00:00:19.330> isolates<00:00:19.750> it's<00:00:20.560> a<00:00:20.650> protein

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
whey protein isolates it's a protein

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.909 
whey protein isolates it's a protein
powder<00:00:21.570> basically<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:23.410> that's<00:00:23.499> the<00:00:23.679> only

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
powder basically and that's the only

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.409 
powder basically and that's the only
protein<00:00:24.160> yet<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.609> only<00:00:24.759> protein<00:00:25.179> source

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
protein yet the only protein source

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.150 
protein yet the only protein source
inside<00:00:25.720> there<00:00:25.990> so<00:00:26.230> is<00:00:26.679> there<00:00:26.919> a<00:00:26.949> hundred

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
inside there so is there a hundred

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.529 
inside there so is there a hundred
percent<00:00:27.220> whey<00:00:27.429> protein<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:27.849> so<00:00:28.060> that<00:00:28.179> may<00:00:28.300> be<00:00:28.359> to

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
percent whey protein I so that may be to

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.720 
percent whey protein I so that may be to
compete<00:00:28.900> against<00:00:29.169> like<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.650> VP<00:00:29.980> twos<00:00:30.220> or<00:00:30.609> the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
compete against like the VP twos or the

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.210 
compete against like the VP twos or the
things<00:00:31.659> like<00:00:31.810> that<00:00:31.989> with<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.259> hydro<00:00:32.619> whey<00:00:32.890> let's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
things like that with a hydro whey let's

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.340 
things like that with a hydro whey let's
have<00:00:33.370> your<00:00:33.520> yeah<00:00:33.760> less<00:00:34.000> so<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:34.239> so<00:00:34.600> flex<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.930> yeah

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
have your yeah less so I so flex so yeah

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.229 
have your yeah less so I so flex so yeah
so<00:00:38.590> hydrolyzed<00:00:39.309> proteins<00:00:39.670> have<00:00:39.760> become<00:00:40.000> quite

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
so hydrolyzed proteins have become quite

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.869 
so hydrolyzed proteins have become quite
popular<00:00:40.420> and<00:00:40.899> you<00:00:41.710> know<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:41.949> thing<00:00:42.100> when<00:00:42.850> you

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
popular and you know the thing when you

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.220 
popular and you know the thing when you
hydrolyze<00:00:43.359> a<00:00:43.390> protein<00:00:43.899> what<00:00:44.079> you're

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
hydrolyze a protein what you're

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.900 
hydrolyze a protein what you're
basically<00:00:44.410> doing<00:00:44.559> is<00:00:44.829> you're<00:00:45.010> pre<00:00:45.340> digesting

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
basically doing is you're pre digesting

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.459 
basically doing is you're pre digesting
it<00:00:46.030> in<00:00:46.359> other<00:00:46.539> words<00:00:46.780> you're<00:00:46.899> breaking<00:00:47.379> it

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
it in other words you're breaking it

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.229 
it in other words you're breaking it
down<00:00:47.590> into<00:00:47.649> smaller<00:00:47.920> chain<00:00:48.489> peptides<00:00:49.000> the

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
down into smaller chain peptides the

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.509 
down into smaller chain peptides the
goal<00:00:49.480> is<00:00:49.809> they<00:00:50.260> get<00:00:50.410> it<00:00:50.559> ideally<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.219> a<00:00:51.250> high

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
goal is they get it ideally to a high

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.310 
goal is they get it ideally to a high
percent<00:00:51.969> of<00:00:52.059> died<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:52.480> tripeptides<00:00:52.899> those

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
percent of died and tripeptides those

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.840 
percent of died and tripeptides those
are<00:00:53.440> two<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:53.829> three<00:00:53.980> amino<00:00:54.250> acid<00:00:54.609> chains

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
are two and three amino acid chains

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.549 
are two and three amino acid chains
because<00:00:55.149> those<00:00:55.660> can<00:00:55.870> be<00:00:55.989> absorbed<00:00:56.230> directly

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
because those can be absorbed directly

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.470 
because those can be absorbed directly
into<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.980> blood<00:00:57.250> in<00:00:57.429> that<00:00:57.460> form<00:00:57.910> you<00:00:58.390> know

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
into the blood in that form you know

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.549 
into the blood in that form you know
they<00:00:58.600> don't<00:00:58.690> you<00:00:58.839> know<00:00:58.929> your<00:00:59.109> body<00:00:59.260> can<00:00:59.469> absorb

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
they don't you know your body can absorb

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.430 
they don't you know your body can absorb
single<00:01:00.129> amino<00:01:00.309> acids<00:01:00.899> dipeptides<00:01:01.899> or

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
single amino acids dipeptides or

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.130 
single amino acids dipeptides or
tripeptides<00:01:03.249> anything<00:01:04.210> larger<00:01:04.900> than<00:01:05.050> that

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
tripeptides anything larger than that

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.440 
tripeptides anything larger than that
needs<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.500> be<00:01:05.620> broken<00:01:05.770> down<00:01:06.070> first<00:01:06.430> now<00:01:07.390> the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
needs to be broken down first now the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.090 
needs to be broken down first now the
question<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.140> what's<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.800> degree<00:01:09.070> of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
question is what's the degree of

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.560 
question is what's the degree of
hydrolysis<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.970> know<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.119> can't<00:01:10.390> really

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
hydrolysis you know you can't really

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.210 
hydrolysis you know you can't really
hydrolyzed<00:01:11.110> proteins<00:01:11.560> completely<00:01:12.070> because

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
hydrolyzed proteins completely because

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.310 
hydrolyzed proteins completely because
they'll<00:01:12.340> get<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:12.579> better<00:01:12.790> yeah<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:14.200> know

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
they'll get you better yeah so you know

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.420 
they'll get you better yeah so you know
so<00:01:14.470> we<00:01:14.560> don't<00:01:14.740> know<00:01:14.890> what<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.130> degree<00:01:15.400> of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
so we don't know what the degree of

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.969 
so we don't know what the degree of
hydrolysis<00:01:16.090> is<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:16.479> it's<00:01:16.630> one<00:01:16.840> one<00:01:17.680> thing<00:01:17.890> I

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
hydrolysis is so it's one one thing I

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.249 
hydrolysis is so it's one one thing I
question<00:01:18.400> yeah<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:18.970> then<00:01:19.060> you're<00:01:19.210> also<00:01:19.360> with

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
question yeah and then you're also with

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:21.660 
question yeah and then you're also with
the<00:01:20.439> degree<00:01:20.680> of<00:01:20.710> hydrolysis<00:01:21.280> you're<00:01:21.460> also

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
the degree of hydrolysis you're also

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.700 
the degree of hydrolysis you're also
left<00:01:21.939> over<00:01:22.270> with<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.540> lot<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.020> single<00:01:23.380> amino

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
left over with a lot of single amino

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.210 
left over with a lot of single amino
acids<00:01:24.250> they're<00:01:24.490> not<00:01:24.670> peptide<00:01:25.030> bonded<00:01:25.479> so

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
acids they're not peptide bonded so

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
acids they're not peptide bonded so
you're<00:01:27.220> left<00:01:27.430> with<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.610> lot<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:27.790> those<00:01:28.000> with

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
you're left with a lot of those with

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.620 
you're left with a lot of those with
specifically<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.960> way<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.200> saw<00:01:29.560> yeah<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:30.130> way<00:01:30.630> in

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
specifically a way I saw yeah the way in

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.090 
specifically a way I saw yeah the way in
the<00:01:31.720> problem<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.079> too<00:01:32.229> many<00:01:32.320> fruit<00:01:32.710> form<00:01:32.979> amino

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the problem of too many fruit form amino

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.639 
the problem of too many fruit form amino
acids<00:01:33.579> in<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.729> presence<00:01:34.119> with<00:01:34.240> peptides<00:01:34.810> you

know<00:01:35.740> as<00:01:35.829> we<00:01:35.979> understand<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.490> at<00:01:36.640> this<00:01:36.729> point

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
know as we understand it at this point

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.819 
know as we understand it at this point
you<00:01:37.210> know<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.479> protein<00:01:38.110> metabolism<00:01:38.200> Roza

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829

somewhat limited because one of the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.240 
somewhat limited because one of the
functions<00:01:44.049> of<00:01:44.140> your<00:01:44.200> liver<00:01:44.500> is<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.829> converts

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
functions of your liver is to converts

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.440 
functions of your liver is to converts
essential<00:01:46.149> amino<00:01:46.329> acids<00:01:46.780> into<00:01:46.899> not

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
essential amino acids into not

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.389 
essential amino acids into not
no<00:01:47.719> acids<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.170> those<00:01:48.259> freeform<00:01:48.770> amino<00:01:49.070> acids

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
no acids and those freeform amino acids

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.249 
no acids and those freeform amino acids
can<00:01:49.430> get<00:01:49.670> plucked<00:01:49.909> up<00:01:50.119> for<00:01:50.299> that<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.079> made

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
can get plucked up for that so that made

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.380 
can get plucked up for that so that made
slowly<00:01:51.740> actually<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.189> effect<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.670> getting

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
slowly actually the effect of getting

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.480 
slowly actually the effect of getting
you<00:01:53.899> know<00:01:54.020> your<00:01:54.170> amino<00:01:54.829> acids<00:01:55.219> into<00:01:55.369> your

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
you know your amino acids into your

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.760 
you know your amino acids into your
blood<00:01:55.640> faster<00:01:56.350> also<00:01:57.350> when<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.560> talk<00:01:57.679> about

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
blood faster also when you talk about

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.800 
blood faster also when you talk about
weight<00:01:58.130> protein<00:01:58.640> weight<00:01:59.240> proteins<00:01:59.659> like<00:01:59.719> a

weight protein weight proteins like a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.569 
weight protein weight proteins like a
superfood<00:02:00.380> if<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.619> really<00:02:00.890> look<00:02:01.369> at<00:02:01.429> the

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
superfood if you really look at the

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.529 
superfood if you really look at the
research<00:02:01.909> on<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.149> I<00:02:02.299> mean<00:02:02.420> it's

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
research on it I mean it's

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.690 
research on it I mean it's
anti-carcinogenic<00:02:03.140> has<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:03.979> ton<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.310> immune

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
anti-carcinogenic has a ton of immune

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.520 
anti-carcinogenic has a ton of immune
enhancing<00:02:04.850> effects<00:02:05.569> I<00:02:05.869> mean<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:06.319> really

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
enhancing effects I mean it's really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.589 
enhancing effects I mean it's really
really<00:02:06.920> an<00:02:07.130> amazing<00:02:07.610> protein<00:02:08.119> sources<00:02:08.390> we

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
really an amazing protein sources we

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.150 
really an amazing protein sources we
know<00:02:08.690> it's<00:02:08.840> rich<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.080> BCAAs<00:02:09.619> when<00:02:10.069> you

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
know it's rich in BCAAs when you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.009 
know it's rich in BCAAs when you
hydrolyze<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:10.880> actually<00:02:11.060> did<00:02:11.540> nature<00:02:11.810> and

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
hydrolyze it you actually did nature and

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.170 
hydrolyze it you actually did nature and
kind<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.260> ruin<00:02:13.069> those<00:02:13.280> effects<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.970> speak

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
kind of ruin those effects so to speak

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.000 
kind of ruin those effects so to speak
now<00:02:14.330> some<00:02:14.599> would<00:02:14.780> say<00:02:14.959> I'm<00:02:15.290> happy<00:02:15.799> to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
now some would say I'm happy to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.100 
now some would say I'm happy to
compromise<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.790> for<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> faster<00:02:17.540> absorption

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
compromise that for a faster absorption

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.589 
compromise that for a faster absorption
because<00:02:18.799> you<00:02:18.950> know<00:02:19.040> maybe<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:20.030> intro

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
because you know maybe I'm in intro

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.300 
because you know maybe I'm in intro
training<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.170> don't<00:02:21.349> want<00:02:21.500> too<00:02:21.620> much<00:02:21.709> blood

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
training and I don't want too much blood

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.240 
training and I don't want too much blood
draw<00:02:22.519> my<00:02:22.730> god<00:02:23.560> whatever<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.739> reason<00:02:25.069> let's

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
draw my god whatever the reason let's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.949 
draw my god whatever the reason let's
just<00:02:25.430> say<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.150> depending<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.660> kind<00:02:26.810> of

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
just say and depending on the kind of

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:27.759 
just say and depending on the kind of
training<00:02:27.140> you're<00:02:27.349> doing<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.650> really

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
training you're doing you really

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.170 
training you're doing you really
shouldn't<00:02:28.310> have<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.549> do<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.700> unless<00:02:28.970> you're

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
shouldn't have to do that unless you're

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.059 
shouldn't have to do that unless you're
doing<00:02:29.269> some<00:02:29.510> kind<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.720> long<00:02:30.349> long<00:02:30.590> distance

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
doing some kind of long long distance

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:39.819 
doing some kind of long long distance
yeah<00:02:31.340> you're<00:02:31.970> couple<00:02:32.780> hours<00:02:38.410> entirely<00:02:39.410> sure

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
yeah you're couple hours entirely sure

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.710 
yeah you're couple hours entirely sure
and<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.340> costs<00:02:40.700> more<00:02:40.849> do<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.120> hydrolyzed

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
and it costs more do you hydrolyzed

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.120 
and it costs more do you hydrolyzed
proteins<00:02:42.170> cost<00:02:42.470> more<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.709> when<00:02:42.890> I'm<00:02:42.950> trying<00:02:43.040> to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
proteins cost more so when I'm trying to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.650 
proteins cost more so when I'm trying to
talk<00:02:43.220> anybody<00:02:43.670> out<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.940> hydrolyzed<00:02:44.299> protein

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
talk anybody out of a hydrolyzed protein

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.819 
talk anybody out of a hydrolyzed protein
we're<00:02:45.049> just<00:02:45.170> trying<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.380> give<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.530> guys<00:02:45.620> both

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
we're just trying to give you guys both

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.940 
we're just trying to give you guys both
sides<00:02:46.069> they<00:02:46.340> do<00:02:46.430> cost<00:02:46.730> more<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.739> know<00:02:48.829> we

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
sides they do cost more and you know we

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.589 
sides they do cost more and you know we
don't<00:02:49.370> know<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.670> degree<00:02:49.819> of<00:02:49.940> hydrolysis<00:02:50.510> we

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
don't know the degree of hydrolysis we

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.759 
don't know the degree of hydrolysis we
don't<00:02:50.780> know<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.049> you<00:02:51.349> know<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.530> actual

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
don't know the you know the actual

now<00:02:55.579> some<00:02:55.760> company<00:02:56.090> will<00:02:56.269> tell<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
now some company will tell you the

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.330 
now some company will tell you the
percent<00:02:56.870> die<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.109> tripeptides<00:02:57.380> but<00:02:57.739> then<00:02:57.889> on

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
percent die and tripeptides but then on

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.949 
percent die and tripeptides but then on
the<00:02:58.400> flip<00:02:58.519> side<00:02:58.730> we<00:02:59.030> don't<00:02:59.120> know<00:02:59.299> how<00:02:59.450> many<00:02:59.630> of

the flip side we don't know how many of
the<00:03:00.440> rest<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.799> out<00:03:00.980> ago<00:03:01.160> peptides<00:03:01.549> or<00:03:01.760> 3-4

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
the rest is out ago peptides or 3-4

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.759 
the rest is out ago peptides or 3-4
amino<00:03:02.389> acid<00:03:02.660> they'll<00:03:02.780> break<00:03:02.900> down<00:03:02.959> which<00:03:03.739> of

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
amino acid they'll break down which of

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.440 
amino acid they'll break down which of
what<00:03:04.010> you're<00:03:04.190> getting<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.639> as<00:03:05.030> we<00:03:05.150> touched<00:03:05.359> on

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
what you're getting and as we touched on

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.720 
what you're getting and as we touched on
with<00:03:05.569> whey<00:03:05.920> can<00:03:06.920> lose<00:03:07.190> some<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.370> those<00:03:07.489> great

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
with whey can lose some of those great

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.350 
with whey can lose some of those great
benefits<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.299> know<00:03:08.389> whey<00:03:09.380> protein<00:03:09.739> fraction

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
benefits you know whey protein fraction

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.080 
benefits you know whey protein fraction
yeah<00:03:10.990> so<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:12.280> know<00:03:12.370> we<00:03:12.490> got<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.730> put<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:12.970> in

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
yeah so you know we got to put that in

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.230 
yeah so you know we got to put that in
context<00:03:13.630> when<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.840> comes<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.550> now<00:03:15.550> Dymatize

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
context when it comes to it now Dymatize

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.970 
context when it comes to it now Dymatize
does<00:03:16.480> also<00:03:16.810> make<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.320> know<00:03:17.410> other<00:03:17.740> whey

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
does also make you know other whey

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.700 
does also make you know other whey
proteins<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.520> are<00:03:18.580> intact<00:03:19.030> too<00:03:19.330> so<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.650> know

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
proteins that are intact too so you know

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.870 
proteins that are intact too so you know
those<00:03:20.890> are<00:03:20.920> other<00:03:21.130> options<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.790> think

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
those are other options and so I think

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.970 
those are other options and so I think
that<00:03:21.970> but<00:03:22.210> right<00:03:22.660> now<00:03:22.770> hydrolysates<00:03:23.770> are<00:03:23.860> all

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
that but right now hydrolysates are all

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.560 
that but right now hydrolysates are all
the<00:03:24.070> rage<00:03:24.220> right<00:03:24.250> yeah<00:03:24.850> very<00:03:25.150> money<00:03:25.360> very

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
the rage right yeah very money very

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.080 
the rage right yeah very money very
popular<00:03:26.080> way<00:03:26.260> things<00:03:26.620> like<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.880> also

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
popular way things like that this also

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.150 
popular way things like that this also
comes<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.570> 1.6<00:03:29.080> pound<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.410> 3<00:03:29.560> pound<00:03:29.770> and<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.920> 5

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
comes in a 1.6 pound of 3 pound and a 5

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.680 
comes in a 1.6 pound of 3 pound and a 5
pound<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.580> they<00:03:30.700> do<00:03:30.790> have<00:03:30.940> three<00:03:31.180> sizes<00:03:31.390> out

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
pound so they do have three sizes out

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.810 
pound so they do have three sizes out
there<00:03:31.750> right<00:03:32.080> now<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.100> think<00:03:33.280> it's<00:03:33.370> cheap

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
there right now and I think it's cheap

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.580 
there right now and I think it's cheap
relative<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.630> some<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.900> other<00:03:35.080> hydrolyzed

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
relative to some of the other hydrolyzed

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.920 
relative to some of the other hydrolyzed
proteins<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.400> mean<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:36.790> mean<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.180> does<00:03:37.420> cost<00:03:37.630> more

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
proteins I mean I mean it does cost more

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.170 
proteins I mean I mean it does cost more
than<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.200> typical<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:39.610> know<00:03:39.640> whey<00:03:39.820> protein

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
than a typical you know whey protein

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.810 
than a typical you know whey protein
isolate<00:03:40.570> even<00:03:40.810> at<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:41.020> point<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.640> know

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
isolate even at this point but you know

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.460 
isolate even at this point but you know
relative<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.450> some<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.750> other<00:03:43.870> hydrolyzed

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
relative to some of the other hydrolyzed

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.810 
relative to some of the other hydrolyzed
proteins<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:44.950> think<00:03:45.340> it's<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:45.520> little<00:03:45.700> bit

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
proteins I think it's a little bit

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.490 
proteins I think it's a little bit
cheaper<00:03:45.970> they<00:03:46.360> they<00:03:46.570> have<00:03:46.720> done<00:03:46.960> their<00:03:47.170> due

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
cheaper they they have done their due

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.920 
cheaper they they have done their due
diligence<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.100> make<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.520> inexpensive<00:03:49.300> for

consumers<00:03:51.120> yeah<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.780> think<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.770> answers

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
consumers yeah so I think that answers

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.380 
consumers yeah so I think that answers
all<00:03:54.190> questions<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.850> I'm<00:03:55.030> sure<00:03:55.060> they'll

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
all questions on that I'm sure they'll

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.300 
all questions on that I'm sure they'll
be<00:03:55.510> more<00:03:55.720> if<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.410> guys<00:03:56.560> have<00:03:56.860> them<00:03:57.070> please
