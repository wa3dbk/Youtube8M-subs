00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920 
along with the set all right so you're
basically<00:02:05.130> getting<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.880> sets<00:02:06.149> normally<00:02:06.659> for

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
basically getting this sets normally for

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.139 
basically getting this sets normally for
50<00:02:07.350> sometimes<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.069> get<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.250> low<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.399> 382

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
50 sometimes you can get as low as 382

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.770 
50 sometimes you can get as low as 382
this<00:02:09.690> sets<00:02:09.929> normally<00:02:10.259> 179<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.129> analog<00:02:11.520> set<00:02:11.849> so

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
this sets normally 179 the analog set so

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.309 
this sets normally 179 the analog set so
you<00:02:12.840> combine

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
you combine

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.640 
you combine
both<00:02:13.650> these<00:02:13.920> sets<00:02:14.629> labelled<00:02:15.629> yeah<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.439> is<00:02:16.620> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
both these sets labelled yeah this is a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.699 
both these sets labelled yeah this is a
deal<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.609> a<00:02:17.909> lifetime<00:02:18.109> you're<00:02:19.109> gonna<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.379> so

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
deal of a lifetime you're gonna get so

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.170 
deal of a lifetime you're gonna get so

you<00:02:38.909> have<00:02:39.060> power<00:02:39.329> line<00:02:39.599> track<00:02:39.989> going<00:02:40.500> from<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
you have power line track going from the

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.140 
you have power line track going from the
pit<00:02:41.129> box<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.769> left<00:02:43.889> counter<00:02:44.249> now<00:02:44.790> after

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
pit box to the left counter now after

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.059 
pit box to the left counter now after
the<00:02:45.239> lab<00:02:45.359> counter<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.169> can<00:02:46.319> use<00:02:46.500> all<00:02:46.769> the

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
the lab counter you can use all the

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.280 
the lab counter you can use all the
track<00:02:47.370> that's<00:02:47.609> in<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.969> analog<00:02:48.359> set<00:02:48.750> going

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
track that's in the analog set going

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.020 
track that's in the analog set going
around<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.799> layout<00:02:50.069> because<00:02:50.370> remember<00:02:50.609> these

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
around the layout because remember these

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.619 
around the layout because remember these
bridges<00:02:51.419> are<00:02:51.750> all<00:02:51.930> analog<00:02:52.409> or<00:02:53.069> universal<00:02:53.819> they

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
bridges are all analog or universal they

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.390 
bridges are all analog or universal they
don't<00:02:54.750> have<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> power<00:02:55.169> line<00:02:55.379> them<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:55.739> if<00:02:56.340> you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
don't have the power line them so if you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.349 
don't have the power line them so if you
were<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.730> put<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.150> lab<00:02:57.299> counter<00:02:57.750> right<00:02:57.930> here

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
were to put the lab counter right here

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.309 
were to put the lab counter right here
they<00:03:00.359> wouldn't<00:03:00.629> work<00:03:00.689> because<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.109> after

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
they wouldn't work because it's after

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.589 
they wouldn't work because it's after
the<00:03:02.189> non<00:03:02.370> power<00:03:02.730> line<00:03:02.939> track<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.359> wouldn't

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
the non power line track so wouldn't

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.670 
the non power line track so wouldn't
work<00:03:03.689> you<00:03:03.719> got<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.900> put<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.139> before<00:03:04.409> like<00:03:04.530> I've

you think I'm gonna run over these

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.030 
you think I'm gonna run over these
numbers<00:03:21.419> one<00:03:21.659> more<00:03:21.780> time<00:03:21.959> everybody<00:03:22.799> calm

down
so<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:26.419> d100<00:03:27.419> for<00:03:28.790> triple<00:03:29.790> zero<00:03:29.939> four<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.799> no

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
so it's d100 for triple zero four and no

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.469 
so it's d100 for triple zero four and no
a<00:03:32.069> one<00:03:32.790> triple<00:03:33.239> zero<00:03:33.479> four<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.159> D<00:03:35.180> one<00:03:36.180> triple

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
a one triple zero four and D one triple

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.240 
a one triple zero four and D one triple
zero<00:03:36.750> died<00:03:36.959> I'm<00:03:37.560> gonna<00:03:37.769> put<00:03:37.919> it<00:03:38.009> on<00:03:38.129> the
