00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.550
 the mayor's office today we are experiencing a national crisis that I already had

 n also the paok in the payment 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
 of that train and they also help to make 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.710
 I would say that if such 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 I would say yes because 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.920
 I have the clearest example since the elections themselves 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.430
 for the election precisely the magistrates 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.040
 I am speaking to you from the choice of professionals of the school of 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.480
 lawyers 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.290
 of the lawyers who participate in the exile

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.410

 in this country have transnational companies this that quotes 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.310
 to invest they do not come to build a building to buy a building 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.740
 in the country although the frontal shot 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.520
 and we talk about state institutions and we talk about how we can press 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.200

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:25.639
 this country the matter 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.419
 in civil society forgive me that the subject is so trite 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:30.359
 convince 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.359

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.399
 that cries will remove me presented by this civil society of a few 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.269
 that they know 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.739
 taking 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.739
 the title by a thousand to speak for my mouth 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.149
 it's not exactly what I think what these people men and women 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.149
 more women than men go and say 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.029
 but how are these civil society? 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.359
 percent and recognized because this one the ministry does not accept motorcycle either 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.359
 civil well in or páramo socially accepted 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.079

 this afternoon to 7% the international community to sales and all the 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.609
 instances of the state 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.389
 help but not about the current state yes 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.979
 there are two things there 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.579
 as you exactly say 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.579
 they are said to consider themselves to represent something 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.329
 I do not consider myself represented by indignant 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:57.879
 in absolutely nothing I do not understand by how that man wants to the guidelines of 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.059
 gradually the defense will be presented either because I want to say 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:06.099
 I am criminologists as a profession I am a litigating lawyer influencing 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.439
 criminology 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.789
 and I understand criminal behavior in this country I insist 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:15.759
 each of these societies never speak of agrarian reform for 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.549
 cowards 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.050
 the country is not going to solve its economic crisis if we do not solve the issue of 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.150
 job 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.180
 if we do not face structural policies, such as nationalization by 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.009
 example of lanús 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.669
 we will never commit ourselves as men as women or that we add 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.219
 adapt to a side 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.080
 percent support 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.020
 fidelity and coverage 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.930
 to the activity that led to the national struggle front gathering the signature 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.319
 parana nationalization 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.129
 I want that it was transported we are greece was happening was 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.279
 Holy family must be exact to pay the external debt at 10 o'clock 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.979
 i the humble working people 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.800
 compactors because as you can not leave to whoever counts that who 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.230
 want to cover the truth you will like the audience ap of the real fall with your 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.440
 loud and clear 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.409
 in this vega line has commented 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.270
 but today not open account of the national front of fight with the pants to 

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:19.689
 another bike we need 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.809
 so cheap 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.439
 this civil society 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.889
 that protects human rights 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.059
 In my opinion 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:30.550
 they arrived for the appointment 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.870
 they came to practice 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.560
 they helped them collect signatures a daughter was released 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.729
 avatar 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.819
 but of course like five clubs 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.129
 as well as attacking opel a magna are like five of the sea as well as seven men 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.659
 but piñera 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.069
 came the international community as you just signed for three you make a 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:50.189
 good policy 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.889
 when three Spanish were missing 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.000
 m has been present in civil society 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.520
 so that the complainant when you these union leaders 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.469
 and without silver neighbors summoned today to a farm has the kill them as little co-author 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.970
 loquacious barbecue and has not arrived civil society is collegiate price 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.469
 we only respond that our civil society in which the 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:16.530
 first of May the one that breathes the October 20 the one that are the classrooms 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.749
 university students walk association and qualified in the short list of asobal after 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.009
 admit accepted to peñarol has done what I wanted to give 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.240
 group the tpp 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.220
 to that which is what we recognize as a city partner I do not 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.630
 what I want to say to the press manipulates as a civil society 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.180
 I for that reason in this edition I do not know how to explain at this moment and it is important 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.849
 that the socialite 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.879
 they involve partnering well commented 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.879
 we require it 2 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:49.080
 we do not recognize that specific representativeness for us society 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.789
 civil than what we work 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:54.659
 the collection of the signatures almost we have already three hundred thousand signatures 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.300
 precisely requesting the nationalization of the abandonment so 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.039
 good news and has presented another series of firecrackers and even point yo 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.999
 would consider team all those signatures 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:07.999
 it has practically a legitimation 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:11.219
 of the hope that the country has 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.039
 as a non-electoral purpose 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.379
 but commitment to transform the country once 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.229
 but I want to return to that topic in that civil society Luis Luna in Mrs. 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.289
 she was minister of government for the Antilleans absolutely nothing in the 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:26.979
 country I see there 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.779
 as a civil society 

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:31.990
 from characters there the shed teros 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.460
 I want to recognize that there will be some good men and good intentions 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.800
 What worries me is that any discussion 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.029
 all analysis 

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:44.469
 is never done on agrarian issues of the country I'm going to cut this way is of 

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:47.219
 bad faith and you because I have to take care of it 

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:48.509
 of people 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.699
 that help create criticism in the country 

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:55.680
 or that they simply are not there when they should be and when nobody has called us 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.599
 there is
