 Hello everyone, we are on the Pound World Channel 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.529

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.690
 stripes 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.580
 the knowledge of samyshin amen therefore we take 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.529
 ukulele check properly configured 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.220
 if something sounds on so here in this 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.970
 faith 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.199
 song is played by only two strings is 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.039
 here and hold only 2 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:49.319
 second string 8 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:57.209

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:01.829
