lights all the way down to zero I mean

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.710 
lights all the way down to zero I mean
it<00:02:56.130> still<00:02:56.400> bleeds<00:02:56.700> through<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.180> little<00:02:57.540> bit

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720

on a side so here's B's into a HDMI on

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.330 
on a side so here's B's into a HDMI on
the<00:03:48.299> back<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.959> has<00:03:49.170> two<00:03:49.470> more<00:03:49.709> HDMI<00:03:51.769> it<00:03:52.769> has<00:03:52.980> a

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.050 
connect your out of out of your
connection<00:04:07.140> looks<00:04:07.260> like<00:04:07.549> not<00:04:08.549> sure<00:04:08.730> really

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
connection looks like not sure really

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.550 
connection looks like not sure really
what<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.569> but<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:11.609> can<00:04:11.760> connect<00:04:12.120> your

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
what it is but you can connect your

cheap<00:05:26.870> although<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:27.990> does<00:05:28.170> have<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.380> Netflix

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
cheap although it does have a Netflix

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.430 
cheap although it does have a Netflix
button<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:30.060> Sen<00:05:30.690> burn<00:05:30.930> Sony

button and the Sen burn Sony
Entertainment<00:05:31.710> Network<00:05:32.070> bad<00:05:32.810> but<00:05:33.810> it's

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
Entertainment Network bad but it's

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.780 
Entertainment Network bad but it's
pretty<00:05:34.170> much<00:05:34.440> cheap<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:35.010> would<00:05:35.160> expect<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.640> a

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
pretty much cheap I would expect that a

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.080 
pretty much cheap I would expect that a
better<00:05:36.030> controller<00:05:37.020> like<00:05:37.590> this<00:05:37.620> one<00:05:38.040> from<00:05:38.910> my

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
better controller like this one from my

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.590 
better controller like this one from my
other<00:05:39.360> Sony<00:05:39.720> TV<00:05:40.550> is<00:05:41.550> way<00:05:41.730> better<00:05:41.970> has<00:05:42.300> light

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
other Sony TV is way better has light

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.150 
other Sony TV is way better has light
behind<00:05:42.990> everything<00:05:43.350> that<00:05:45.500> was<00:05:46.500> my<00:05:46.650> third<00:05:46.890> con

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
behind everything that was my third con

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.860 
behind everything that was my third con
it's<00:05:47.580> not<00:05:47.730> really<00:05:47.910> a<00:05:47.970> big<00:05:48.150> con<00:05:48.420> because<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:48.720> use

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
it's not really a big con because I use

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.010 
it's not really a big con because I use
a<00:05:48.900> mother<00:05:49.140> controller<00:05:49.770> anyway<00:05:49.950> but<00:05:50.430> I<00:05:51.020> would

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
a mother controller anyway but I would

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.600 
a mother controller anyway but I would
have<00:05:52.140> expected<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:52.920> come<00:05:53.100> with<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.250> better

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
have expected it to come with a better

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.220 
have expected it to come with a better
controller<00:05:55.010> considering<00:05:56.010> it<00:05:56.160> is<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.310> 50<00:05:56.790> inch

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
controller considering it is a 50 inch

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.780 
controller considering it is a 50 inch
it<00:05:58.230> is<00:05:58.290> more<00:05:58.770> than<00:05:58.970> $500<00:05:59.970> and<00:06:00.890> it<00:06:01.890> is<00:06:02.040> a<00:06:02.070> 3d<00:06:02.550> TV

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
it is more than $500 and it is a 3d TV

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.540 
it is more than $500 and it is a 3d TV
so<00:06:03.660> I<00:06:05.150> would<00:06:06.150> expect<00:06:06.240> it<00:06:06.660> better<00:06:07.100> but<00:06:08.100> I<00:06:08.340> mean

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
so I would expect it better but I mean

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.070 
so I would expect it better but I mean
you<00:06:08.670> can't<00:06:08.910> really<00:06:08.970> argue<00:06:09.270> that<00:06:09.540> much<00:06:09.720> for<00:06:10.020> the

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
you can't really argue that much for the

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.580 
you can't really argue that much for the
price<00:06:11.150> you<00:06:12.150> get<00:06:12.300> for<00:06:12.540> this<00:06:12.630> TV<00:06:13.020> it<00:06:13.230> has<00:06:13.260> pretty

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
price you get for this TV it has pretty

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.160
