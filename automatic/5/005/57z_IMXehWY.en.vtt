bolts here on the driver's side or right
here<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.119> right<00:02:01.119> here<00:02:01.590> we're<00:02:02.590> going<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.770> go

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
here and right here we're going to go

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.050 
here and right here we're going to go
ahead<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.220> use<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.340> little<00:02:03.610> bit<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.820> spray

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
ahead and use a little bit of spray

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.120 
ahead and use a little bit of spray
lubricant<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:05.289> help<00:02:05.320> them<00:02:05.619> come<00:02:05.800> out<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.950> little

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
lubricant to help them come out a little

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.359 
lubricant to help them come out a little
bit<00:02:06.280> easier<00:02:07.470> now<00:02:08.470> it'll<00:02:08.619> be<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.739> same<00:02:09.070> process

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
bit easier now it'll be the same process

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.940 
bit easier now it'll be the same process
and<00:02:09.789> same<00:02:09.970> location<00:02:10.630> over<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.440> passenger

and same location over on the passenger

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.970 
and same location over on the passenger
side<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> good<00:02:13.989> idea<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.769> an<00:02:14.890> extra

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
side it's a good idea to get an extra

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.620 
side it's a good idea to get an extra
set<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.340> hands<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.760> help<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.060> hold<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.390> bumper

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.920 
the hitch up into position put the hitch
raised<00:03:33.430> up<00:03:33.670> into<00:03:33.850> position<00:03:34.330> we'll<00:03:34.660> go<00:03:34.780> ahead

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
raised up into position we'll go ahead

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.890 
raised up into position we'll go ahead
and<00:03:35.050> install<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:36.130> flange<00:03:36.430> nut<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.000> each<00:03:37.720> of

brackets<00:03:48.620> now<00:03:48.830> this<00:03:49.010> little<00:03:49.250> tab<00:03:49.520> here<00:03:49.550> we

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
brackets now this little tab here we

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.640 
brackets now this little tab here we
need<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.720> make<00:03:50.870> sure<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.350> comes<00:03:51.560> through

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
need to make sure that it comes through

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.930 
need to make sure that it comes through
the<00:03:52.010> hitch<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:55.340> it'll<00:03:55.490> go<00:03:55.610> up<00:03:55.640> in<00:03:55.790> there<00:03:55.910> like

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
the hitch so it'll go up in there like

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:05.260 
the hitch so it'll go up in there like
this<00:04:02.800> we'll<00:04:03.800> then<00:04:03.950> line<00:04:03.980> up<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.430> holes<00:04:04.580> and

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
this we'll then line up the holes and

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.690 
this we'll then line up the holes and
reinstall<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.440> hardware<00:04:06.860> attaching<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.960 

well<00:04:29.920> then<00:04:30.070> we<00:04:30.130> repeat<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.520> same<00:04:30.550> process

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.360 
well then we repeat the same process
over<00:04:31.420> on<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.810> other<00:04:31.900> side<00:04:32.190> next<00:04:33.190> we'll<00:04:33.280> go

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
over on the other side next we'll go

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:48.400 
over on the other side next we'll go
ahead<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.610> tighten<00:04:33.910> down<00:04:34.030> all<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.420> hardware

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.800 

and<00:04:49.790> torque<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.120> manufacturers

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
and torque it to the manufacturers

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.550 
and torque it to the manufacturers
specification

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.930 

now<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.740> we<00:04:58.830> have<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.220> hitch<00:04:59.400> torque<00:04:59.760> down

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
now that we have the hitch torque down

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.000 
now that we have the hitch torque down
to<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.210> vehicle's<00:05:00.630> frame<00:05:00.870> now<00:05:01.680> we're<00:05:01.860> ready

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010
