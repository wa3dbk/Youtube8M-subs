about 15 odd minutes now so let's check
the<00:01:48.659> temperature<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.680> it's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the temperature so you can see it's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.100 
the temperature so you can see it's
risen<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.490> 51<00:01:50.909> degrees<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> front<00:01:51.899> and

again<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.420> 48<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.780> degrees<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.700> so

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
again about 48 or degrees at the back so

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
again about 48 or degrees at the back so
as<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.780> phone<00:01:58.049> does<00:01:58.350> heat<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.829> while<00:01:59.340> gaming
