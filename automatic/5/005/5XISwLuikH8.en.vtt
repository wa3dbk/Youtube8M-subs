00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.730
 yes 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.320
 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.790
 are missing 90 health with a new 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.070
 video equal friends on this occasion jose 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.250
 the unboxing as you can see from a sleeve 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.529
 called armored currently this case 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.689
 is ironman as you can see is 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.700
 fenced by marvel in the back 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.090
 We only see what they are a little 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.160
 up close product specifications 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.260
 warnings and what are the logos 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.420
 of the brand that sells it, we are going to 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.050
 proceed to take out quickly to not 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.659
 make this boxing very long and good 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.879
 I think it already includes nothing more 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.100
 only from this part then good 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.290
 let's take what is the cover of this 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.510
 small package that brings us in this 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.100
 part of here as we can see the case 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 at a glance it is two parts 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.410
 according to the card 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.700
 which is in Japanese and from the side 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.280
 well, this is a warning 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.050
 to its put aside and also has a 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.870
 small card in which or what to tell you 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.160
 how to activate the reactor that is this 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.430
 part of here we're just going to 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.380
 play good notifications what 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.900
 are the notifications enable the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.310
 going to general accessibility and putting 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.840
 what is light for notifications 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.150
 for each time a message arrives or 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.680
 mark us this this sleeve turn on 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.960
 I guess it's fine it works through 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.550
 to take a picture we 're going to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.140
 try that edit your port is one side 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.910
 and good as we can see is two 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.340
 parts to see thoroughly is made in 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.560
 plastic completely is something 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.060
 voluptuous here I think you can 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.090
 appreciate well 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.899
 but well let's proceed to insert it 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.409
 I think he gets in this way he enters very 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.390
 very just very just the truth but in 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.360
 this screen case and I do not wake up what 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.539
 which one could zoom and it's something something 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.039
 good for this one on this part and good is 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.390
 a little click as you can see and ready 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.310
 already installed what our sleeve 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.009
 now good for an entire photograph in 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.330
 This is how we do as we can see 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.640
 It has all completely closed 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.690
 only this part of here nothing more 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.280
 we slide it out and how can 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.480
 see the camera comes out to be able to take 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.769
 Photographs 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.380
 Now let's check if this does not 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.510
 interferes the area took a picture 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.720
 because very important what we and 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.370
 they come out very well and not in this 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.670
 case they do not interfere absolutely as they can 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.170
 see with your position in the camera we have 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.030
 a photograph and they go perfectly 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.740
 now let's see how our 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.110
 reactor when we mention let's 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.360
 density what is the flash and we go as 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.420
 a photograph to see how it 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.530
 turn on or see if you can appreciate 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.060
 because here are the buttons and in 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.850
 this part of here 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.710
 that are very hard to the touch 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.710
 but I think you can appreciate it well 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.890
 in this part of where this is lit 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.569
 equal every scribe traction this is going to 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 turn on something bad that I see is that 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.870
 this reduces a lot whatever since 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.630
 direct our light as you can 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.069
 appreciate here this central part for 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.560
 that may have turned on then 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.120
 we want to take pictures at night with 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.340
 this foundation laid the truth is going to be a 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.140
 little impossible good is a very sheath 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.989
 father for all the fans of 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.840
 'iron is very stopped as you can see is 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.069
 something voluptuous in this upper part 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.630
 I think it's a cover not for the 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.060
 daily not safety not this 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.950
 device do not remain what is important 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.080
 have a sleeve since good does not have 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.330
 no edge of this screen what 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.680
 which point protects us 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.720
 absolutely nothing but the part 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.310
 back in the side parts with another 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.630
 side as I comment the buttons are a 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.430
 to touch and are a bit 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.800
 hidden is not difficult to access them 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.180
 for example here assumes that should 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.680
 be the one of the ok but it is not 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.620
 working what is the button 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.290
 this is not being activated 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.760
 monarchy was activated but if these 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.709
 buttons a bit difficult 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.290
 it's very well work well and the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.150
 aspect of the camera because if this one 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.500
 that we can not take night pictures anymore 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.690
 that this weakens a lot what is the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.820
 flash is very important what you have to 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.199
 take this into account is not what our 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.540
 that has liked the brightness by point 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.449
 that we leave this video of the cover 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.270
 armond currently I think it's called the 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.430
 ironman case for iphone 5 and the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.510
 You can find it in Brando isoc 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.699
 to be the solution so that you 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.729
 can check in case they want it 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.020
 buy this good comment in the part 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.130
 of toy you think this case if you 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.510
 liked it or not
