00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it didn't take me all to learn the make

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.059 
it didn't take me all to learn the make
and<00:02:07.170> there<00:02:07.259> wasn't<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.500> much<00:02:07.649> money

involved<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> silicon<00:02:09.000> well<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
involved in the silicon well this is the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
involved in the silicon well this is the
mold<00:02:10.470> whether<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> came<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.280> two

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
mold whether it came out of two

that's the negative that's the positive
that's<00:02:15.960> just<00:02:16.280> silicon<00:02:18.260> reinforced<00:02:19.260> with

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
that's just silicon reinforced with

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.000 
that's just silicon reinforced with
fiberglass<00:02:19.710> then<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:22.140> resin<00:02:22.890> was

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
fiberglass then that the resin was

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.540 
fiberglass then that the resin was
pulled<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.400> there<00:02:23.550> sloshed<00:02:24.540> around<00:02:25.550> hardened

pulled in there sloshed around hardened
and<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.760> pulled<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.090> out<00:02:27.770> that's<00:02:28.770> what<00:02:28.920> came<00:02:29.070> out

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
and I pulled it out that's what came out

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.850 
and I pulled it out that's what came out
that's<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:33.050> what<00:02:34.050> else<00:02:34.230> what<00:02:34.410> else<00:02:34.440> or<00:02:34.680> this

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.090 
little torch in the life because there's
a<00:03:36.480> torch<00:03:36.690> on<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.930> blueprints<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.440> thought<00:03:37.650> it's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
a torch on the blueprints I thought it's

detail got bored one day and I also put
the<00:04:37.990> trigger<00:04:38.230> system<00:04:38.440> in<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:40.630> it's<00:04:40.900> it's<00:04:41.710> all

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890

there<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.710> there's<00:04:44.950> another<00:04:45.280> bit<00:04:46.000> of<00:04:46.060> a

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
there and there's another bit of a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.190 
there and there's another bit of a
system<00:04:46.480> going<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.810> in<00:04:46.930> there<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.860> just<00:04:48.070> put

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
system going on in there so I just put

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.280 
system going on in there so I just put
bring<00:04:50.200> it<00:04:50.290> back<00:04:50.470> dumb<00:04:51.330> sprung<00:04:52.330> load<00:04:52.540> that's

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
bring it back dumb sprung load that's

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.770 
bring it back dumb sprung load that's
pretty<00:04:53.470> cool<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.770> little<00:04:54.640> experimentation<00:04:55.920> so

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
pretty cool a little experimentation so

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.750 
pretty cool a little experimentation so
I'll<00:04:58.780> give<00:04:59.710> us<00:04:59.890> a<00:04:59.950> little<00:05:00.070> pan<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.550> what<00:05:00.670> it

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
I'll give us a little pan of what it

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.440 
I'll give us a little pan of what it
looks<00:05:00.880> like<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:02.010> start<00:05:03.010> at<00:05:03.130> this<00:05:03.250> end<00:05:03.450> float

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
looks like I start at this end float

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.680 
looks like I start at this end float
along<00:05:04.570> oh<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.280> holes<00:05:06.490> those<00:05:07.240> three<00:05:07.450> holes

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
along oh and the holes those three holes

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.540 
along oh and the holes those three holes
are<00:05:07.870> just<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:08.680> i<00:05:08.740> could<00:05:08.800> get<00:05:09.010> nails<00:05:09.280> into

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
are just so that i could get nails into

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.570 
are just so that i could get nails into
the<00:05:09.640> arm<00:05:09.880> or<00:05:10.090> pins<00:05:10.750> into<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.710> trigger<00:05:12.400> system

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
the arm or pins into the trigger system

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.000 
the arm or pins into the trigger system
so<00:05:12.880> that<00:05:12.910> pull<00:05:13.600> out<00:05:13.780> they'll<00:05:14.440> be<00:05:14.500> body<00:05:14.770> filler

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
so that pull out they'll be body filler

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.870 
so that pull out they'll be body filler
dovin<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:16.120> know<00:05:16.270> hidden<00:05:17.010> okay<00:05:18.010> we<00:05:18.370> keep

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
dovin you know hidden okay we keep
