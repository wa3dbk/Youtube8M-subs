gas and then we have the void gas then

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.679 
gas and then we have the void gas then
we<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.560> bottle<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.040> gas<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.640> kind<00:02:00.540> of

we have this bottle of gas so kind of
weird<00:02:00.960> yeah<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.860> weird<00:02:02.040> mod<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> guess<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
weird yeah kind of weird mod I guess you

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.560 
weird yeah kind of weird mod I guess you
could<00:02:02.729> say<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.909> let's<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.240> ahead<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.450> place

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
could say so let's go ahead and place

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.359 
could say so let's go ahead and place
this<00:02:03.659> green<00:02:03.930> gas<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.290> gown<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.829> it's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
this green gas to gown and it's

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.670 
this green gas to gown and it's
basically<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.030> suffocate<00:02:07.020> us<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.590> as

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
basically going to suffocate us so as

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.940 
basically going to suffocate us so as
you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:07.950> our<00:02:09.170> thing<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.470> down<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you can see our thing is going down and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.220 
you can see our thing is going down and
but<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
but we do have a

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.140 
but we do have a
option<00:02:12.709> right<00:02:12.920> now<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.430> if<00:02:13.519> we<00:02:13.610> go<00:02:13.819> ahead<00:02:13.849> and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
option right now so if we go ahead and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.300 
option right now so if we go ahead and
get<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.450> off<00:02:14.690> let<00:02:15.500> me<00:02:15.530> go<00:02:15.590> ahead<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:15.860> go<00:02:16.129> into

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
get that off let me go ahead and go into

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.360 
get that off let me go ahead and go into
game<00:02:16.640> mode<00:02:16.670> one<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.510> grab<00:02:18.140> some<00:02:18.590> milk<00:02:18.920> buckets

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
game mode one and grab some milk buckets

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.460 
game mode one and grab some milk buckets
I<00:02:19.549> think<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.000> helps<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.629> let's<00:02:21.230> go<00:02:21.349> ahead

and get our during gas again let's go
and<00:02:24.500> grab<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.799> green<00:02:25.010> gas<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.790> go<00:02:26.690> back<00:02:26.959> into

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
and grab that green gas and go back into

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.860 
and grab that green gas and go back into
game<00:02:27.709> modes<00:02:28.040> zero<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.030> let's<00:02:29.510> go<00:02:29.629> ahead<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
game modes zero and let's go ahead and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.660 
game modes zero and let's go ahead and
drink<00:02:30.019> our<00:02:30.170> milk<00:02:30.500> which<00:02:30.739> takes<00:02:31.069> off<00:02:31.310> all<00:02:31.549> the

drink our milk which takes off all the
potion<00:02:32.000> effects<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.569> let's<00:02:32.900> go<00:02:33.019> ahead<00:02:33.080> and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
potion effects and let's go ahead and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.289 
potion effects and let's go ahead and
get<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> green<00:02:33.680> gas<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.670> as<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:34.940> see<00:02:35.000> yeah

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
get the green gas so as you can see yeah

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.390 
get the green gas so as you can see yeah
the<00:02:35.510> green<00:02:35.690> gas<00:02:35.870> gas<00:02:36.290> just<00:02:36.590> does<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.010> okay<00:02:37.220> so

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
the green gas gas just does that okay so

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.770 
the green gas gas just does that okay so
let's<00:02:37.640> see<00:02:37.849> let's<00:02:38.090> wait<00:02:38.209> for<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.450> green<00:02:38.569> gas

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
let's see let's wait for the green gas

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.330 
let's see let's wait for the green gas
to<00:02:38.900> go<00:02:39.019> away<00:02:39.140> as<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.530> can<00:02:39.650> see<00:02:39.799> it's<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.040> kind

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
to go away as you can see it's just kind

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.190 
to go away as you can see it's just kind
of<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:40.459> floating<00:02:41.390> around<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.840> ceiling

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
of like floating around on the ceiling

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.509 
of like floating around on the ceiling
bin<00:02:42.319> eventually<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:42.860> will<00:02:42.950> leave<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.340> cave

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
bin eventually it will leave the cave

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.940 
bin eventually it will leave the cave
system<00:02:43.879> and<00:02:44.030> go<00:02:44.239> up<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.720> there<00:02:44.870> now<00:02:45.140> obviously

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
system and go up and there now obviously

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.800 
system and go up and there now obviously
if<00:02:46.099> you're<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.400> an<00:02:46.579> enclosed<00:02:47.090> cave<00:02:47.390> system

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
if you're in an enclosed cave system

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.660 
if you're in an enclosed cave system
it's<00:02:47.989> not<00:02:48.049> going<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.650> go<00:02:48.890> out<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.250> go<00:02:49.340> into<00:02:49.489> the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
it's not going to go out and go into the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.009 
it's not going to go out and go into the
air<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:50.030> gonna<00:02:50.180> float<00:02:50.420> around<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.840> top

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
air is just gonna float around the top

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.690 
air is just gonna float around the top
of<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.200> cave<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:52.099> let's<00:02:52.250> see<00:02:52.400> what<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.549> red

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
of the cave so let's see what the red

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.050 
of the cave so let's see what the red
gas<00:02:52.910> does<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.359> us<00:02:53.510> um<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:55.370> red<00:02:55.549> gas<00:02:55.760> actually

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
gas does to us um the red gas actually

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.110 
gas does to us um the red gas actually
flows<00:02:56.709> downwards<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:57.859> that's<00:02:58.120> definitely

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
flows downwards so that's definitely

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.610 
flows downwards so that's definitely
kind<00:02:59.329> of<00:02:59.420> different<00:02:59.810> let's<00:02:59.989> see<00:03:00.170> if<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.440> can

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
kind of different let's see if we can

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.530 
kind of different let's see if we can
get<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:00.980> I'm<00:03:01.190> not<00:03:01.489> sure<00:03:01.790> if<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.120> does<00:03:02.299> anything

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
get it I'm not sure if it does anything

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.110 
get it I'm not sure if it does anything
to<00:03:02.690> us<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.049> don't<00:03:03.109> think<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.440> does<00:03:03.670> hmm<00:03:04.730> it's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
to us I don't think it does hmm it's

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.150 
to us I don't think it does hmm it's
kind<00:03:05.329> of<00:03:05.359> different<00:03:05.540> okay<00:03:06.379> so<00:03:06.440> let's<00:03:06.709> see<00:03:06.920> what

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
kind of different okay so let's see what

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.460 
kind of different okay so let's see what
the<00:03:07.310> void<00:03:07.819> gas<00:03:08.359> does<00:03:08.720> now<00:03:08.959> probably<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.379> is

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
the void gas does now probably this is

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.809 
the void gas does now probably this is
gonna<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.859> worst<00:03:09.980> obviously<00:03:10.549> it's<00:03:10.670> just

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
gonna be the worst obviously it's just

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.050 
gonna be the worst obviously it's just
going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.090> kill<00:03:11.930> y'all<00:03:12.170> or<00:03:12.579> slowly<00:03:13.579> kill<00:03:13.910> you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
going to kill y'all or slowly kill you

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.300 
going to kill y'all or slowly kill you
but<00:03:14.239> it's<00:03:14.420> going<00:03:14.629> to<00:03:14.750> go<00:03:14.930> down<00:03:15.260> instead<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.890> up

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
but it's going to go down instead of up

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.559 
but it's going to go down instead of up
so<00:03:16.519> that's<00:03:16.700> kind<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:16.940> different<00:03:17.299> kind<00:03:17.419> of

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
so that's kind of different kind of

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.909 
so that's kind of different kind of
weird<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:17.900> if<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.079> walk<00:03:18.260> on<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.799> you're

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
weird so if you walk on to it you're

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.920 
weird so if you walk on to it you're
definitely<00:03:19.099> going<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.579> have<00:03:19.669> a<00:03:20.060> little<00:03:20.660> bit<00:03:20.840> of

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
definitely going to have a little bit of

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.300 
definitely going to have a little bit of
trouble<00:03:21.139> so<00:03:21.440> now<00:03:21.590> let's<00:03:21.829> see<00:03:21.980> if<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.130> last

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
trouble so now let's see if the last

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.740 
trouble so now let's see if the last
thing<00:03:22.519> does<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.030> going<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.329> be<00:03:23.569> the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
thing does this is going to be the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.490 
thing does this is going to be the
bottle<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.620> gas<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.579> I'm<00:03:26.150> not<00:03:26.450> 100<00:03:26.989> sure<00:03:27.169> what

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
bottle of gas so I'm not 100 sure what

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.920 
bottle of gas so I'm not 100 sure what
you<00:03:27.620> can<00:03:27.769> do<00:03:27.980> with<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.480> really<00:03:29.720> don't

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
you can do with this like I really don't

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.930 
you can do with this like I really don't
know<00:03:30.169> I<00:03:30.200> think<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.680> can<00:03:30.859> use<00:03:31.099> it<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.700> can't

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
know I think you can use it you can't

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.440 
know I think you can use it you can't
drink<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.329> obviously<00:03:32.870> but<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:34.120> believe<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.269> can

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
drink it obviously but I believe you can

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.770 
drink it obviously but I believe you can
use<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.900> for<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:37.040> potions<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.760> stuff<00:03:37.880> so

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
use it for like potions and stuff so

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.300 
use it for like potions and stuff so
that's<00:03:39.139> kind<00:03:39.410> of<00:03:39.440> weird<00:03:39.620> kind<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.010> different

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
that's kind of weird kind of different

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.589 
that's kind of weird kind of different
so<00:03:40.489> if<00:03:40.609> you'd<00:03:40.730> like<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:41.000> check<00:03:41.180> out<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:41.480> rest

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
so if you'd like to check out the rest

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.030 
so if you'd like to check out the rest
of<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.810> mod<00:03:41.989> that's<00:03:42.230> really<00:03:42.500> about<00:03:42.709> all<00:03:42.769> the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
of the mod that's really about all the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.059 
of the mod that's really about all the
mod<00:03:43.220> shows<00:03:44.150> for<00:03:44.750> us<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.530> mean<00:03:45.680> it's<00:03:45.889> pretty

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
mod shows for us I mean it's pretty

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.129 
mod shows for us I mean it's pretty
different<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.549> reason<00:03:46.849> I<00:03:46.940> decided<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.720> review

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
different the reason I decided to review

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.020 
different the reason I decided to review
it<00:03:48.290> is<00:03:48.410> because<00:03:48.829> I've<00:03:49.310> never<00:03:49.489> seen<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.790> mod<00:03:50.000> like

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
it is because I've never seen a mod like

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.270 
it is because I've never seen a mod like
this<00:03:50.329> minecraft<00:03:50.569> I've<00:03:50.989> never<00:03:51.200> seen<00:03:51.530> gasses

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
this minecraft I've never seen gasses

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.129 
this minecraft I've never seen gasses
and<00:03:52.519> a<00:03:52.579> Minecraft<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.299> mean<00:03:53.450> it's<00:03:53.599> really<00:03:53.900> weird

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
and a Minecraft I mean it's really weird

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.619 
and a Minecraft I mean it's really weird
like<00:03:54.410> you<00:03:54.440> normally<00:03:54.980> never<00:03:55.700> think<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.269> seeing

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
like you normally never think of seeing

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.900 
like you normally never think of seeing
stuff<00:03:56.930> like<00:03:57.139> that<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.470> game<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:57.919> now<00:03:58.069> you<00:03:58.730> do

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
stuff like that in a game but now you do

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.849 
stuff like that in a game but now you do
I<00:03:58.940> mean<00:03:59.239> they're<00:03:59.419> gases<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.079> it's<00:04:00.230> cool<00:04:00.530> like

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
I mean they're gases and it's cool like

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.559 
I mean they're gases and it's cool like
I<00:04:00.889> think<00:04:01.160> they<00:04:01.400> should<00:04:01.549> add<00:04:01.730> more<00:04:01.760> types<00:04:02.329> of

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
I think they should add more types of

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.270 
I think they should add more types of
gases<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.349> would<00:04:03.500> be<00:04:03.650> really<00:04:04.010> cool<00:04:04.220> so

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
gases and that would be really cool so

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.069 
gases and that would be really cool so
that<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.609> really<00:04:04.819> gonna<00:04:04.940> be<00:04:05.120> about<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.840> for<00:04:06.019> the

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
that is really gonna be about it for the

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.750 
that is really gonna be about it for the
gas<00:04:06.230> mod<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.739> decided<00:04:07.129> to<00:04:07.250> review<00:04:07.489> because<00:04:07.700> I

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
gas mod I decided to review because I

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.830 
gas mod I decided to review because I
thought<00:04:07.879> it<00:04:08.000> was<00:04:08.060> interesting<00:04:08.389> and<00:04:08.690> it's

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
thought it was interesting and it's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.000 
thought it was interesting and it's
something<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.169> I've<00:04:09.260> never<00:04:09.410> seen<00:04:09.650> before
