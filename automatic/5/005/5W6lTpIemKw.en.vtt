00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.730
 I like to dance as well as I can on the video clips choreography 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.590
 The magic word is difficult to pronounce, even harder to learn 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.620
 Blind greed of debt has hit you as you rightly and wrongly 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.450
 Percent denote as the most famous choreographies in Germany Carlo is that 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.599
 method 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.050
 so everyone knows he brought García after 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.730
 The OG also roars Magna and the Credo 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.369
 decisive steps to success 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.480
 The bad ones are not so often known as the ones we have 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.879
 sympathetic Berliner at one of his famous workshops in Aussicht Alp 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.879
 hit a point end 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.910
 4 volts is a candidate 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.780
 that was 11 years ago the pop dance is cool who can move like that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.250
 Kleist does not have to be rehearsed stars on the video clips because you have to 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.100
 sometimes get louder and just for this is known in the right 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.490
 Moment the right criticism Paletten we but nobody 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150
 I think the young people get a lasting damage if you give them 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.589
 says 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.890
 Here is not so bad Kathmandu have given you trouble 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.220
 if you missed him then similar lasting damage in the head she think 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.990
 that they are in this profession pop star or PMU artist 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 be successful and be launched five years later 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.590
 by themselves but they do not succeed the year of their lives 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.840
 I think it was worse 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.600
 «As if I'm looking for a Sunday contact 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.560
 you will never 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.590
 Become a popstar 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.720
 because that's not what it's about 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 the self made it he has a great passion for dancing 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.600
 and he has become a large company 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.520
 all over Germany there are studios choreography of the lessons 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 He works just as much as fear then with the stars of the scene 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.310
 Of course there are differences with young people's work 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.130
 From the beginning of their dance development, there are the successes 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 much bigger 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.230
 at the stops I work with or the professional dancers for the stars 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.700
 then dancing and toning are of course the successes you have 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.760
 only limited to fear only, you are very much limited to her 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.430
 both can be charming both is very very interesting March but that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.560
 Here are things that always bring me back to the ground 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.219
 all you are in this media industry moves because it is of course already like that 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.049
 that there is a lot of fluffy pro farm iMovie yes and that they are still curative and 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:16.959
 that's good too 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.849
 Success is not everything for love because he knows best as he does 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.139
 is to be on the ground 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.329
 who meets Sohst grew up as an orphan in a home in the east 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.569
 Berlin's on since that's his world's dancing his passion 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.749
 Thilo Maack Hansen was the first for me 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:33.909
 Fiala 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.539
 So they are those of social conditions 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.269
 independent way to get recognition a man in public 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.709
 School there were kids from normal heat balance and from the home and there 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.789
 you can not lose any touched by the teams Solon was supposed to have 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.569
 So what we did not have what I have then sometime the attractiveness 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.419
 I have received recognition for the movement 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.089
 and then that's how Bauer suddenly but also the passion 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:59.569
 evolved because I realized that brings me what it creates next 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.849
 Werth that can not take with anyone 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.049
 And so it was probably about 100 young people at Visual Klopp in Aurich 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.139
 lead-free serious 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.819
 Just forget about everyday life with dancing and who knows maybe has 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.539
 she also discovered here in Swabia one or the other star of tomorrow
