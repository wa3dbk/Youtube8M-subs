00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so we'll take a closer look at this and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.950 
so we'll take a closer look at this and
then<00:01:13.260> we'll<00:01:13.439> insert<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> card<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
then we'll insert the card in all that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.570 
then we'll insert the card in all that
as<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> outside<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
as you can see from the outside this

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
as you can see from the outside this
thing<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.060> actually<00:01:18.270> stitched<00:01:18.750> together<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
thing is actually stitched together and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.880 
thing is actually stitched together and
the<00:01:20.009> stitching<00:01:20.490> appears<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.119> decent

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
the stitching appears to be decent

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.609 
the stitching appears to be decent
now<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.390> badge<00:01:24.390> itself<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> slide

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
