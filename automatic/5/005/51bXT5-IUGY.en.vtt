always<00:03:20.580> potential<00:03:21.090> especially<00:03:22.080> when<00:03:22.769> it

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
always potential especially when it

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.940 
always potential especially when it
comes<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.340> some<00:03:23.700> sort<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.000> historic<00:03:24.480> value<00:03:24.950> we

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
can also get blinded by love so people

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.699 
can also get blinded by love so people
go<00:03:33.090> for<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.360> image<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> quality<00:03:34.260> however

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
go for the image and the quality however

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.100 
go for the image and the quality however
I<00:03:34.920> always<00:03:35.190> look<00:03:35.340> at<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.549> potential

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
I always look at the potential

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.630 
I always look at the potential
especially<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.260> defender<00:03:37.709> range<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.579> is

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
especially the defender range this is

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
bona fide or not now the VIN number will

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.660 
bona fide or not now the VIN number will
be<00:04:03.540> here<00:04:03.780> on<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.739> brake<00:04:04.920> master<00:04:05.099> cylinder

LT 95 or 5-speed Auto which isn't
correct<00:05:35.800> it<00:05:36.520> should<00:05:36.550> actually<00:05:36.880> be<00:05:37.060> number

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
correct it should actually be number

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.719

digit<00:05:43.389> we<00:05:43.630> have<00:05:43.870> is<00:05:44.110> an<00:05:44.290> A<00:05:44.410> which<00:05:44.740> says<00:05:44.950> it's

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
digit we have is an A which says it's

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.860 
digit we have is an A which says it's
all<00:05:45.190> models<00:05:45.550> except<00:05:45.910> for<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.330> BCD<00:05:47.340> etc<00:05:48.870> the

all models except for the BCD etc the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.420 
all models except for the BCD etc the
last<00:05:50.050> digit<00:05:50.470> we're<00:05:50.590> going<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.770> look<00:05:50.860> at<00:05:51.040> is<00:05:51.250> a

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
last digit we're going to look at is a

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.120 
last digit we're going to look at is a
which<00:05:52.240> says<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:52.600> was<00:05:52.750> built<00:05:52.990> in<00:05:53.200> Solihull<00:05:53.590> in

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
which says it was built in Solihull in

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.360 
which says it was built in Solihull in
the<00:05:54.250> UK<00:05:55.320> okay<00:05:56.320> so<00:05:56.380> we<00:05:56.590> have<00:05:56.740> a<00:05:56.770> little<00:05:57.070> bit<00:05:57.280> of<00:05:57.310> a

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
the UK okay so we have a little bit of a

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.070 
the UK okay so we have a little bit of a
mystery<00:05:57.669> here<00:05:58.000> about<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.389> gearbox<00:05:58.780> type

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
mystery here about the gearbox type

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:14.659 
mystery here about the gearbox type
however<00:05:59.380> this<00:05:59.620> is<00:05:59.800> something<00:06:00.010> to<00:06:00.130> investigate

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.540 

so<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.509> VIN<00:06:15.659> plate<00:06:15.840> isn't<00:06:16.740> just<00:06:17.099> for<00:06:17.310> the

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
so the VIN plate isn't just for the

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.459 
so the VIN plate isn't just for the
vehicle<00:06:17.999> information<00:06:18.300> it<00:06:18.840> also<00:06:18.870> has<00:06:19.289> the

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
vehicle information it also has the

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.950 
vehicle information it also has the
weights<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.830> axle<00:06:20.129> numbers<00:06:20.430> on<00:06:20.580> it<00:06:20.699> and<00:06:20.849> if<00:06:21.840> we

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
weights and axle numbers on it and if we

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.739 
weights and axle numbers on it and if we
look<00:06:22.110> at<00:06:22.229> this<00:06:22.319> one<00:06:22.530> here<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:23.580> plate<00:06:23.819> we're

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:24.749 
look at this one here the plate we're

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 
on the side it's an older box and I'm

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.999 
on the side it's an older box and I'm
using<00:07:18.539> the<00:07:18.719> mirror<00:07:18.930> as<00:07:19.349> I<00:07:19.500> said<00:07:19.650> you<00:07:19.800> need<00:07:19.979> a

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:20.009 
using the mirror as I said you need a

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.610 
using the mirror as I said you need a
mirror<00:07:20.279> to<00:07:20.490> check<00:07:21.330> the<00:07:21.659> number<00:07:22.020> so<00:07:22.229> you<00:07:22.319> can

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 
mirror to check the number so you can

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.499 
mirror to check the number so you can
just<00:07:22.770> about<00:07:23.069> read<00:07:23.339> that<00:07:23.639> with<00:07:24.000> the<00:07:24.089> magic<00:07:24.419> of

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509 
just about read that with the magic of

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:27.439 
just about read that with the magic of

vane<00:07:27.689> it's<00:07:28.500> worth<00:07:28.710> noting<00:07:29.279> all<00:07:29.370> these<00:07:29.550> details

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:29.789 
vane it's worth noting all these details

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:32.119 
vane it's worth noting all these details
down<00:07:30.389> so<00:07:30.810> you<00:07:30.870> have<00:07:30.960> a<00:07:31.259> record<00:07:31.710> of<00:07:31.889> exactly

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:32.129 
down so you have a record of exactly

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:33.350 
down so you have a record of exactly
what<00:07:32.819> you've<00:07:32.939> got
