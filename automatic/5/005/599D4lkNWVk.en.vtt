00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello to all my friends in this 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:16.020
 new unboxing let's do it fast doctors 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:18.090
 no longer too busy then how 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.140
 I said in the video of you tube or undecided 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 between the gitzo hat all inn dura 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.390
 obviously everyone knows that if one has one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.289
 the undoubtedly obviously after funk egizzo 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.239
 but in the end, I decided to wear leather 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.500
 a gitzo because the brand is one of the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.989
 major brands like then 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 I tried so a little to risk it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.719
 taken used because otherwise they cost 6 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.680
 700 bubbles immediately enter the heart 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.590
 heel comes in one size 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.180
 somewhat doubtful there will be no mica 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:02.699
 so little though I have to admit it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:05.939
 suitcase I have to say that I listed it yesterday 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.189
 morning and today arrived there was no 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:18.049
 day but I put only minimum by 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:21.049
 Florida shipments are super 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.049
 accelerated 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:57.149
 so why practically this 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:00.930
 here is the 13 25 of the agip and maybe the mark 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.880
 1 and I saw online that there is mark ii and ho 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.820
 said mark ii probably will be because 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.799
 this is the central column and the mark 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.819
 ii has no knowledge is that some 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.130
 say that the central column renders 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.590
 makes the camera less stabilized 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.810
 like the Scotsman doesn't want the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.080
 they know central for nothing this year 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.390
 and punitive inside and had 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.810
 said ah well I do not want to spend 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.200
 so much they are right here and here I am 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:40.709
 here there is the lace for the column not 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:44.400
 central roof is total expenditure 350 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.010
 with shipping costs and taxes 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.620
 paypal to gen closed we can see that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.650
 this point we can carbon fibers 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.590
 note that it is much much bigger and 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:03.540
 width the thickness of what it was 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:06.239
 what I had now very rigid and 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.609
 because what I had now but now 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.840
 bertolo del ponente repeat more wind 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.400
 anyway 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.310
 what I have now not only in 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:23.530
 machine because my head is the head 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:26.379
 however, we will reuse things I have 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.209
 noticed while looking for contrÃ  on 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.549
 easel that lives up to that 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.910
 that I have now that is yes in fiber 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.590
 carbon because I also had 200 dollars 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.500
 it's not very high when I have to do the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.299
 photo that maybe the photo is a subject 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.200
 that is not moving around strange 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:47.849
 giusy I wanted one that is enough 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.849
 no standing upright 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.409
 let's see a proof 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.189
 another name that you see when 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.090
 already with seeing 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:39.210
 madonna how much you can take a picture like this 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.180
 usually cheer 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:07.490
 be light enough very light 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:08.410
 all in carbon fiber anyway 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.900
 nice nice 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.569
 then having this bonus which was one 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.750
 some things they told me no to 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:22.220
 central eaves we do fuck off 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.409
 for exclusive and cell this is included 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:33.050
 bonus because I had said it in the 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:38.979
 micetto is today we also find the manual 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:41.120
 of instructions that I think them new 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.729
 appears but because we no longer do 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.880
 that goes the new model this shows 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.880
 a gross case like 700 dollars 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.570
 now I have to go get the 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:00.490
 camera then we vote with the blanket 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.490
 of the easel we make of the heart
