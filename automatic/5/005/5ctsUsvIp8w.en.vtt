00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.803
 Set the pair 6, -8 on the coordinate system 

00:00:06.803 --> 00:00:09.311
 This is the coordinate system here 

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:12.237
 This horizontal axis, ie x axis 

00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:16.463
 The vertical axis is located here, the y axis 

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:21.804
 It is known that when you get such a salary pair 

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:24.961
 Is that the first coordinate is an x ​​coordinate 

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.119
 The second coordinate is the y coordinate 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.463
 And gave us an x ​​x 6 

00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:33.135
 The x coordinate is 6 

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:36.897
 What we mean is that we do 6 units on the x-axis 

00:00:36.897 --> 00:00:40.054
 Let's promise if, 1 - I can not write - 

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.655
 Then we have 2 here 

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:46.695
 Then 3, then 4, then 5 

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.467
 And then move to the 6 x axis 

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:53.150
 We start from the origin point 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.472
 Any of 0,0, this is the origin point 

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.051
 Then we move to 6 to the right 

00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:59.466
 This part is here 

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.485
 Now the y-coordinate is -8 

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:05.867
 This means that we will move down by 8 in the vertical direction 

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:09.126
 We can see it here 

00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:10.565
 I will move by 2 

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:12.795
 This is 1, this -2 

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:16.138
 -3, these are -4 here 

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:19.900
 5, -6, -7, -8 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.448
 We moved to the right by 6 and down by 8 

00:01:26.448 --> 00:01:28.584
 We moved to the right by 6 

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:32.810
 Then down by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.897
 We are here now 

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:42.377
 If this is point 6, -8 

00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:46.371
 You can move it this way too 

00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:47.717
 We move 6 by here 

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:49.111
 We will be along this line 

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.804
 Then moving, and the y-factor is -8 

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:55.705
 You will say that we will be along this line 

00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:56.820
 The location of the intersection is this coordinate 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.488
 I would like to think about it in a 6-to-right way 

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:02.067
 Along the x axis 

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:05.132
 Then we move along the y axis 

00:02:05.132 --> 99:59:59.999
 Down by 8
