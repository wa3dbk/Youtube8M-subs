in<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.180> back<00:00:58.810> it's<00:00:58.840> not<00:00:59.260> with<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.650> machine

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
in the back it's not with the machine

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.300 
in the back it's not with the machine
but<00:01:00.490> it<00:01:00.640> will<00:01:00.820> go<00:01:01.060> with<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.480> machine

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
but it will go with the machine

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.130 
but it will go with the machine
we're<00:01:03.310> just<00:01:03.460> going<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.640> run<00:01:03.820> this<00:01:03.940> thing<00:01:04.239> just

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
we're just going to run this thing just

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.930 
we're just going to run this thing just
jog<00:01:05.410> it<00:01:05.590> around<00:01:05.830> run<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.250> spit<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.490> little<00:01:06.820> bit
