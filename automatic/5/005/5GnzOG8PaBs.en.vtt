00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.350
 according to the number of complaints in the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.730
 Carabineros records thefts of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.199

 shops and supermarkets are few without 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 however when this happens the victims 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.539
 they have a hard time trying to search 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 answers from those responsible 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.750

 station the car went by like 25 minutes and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 I got back and the car was not there 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.619
 I went to security they did not tell me anything 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.899

 car in the parking lot 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.429
 establishment and as a measure 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.860
 desperate at about 20 o'clock this 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.159

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.159
 shout 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.490
 I asked for help from police who 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.920
 it took more than 50 minutes to get to the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.509
 enclosure this case returns to take the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.100
 It shows the security that the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.500
 parking lots of supermarkets 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.810
 consumers have rights when 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.850
 they leave their vehicles to remember the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.670
 companies are our free segment 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.349
 or be paid the regional deputy director 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.299
 national consumer service lucas 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.069
 of the villar ensures that people 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.170
 they should be aware that they have 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.909
 all the right to ask for solutions in the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.219
 case that a situation like this 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.200
 another of the scope of the 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.269
 current legislation the law of rights of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.039
 consumer makes clear relationship with 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.780
 with respect to the posters where it is indicated 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.760
 that the company is not responsible for 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.890
 damage or robberies within certain 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.090
 precincts companies have a duty to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.579
 have a system of attention to 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.410
 client according to the circumstances in 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.870
 which meets the need of the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.359
 consumers facing for example to stealing 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.040
 hidden in vehicles that are under 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.500
 your care of traction to winds 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.420
 but before making any claim 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.920
 before this service one should leave a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.200
 denunciation before the carabineros about the fact 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.000
 after this the sernac can mediate with 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.220
 the company and of not reaching agreement 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.230
 you can even get to an instance 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.220
 which is also part of the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.320
 instance that I defend to the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.330
 consumers is the regular course that 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.280
 John continued the damage that I started having 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.500
 found his vehicle warns that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.330
 will come to the end 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.830
 to find a solution 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.080
 I was just called carabinero 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.730
 He found the car are Bernardo 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.080
 everything is dismantled so I'm 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.680
 finding out so that until the last one there 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.680
 it could be like that
