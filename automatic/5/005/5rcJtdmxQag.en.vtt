00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.430
 heil hello to all welcome to this 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.919
 video preview of the 650.8 scan I do not say 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.860
 no nonsense her 158 who fell this 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.000
 morning you will see on the road at mx 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.910
 if you have not seen it yet and 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.439
 come back after enjoying this review 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.060
 so it's a scan that really 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.140
 more frankly I'll tell you that 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.570
 it was a long time since I was not 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.839
 as thoroughly in it is as much a 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.850
 patient to click on the next page 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.220
 this scan I loved I loved everything 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.980
 just to see madara important I 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.590
 like but see madara be 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.530
 completely disintegrated it makes me that 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.850
 I really much more beautiful why 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.170
 so what is it that's 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.379
 spent in this booth then you have it 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.379
 well understood 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.100
 jewels want madara and there they 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.400
 were unleashed on him it was 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.170
 really hilarious so I'm kakou a 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.310
 started the hostilities already we can 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.680
 to clarify that I am at once it's a 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.200
 little bit we will say rabibocher with 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.070
 station to me you know to tend for 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 those who follow me for a long time 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 you know that my goal I preferred 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.320
 it is precisely this jewel 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.780
 had neither that so it's at 10am lukaku 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.760
 why would I frankly show myself 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.110
 do not know he's always liked it since 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.520
 that I saw the first time in a 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.500
 fight remember when remember 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.149
 you when he fights against naruto 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.840
 when they are small even as naruto 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.270
 does 1-1 nghÃª an guy so this is a 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.100
 transformation and it turns into 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.450
 demon fox precisely I remember and 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.910
 I liked this quack or because they 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.990
 used footon sand I like 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.610
 the use of men 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 the crazy tons and in addition he has a voice 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.979
 super acute this trophy end I find 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.810
 that he is funny so I really 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.640
 well liked shukaku of the blow that made 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.350
 very long very very very long 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.990
 that we did not see it there we see it 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.550
 with train station to form a combination of the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.679
 rather interesting technique on morning 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.360
 you saw sand come in 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.929
 body to block everything it's really 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.330
 unbelievable 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.920
 it happens even enough mahdharas but 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.020
 of course it was not counting the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.870
 extraordinary power of madara who 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.340
 outright arrived at the adc sends them a 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.959
 sound and a technique 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.580
 finally it's anything the guy he is 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.080
 too powerful he comes out with his 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.290
 support frankly the class the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.200
 high class and afterwards against 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.209
 jewelry deals with his case 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.489
 jewels take care of this 200 case and 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.709
 then hey and he gets shriveled 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.890
 frankly it's really weird of 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.150
 see madam do as much at the time in 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.760
 fund time it is in any case 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.880
 it was funny and in the end so we 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.920
 see who will lose 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.760
 as I mentioned in the faq I have 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.620
 did it maybe a week ago I was able to 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.380
 I was saying that Naruto has changed a lot 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.569
 down there we send one of the facets 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.459
 so then you have to know that when you 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.920
 said it changed it's not necessarily 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.269
 negative as it says in the video no 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.489
 back I think it has changed but 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.930
 it's not necessarily a criticism it's 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.260
 not necessarily yeah that's all bad 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.569
 exchange 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.849
 I'm just saying that it has evolved 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.560
 not take it on the negative side 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.500
 and that's where we see, for example 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.500
 that it evolves look he knows he sank 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.150
 when he had his arm cut off and I 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.140
 was scared when I saw the picture because 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.200
 I told myself I hope they will not 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.209
 we make it to the minato kind with a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.200
 guy who has a guy you have an arm and who is 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.360
 wants an arm because I honestly 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.440
 it scares me a guy has an arm do that 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.630
 makes me cold it makes me flipper I you 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.130
 not hide so so there when I see 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.060
 minato for example I do not appreciate the 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.050
 all to see it mines to others because 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.060
 that precisely he has an arm and I 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.950
 frankly I do not think it's super great 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.260
 so stylish when I saw madara I had 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.690
 afraid of that but no but it goes down 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.090
 mattered was not counting the naruto 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.550
 blow the guy he took the arm under he 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.720
 cut him islamic islah live and 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.670
 this is where we really see that it has 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.890
 changed since remember at the time 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.510
 gave a return you took a shot 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.220
 in the back you were dead now 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.860
 obviously we find the arms good bah 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.180
 has been so low now see the 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.330
 guy who cuts his arm in a heads or 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.460
 up light their easylife glue I want 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.180
 to say so 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.560
 So that's true I say it 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.510
 change but it does not bother me it's a 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.480
 manga and then I'd much even 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.920
 madara with two arms that with a good 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.690
 anyway here and at the same 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.280
 time they bring him back so the rin and 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.799
 gansu shine win to be more 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.720
 accurate his the gift he is recovering and then 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.250
 and then apparently he promises us to 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.600
 beautiful prowess with so I think that 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.420
 it's the Rennes Guen who took it to 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.820
 auby early though I'm not so sure 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.130
 since remember a madara and toby 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.140
 he had one of his collections of 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.370
 sharingan rin and win end the guys 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.290
 who are in the eye business 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.260
 clearly it has been felt since 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.340
 a long time so I do not know pretty much 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.020
 finally I do not know which one knows but I 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.880
 think it's the one of btu do not hesitate 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.740
 not to give me your opinion but I think 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.560
 that that of vito is apparently so 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 it's his original and it promises 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.710
 apparently big fight so there 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.390
 really i am really really very 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.040
 very very very hurry from Wednesday 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.570
 next and I hope they will not do 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.550
 To cut bat canes week 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.080
 next because I would be disgusted 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.510
 I really want to see more 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.430
 that's ok yeah then week confess 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.290
 own something too for those 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.120
 who have already seen the video I made 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.850
 on my main channel about 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.880
 dailymotion the video that I filmed 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.430
 so the day before yesterday I think so I did 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.230
 could not express myself about that so I 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.780
 do now on this preview 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.000
 I wanted to clarify that this video on 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.460
 dailymotion has nothing to do 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.210
 with the new law and youtube that is 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.230
 spent yesterday on on the monkey money 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.880
 in videos 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.020
 the timing was really bad I 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.610
 I was not lucky on this one 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.860
 so I'm afraid some people 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.450
 could have thought that given the 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.700
 monetization difficulties on youtube 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.240
 now that I was trying to pass on 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.039
 delays 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.870
 harper channel was not at all the case 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.610
 already the chain dailymotion was created there 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.660
 about two weeks ago so pretty well 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.490
 before this law 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.500
 and then anyway I do not even know 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.910
 not if I'm touched on my channel 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.770
 youtube by this new law 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.690
 so whatever it is I will stay on 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.430
 youtube and not on dailymotion lo 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.690
 it was just a small precision for 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.430
 avoid amalgam 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.410
 it's always better since on youtube 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.060
 the blahs it goes very very quickly 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.470
 in any case thank you all really 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.669
 have not looked at this preview we get 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.949

 ciao
