00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.970
 Welcome to a new Hamburg are on this channel it is that 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.810
 First on boxing for a long time there was already no one left and it will 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.210
 this great device 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.699
 replace more or less for me personally 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.669
 Percent of what in the Selterser Seifert 1 so the first generation 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.630
 Percent one wi-fi old girl 32 gigabytes percent 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.640
 Storage 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.810
 and this 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.749
 I have to celebrate the day 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.699
 yes today you can put the iPad 2 in the shops 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.660
 I could get more backups and I'll hold 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 unpack now together again 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.270
 to the minimum measure beautiful iPad 1 way 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.220
 what happened 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.390
 but you do not get any scared at the end I will not do it as Blue 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.540
 So here we have the iPad 2 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.470
 still packed Unna 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.980
 It's a bit complicated 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.030
 the iPad 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.140
 get in a good mood via video 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.990
 because just try it 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.240
 and 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.730
 I hope that the whole thing is in a war because once on board 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.660
 more on board are open so open 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.560
 we do that the old cautious also the loss of spectators 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.580
 Industry leader has disappeared 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580
 So it's easy to scratch deep down here 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.000
 Actually, the usual ones are just that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Matthias Plastik awakened 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620
 Loopholes with 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.040
 despite the promise 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.490
 At least, the interest reflects strong 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.649
 we'll take care of it all now 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.009
 before making it on Latvians was specification 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.509
 this is the iPad 2 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.490
 should now be arrived at everyone 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.250
 in the variant white you should resume 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.860
 with 64 gigabytes of memory to two free 3g that is it is so to speak 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.250
 Bengal tiger 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.110
 in all ages so that's the tallest thing possible 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.990
 from the memory as well as with 3g and we open the box now just times 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.740
 careful crime scene Azzurra 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.850
 and then there are already 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.759
 yes I found that you need to get used to - all in white too 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:05.380
 pick up 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.190
 However, it is the whole hall that I am as black as possible 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.679
 and white Alcañiz were sold out 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.679
 to maybe a few info 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.649
 the iPad 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.749
 you have in limited numbers at least in my area 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:20.529
 is received 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.399
 in the media market they took with them said many may be 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.309
 but not at all or did they say that will probably not be enough 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.889
 So I'm following on 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.540
 We had days and wrote a stalemate 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.889
 Sarah write three eyecatchers get the iPhone from Apple percent 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.550
 quite a lot but what should I say I represent the viewer 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.549
 So this was currently from Mainz 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.959
 yes, I was so lucky 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.999
 and we take a quick exit for the 9th 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.869
 we have to lead carefully 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:53.059
 and so you have what it takes to work anyway I think you can do it all 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.219
 For many years this is quite a lot of beautiful power 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.080
 Vintage the clock look like that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.389
 sometimes you do not 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.499
 then we have the plug here 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.690
 d sockets Charge off a usb cable 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.730
 Everything was known so everything is not as interesting as the iPad 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.909
 of course, yourself 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.489
 You have to first to the side 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.689
 and chance site last something 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.729
 Maybe there should be some people who did not quite notice that 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.769
 iPad 2 is percent the same size as Innernzell 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.989
 may miss some cases 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.439
 Naturalness Arques or something like that but in Kansas it's just a show 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.589
 times were allowed to fit quite well here 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:36.489
 we have the choice of white and black I have the case two games 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.969
 had to disconnect because it wants to talk Tacheles Much said no matter 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.039
 I almost do not have the patients anymore in Cardrona 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.039
 we also have people in front of all the rock comrades 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.159
 we have the back 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.479
 the percentages the chamber was and these black bars are specific 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.209
 for Tercera 3g 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.479
 we have the normal ones 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.869
 Percentage of the club for the other side too 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:03.739
 and basically, the iPad 2 is giving a little bit of air 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.869
 lighter 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.529
 inside so the inner values ​​count in the iPad, however, the whole was not 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:10.580
 Preview 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.120
 he smiled and did something 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.770
 honestly probably not because there are so many reviews exercise wide 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.129
 be better than mine 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.120
 yes, I would be if I wish that we do that 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.710
 he has things on Boxing Day from that he still relishes school anxiety 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.439
 set up and then with the first words Heinen summarizes from the bed 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.750
 the grateful to see you see us write us next time 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.449
 Rubbish with the mestemacher said if this then further increased 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.460
 yes you agree 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.430
 So if you are interested in looking at the info-box 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.990
 and around 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.509
 there is then a left 1 some of the actions if this link is not yet 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.770
 then please do not panic because either the iPad is not yet 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.819
 adjusted 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.619
 or the auction has already expired so if it has expired 

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:55.210
 write 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.690
 van Gaal is the sign of the action yet 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.730
 unevenly started that means you have to be patient if you are interested 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.490
 has registered 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.319
 but now it was as far as I know it was to see we are then write 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.250
