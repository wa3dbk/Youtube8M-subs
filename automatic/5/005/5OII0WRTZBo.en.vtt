bowl you you get little dots on there

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
bowl you you get little dots on there
these<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.250> okay<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.760> those<00:00:47.969> sorts<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> bowls

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
these are okay on those sorts of bowls

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.740 
these are okay on those sorts of bowls
but<00:00:48.989> nowadays<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.670> evolution<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
but nowadays with the evolution of the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.360 
but nowadays with the evolution of the
game<00:00:52.399> has<00:00:53.399> become<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:54.120> more<00:00:54.149> complex<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
game has become a lot more complex and

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.799 
game has become a lot more complex and
colors<00:00:56.370> very<00:00:56.610> important<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.510> lot<00:00:57.629> of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
colors very important because a lot of

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
colors very important because a lot of
the<00:00:57.960> bowls<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:59.010> today<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.670> got

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the bowls that are out today have got

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.750 
the bowls that are out today have got
stripes<00:01:00.270> dot<00:01:00.780> patterns<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:02.250> range<00:01:02.609> from

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
stripes dot patterns they range from

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.250 
stripes dot patterns they range from
pure<00:01:03.300> white<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.339> black<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.700> course<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
pure white to black of course and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.510 
pure white to black of course and
everything<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.500> between<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:08.070> Pink's<00:01:08.460> greens

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
everything in between like Pink's greens

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
everything in between like Pink's greens
yellows<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.630> all<00:01:09.750> sorts<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.080> things<00:01:10.140> like

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
yellows and all sorts of things like

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
yellows and all sorts of things like
that<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.799> after<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> color<00:01:11.760> like

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that and after you get a color like

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
that and after you get a color like
white<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.630> show<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.290> those<00:01:13.470> bowls<00:01:13.799> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
white to show up on all those bowls this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
white to show up on all those bowls this
is<00:01:14.460> impossible

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
is impossible

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.990 
is impossible
basically<00:01:16.020> impossible<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.640> did<00:01:17.759> was

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
basically impossible so what I did was

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.499 
basically impossible so what I did was
introduce<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.570> color<00:01:19.009> their<00:01:20.009> color<00:01:20.299> this<00:01:21.299> is

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
introduce a color their color this is

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.800 
introduce a color their color this is
the<00:01:21.659> colored<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:23.909> also<00:01:24.090> sprays<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the colored one and it also sprays a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.600 
the colored one and it also sprays a
stripe<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.619> you'll<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> difference

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.630 

so<00:01:31.240> there<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:31.990> are<00:01:32.020> they're<00:01:32.890> much<00:01:33.190> easier<00:01:33.220> to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
so there we are they're much easier to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.170 
so there we are they're much easier to
see<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:35.320> all<00:01:36.310> sorts<00:01:36.730> of<00:01:36.790> color<00:01:37.060> bowls<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:39.180> what

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
see on all sorts of color bowls and what

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.110 
see on all sorts of color bowls and what
that<00:01:40.390> does<00:01:40.630> basically<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.650> replicate<00:01:42.340> what

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
that does basically is replicate what

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.880 
that does basically is replicate what
people<00:01:43.510> used<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.840> do<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.260> old<00:01:44.290> days<00:01:44.500> with<00:01:44.800> a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
people used to do in the old days with a

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.320 
people used to do in the old days with a
piece<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.220> chalk<00:01:45.460> they<00:01:45.730> used<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.970> get<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.120> piece

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
piece of chalk they used to get a piece

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.000 
piece of chalk they used to get a piece
of<00:01:46.510> chalk<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:50.290> then<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:50.800> have

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
of chalk and do this so then you have

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.280 
of chalk and do this so then you have
the<00:01:51.550> chalk<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.090> original<00:01:52.540> chalk<00:01:52.780> March<00:01:53.020> which

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
the chalk the original chalk March which

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.520 
the chalk the original chalk March which
people<00:01:53.710> prefer<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:56.020> is<00:01:56.200> what<00:01:56.380> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
people prefer and this is what the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.010 
people prefer and this is what the
chalky<00:01:56.860> does<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.400> think<00:01:58.270> you'll<00:01:58.720> all<00:01:58.870> agree

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
chalky does I think you'll all agree

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.440 
chalky does I think you'll all agree
that<00:01:59.740> it's<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.040> much<00:02:00.340> better<00:02:00.550> situation

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
that it's a much better situation

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.420 
that it's a much better situation
because<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.290> don't<00:02:02.530> have<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.860> touch<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.220> bowl

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
because you don't have to touch the bowl

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.430 
because you don't have to touch the bowl
it's<00:02:04.240> all<00:02:04.570> done<00:02:05.100> without<00:02:06.100> touching<00:02:06.520> anything

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
it's all done without touching anything

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.790 
it's all done without touching anything
