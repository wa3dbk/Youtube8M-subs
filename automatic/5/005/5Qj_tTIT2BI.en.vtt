00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
annoys me too other than that those are

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.850 
annoys me too other than that those are
the<00:06:00.180> two<00:06:00.419> cons<00:06:00.900> about<00:06:01.169> this<00:06:01.320> bag<00:06:01.650> and

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
the two cons about this bag and

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.680 
the two cons about this bag and
sometimes<00:06:02.280> the<00:06:02.460> zipper<00:06:02.760> not<00:06:02.940> going<00:06:03.240> all<00:06:03.450> the

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
sometimes the zipper not going all the

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.620 
sometimes the zipper not going all the
way<00:06:03.720> open<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.789> just<00:06:05.789> trying<00:06:06.270> to<00:06:06.390> get<00:06:06.510> your

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
way open and just trying to get your

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.110 
way open and just trying to get your
things<00:06:06.960> out<00:06:07.169> of<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:07.520> it's<00:06:08.520> kind<00:06:08.729> of<00:06:08.789> impossible

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
things out of it it's kind of impossible

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.000 
things out of it it's kind of impossible
cuz<00:06:09.539> that's<00:06:09.720> pretty<00:06:10.050> close<00:06:10.289> to<00:06:10.440> your<00:06:10.560> armpit

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
cuz that's pretty close to your armpit

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.310 
cuz that's pretty close to your armpit
so<00:06:11.880> unless<00:06:12.479> you<00:06:12.750> have<00:06:12.780> your<00:06:13.229> purse<00:06:13.530> origin<00:06:15.320> you

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
so unless you have your purse origin you

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.529 
so unless you have your purse origin you
can<00:06:16.470> have<00:06:16.650> it<00:06:16.860> you<00:06:17.190> know<00:06:17.340> unzipped<00:06:18.500> like<00:06:19.500> that

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
can have it you know unzipped like that

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.790 
can have it you know unzipped like that
and<00:06:21.539> many<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.840> you<00:06:21.930> want<00:06:22.110> to<00:06:22.200> grab

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
and many of you want to grab

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.529 
and many of you want to grab
of<00:06:22.979> course<00:06:23.310> it's<00:06:23.520> easier<00:06:23.909> to<00:06:24.060> just<00:06:24.240> kind<00:06:24.449> of

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
of course it's easier to just kind of

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.779 
of course it's easier to just kind of
like<00:06:24.750> that<00:06:24.900> and<00:06:25.139> grab<00:06:25.379> but<00:06:26.099> if<00:06:26.190> it<00:06:26.310> zip<00:06:26.550> it's

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
like that and grab but if it zip it's

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.820 
like that and grab but if it zip it's
pretty<00:06:27.300> much<00:06:27.419> impossible<00:06:29.629> yeah<00:06:30.629> so<00:06:31.110> this<00:06:31.650> is

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
pretty much impossible yeah so this is

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.350 
pretty much impossible yeah so this is
