00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.690 
can improve your free-throw shooting
first<00:00:37.290> we're<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> start<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.129> building

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
first we're going to start with building

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400 
first we're going to start with building
a<00:00:38.790> routine<00:00:39.210> every<00:00:39.660> player's<00:00:39.930> got<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
a routine every player's got to have a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.200 
a routine every player's got to have a
routine<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.340> routine<00:00:41.370> doesn't<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> be

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
routine the routine doesn't have to be

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970 
routine the routine doesn't have to be
the<00:00:42.329> same<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.840> every<00:00:43.050> player<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.739> every

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the same for every player but every

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
the same for every player but every
player's<00:00:44.250> got<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.719> Kyle<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.020> you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
player's got to have one so Kyle if you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.540 
player's got to have one so Kyle if you
would<00:00:46.289> step<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.800> free-throw<00:00:46.980> line<00:00:47.190> here

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
would step to the free-throw line here

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.490 
would step to the free-throw line here
for<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> couple<00:00:49.110> things<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.350> we're

that<00:01:09.409> okay<00:01:10.409> once<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> take<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.040> memory<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that okay once you take that memory and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.859 
that okay once you take that memory and
I<00:01:11.490> want<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.450> mind<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
I want you to put that in your mind I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.240 
I want you to put that in your mind I
want<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> positive<00:01:14.010> thought

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
want that to be the positive thought

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
want that to be the positive thought
that<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.090> every<00:01:15.479> time<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.840> come<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that you have every time you come to the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.730 
that you have every time you come to the
free-throw<00:01:16.380> line

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
free-throw line

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.249 
free-throw line
so<00:01:17.220> sometimes<00:01:17.700> working<00:01:18.420> through<00:01:18.720> reps<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.110> lot

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so sometimes working through reps a lot

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.660 
so sometimes working through reps a lot
of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> basketball<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> mental<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.549> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
of the basketball is mental and so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.280 
of the basketball is mental and so
free-throw<00:01:21.119> shooting<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.750> mental<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.200> at

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
free-throw shooting can be mental and at

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.140 
free-throw shooting can be mental and at
times<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.710> later<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> game<00:01:23.610> gets<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
times as later that the game gets the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.630 
times as later that the game gets the
more<00:01:24.330> pressure<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> comes<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
more pressure that comes the more that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
more pressure that comes the more that
you<00:01:26.850> might<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:27.780> positive

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you might have to think more positive

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.660 
you might have to think more positive
thoughts<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.829> every<00:01:29.100> time<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> step<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
thoughts but every time you step to the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.649 
thoughts but every time you step to the
free-throw<00:01:29.820> line<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> first<00:01:30.329> thing<00:01:30.540> you're

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
free-throw line the first thing you're

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.630 
free-throw line the first thing you're
gonna<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.680> positive<00:01:31.920> thought<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.549> as

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
gonna do is get a positive thought so as

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.550 
gonna do is get a positive thought so as
we<00:01:32.759> go<00:01:32.909> through<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.210> routine<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.290> start

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
we go through this routine and to start

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.710 
we go through this routine and to start
out<00:01:34.770> our<00:01:34.799> first<00:01:35.280> progression<00:01:36.000> we're<00:01:36.420> gonna<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
out our first progression we're gonna to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.740 
out our first progression we're gonna to
shoot<00:01:36.960> ten<00:01:37.259> free-throws<00:01:38.270> concentrating<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
shoot ten free-throws concentrating on a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.850 
shoot ten free-throws concentrating on a
good<00:01:40.140> routine

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
good routine

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.730 
good routine
so<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.909> first<00:01:42.119> step<00:01:42.380> positive<00:01:43.380> thought<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so the first step positive thought you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.429 
so the first step positive thought you
got<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> okay<00:01:44.610> next<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.810> want<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> make<00:01:46.409> sure
