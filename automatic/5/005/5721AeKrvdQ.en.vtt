okay the reflex mirror then lifts up and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.370 
okay the reflex mirror then lifts up and
the<00:01:10.860> sensor<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> exposed<00:01:12.180> again<00:01:12.990> most<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the sensor is exposed again most the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.999 
the sensor is exposed again most the
time<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.909> sensor

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
time you don't want to have the sensor

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.760 
time you don't want to have the sensor
tilt<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:18.060> falling<00:01:18.390> debris<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:19.470> best

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
tilt it up for falling debris it's best

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.149 
tilt it up for falling debris it's best
just<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.130> go<00:01:20.340> ahead<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.909> start<00:01:21.360> again<00:01:22.159> by

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
just to go ahead and start again by

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.600 
just to go ahead and start again by
blowing<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:25.080> an<00:01:25.200> upright<00:01:25.530> parody<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:26.400> right

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
blowing in an upright parody down right

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
blowing in an upright parody down right
position<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.299> any<00:01:28.020> extra<00:01:28.439> particles<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.130> fall

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
position so any extra particles can fall

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.800 
position so any extra particles can fall
down<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.350> suggest<00:01:31.350> purchasing<00:01:32.479> one<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.540> these

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
down I suggest purchasing one of these

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.600 
down I suggest purchasing one of these
devices<00:01:34.200> they<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.890> them<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.280> cleaning

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
devices they have them for cleaning

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.700 
devices they have them for cleaning
prints<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.630> loop<00:01:36.900> situation

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
prints it's kind of a loop situation

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.130 
prints it's kind of a loop situation
it's<00:01:38.369> gots<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:38.939> magnifier<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> with

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's gots a little magnifier on it with

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.950 
it's gots a little magnifier on it with
some<00:01:40.290> LEDs<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.460> will<00:01:41.640> fit<00:01:41.850> directly<00:01:42.150> over<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
some LEDs it will fit directly over and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490 
some LEDs it will fit directly over and
so<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.100> look<00:01:44.280> down<00:01:44.549> inside<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.720> see

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
so that you can look down inside and see

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
so that you can look down inside and see
where<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> dust<00:01:47.790> particles<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
where some of the dust particles and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.170 
where some of the dust particles and
everything<00:01:49.049> might<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.560> accumulated<00:01:50.180> that

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
everything might have accumulated that
