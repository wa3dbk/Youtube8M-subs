00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
it'll it'll creator of because of the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.310 
it'll it'll creator of because of the
orange<00:03:00.900> peel<00:03:01.250> really<00:03:02.250> super<00:03:02.790> bad<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:04.110> was

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
orange peel really super bad and I was

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.620 
orange peel really super bad and I was
really<00:03:04.830> surprised<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.670> after<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.300> was<00:03:06.450> all

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
really surprised that after it was all

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.380 
really surprised that after it was all
done<00:03:06.680> it's<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.800> hard<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:09.060> just

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
done it's just hard and it's just

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.130 
done it's just hard and it's just
beautiful<00:03:09.980> now<00:03:10.980> now<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.600> finish

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
beautiful now now I have to finish

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.620 
beautiful now now I have to finish
sanding<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.160> probably<00:03:14.700> sand<00:03:15.030> most<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.510> this

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
sanding and probably sand most of this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.440 
sanding and probably sand most of this
off<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:16.200> it'll<00:03:16.680> be<00:03:16.830> thicker<00:03:17.190> than<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
off because it'll be thicker than the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.660 
off because it'll be thicker than the
regular<00:03:18.900> than<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.770> rest<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.190> boat<00:03:20.430> so

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
regular than the rest of the boat so

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.990 
regular than the rest of the boat so
it'll<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.870> probably<00:03:22.140> be<00:03:22.500> sanded<00:03:23.040> off<00:03:23.190> but

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
it'll have to probably be sanded off but

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.090 
it'll have to probably be sanded off but
I<00:03:24.030> kept<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.570> on<00:03:24.690> here<00:03:25.020> just<00:03:25.050> as<00:03:25.560> kind<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.890> like<00:03:25.950> a
