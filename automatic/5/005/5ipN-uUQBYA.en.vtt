00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.600 
would and I like this part on the front
um<00:03:44.320> this<00:03:45.320> shoots<00:03:45.830> pretty<00:03:46.250> good<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.310> can

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
um this shoots pretty good but it can

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.820 
um this shoots pretty good but it can
break<00:03:49.820> if<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.150> put<00:03:50.360> too<00:03:50.390> much<00:03:50.720> pressure<00:03:50.989> on<00:03:51.500> it

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
break if you put too much pressure on it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.330 
break if you put too much pressure on it
