00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 friends of windows and casket in eye case 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.509
 here we are finally with the nokia lumia 920 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.980
 Nokia Italia provided it to us on trial 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.279
 for a few days it is finally even 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.930
 we can show you all his 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.970
 functionality and features both a 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.809
 hardware level and software 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.600
 this however is a brief preview just 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.130
 to provide you with some information 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.350
 preliminaries 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.640
 first I tell you the first one 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.490
 impression is very good at 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.130
 feel is very pleasant the surface in 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.660
 glossy and very pleasant polycarbonate 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.260
 to hold in your hand 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:00.280
 the fingerprints remain on the display 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.500
 that on the back but let's say 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.270
 this is a minor problem 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.909
 the weight is 185 grams as known but this 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.540
 it is well distributed over the entire surface 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:18.970
 of the device therefore it is a weight that yes 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.159
 feels relatively as I said this 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.740
 but I want to show you a preview 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.420
 some new windows phone 8 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.700
 briefly then we go into the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.670
 settings I show the 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.490
 bluetooth as we know in windows 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 phone 8 is unlocked so I can 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.740
 transfer to another device 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.990
 compatible any type of file us 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.619
 we tried with a nokia n8 a 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.710
 send a photo and an mp3 and we are 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.360
 managed to transfer these files without 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.950
 no problem 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.600
 other novelty of windows phone 8 is the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.670
 lock screen which is now much more 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.830
 customizable as you see I have the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.060
 possibility to choose an application 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.420
 to show his picture in 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.670
 lockscreen or I can choose which ones 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.860
 notifications just display but this 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.260
 we will see it in more detail in 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.140
 another occasion 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.290
 another very fast thing that I want to do to you 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.430
 see is the backup the back up that 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.030
 allows you to save on the su 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.700
 skydrive sms and photos le 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.620
 applications and some settings of the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.520
 phone so I can safely 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.370
 after a possible reset of the device 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.690
 just restore everything back to the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.690
 phone as it was before 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.270
 this is the other novelty of windows phone 8 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.870
 we say application that allows us to 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.120
 see also in a graphic way how 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.850
 available space or inside the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.660
 mass memory as we know the nokia 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.050
 lumia 920 at 32 gigabytes of memory 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.250
 mass 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.660
 I currently occupied 3.32 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:18.430
 gigabytes with mp3 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:22.610
 another novelty that I want to show you is 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.250
 accessibility accessibility allows 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.010
 to increase or decrease to own 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.140
 liking the font the size of the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.870
 system font so if I have 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.410
 some problems of view I can 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.690
 increase it and then I'll show you one 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.530
 increased time I go to contacts for 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.250
 example but this also happens in others 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.739
 applications 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.750
 therefore in the contacts for example I open 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.090
 my trial contact and see that I have 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.170
 the number finally the number of 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.430
 phone and finally with a character 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:02.489
 bigger and the other last news that 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.489
 I want to show you a preview, let's say 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.420
 the option that allows us to activate e 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.280
 disable the display sensitivity 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.470
 as we know this display is a super 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.989
 sensitive touch therefore allows us to 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.669
 use it also with gloves or with 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.739
 other objects so if I want 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.150
 use it also with other old ones with 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.950
 gloves 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.660
 enough that the active is active this 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.229
 functionality so I can 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.639
 quietly use it with one 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.639
 greater sensitivity 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.750
 I would say that this is all for the moment 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.540
 as you can see I have wireless here too 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.370
 charging fat boy that lets like 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:48.130
 we know we charge the phone without 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.970
 the clutter of the wires or whatever I can 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.880
 quietly rest it and remove it 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.210
 without having to remove any wires then 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.520
 very practical for this as you see 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.340
 put it back there because the charge of 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.680
 battery is almost exhausted 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.870
 I refer you to our lives 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.820
 more in-depth review than 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.450
 will publish in the coming days and to such 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.229
 I ask you if you have any questions 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.800
 curiosity I have another point to ask 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.470
 to forward everything in the comments and with 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.280
 pleasure as we say immediately as we say

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.770
 all your questions 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:38.229
 so I greet you for the moment and there 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.650

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.330
 hello everyone from wissel a
