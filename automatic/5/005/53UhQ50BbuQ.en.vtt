00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.520 
disks you got your book and then you got
your<00:03:11.370> game<00:03:12.299> which<00:03:12.780> would<00:03:13.139> look<00:03:13.230> pretty<00:03:13.440> good

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
your game which would look pretty good

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.039 
your game which would look pretty good
on<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.250> shelf<00:03:14.489> because<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.970> double<00:03:15.510> wide<00:03:15.690> um

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
on the shelf because it's double wide um

I like it when games come out and they

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.259 
I like it when games come out and they
make<00:03:19.049> them<00:03:19.169> a<00:03:19.260> little<00:03:19.380> bit<00:03:19.590> bigger<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:19.980> that

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269
