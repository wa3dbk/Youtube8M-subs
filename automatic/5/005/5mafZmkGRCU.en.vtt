00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
 I all wanted to love today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 address what you can do if you are 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.460
 surrounded by parents and caring 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 people who are against the vegan 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.800
 Whole nutrition is and still is 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 In addition, it is surrounded by doctors 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.420
 Do not support the vegan diet 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.480
 although good blood values there I am 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.789
 I am always contacted by 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.590
 Minors of teenagers say I 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.080
 because I want to do it well 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.630
 is the only right thing for me yes me 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.270
 also remember totally healthy and 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 try to avoid junk food and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.690
 I'm totally super so not for 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.250
 me good but somehow mine are 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.750
 Parents totally against me and want that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.120
 I eat meat again because my doctor 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.789
 said so I would on duration 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.840
 totally the lack of appearance 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.329
 and Jesus do not quite go that way anymore 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.530
 good with comfort so yes it would be totally 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.789
 the malnutrition story that I have there 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 would drive if I go in 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.750
 eat vegetables and yes then 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.280
 still oil away so bad 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.380
 Usually such statements come from 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.909
 People do not even know about 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.070
 really have health and nutrition 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.080
 because she herself is not 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.900
 embody yes, you come most of the time 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.580
 doctors are so all the time 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.960
 maybe still smoking under stress 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 Drinks coffee and yes treat patients 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 with tablets just just tablets 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.380
 off and therapies out and here but there 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.640
 make no real difference 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 what can you do the doctor 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.400
 switch 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920
 you can try that you can 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.610
 somehow borrow that says hey mommy 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.899
 papi look that's great the disaster 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.820
 but let's have one more 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.500
 second opinion, seek so let us 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.060
 In addition, go to the doctor where you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.280
 perhaps googled has 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.000
 always links here a video 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.220
 respectively 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 a video i say which websites 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.240
 can use to see what doctors 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.910
 in your environment, they are just like that 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.260
 pure vegetable feed or beta 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.590
 feed and per purely herbal 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.940
 are tuned yes what can 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.740
 You, your parents, can do it now and then 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.510
 once again leave an internet page 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.770
 yes, for example, a fixed point orca 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.450
 can you tell your doctor? 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.280
 Mr. doctor look there but there 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.500
 there are many studies that makes 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000
 also a doctor who if you still 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.660
 are not well informed 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.530
 I also like to give them in form atrial 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.220
 you can like to recommend books or 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.770
 recommend it mostly is difficult 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.959
 buy her the book and just leave it 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.280
 with their parents on the desk 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.459
 lie or even on the kitchen table 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.130
 yes you'll see someday 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.560
 hold each either they believe is 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.390
 to clear things up or they take hold 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.010
 really look in and then 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.940
 Did you actually win because 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.480
 then they are closer to yours 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.970
 nutrition and we also have others 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.730
 other opinions to read because you 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.950
 hears only often if you are in 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.810
 such circles is with parents the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.880
 think totally negatively about vegan 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.980
 Nutrition and family totally negative 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.190
 thinks and physicians who think totally negative 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.290
 You hear only bad things 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.850
 years and does not hear the positive 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.380
 successes and maybe even know 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.480
 not or at least a bit parents 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.160
 and the doctor does not care for that 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.690
 illnesses can cure that too 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.720
 totally good for the prevention of 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.670
 Illnesses is that's what you're doing 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.410
 no heart attack risk get it 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.630
 can not get a stroke yes 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:56.870
 no diabetes and alzheimer's get 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.870
 everything from there 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.740
 you can try so a bit 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.480
 Information always a bit 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.820
 always to be involved 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.070
 say something for example know 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.740
 I 've been here with you recently 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.390
 who has spoken and who has none 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.330
 A clue has to be with it again 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.560
 getting into the grip or neurodermatitis 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.730
 or has lost a lot of weight with it and 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.320
 has totally good sporting successes with it 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.500
 but basically you can 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.780
 just be the shining example 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.210
 that's the thing that's the most convincing 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.820
 because you can just your parents 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.580
 convince them to trust in 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.550
 you can have that you that what you 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.410
 you're doing pretty well over night 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.150
 that you want the best for you and 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.710
 that's really good for you 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.080
 you're doing and you can only do that 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.450
 first of all, that's about it 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.360
 happy makes you this so live like 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.150
 wanting to live is yes 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.470
 second, that it makes you easy 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.000
 lets radiate that you are totally happy 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.550
 and the other one is really the one 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.100
 notice difference and they will 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.900
 yes, nobody guarantees to try 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.120
 convince but just try 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.250
 to offer information pieces 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.010
 I know that we all save the world 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.100
 want to start when we start 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.360
 to feed on vegetables and that we 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.370
 all people want to recommend that too 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.090
 because we are really excited about it and 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.500
 because we like to have information 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.270
 not all people have yet 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.340
 you want to hear that and you have to 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.700
 Unfortunately, I just accept that 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.220
 sometimes I know that too 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.820
 it can not be that easy 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.820
 people all day and I have 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.960
 constantly talking about their illnesses and 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.550
 just yet how bad it is indeed when 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.100
 one then says yes ahead, have some the 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:58.410
 and that's why I've got that already 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:01.060
 I've been doing this for a while, I do not know 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.980
 renounce 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.139
 of such people when it comes trendy 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:09.730
 You just do not do that well 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.710
 with people I support too 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.070
 very important and if it's just online 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.150
 yes, you are looking for a meeting in the city 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.150
 sought support in the circle of friends 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.200
 That's what I recommend to you 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:28.200
 I would wish that one 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.230
 couple of you pds respectively 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.760
 juveniles the vegans feed themselves 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.130
 and sometimes problems in the family 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.460
 had a few comments left there 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.440
 who you have so curled and yes 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.090
 also what your doctor has said it and 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.860
 like that and maybe you somehow 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.139
 times have gotten in the direction 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.540
 that he informs himself about it now 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:55.770
 and then I hope the video has 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.940
 anyone i hope that really wants 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.000
 So, honestly, do so much 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.500
 Can you help yourself if someone does not want to 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.389
 do not want to take any information and 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.460
 convinced that what he from 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.930
 30 years ago 40 years ago 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.320
 today is still correct and no 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.180
 then cosmopolitan attitude has then 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.039
 Do not you miss that I have to go all the way 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.500
 honestly, I just want to tell you 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.630
 Do not make too much hope 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.250
 but you know what is wrong 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.250
 and that's what it's all about 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.460
 I wish you all the best 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.460
 ciao
