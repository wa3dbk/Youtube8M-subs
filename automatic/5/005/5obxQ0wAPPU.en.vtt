just going to go over some of the basic
features<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:06.629> application<00:00:06.980> you<00:00:07.980> can<00:00:08.010> see

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
features of this application you can see

features of this application you can see
that<00:00:08.490> i<00:00:08.519> currently<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:09.300> my<00:00:09.599> iphone<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.820> what

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
that i currently have my iphone in what

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.890 
that i currently have my iphone in what
we<00:00:11.940> would<00:00:12.030> call<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.480> landscape<00:00:13.080> mode<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
we would call a landscape mode the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.560 
we would call a landscape mode the
program<00:00:15.900> does<00:00:16.080> operate<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.340> either<00:00:18.150> mode

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
program does operate in in either mode

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.590 
program does operate in in either mode
so<00:00:19.020> let's<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.590> show<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:21.000> i<00:00:21.119> rotate<00:00:21.449> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
so let's just show you if i rotate it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900 
so let's just show you if i rotate it
left<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.020> screen<00:00:22.260> will<00:00:22.380> turn<00:00:22.529> left<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:23.519> i

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
left or screen will turn left if i

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.220 
left or screen will turn left if i
rotate<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:24.570> or<00:00:24.720> screen<00:00:24.990> will<00:00:25.080> turn

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
rotate it right or screen will turn

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.290 
rotate it right or screen will turn
right<00:00:25.439> that'll<00:00:26.130> happen<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.519> any<00:00:26.609> screen<00:00:26.910> so

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
right that'll happen on any screen so

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.290 
right that'll happen on any screen so
fully<00:00:28.010> compatible<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.880> most<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.240> the

formats UTM whatever you like and then
this<00:01:04.920> NTS<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:05.970> commonly<00:01:06.299> use

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
this NTS that's what they commonly use

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
this NTS that's what they commonly use
in<00:01:06.600> bc<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> well<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.979> well<00:01:08.159> site<00:01:08.430> naming

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
in bc for the well the well site naming

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.969 
in bc for the well the well site naming
out<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.060> let's<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:09.960> go<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.619> let's<00:01:10.799> do

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
out there let's just go up here let's do

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.730 
out there let's just go up here let's do
LSD<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> second<00:01:12.450> i'm<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> make

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
LSD for a second i'm just going to make

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
LSD for a second i'm just going to make
one<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> nice<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.030> spinny<00:01:15.420> wheel

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
one up we get a nice little spinny wheel

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.859 
one up we get a nice little spinny wheel
when<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.350> when<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:16.920> search<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.250> these<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
when we when we search for these so we

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.460 
when we when we search for these so we
know<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.110> can't<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:19.439> wrong

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.480 

so<00:01:23.400> I'm<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> make<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:25.160> an<00:01:26.160> LSD

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
so I'm just going to make up a an LSD

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.890 
so I'm just going to make up a an LSD
location<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.480> for<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.690> sake<00:01:27.870> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
location here just for the sake of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.530 
location here just for the sake of
showing<00:01:28.080> us<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.590> how<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.830> works<00:01:29.240> I'm<00:01:30.240> ready

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
showing us all how it works I'm ready

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
showing us all how it works I'm ready
unless<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.140> let's<00:01:31.620> choose<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> third<00:01:32.100> will

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
unless you let's choose the third will

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.740 
unless you let's choose the third will
choose<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> sketch<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.330> we<00:01:33.450> like

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
choose a sketch on because we like

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.860 
choose a sketch on because we like
Saskatchewan<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.360> calculate<00:01:36.360> distance<00:01:36.720> using

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
Saskatchewan so calculate distance using

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.990 
Saskatchewan so calculate distance using
that's<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.380> asking<00:01:37.530> me<00:01:37.860> how<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> want<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> show

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that's just asking me how I want to show

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
that's just asking me how I want to show
this<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.300> distance<00:01:39.840> number<00:01:40.230> that<00:01:40.410> you're

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this little distance number that you're

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.260 
this little distance number that you're
going<00:01:40.620> to<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.190> one<00:01:41.370> here<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:42.120> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
going to see here this one here you can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.400 
going to see here this one here you can
see<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.630> very<00:01:42.810> far<00:01:43.170> away<00:01:43.260> from

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
see that I'm very far away from

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.740 
see that I'm very far away from
Saskatchewan<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.190> now<00:01:44.370> so<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.600> my

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
Saskatchewan right now so so that's my
