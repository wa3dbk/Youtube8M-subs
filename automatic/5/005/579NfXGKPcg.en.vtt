stay tuned man so basically the math can

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.529 
stay tuned man so basically the math can
be<00:00:15.540> calculated<00:00:15.870> by<00:00:16.199> dividing<00:00:17.180> 3,100<00:00:18.180> units

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
be calculated by dividing 3,100 units

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.120 
be calculated by dividing 3,100 units
from<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> total<00:00:19.380> sum<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.770> buying<00:00:20.010> the

actually I'm actually press us back

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.410 
actually I'm actually press us back
whenever<00:02:00.270> I

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
whenever I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.020 
whenever I
start<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.259> new<00:02:03.290> spin<00:02:03.830> this<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.759> because

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
start a new spin this is because

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.510 
start a new spin this is because
Ranelagh<00:02:05.509> actually<00:02:05.869> see<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.740> role<00:02:07.040> of<00:02:07.070> spins

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
Ranelagh actually see the role of spins

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.300 
Ranelagh actually see the role of spins
a<00:02:07.880> ton<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.450> toast<00:02:08.869> or<00:02:09.110> crackers<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.800> would

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
a ton of toast or crackers I would

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.910 
a ton of toast or crackers I would
definitely<00:02:10.429> go<00:02:11.030> back<00:02:11.060> go<00:02:11.690> press<00:02:11.959> back<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.830> the

definitely go back go press back to the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.089 
definitely go back go press back to the
crystal<00:02:13.370> vault<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.930> restart<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.860> whole

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
crystal vault and just restart the whole

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.610 
crystal vault and just restart the whole
system<00:02:16.340> again<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.630> way<00:02:17.900> I'm<00:02:18.170> actually

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
system again in this way I'm actually

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.840 
system again in this way I'm actually
refreshing<00:02:19.340> your<00:02:19.700> whole<00:02:19.970> rule<00:02:20.239> itself<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.850> let

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
refreshing your whole rule itself so let

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.820 
refreshing your whole rule itself so let
me<00:02:22.880> explain<00:02:23.209> it<00:02:23.239> in<00:02:23.450> detail<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:24.319> example<00:02:24.680> in

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
me explain it in detail for example in

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.590 
me explain it in detail for example in
the<00:02:25.010> role<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.220> screen<00:02:25.580> you'll<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.209> getting<00:02:26.480> a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
the role of screen you'll be getting a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.710 
the role of screen you'll be getting a
Champions<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.489> Champions<00:02:29.090> maybe<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.569> love

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
Champions so a Champions maybe if I love

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.040 
Champions so a Champions maybe if I love
it<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.050> like<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:31.010> star<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.489> 14<00:02:32.360> *<00:02:32.569> in<00:02:32.599> 23

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
it it's like to star and 14 * in 23

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.530 
it it's like to star and 14 * in 23
starts<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.950> kind<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.280> role<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.550> spin<00:02:34.819> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
starts this kind of role of spin the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.360 
starts this kind of role of spin the
also<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.050> getting<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.410> tree<00:02:36.620> star<00:02:36.860> at<00:02:37.040> least

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
also if you getting a tree star at least

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.820 
also if you getting a tree star at least
is<00:02:37.610> them<00:02:37.910> low<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.780> what<00:02:38.989> I'm<00:02:39.080> gonna<00:02:39.200> do<00:02:39.410> I'm

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
is them low so what I'm gonna do I'm

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.210 
is them low so what I'm gonna do I'm
just<00:02:39.950> gonna<00:02:40.040> press<00:02:40.310> back<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.880> just<00:02:41.450> go

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
just gonna press back and just go

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.330 
just gonna press back and just go
basically<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.549> go<00:02:44.540> drag<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> crystals<00:02:45.920> go

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
basically just go drag the crystals go

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.270 
basically just go drag the crystals go
back<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:47.049> opening<00:02:48.049> this<00:02:48.170> crystal<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.860> this

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
back to opening this crystal in this

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.550 
back to opening this crystal in this
space<00:02:49.489> right<00:02:49.700> here<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:51.019> way<00:02:51.290> I'm

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
space right here and this way I'm

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.900 
space right here and this way I'm
actually<00:02:51.830> refreshing<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.549> whole<00:02:52.730> real

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
actually refreshing the whole real

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.180 
actually refreshing the whole real
assistant<00:02:53.420> by<00:02:53.959> getting<00:02:54.200> new<00:02:54.470> characters<00:02:54.920> back

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
assistant by getting new characters back

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.120 
assistant by getting new characters back
and<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.900> will<00:02:57.200> keep<00:02:57.440> refreshing<00:02:57.709> this

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
and so I will keep refreshing this

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.070 
and so I will keep refreshing this
system<00:02:58.519> at<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.910> get<00:02:58.970> like<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.540> rule<00:03:00.049> of

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
system at you I get like a rule of

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.210 
system at you I get like a rule of
spin-off<00:03:00.680> maybe<00:03:01.459> 5<00:03:01.910> 3<00:03:02.510> star<00:03:02.780> characters<00:03:03.230> for

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
spin-off maybe 5 3 star characters for

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.819 
spin-off maybe 5 3 star characters for
tree<00:03:04.459> stock<00:03:04.670> characters<00:03:05.090> 14<00:03:05.690> *<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.560> way<00:03:06.799> I

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
tree stock characters 14 * this way I

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.310 
tree stock characters 14 * this way I
should<00:03:07.100> attain<00:03:07.549> a<00:03:07.609> higher<00:03:07.970> rate<00:03:08.299> compared<00:03:09.140> to

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
should attain a higher rate compared to

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.560 
should attain a higher rate compared to
those<00:03:09.500> five<00:03:09.920> two<00:03:10.160> stars<00:03:10.489> roller<00:03:10.760> spins<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
those five two stars roller spins and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.900 
those five two stars roller spins and
this<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.560> reason<00:03:12.709> why<00:03:13.070> I'm<00:03:13.250> constantly

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
this the reason why I'm constantly

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.590 
this the reason why I'm constantly
pressing<00:03:14.750> back<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:16.310> spinning<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.390> once

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
pressing back and just spinning it once

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.840 
pressing back and just spinning it once
again<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.739> course<00:03:18.769> I'm<00:03:19.100> also<00:03:19.280> trying<00:03:19.730> to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
again and of course I'm also trying to

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.539 
again and of course I'm also trying to
if<00:03:20.750> it's<00:03:20.989> possible<00:03:21.200> in<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.620> future<00:03:21.980> update<00:03:22.010> I'm
