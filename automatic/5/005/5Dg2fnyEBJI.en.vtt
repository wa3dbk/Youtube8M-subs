this<00:00:13.630> presentation<00:00:14.170> we<00:00:14.769> shall<00:00:14.950> build<00:00:15.099> a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
this presentation we shall build a

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.760 
this presentation we shall build a
anchor<00:00:15.759> and<00:00:15.910> chain<00:00:15.940> by<00:00:16.900> using<00:00:17.110> just<00:00:17.410> basic

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
anchor and chain by using just basic

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.679 
anchor and chain by using just basic
primitive<00:00:18.489> type<00:00:18.669> objects<00:00:19.090> and<00:00:19.270> then<00:00:19.390> filling

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
primitive type objects and then filling

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.179 
primitive type objects and then filling
and<00:00:20.020> blending<00:00:20.320> them<00:00:20.439> all<00:00:20.560> together<00:00:20.739> to<00:00:21.070> create

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
and blending them all together to create

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.330 
and blending them all together to create
the<00:00:21.369> one<00:00:21.550> single<00:00:21.970> solid<00:00:22.630> anchor<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.890> chain<00:00:24.130> is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
the one single solid anchor the chain is

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.679 
the one single solid anchor the chain is
comprised<00:00:24.700> of<00:00:24.700> a<00:00:24.880> single<00:00:25.149> link<00:00:25.329> which<00:00:25.570> we

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
comprised of a single link which we

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.569 
comprised of a single link which we
multicopy<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.410> then<00:00:26.500> we<00:00:26.619> bend<00:00:26.890> those<00:00:27.220> links

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
multicopy and then we bend those links

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.310 
multicopy and then we bend those links
along<00:00:27.759> a<00:00:27.820> path<00:00:29.579> we<00:00:30.579> begin<00:00:30.969> by<00:00:31.300> using<00:00:31.750> just<00:00:32.169> the

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
along a path we begin by using just the

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.650 
along a path we begin by using just the
primitive<00:00:33.070> tools<00:00:33.340> we'll<00:00:33.730> pull<00:00:33.940> those<00:00:34.120> out<00:00:34.300> and

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
primitive tools we'll pull those out and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.090 
primitive tools we'll pull those out and
maybe<00:00:35.020> for<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.290> shank<00:00:35.650> use<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.670> cone<00:00:38.100> extrude

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
maybe for the shank use a cone extrude

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.950 
maybe for the shank use a cone extrude
it<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.370> height<00:00:39.520> that<00:00:39.700> we<00:00:39.850> want<00:00:40.150> and<00:00:40.630> then

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
it to the height that we want and then

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.810 
it to the height that we want and then
of<00:00:41.050> course<00:00:41.080> we<00:00:41.440> can<00:00:41.590> use<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:41.950> Edit<00:00:42.310> controls

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
of course we can use the Edit controls

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.480 
of course we can use the Edit controls
tool<00:00:43.240> on<00:00:43.540> any<00:00:44.440> type<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.710> object<00:00:44.950> for<00:00:45.460> example

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
tool on any type of object for example

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.940 
tool on any type of object for example
this<00:00:45.850> cone<00:00:46.150> by<00:00:46.420> simply<00:00:47.110> moving<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.470> top<00:00:47.740> or

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
this cone by simply moving the top or

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.260 
this cone by simply moving the top or
bottom<00:00:48.100> radius<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.680> eye<00:00:50.980> ring<00:00:51.850> on<00:00:52.030> top

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
bottom radius for the eye ring on top

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.830 
bottom radius for the eye ring on top
I'll<00:00:52.540> use<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.690> torus<00:00:53.170> shape<00:00:53.650> for<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.660> sort

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
I'll use a torus shape for that to sort

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.180 
I'll use a torus shape for that to sort
of<00:00:55.930> type<00:00:56.110> in<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.350> radius<00:00:56.620> values<00:00:56.950> that<00:00:57.070> we

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
of type in the radius values that we

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.229 
of type in the radius values that we
need<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:57.640> move<00:00:58.060> that<00:00:58.239> into<00:00:58.480> position<00:00:59.110> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
need and move that into position and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.120 
need and move that into position and
then<00:01:01.239> using<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.810> fill<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.410> tool<00:01:02.590> what<00:01:02.890> we<00:01:02.980> can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
then using the fill it tool what we can

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.009 
then using the fill it tool what we can
do<00:01:03.250> is<00:01:03.399> sort<00:01:03.550> of<00:01:03.640> fill<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:04.000> any<00:01:04.239> two<00:01:04.449> objects

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
do is sort of fill it any two objects

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.630 
do is sort of fill it any two objects
together<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:05.950> can<00:01:06.040> see<00:01:06.190> in<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.310> smooth

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
together you can see in a smooth

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.670 
together you can see in a smooth
transition<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.390> then<00:01:07.780> blended<00:01:08.170> together<00:01:08.290> to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
transition is then blended together to

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.410 
transition is then blended together to
create<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.010> one<00:01:09.190> single<00:01:09.670> solid<00:01:10.390> object<00:01:12.420> for

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
create the one single solid object for

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.270 
create the one single solid object for
the<00:01:13.450> crossbar<00:01:14.080> what<00:01:14.350> I'll<00:01:14.470> do<00:01:14.620> is<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.800> once

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
the crossbar what I'll do is a once

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.539 
the crossbar what I'll do is a once
again<00:01:15.370> create<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.850> cone<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.200> I'll<00:01:17.650> edit<00:01:17.920> the

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
again create a cone and I'll edit the

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.690 
again create a cone and I'll edit the
top<00:01:18.790> radius<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.650> desired<00:01:21.010> radius<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.580> we

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
top radius to the desired radius that we

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.690 
top radius to the desired radius that we
need<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.620> then<00:01:23.620> I'll<00:01:23.710> just<00:01:23.740> simply<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.340> move

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
need and then I'll just simply a move

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.740 
need and then I'll just simply a move
that<00:01:24.970> part<00:01:25.630> into<00:01:26.020> position<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:28.510> cross

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
that part into position and the cross

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.620 
that part into position and the cross
bar<00:01:28.930> has<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.229> little<00:01:29.560> ball<00:01:30.010> at<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.340> end<00:01:30.549> so<00:01:31.479> what

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
bar has a little ball at the end so what

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
bar has a little ball at the end so what
I'll<00:01:31.750> do<00:01:31.869> is<00:01:31.900> just<00:01:32.110> put<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.290> little<00:01:32.320> sphere

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
I'll do is just put a little sphere

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.910 
I'll do is just put a little sphere
right<00:01:33.970> on<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.240> end<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.840> then<00:01:35.500> once<00:01:35.650> again

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
right on the end and then once again

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.280 
right on the end and then once again
I'll<00:01:36.040> go<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.490> fill<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.850> tool<00:01:37.180> just<00:01:38.110> simply

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
I'll go to the fill it tool just simply

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.870 
I'll go to the fill it tool just simply
click<00:01:38.560> on<00:01:38.680> those<00:01:38.770> two<00:01:38.979> objects<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.610> create<00:01:39.760> a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
click on those two objects to create a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.149 
click on those two objects to create a
nice<00:01:40.049> transitional<00:01:41.049> fill<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.860> combine

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
nice transitional fill it to combine

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.060 
nice transitional fill it to combine
those<00:01:42.310> together<00:01:42.900> let's<00:01:43.900> mirror<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.530> copy

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
those together let's mirror and copy

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.590 
those together let's mirror and copy
this<00:01:46.060> object<00:01:46.540> over<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.020> other<00:01:47.110> side<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
this object over to the other side and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.950 
this object over to the other side and
then<00:01:50.110> I'll<00:01:50.260> use<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.650> fill<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.860> tool<00:01:51.159> again<00:01:51.640> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
then I'll use the fill a tool again to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.980 
then I'll use the fill a tool again to
fill<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.110> both<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.100> crossbar<00:01:54.970> members<00:01:55.390> to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
fill it both of the crossbar members to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.539 
fill it both of the crossbar members to
the<00:01:56.110> main<00:01:56.290> shank<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.100> anchor<00:01:59.250> now<00:02:00.250> down<00:02:00.460> at

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
the main shank of the anchor now down at

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.130 
the main shank of the anchor now down at
the<00:02:00.640> bottom<00:02:00.790> will<00:02:01.090> go<00:02:01.180> ahead<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.390> create<00:02:01.630> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
the bottom will go ahead and create the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.399 
the bottom will go ahead and create the
arm<00:02:02.409> of<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.680> anchor<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.960> can<00:02:05.080> see<00:02:05.259> with

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
arm of the anchor and you can see with

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.369 
arm of the anchor and you can see with
the<00:02:05.939> primitive<00:02:06.939> tools<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.390> modify<00:02:07.869> some<00:02:08.289> of

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
the primitive tools I can modify some of

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.199 
the primitive tools I can modify some of
the<00:02:08.439> parameters<00:02:08.649> such<00:02:09.129> as<00:02:09.189> making<00:02:09.519> it<00:02:09.819> an

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
the parameters such as making it an

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.780 
the parameters such as making it an
elliptical<00:02:10.959> type<00:02:11.260> cone<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.189> a<00:02:12.430> surface

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
elliptical type cone and a surface

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.900 
elliptical type cone and a surface
object

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
object

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.540 
object
and<00:02:14.210> if<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.570> choose<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:15.110> closure<00:02:15.860> option<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.430> be

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
and if I choose the closure option to be

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.310 
and if I choose the closure option to be
none<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.420> then<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.690> see<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.930> instead

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
none that then you can see that instead

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.470 
none that then you can see that instead
of<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.500> solid<00:02:18.770> cone<00:02:19.190> it's<00:02:19.850> an<00:02:19.970> actual<00:02:20.180> surface

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
of a solid cone it's an actual surface

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
object for the Fluke of the arm we can

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.190 
object for the Fluke of the arm we can
do<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.910> paraboloid<00:02:26.620> once<00:02:27.620> again<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
do a paraboloid once again just to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.450 
do a paraboloid once again just to
create<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> radiuses<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.010> want<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
create the radiuses that we want and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.750 
create the radiuses that we want and
extrude<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.750> shade<00:02:32.990> that<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.260> need<00:02:33.760> then

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
extrude that the shade that we need then

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.690 
extrude that the shade that we need then
maybe<00:02:34.910> move<00:02:35.030> into<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.420> front<00:02:35.840> view<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.700> I'll

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
maybe move into a front view and I'll

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.410 
maybe move into a front view and I'll
move<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:39.280> right<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.490> end<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.060> arm

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
move that right on the end of the arm

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.820 
move that right on the end of the arm
then<00:02:41.690> I'll<00:02:41.810> leave<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.080> little<00:02:42.230> gap<00:02:42.320> there

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
then I'll leave a little gap there

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.430 
then I'll leave a little gap there
because<00:02:43.190> what<00:02:43.370> I'm<00:02:43.460> going<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.760> do<00:02:43.940> now<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.840> use

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
because what I'm going to do now is use

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.740 
because what I'm going to do now is use
the<00:02:45.740> blend<00:02:46.160> tool<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.880> blend<00:02:47.150> any<00:02:47.450> two

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
the blend tool and I can blend any two

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.840 
the blend tool and I can blend any two
types<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.170> objects<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.830> this<00:02:49.310> case<00:02:49.550> I'll<00:02:49.700> just

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
types of objects in this case I'll just

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.570 
types of objects in this case I'll just
click<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.420> surfaces<00:02:51.080> are<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.130> faces<00:02:52.550> of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
click on the surfaces are the faces of

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.040 
click on the surfaces are the faces of
both<00:02:52.820> those<00:02:53.000> objects<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.630> we'll<00:02:53.750> create<00:02:53.900> a

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
both those objects and we'll create a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.290 
both those objects and we'll create a
nice<00:02:54.170> smooth<00:02:54.700> transitional<00:02:55.700> blend<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.210> I

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
nice smooth transitional blend and I

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.880 
nice smooth transitional blend and I
have<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.540> stitch<00:02:56.750> option<00:02:57.140> on<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.410> it'll<00:02:57.740> also

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
have the stitch option on so it'll also

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.530 
have the stitch option on so it'll also
stitch<00:02:58.280> those<00:02:58.490> pieces<00:02:58.790> together<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.390> create

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
stitch those pieces together to create

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.230 
stitch those pieces together to create
one<00:02:59.840> single<00:03:00.200> object<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:01.580> then<00:03:01.850> using<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
one single object and then using the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.210 
one single object and then using the
radial<00:03:02.630> bend<00:03:02.870> tool<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.410> simply<00:03:03.860> grab<00:03:04.070> that

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
radial bend tool I can simply grab that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.180 
radial bend tool I can simply grab that
object<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.730> bend<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.990> desired<00:03:06.620> radius

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
object and bend it to the desired radius

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.920 
object and bend it to the desired radius
that<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.430> want<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:07.970> can<00:03:08.150> also<00:03:08.330> either<00:03:08.810> do<00:03:08.900> it

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
that I want I can also either do it

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.460 
that I want I can also either do it
graphically<00:03:09.440> or<00:03:09.650> type<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.160> number<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.960> then

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
graphically or type in a number and then

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.170 
graphically or type in a number and then
I'll<00:03:12.560> simply<00:03:12.890> take<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.160> part<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:13.790> move<00:03:14.000> that

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
I'll simply take that part and move that

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.949 
I'll simply take that part and move that
into<00:03:14.390> position<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:16.520> now<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:16.970> want<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.390> mirror

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
into position and now I want to mirror

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.190 
into position and now I want to mirror
and<00:03:18.140> copy<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.890> over<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.300> other<00:03:20.390> side<00:03:20.690> for

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
and copy that over to the other side for

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.900 
and copy that over to the other side for
the<00:03:21.320> arm<00:03:21.709> on<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.040> opposite<00:03:22.459> side<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
the arm on the opposite side of the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.360 
the arm on the opposite side of the
anchor<00:03:23.270> and<00:03:23.600> there's<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.110> little<00:03:24.290> crown<00:03:24.980> at<00:03:25.280> the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
anchor and there's a little crown at the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.949 
anchor and there's a little crown at the
bottom<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.910> anchor<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.420> we'll<00:03:26.600> just<00:03:26.750> put<00:03:26.930> a

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
bottom of the anchor so we'll just put a

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.730 
bottom of the anchor so we'll just put a
little<00:03:27.110> sphere<00:03:28.070> for<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.930> move<00:03:30.350> that<00:03:30.530> up

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
little sphere for that and move that up

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.660 
little sphere for that and move that up
into<00:03:31.700> position<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:33.250> then<00:03:34.250> we'll<00:03:34.430> just<00:03:34.459> go

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
into position and then we'll just go

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.910 
into position and then we'll just go
back<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.000> our<00:03:35.390> fill<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.780> tool<00:03:35.990> once<00:03:36.290> again<00:03:36.620> and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
back to our fill it tool once again and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.010 
back to our fill it tool once again and
just<00:03:37.010> simply<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.370> click<00:03:38.150> on<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.390> shank<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:38.900> the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
just simply a click on the shank in the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.020 
just simply a click on the shank in the
sphere<00:03:39.470> at<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.770> bottom<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.250> it'll<00:03:40.700> fill<00:03:40.910> out

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
sphere at the bottom and it'll fill out

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.270 
sphere at the bottom and it'll fill out
those<00:03:41.150> pieces<00:03:41.450> together<00:03:41.830> do<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:42.950> same<00:03:43.130> thing

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
those pieces together do the same thing

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.790 
those pieces together do the same thing
with<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.489> arm<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.690> shank<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.140> we'll<00:03:45.709> do

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
with the arm and a shank and we'll do

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.440 
with the arm and a shank and we'll do
the<00:03:45.920> same<00:03:46.100> thing<00:03:46.280> with<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.430> other<00:03:46.520> arm<00:03:47.150> on<00:03:47.330> the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the same thing with the other arm on the

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.150 
the same thing with the other arm on the
other<00:03:47.570> side<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.080> what<00:03:48.200> we<00:03:48.290> end<00:03:48.440> up<00:03:48.530> with<00:03:48.590> is<00:03:48.890> one

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
other side so what we end up with is one

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.410 
other side so what we end up with is one
single<00:03:49.760> solid<00:03:50.600> object<00:03:51.080> that<00:03:51.530> is<00:03:51.680> all<00:03:51.800> smoothly

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
single solid object that is all smoothly

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.570 
single solid object that is all smoothly
blended<00:03:53.420> together<00:03:53.510> into<00:03:53.989> one<00:03:54.230> object<00:03:57.550> for<00:03:58.550> the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
blended together into one object for the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.260 
blended together into one object for the
chain<00:03:58.970> what<00:03:59.720> we'll<00:03:59.870> do<00:03:59.989> is<00:04:00.140> first<00:04:00.820> rotate<00:04:01.820> the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
chain what we'll do is first rotate the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.210 
chain what we'll do is first rotate the
anchor<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.080> laying<00:04:03.350> on<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.709> bottom<00:04:03.980> of

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
anchor so it's laying on the bottom of

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.210 
anchor so it's laying on the bottom of
the<00:04:04.340> ocean<00:04:04.670> floor<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:06.500> I'll<00:04:06.650> rotate<00:04:06.830> it

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
the ocean floor so I'll rotate it

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.070 
the ocean floor so I'll rotate it
written<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.940> bottom<00:04:08.390> here<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:10.750> for<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.840> chain

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
written a bottom here and for the chain

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.370 
written a bottom here and for the chain
the<00:04:12.380> first<00:04:12.890> thing<00:04:13.100> I'll<00:04:13.250> do<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.430> create<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.910> path

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
the first thing I'll do is create a path

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.720 
the first thing I'll do is create a path
for<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.470> chain<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.709> follow<00:04:16.100> so<00:04:16.370> i'll<00:04:16.459> just<00:04:16.520> use

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
for the chain to follow so i'll just use

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.199 
for the chain to follow so i'll just use
the<00:04:17.060> spline<00:04:17.419> drawing<00:04:18.290> tool<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.700> in<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:19.970> side

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
the spline drawing tool and in the side

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.380 
the spline drawing tool and in the side
view<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.870> can<00:04:21.140> sort<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.700> approximate<00:04:22.700> where<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
view I can sort of approximate where I

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.760 
view I can sort of approximate where I
want<00:04:23.750> that<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.169> spline<00:04:24.500> curve<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.310> be

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
want that to spline curve to be

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.029 
want that to spline curve to be
extend<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.699> a<00:04:27.849> little<00:04:27.879> further<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:29.620> I'll<00:04:29.949> go

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
extend it a little further and I'll go

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.070 
extend it a little further and I'll go
back<00:04:30.190> into<00:04:30.340> my<00:04:30.520> 3d<00:04:30.849> view<00:04:31.120> here<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.990> can

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
back into my 3d view here and you can

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.290 
back into my 3d view here and you can
see<00:04:32.259> I<00:04:32.289> can<00:04:32.349> now<00:04:32.530> take<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.770> spline<00:04:33.280> curve<00:04:33.759> and

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
see I can now take that spline curve and

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.809 
see I can now take that spline curve and
once<00:04:34.660> again<00:04:34.780> using<00:04:35.259> the<00:04:35.349> Edit<00:04:35.710> controls<00:04:36.460> to

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
once again using the Edit controls to

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.119 
once again using the Edit controls to
law<00:04:37.000> just<00:04:37.210> sort<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.389> modify<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.080> shape<00:04:38.409> to

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
law just sort of modify that shape to

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:46.950 
law just sort of modify that shape to
the<00:04:39.580> desired<00:04:39.909> path<00:04:40.240> that<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.720> want<00:04:45.780> next<00:04:46.780> what

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the desired path that I want next what

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.719 
the desired path that I want next what
we'll<00:04:47.080> need<00:04:47.139> to<00:04:47.199> do<00:04:47.379> is<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.560> create<00:04:48.099> the<00:04:48.520> actual

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
we'll need to do is I create the actual

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.960 
we'll need to do is I create the actual
chain<00:04:49.180> links<00:04:49.539> themselves<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:51.280> so<00:04:51.699> I'll<00:04:51.789> do

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
chain links themselves and so I'll do

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.820 
chain links themselves and so I'll do
that<00:04:52.150> by<00:04:52.330> once<00:04:52.720> again<00:04:52.810> going<00:04:53.199> to<00:04:53.319> the<00:04:53.440> drawing

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
that by once again going to the drawing

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.399 
that by once again going to the drawing
tools<00:04:54.250> I'll<00:04:55.090> start<00:04:55.449> with<00:04:55.509> a<00:04:55.569> vector<00:04:55.930> line<00:04:56.080> tool

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
tools I'll start with a vector line tool

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.420 
tools I'll start with a vector line tool
and<00:04:57.370> switch<00:04:58.000> over<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.720> arc<00:04:59.020> tool<00:04:59.380> and<00:05:00.099> you

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
and switch over to the arc tool and you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.879 
and switch over to the arc tool and you
can<00:05:00.610> go<00:05:01.419> back<00:05:01.449> to<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.840> vector<00:05:02.139> line<00:05:02.289> tool<00:05:02.560> you

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
can go back to the vector line tool you

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.350 
can go back to the vector line tool you
can<00:05:02.979> see<00:05:03.159> in<00:05:03.250> form<00:05:03.490> Z<00:05:03.729> that<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.120> can<00:05:04.240> actually

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
can see in form Z that you can actually

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.249 
can see in form Z that you can actually
create<00:05:04.659> mixed<00:05:05.620> composite<00:05:06.490> type<00:05:06.699> curves<00:05:07.090> in<00:05:07.930> a

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
create mixed composite type curves in a

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.930 
create mixed composite type curves in a
continuous<00:05:08.889> drawing<00:05:09.190> session<00:05:09.699> without

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
continuous drawing session without

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.670 
continuous drawing session without
having<00:05:10.389> to<00:05:10.479> create<00:05:10.750> separate<00:05:11.110> pieces<00:05:11.349> and

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
having to create separate pieces and

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.070 
having to create separate pieces and
join<00:05:11.860> those<00:05:12.009> together<00:05:12.159> later<00:05:12.810> let's<00:05:13.810> create<00:05:14.020> a

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
join those together later let's create a

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.339 
join those together later let's create a
circle<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:15.030> then<00:05:16.030> using<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.509> sweep<00:05:17.050> tool

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
circle and then using the sweep tool

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.110 
circle and then using the sweep tool
what<00:05:17.979> I'm<00:05:18.099> going<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.400> do<00:05:18.580> is<00:05:18.669> take<00:05:18.880> that

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
what I'm going to do is take that

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.640 
what I'm going to do is take that
profile<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.169> sweep<00:05:20.440> it<00:05:20.560> along<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.979> path<00:05:22.650> so

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
profile and sweep it along that path so

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.249 
profile and sweep it along that path so
there's<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:23.889> single<00:05:24.159> a<00:05:24.400> chain<00:05:24.849> link<00:05:25.270> there<00:05:25.659> so

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
there's a single a chain link there so

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.600 
there's a single a chain link there so
what<00:05:26.379> we'll<00:05:26.530> do<00:05:26.620> is<00:05:26.650> I'll<00:05:26.800> make<00:05:27.069> a<00:05:27.099> copy<00:05:27.460> of

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
what we'll do is I'll make a copy of

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.209 
what we'll do is I'll make a copy of
that<00:05:30.389> and<00:05:31.389> from<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:31.870> we<00:05:32.080> need<00:05:32.229> to<00:05:32.409> probably

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
that and from that we need to probably

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.490 
that and from that we need to probably
rotate<00:05:33.699> that<00:05:33.940> so<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.389> links<00:05:34.719> fit<00:05:35.229> together

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
rotate that so the links fit together

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.980 
rotate that so the links fit together
properly<00:05:35.710> so<00:05:36.639> in<00:05:36.759> the<00:05:36.849> side<00:05:37.150> view<00:05:37.180> I'll<00:05:37.690> just

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
properly so in the side view I'll just

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.010 
properly so in the side view I'll just
rotate<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:39.659> 90<00:05:40.659> degrees<00:05:42.630> all<00:05:43.630> right<00:05:43.750> and

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
rotate that 90 degrees all right and

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.260 
rotate that 90 degrees all right and
there's<00:05:44.289> two<00:05:44.560> links<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:45.819> what<00:05:46.000> I'll<00:05:46.060> do<00:05:46.180> is

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
there's two links and I what I'll do is

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.580 
there's two links and I what I'll do is
create<00:05:46.479> multiple<00:05:46.870> links<00:05:47.110> i'll<00:05:47.349> just<00:05:47.500> grab

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
create multiple links i'll just grab

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.740 
create multiple links i'll just grab
both<00:05:47.919> of<00:05:48.099> those<00:05:48.190> objects<00:05:48.699> and<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.090> multi<00:05:49.479> copy

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
both of those objects and the multi copy

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.680 
both of those objects and the multi copy
that<00:05:50.310> type<00:05:51.310> in<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.520> number<00:05:52.000> that<00:05:52.150> i<00:05:52.180> want<00:05:52.479> how

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
that type in the number that i want how

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.469 
that type in the number that i want how
about<00:05:52.719> 12<00:05:53.199> so<00:05:54.190> we'll<00:05:54.340> make<00:05:54.460> 12<00:05:54.759> more<00:05:54.969> copies

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
about 12 so we'll make 12 more copies

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.620 
about 12 so we'll make 12 more copies
and<00:05:56.159> there's<00:05:57.159> all<00:05:57.370> of<00:05:57.520> our<00:05:57.669> links<00:05:58.330> for<00:05:58.479> the

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
and there's all of our links for the

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.189 
and there's all of our links for the
chain<00:05:59.130> now<00:06:00.150> what<00:06:01.150> i'm<00:06:01.210> going<00:06:01.270> to<00:06:01.509> do<00:06:01.690> is<00:06:01.719> grab

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
chain now what i'm going to do is grab

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.700 
chain now what i'm going to do is grab
all<00:06:02.440> of<00:06:02.500> these<00:06:02.889> objects<00:06:03.430> and<00:06:04.210> using<00:06:05.169> the<00:06:05.289> join

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
all of these objects and using the join

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.529 
all of these objects and using the join
tool<00:06:06.219> what<00:06:06.520> i<00:06:06.550> can<00:06:06.759> do<00:06:06.880> is<00:06:06.909> join<00:06:07.360> those

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
tool what i can do is join those

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.370 
tool what i can do is join those
together<00:06:07.690> as<00:06:08.110> one<00:06:08.469> single<00:06:08.800> object<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.810> then

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
together as one single object and then

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.830 
together as one single object and then
using<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:11.860> bandar-log<00:06:12.580> curve<00:06:13.029> tool<00:06:13.330> i<00:06:13.569> can

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
using the bandar-log curve tool i can

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.339 
using the bandar-log curve tool i can
take<00:06:14.050> that<00:06:14.229> object<00:06:14.680> and<00:06:14.889> have<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:15.639> bend<00:06:16.349> along

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
take that object and have it bend along

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.290 
take that object and have it bend along
that<00:06:17.529> curve<00:06:17.770> and<00:06:18.159> you<00:06:18.639> can<00:06:18.729> see<00:06:18.880> that<00:06:18.909> the

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
that curve and you can see that the

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.499 
that curve and you can see that the
geometry<00:06:20.199> will<00:06:20.770> then<00:06:20.979> bend<00:06:21.909> accordingly

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
geometry will then bend accordingly

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.730 
geometry will then bend accordingly
along<00:06:23.319> that's<00:06:23.830> blind<00:06:24.190> curve<00:06:25.560> now<00:06:26.560> at<00:06:26.650> this

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
along that's blind curve now at this

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.379 
along that's blind curve now at this
point<00:06:26.949> we're<00:06:27.340> still<00:06:27.550> an<00:06:27.610> interactive<00:06:28.060> shaded

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
point we're still an interactive shaded

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.300 
point we're still an interactive shaded
mode<00:06:28.539> we<00:06:29.020> have<00:06:29.139> a<00:06:29.169> gray<00:06:29.380> plastic<00:06:29.919> there<00:06:30.099> maybe

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
mode we have a gray plastic there maybe

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.830 
mode we have a gray plastic there maybe
we<00:06:30.490> want<00:06:30.639> to<00:06:30.759> give<00:06:30.880> it<00:06:31.000> more<00:06:31.150> of<00:06:31.210> a<00:06:31.330> realistic

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
we want to give it more of a realistic

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.050 
we want to give it more of a realistic
server<00:06:32.319> style<00:06:32.590> texture<00:06:33.039> we<00:06:33.430> can<00:06:33.580> use<00:06:33.610> an<00:06:33.849> image

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
server style texture we can use an image

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.760 
server style texture we can use an image
map<00:06:34.360> of<00:06:34.779> course<00:06:34.990> that's<00:06:35.110> one<00:06:35.349> way<00:06:35.469> of<00:06:35.500> creating

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
map of course that's one way of creating

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.129 
map of course that's one way of creating
server<00:06:36.070> styles<00:06:36.460> will<00:06:37.300> put<00:06:37.449> a<00:06:37.479> mere<00:06:37.810> type

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
server styles will put a mere type

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.290 
server styles will put a mere type
reflection<00:06:39.009> on<00:06:39.099> the<00:06:39.190> surface

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
reflection on the surface

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.369 
reflection on the surface
and<00:06:41.139> we'll<00:06:41.409> also<00:06:41.560> put<00:06:41.889> a<00:06:42.389> bump<00:06:43.389> map<00:06:43.900> on<00:06:44.199> there

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:44.379 
and we'll also put a bump map on there

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.689 
and we'll also put a bump map on there
too<00:06:44.590> so<00:06:44.830> we<00:06:44.889> can<00:06:45.009> actually<00:06:45.069> use<00:06:45.250> that<00:06:45.490> same

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699 
too so we can actually use that same

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.610 
too so we can actually use that same
image<00:06:46.120> and<00:06:46.360> based<00:06:46.750> on<00:06:46.900> the<00:06:47.020> intensity<00:06:47.560> of

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
image and based on the intensity of

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.309 
image and based on the intensity of
those<00:06:47.710> gray<00:06:47.979> scale<00:06:48.720> pixels<00:06:49.720> in<00:06:49.900> that<00:06:50.050> image<00:06:50.199> we

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 
those gray scale pixels in that image we

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.749 
those gray scale pixels in that image we
can<00:06:50.500> create<00:06:50.590> a<00:06:50.710> bumpy<00:06:50.979> surface<00:06:51.370> now<00:06:51.490> this<00:06:51.639> is

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
can create a bumpy surface now this is

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.999 
can create a bumpy surface now this is
an<00:06:51.879> interactive<00:06:52.120> shaded<00:06:52.720> right<00:06:52.870> here<00:06:53.169> but<00:06:53.919> if

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
an interactive shaded right here but if

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:56.430 
an interactive shaded right here but if
we<00:06:54.129> do<00:06:54.250> a<00:06:54.280> render<00:06:54.699> zone<00:06:54.970> rendering<00:06:55.659> then<00:06:56.259> we

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
we do a render zone rendering then we

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.830 
we do a render zone rendering then we
can<00:06:56.620> take<00:06:57.129> advantage<00:06:57.280> of<00:06:57.789> both<00:06:58.210> aamir<00:06:58.629> type
