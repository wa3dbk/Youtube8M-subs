00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
around with it until you get the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.530 
around with it until you get the
intensity<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> brightness<00:01:35.430> around<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
intensity and brightness around what you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.440 
intensity and brightness around what you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
want and that looks about good so let's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.399 
want and that looks about good so let's
compare<00:01:39.840> green<00:01:40.740> low<00:01:41.689> looks<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:43.079> about<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
compare green low looks just about the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.940 
compare green low looks just about the
same<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:44.850> make<00:01:45.630> sure<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.290> select<00:01:46.710> your

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.380 
same so now make sure you select your
next<00:01:47.250> clip<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.670> let's<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:47.939> ahead<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
next clip and let's go ahead and do the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.740 
next clip and let's go ahead and do the
same<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> different<00:01:50.220> color<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.750> we

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
same and make a different color and we

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.360 
same and make a different color and we
will<00:01:51.869> try<00:01:52.049> making

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.240 

and<00:01:56.580> let's<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.570> go<00:01:57.720> ahead<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.930> make<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.250> nice

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.020 
and let's just go ahead and make a nice
little<00:01:59.550> purple<00:02:01.010> now<00:02:02.010> some<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.610> colors<00:02:02.910> are

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
little purple now some of the colors are

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.110 
little purple now some of the colors are
really<00:02:03.150> easy<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.660> in<00:02:03.990> some<00:02:04.200> aren't<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
really easy to make in some aren't and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.090 
really easy to make in some aren't and
red<00:02:06.120> is<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.810> hard<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.140> make<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.620> what<00:02:07.980> you

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
red is very hard to make and what you

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.700 
red is very hard to make and what you
have<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.640> make<00:02:08.760> red<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:10.290> I'm<00:02:10.410> doing

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710

that always makes it better but I'm just
going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.300> for<00:03:45.570> for<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.870> video<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
going to do for for this video and

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.730 
going to do for for this video and
shorten<00:03:48.540> them<00:03:48.660> up<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.960> little<00:03:48.990> bit<00:03:49.380> not<00:03:49.710> too

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
shorten them up a little bit not too

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.620 
shorten them up a little bit not too
short<00:03:50.250> if<00:03:50.430> they're<00:03:50.670> too<00:03:50.850> short<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.360> won't<00:03:51.540> be

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
short if they're too short they won't be

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.680 
short if they're too short they won't be
able<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.870> transition<00:03:52.640> slowly<00:03:53.640> but<00:03:54.030> also<00:03:54.180> fast

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
able to transition slowly but also fast

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.970 
able to transition slowly but also fast
enough<00:03:55.140> at<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.650> same<00:03:55.800> time<00:03:57.680> put<00:03:58.680> them<00:03:58.860> around

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
enough at the same time put them around

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.700 
enough at the same time put them around
maybe<00:03:59.280> three<00:03:59.820> seconds<00:04:00.210> or<00:04:00.480> maybe<00:04:01.410> five

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
maybe three seconds or maybe five

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.070 
maybe three seconds or maybe five
seconds<00:04:03.410> that's<00:04:04.410> perfectly<00:04:05.070> fine<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:06.390> just

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
seconds that's perfectly fine and just

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.440 
seconds that's perfectly fine and just
kind<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.350> drag<00:04:07.860> them<00:04:08.040> on<00:04:08.190> top<00:04:08.520> of<00:04:08.580> there<00:04:08.970> and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
kind of drag them on top of there and

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.930 
kind of drag them on top of there and
now<00:04:10.380> drag<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:11.010> clip<00:04:11.370> out<00:04:11.520> some<00:04:11.820> more<00:04:12.060> and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
now drag that clip out some more and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.280 
now drag that clip out some more and
actually<00:04:14.940> this<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:15.690> actually<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.170> very

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
actually this is actually the very

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.420 
actually this is actually the very
tricky<00:04:16.799> part<00:04:17.040> um<00:04:17.310> if<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.970> clips<00:04:18.239> too<00:04:18.420> short

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
tricky part um if your clips too short

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.710 
tricky part um if your clips too short
then<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.549> doesn't<00:04:20.700> look<00:04:20.970> good<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.450> if<00:04:21.570> it's

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
then it doesn't look good and if it's

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.670 
then it doesn't look good and if it's
too<00:04:21.960> long<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.310> doesn't<00:04:23.580> look<00:04:23.670> good<00:04:24.680> and

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
too long and it doesn't look good and

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.890 
too long and it doesn't look good and
but<00:04:26.010> once<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.520> get<00:04:26.670> these<00:04:26.850> four<00:04:27.300> clips<00:04:27.690> or
