impressed<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.560> with<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.040> sago<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.580> it's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
impressed with with the sago is it's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.330

incredible lightness most of that really

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.760 
incredible lightness most of that really
is<00:00:41.460> due<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> part<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.600> polyamide<00:00:43.500> lens

it has very little heft to it at all now
you'll<00:00:51.390> also<00:00:51.510> notice<00:00:51.810> that<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.260> lens<00:00:52.650> profile

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you'll also notice that the lens profile

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.650 
you'll also notice that the lens profile
of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> sago<00:00:53.820> doesn't<00:00:54.090> follow<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.540> you'd

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
of the sago doesn't follow what you'd

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
of the sago doesn't follow what you'd

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
those base curvature conventions you can

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.660 
those base curvature conventions you can
see<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> has<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.649> bulbous<00:01:11.100> lens<00:01:11.369> shape

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
see it has kind of a bulbous lens shape

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.359 
see it has kind of a bulbous lens shape
and<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.570> reason<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.259> esos<00:01:13.890> wanted

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and the reason for that is esos wanted

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.419 
and the reason for that is esos wanted

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.980 
face as opposed to again just shielding
it<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.429> the<00:01:20.549> end<00:01:20.700> result<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.719> really
