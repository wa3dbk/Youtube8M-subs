00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
to serve old school like well I think

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.769 
to serve old school like well I think
the<00:00:28.680> most<00:00:28.859> exciting<00:00:29.220> thing<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.720> only

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the most exciting thing is that not only

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
the most exciting thing is that not only
are<00:00:31.140> these<00:00:31.380> good<00:00:31.800> episodes<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.520> they're

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
are these good episodes I think they're

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.370 
are these good episodes I think they're
some<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> best<00:00:33.570> we've<00:00:33.809> ever<00:00:34.110> done

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
some of the best we've ever done

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380 
some of the best we've ever done
absolutely<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:35.760> really<00:00:36.210> exciting

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
absolutely so that's really exciting

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.299 
absolutely so that's really exciting
because<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.260> doesn't<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.590> feel<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.129> we're

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
because it doesn't just feel like we're

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.280 
because it doesn't just feel like we're
matching<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.180> first<00:00:39.420> three<00:00:39.719> seasons<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
matching the first three seasons it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.190 
matching the first three seasons it
feels<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:40.800> doing<00:00:41.219> our<00:00:41.610> best<00:00:42.360> work<00:00:42.780> so

cool<00:00:56.640> year<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.480> how<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.750> characters<00:00:58.199> have

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
cool year to see how the characters have

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.170 
cool year to see how the characters have
grown<00:00:58.920> since<00:00:59.399> we've<00:00:59.579> last<00:00:59.730> seen<00:00:59.940> them

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
grown since we've last seen them

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
grown since we've last seen them
everybody<00:01:00.590> there's<00:01:01.590> been<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:01.980> time

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
everybody there's been a little time

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.189 
everybody there's been a little time
that<00:01:02.579> has<00:01:02.699> passed<00:01:02.730> since<00:01:03.270> we've<00:01:03.570> seen<00:01:03.780> them<00:01:03.989> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that has passed since we've seen them so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.539 
that has passed since we've seen them so
the<00:01:04.379> characters<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.769> all<00:01:04.830> grown<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the characters of all grown but at the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
the characters of all grown but at the
same<00:01:05.790> time<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.290> characters<00:01:07.619> are

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
same time I think all the characters are

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.370 
same time I think all the characters are
sort<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:07.979> returning<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.640> those<00:01:08.990> traits<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
sort of returning to those traits that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
sort of returning to those traits that
we<00:01:10.530> knew<00:01:10.740> them<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> first<00:01:11.880> couple

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
we knew them for in the first couple

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.560 
we knew them for in the first couple
seasons<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:14.220> an<00:01:14.369> interesting<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.390> an
