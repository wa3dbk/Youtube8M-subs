00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.660 

so<00:04:09.770> 174<00:04:10.770> grams<00:04:12.560> actually<00:04:13.560> be<00:04:13.770> the<00:04:14.490> other

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
so 174 grams actually be the other

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.690 
so 174 grams actually be the other
variant<00:04:15.210> the<00:04:15.390> red<00:04:15.570> one<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.170> think<00:04:16.890> with<00:04:17.160> Kevlar

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
variant the red one I think with Kevlar

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.780 
variant the red one I think with Kevlar
that<00:04:18.360> weighs<00:04:18.540> in<00:04:18.660> at<00:04:18.750> 166<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.010> Flipkart<00:04:20.400> and

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
that weighs in at 166 and Flipkart and

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.200 
that weighs in at 166 and Flipkart and
currently<00:04:21.120> incorrectly<00:04:21.780> states<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.320> as<00:04:23.210> 166

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
crimes on the specs page so I was just

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.160 
crimes on the specs page so I was just
curious<00:04:26.910> that's<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.570> reason<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:27.870> first

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
curious that's the reason I first

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.770 
curious that's the reason I first
started<00:04:28.680> with<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:28.980> anyway<00:04:29.700> this<00:04:30.480> phone

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
started with that anyway this phone

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.730 
started with that anyway this phone
currently<00:04:31.200> runs<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.560> Android<00:04:32.390> 5.0<00:04:33.410> point<00:04:34.410> to

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.340 
currently runs on Android 5.0 point to
lollipop<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:38.180> when<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.210> use<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.630> note<00:04:39.780> 4<00:04:40.110> I

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
lollipop so when I use the note 4 I

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.140 
lollipop so when I use the note 4 I
really<00:04:40.680> like<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.100> note<00:04:41.250> 4<00:04:41.550> but<00:04:41.700> one<00:04:41.910> thing

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
really like the note 4 but one thing

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.610 
really like the note 4 but one thing
that<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:43.010> kept<00:04:44.090> thinking<00:04:45.090> was<00:04:45.120> if<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.230> note<00:04:46.410> 4

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
that I kept thinking was if the note 4

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.920 
that I kept thinking was if the note 4
was<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:46.980> fast<00:04:47.250> with<00:04:47.670> TouchWiz<00:04:48.150> on<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.420> how

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
was this fast with TouchWiz on it how

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.770 
was this fast with TouchWiz on it how
fast<00:04:49.200> would<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.500> be<00:04:49.710> if<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.880> ran<00:04:51.060> stock<00:04:51.330> Android

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
fast would it be if it ran stock Android

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.720 
fast would it be if it ran stock Android
and<00:04:51.990> that's<00:04:52.680> what<00:04:52.920> kind<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.190> got<00:04:53.370> me<00:04:53.550> curious

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
and that's what kind of got me curious

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.660 
and that's what kind of got me curious

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
done that in a while so this is almost

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.210 
done that in a while so this is almost
close<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.900> stock<00:05:13.110> Android<00:05:13.500> so<00:05:13.860> basically

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
close to stock Android so basically

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.250 
close to stock Android so basically
we've<00:05:14.490> got<00:05:14.520> just<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.210> few<00:05:15.450> extra<00:05:15.840> moto<00:05:16.020> apps

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
we've got just a few extra moto apps

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.520 
we've got just a few extra moto apps
like<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.710> Motorola<00:05:17.430> alert<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:18.060> Kinect<00:05:18.530> moto

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
like the Motorola alert the Kinect moto

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.460 
like the Motorola alert the Kinect moto
app<00:05:19.830> itself<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.880> then<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.240> migrate<00:05:21.720> the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
app itself and then the migrate the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.710 
app itself and then the migrate the
camera<00:05:22.800> is<00:05:22.920> also<00:05:23.100> a<00:05:23.610> little<00:05:24.000> bit<00:05:24.120> different<00:05:24.570> so

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
camera is also a little bit different so

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.650 
camera is also a little bit different so
actually<00:05:25.110> let<00:05:25.260> me<00:05:25.350> pull<00:05:25.560> something<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.660> seems

actually let me pull something and seems
decent<00:05:28.010> quite<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.040> bit<00:05:29.220> of<00:05:29.310> book<00:05:29.520> here<00:05:29.730> so

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
decent quite a bit of book here so

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.620
