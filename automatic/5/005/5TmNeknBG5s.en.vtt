00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.299
 my kadima installed on one side 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.260
 of this partition 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.259
 See installed about the topic showed 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.660
 so that way the career and pull and well 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.990
 and then threw and just like a hive tractor 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.630
 rake also removed the excess solution and and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.279
 so look at my devil 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.010
 thickness will be mortar on this side 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.580
 like this will be, I do not know well, once again I 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 checked 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.420
 Of course in such a way to install and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.559
 checked by cut it was perfect that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.420
 level sho otvis showed all the same 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.879
 vertically 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.770
 here the truth replaced it for a screw on 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 the other is not going to do the next 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.270
 I already showed the beacon as mine 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 box you are a caretaker national so 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.539
 that's the way it's all okay 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.969
 that is like this not the thickness launders 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.140
 general solution thickness like this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.680
 have to install 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.730
 and throw like that 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:19.970
 everything turned out okay, I'll put everything on 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.970
 I already showed how to do it 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.540
 This solution will be chosen when 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.050
 I will remove the door then that now I do not 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.050
 removed 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.780
 neatly make sure there is no solution 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.780
 hit 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.050
 these screws then I twist no yes no 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.050
 need to 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.080
 [applause] 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.699
 [applause] 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.130
 what thickness bosch 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.130
 necessarily 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.780
 [applause] 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.310
 we are looking out of the solution 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.310
 trying as much as possible 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.790
 no mind no need to rush website 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.110
 as we want 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.110
 even on the left and right side 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.290
 [applause] 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.470
 so take to be sure to read 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.450
 so simple 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:33.560
 the strip is thin and thin is done and 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.560
 comfortably drive rovki anything 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.600
 strip of solution 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.090
 like still 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.800
 now the top part needs to be done 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:24.679
 now the bath is running cast iron 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:04.070
 look just distribute 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:07.740
 on top because I already tore off and 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:10.770
 I put there Samara I eat 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.770
 I know and here in one line 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:20.690
