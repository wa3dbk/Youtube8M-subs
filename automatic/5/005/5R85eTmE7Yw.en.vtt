00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
already started in a little bit i did

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.709 
already started in a little bit i did
the<00:00:42.750> 10<00:00:42.960> beat<00:00:43.170> 10<00:00:43.620> depot<00:00:43.980> 12<00:00:44.250> racks<00:00:44.550> 13<00:00:45.120> gasps<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
got my second deep below it already

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.990 
got my second deep below it already
before<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> guys<00:00:49.410> tuned<00:00:49.890> in

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.020 

and<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:56.020> mule<00:00:56.320> goes<00:00:56.530> down<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.340> same<00:00:57.550> time<00:00:57.820> the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
and the mule goes down the same time the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.049 
and the mule goes down the same time the
tech<00:00:58.270> lab<00:00:58.510> goes<00:00:58.810> up<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.340> construct<00:01:03.850> my

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
tech lab goes up and I construct my

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.450 
tech lab goes up and I construct my
third<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.050> fourth<00:01:05.650> barracks

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.670 

I<00:01:11.600> previously<00:01:12.600> might<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.140> done<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> two

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
I previously might have done the two

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.430 
I previously might have done the two
barracks<00:01:14.070> after<00:01:14.340> stem<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.780> figured<00:01:16.170> after

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
barracks after stem but I figured after

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.050 
barracks after stem but I figured after
some<00:01:16.799> testing<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:17.760> do<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
some testing that you can actually do it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.109 
some testing that you can actually do it
before<00:01:18.210> without<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.690> problem<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> remember<00:01:20.940> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
before without a problem and remember to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.730 
before without a problem and remember to
get<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.300> Marauder<00:01:21.659> after<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> two<00:01:22.440> barracks

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
get your Marauder after the two barracks

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
get your Marauder after the two barracks
and<00:01:22.920> stem<00:01:23.369> has<00:01:23.520> been<00:01:23.700> started<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and stem has been started and then you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.180 
and stem has been started and then you
need<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.690> supply<00:01:25.050> depot<00:01:25.140> right<00:01:25.740> away<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.070> soon

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
need a supply depot right away as soon

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.070 
need a supply depot right away as soon
as<00:01:26.460> possible<00:01:26.880> otherwise<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.990> get

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
as possible otherwise we're going to get

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.490 
as possible otherwise we're going to get
blocked<00:01:29.750> there<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:32.840> worker<00:01:33.840> production<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
blocked there we go worker production is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.810 
blocked there we go worker production is
constant<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.280> Marauder<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.729> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
constant and the Marauder will be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.100 
constant and the Marauder will be
joining<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.210> rain<00:01:39.390> soon<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:39.899> I'm<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.080> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
joining them rain soon and I'm going to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.090 
joining them rain soon and I'm going to
queue<00:01:40.380> another<00:01:40.619> one<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:43.050> also<00:01:43.229> since<00:01:44.009> i

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
queue another one up and I also since i

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
queue another one up and I also since i
played<00:01:44.340> through<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:44.789> many<00:01:44.910> games<00:01:45.179> i<00:01:45.450> figured

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
played through so many games i figured

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.240 
played through so many games i figured
out<00:01:45.929> it's<00:01:46.080> best<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.500> leave<00:01:46.619> three<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.039> gas

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
out it's best to leave three on gas

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.029 
out it's best to leave three on gas
until<00:01:47.640> both<00:01:47.850> reactors<00:01:48.330> are<00:01:48.479> started<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> i'm

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
until both reactors are started so i'm

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.060 
until both reactors are started so i'm
going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:54.080> ok<00:01:55.080> both<00:01:55.470> reactors<00:01:55.920> are

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
going to do that ok both reactors are

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.590 
going to do that ok both reactors are
done<00:01:56.220> i'm<00:01:56.399> moving<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.940> my<00:01:57.060> three<00:01:57.300> guys<00:01:57.539> on

way to stay in the game here so I'm

way to stay in the game here so I'm
chasing<00:06:19.069> those<00:06:19.189> are<00:06:19.400> just<00:06:19.490> leaving<00:06:19.699> the<00:06:19.879> other

units it's okay sis drones that I care
about<00:06:27.729> there<00:06:28.729> we<00:06:28.819> go

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.129 

that<00:06:31.759> was<00:06:31.939> actually<00:06:32.179> pretty<00:06:32.419> indicative<00:06:32.839> of

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 
that was actually pretty indicative of

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.469 
that was actually pretty indicative of
what<00:06:33.319> a<00:06:33.349> gold<00:06:33.589> player<00:06:33.830> would<00:06:33.979> be<00:06:34.389> doing<00:06:35.389> it

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
what a gold player would be doing it

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.619 
what a gold player would be doing it
around<00:06:35.659> that<00:06:35.749> time<00:06:37.029> banelings<00:06:38.029> might<00:06:38.300> be<00:06:38.599> a

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
around that time banelings might be a

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.629 
around that time banelings might be a
little<00:06:39.259> tough<00:06:39.529> for<00:06:39.559> you<00:06:39.769> guys<00:06:39.889> to<00:06:40.099> handle<00:06:40.459> and

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
little tough for you guys to handle and

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.969 
little tough for you guys to handle and
I'll<00:06:41.599> probably<00:06:41.839> go<00:06:42.110> over<00:06:42.139> splitting<00:06:42.709> rains

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
I'll probably go over splitting rains

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.570 
I'll probably go over splitting rains
here<00:06:43.189> in<00:06:43.219> my<00:06:43.399> next<00:06:43.610> video<00:06:44.110> it's<00:06:45.580> fairly

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
here in my next video it's fairly

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.209 
here in my next video it's fairly
straightforward<00:06:47.379> your<00:06:48.379> three<00:06:48.679> rocks<00:06:48.889> attack

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.219 
straightforward your three rocks attack

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:50.829 
straightforward your three rocks attack
might<00:06:49.459> get<00:06:49.610> clobbered<00:06:49.819> by<00:06:50.059> some<00:06:50.330> beans<00:06:50.539> if<00:06:50.749> you

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:50.839 
might get clobbered by some beans if you

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.389 
might get clobbered by some beans if you
run<00:06:51.019> up<00:06:51.139> the<00:06:51.229> ramp<00:06:51.439> and<00:06:51.679> he<00:06:51.800> just<00:06:51.979> slams<00:06:52.219> him

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:52.399 
run up the ramp and he just slams him

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.790 
run up the ramp and he just slams him
into<00:06:52.459> you<00:06:52.819> die<00:06:52.969> just<00:06:53.749> remember<00:06:54.199> and<00:06:54.349> it's<00:06:54.439> okay

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
into you die just remember and it's okay

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.219 
into you die just remember and it's okay
like<00:06:54.979> I<00:06:55.339> said<00:06:55.399> in<00:06:55.759> other<00:06:55.879> videos<00:06:55.999> some<00:06:56.899> builds

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:57.229 
like I said in other videos some builds

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.019 
like I said in other videos some builds
hard<00:06:57.499> counter<00:06:57.949> and<00:06:58.519> you're<00:06:58.639> just<00:06:58.729> going<00:06:58.969> to

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029 
hard counter and you're just going to

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.129 
hard counter and you're just going to
have<00:06:59.059> to<00:06:59.149> work<00:06:59.360> through<00:06:59.389> it<00:06:59.719> and<00:06:59.779> get<00:06:59.929> better

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:00.139 
have to work through it and get better

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:02.109 
have to work through it and get better
at<00:07:00.289> execution<00:07:00.819> eventually<00:07:01.819> you'll<00:07:01.939> be<00:07:02.059> able

00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:02.119 
at execution eventually you'll be able

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:06.609 
at execution eventually you'll be able
to<00:07:02.239> overpower<00:07:03.159> virtually<00:07:04.159> anything<00:07:05.409> at<00:07:06.409> least

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:06.619 
to overpower virtually anything at least

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:08.859 
to overpower virtually anything at least
at<00:07:06.800> this<00:07:06.889> level<00:07:07.129> of<00:07:07.279> play<00:07:07.599> even<00:07:08.599> up<00:07:08.689> into

at this level of play even up into

at this level of play even up into

some<00:07:13.639> other<00:07:13.759> things<00:07:14.029> in<00:07:14.240> my<00:07:14.360> next<00:07:14.749> video<00:07:15.139> a

00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:15.499 
some other things in my next video a

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:18.009 
some other things in my next video a
bunch<00:07:15.889> of<00:07:15.979> replays<00:07:16.399> I<00:07:16.580> had<00:07:16.819> from<00:07:17.179> the<00:07:17.389> 20-odd

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:18.019 
bunch of replays I had from the 20-odd

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:20.350 
bunch of replays I had from the 20-odd
games<00:07:18.289> I<00:07:18.469> had<00:07:18.619> to<00:07:18.740> play<00:07:18.919> to<00:07:18.979> get<00:07:19.219> here<00:07:19.459> some

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
games I had to play to get here some

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.299 
games I had to play to get here some
players<00:07:20.809> did<00:07:21.259> some<00:07:21.469> interesting<00:07:21.860> things<00:07:22.069> that

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:22.309 
players did some interesting things that

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:24.159 
players did some interesting things that
definitely<00:07:23.059> deserves<00:07:23.179> a<00:07:23.479> second<00:07:23.809> look<00:07:23.839> I'll

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169 
definitely deserves a second look I'll

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:26.800 
definitely deserves a second look I'll
see<00:07:24.589> there
