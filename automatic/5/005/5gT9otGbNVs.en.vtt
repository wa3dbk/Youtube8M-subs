gonna give you some tips and tricks that

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.640 
gonna give you some tips and tricks that
have<00:00:14.910> helped<00:00:15.150> me<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:16.170> might<00:00:16.320> not<00:00:16.470> be<00:00:16.560> the

have helped me it might not be the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.590 
have helped me it might not be the
proper<00:00:16.980> way<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.330> gotten

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
proper way to do it but it's gotten

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.090 
proper way to do it but it's gotten
pretty<00:00:18.779> good<00:00:18.840> results<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.380> far<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.800> hopefully

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
pretty good results so far and hopefully

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.790 
pretty good results so far and hopefully
they'll<00:00:20.189> help<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.080 

no<00:00:26.800> matter<00:00:27.010> how<00:00:27.190> many<00:00:27.340> spins<00:00:27.580> you're<00:00:27.760> doing

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
no matter how many spins you're doing

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.170 
no matter how many spins you're doing
the<00:00:28.869> kickoff<00:00:29.200> is<00:00:29.260> pretty<00:00:29.619> important<00:00:30.160> so<00:00:31.119> I'm

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
the kickoff is pretty important so I'm

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.850 
the kickoff is pretty important so I'm
going<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.330> teach<00:00:31.540> you<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.720> method<00:00:32.200> that<00:00:32.380> I<00:00:32.590> use

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
going to teach you the method that I use

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.000 
going to teach you the method that I use
for<00:00:33.100> it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
for it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.459 
for it
first<00:00:36.010> I<00:00:36.370> take<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.269> step<00:00:37.600> back<00:00:37.840> with<00:00:38.109> my<00:00:38.260> right

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
first I take a step back with my right

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.979 
first I take a step back with my right
foot<00:00:38.739> I<00:00:40.410> then<00:00:41.410> kick<00:00:41.620> off<00:00:41.800> with<00:00:41.920> my<00:00:42.100> left<00:00:42.129> foot

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
foot I then kick off with my left foot

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.619 
foot I then kick off with my left foot
rotate<00:00:43.989> on<00:00:44.170> my<00:00:44.649> right<00:00:44.860> foot<00:00:45.129> and<00:00:45.370> use<00:00:46.300> my<00:00:46.449> left

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
rotate on my right foot and use my left

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.250 
rotate on my right foot and use my left
foot<00:00:46.839> to<00:00:46.960> stop<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.289> spin<00:00:48.809> now<00:00:49.809> let's<00:00:50.019> look<00:00:50.140> at

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
foot to stop the spin now let's look at

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.410 
foot to stop the spin now let's look at
it<00:00:50.350> in<00:00:50.409> full<00:00:50.649> motion<00:00:53.549> and<00:00:54.549> from<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.269> other

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
it in full motion and from the other

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.840 
it in full motion and from the other
side

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.010 

alright<00:01:07.640> spotting<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.729> pretty<00:01:08.940> simple<00:01:09.210> keep

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
alright spotting is pretty simple keep

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
alright spotting is pretty simple keep
your<00:01:10.170> head<00:01:10.350> straight<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.950> eyes<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.370> the

resume the basic pattern that's pretty

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:38.810 
resume the basic pattern that's pretty
much<00:01:26.940> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
a 360 or other multiple spins is very

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.810 
a 360 or other multiple spins is very
important<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:43.990> as<00:01:44.110> not<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.410> fall<00:01:44.680> over<00:01:45.040> best

four connected 360s set up throws are
pretty<00:02:04.300> much<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.630> most<00:02:04.750> important<00:02:05.350> thing

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
pretty much the most important thing

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.790 
pretty much the most important thing
just<00:02:06.990> make<00:02:07.990> sure<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.380> they're<00:02:08.590> high<00:02:08.770> enough

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
just make sure that they're high enough

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.670 
just make sure that they're high enough
and<00:02:09.400> in<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:10.060> pretty<00:02:10.300> tight<00:02:10.600> pattern<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.260> you

and in a pretty tight pattern and you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:21.800 
and in a pretty tight pattern and you
should<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:12.010> fine

and tight set up throws and you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.550 
and tight set up throws and you
shouldn't<00:02:30.670> really<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:30.940> any<00:02:31.090> trouble

when it comes to the feet just use the

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
same method to spin as for a 360 you

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.830 
same method to spin as for a 360 you
just<00:02:44.200> spend<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.410> little<00:02:44.500> bit<00:02:44.620> harder<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:46.599> may

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
just spend a little bit harder you may

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.300 
just spend a little bit harder you may
have<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.019> little<00:02:47.200> bit<00:02:47.349> of<00:02:47.379> trouble<00:02:47.830> stopping

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
have a little bit of trouble stopping

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.910 
have a little bit of trouble stopping
the<00:02:48.430> spin<00:02:48.700> at<00:02:48.940> first<00:02:49.390> but<00:02:50.200> you'll<00:02:50.440> get<00:02:50.530> used<00:02:50.769> to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
the spin at first but you'll get used to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.320 
the spin at first but you'll get used to
it

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330 

one<00:02:55.330> other<00:02:55.450> tip<00:02:55.660> when<00:02:55.810> working<00:02:55.989> out<00:02:56.230> 720s<00:02:57.040> is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
one other tip when working out 720s is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.650 
one other tip when working out 720s is
to<00:02:57.489> tuck<00:02:57.670> your<00:02:57.790> arms<00:02:57.879> in<00:02:58.120> close<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.420> your<00:02:58.510> body

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
to tuck your arms in close to your body

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.990 
to tuck your arms in close to your body
when<00:02:58.930> executing<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> spin<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.640> helps<00:03:00.879> ease

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
when executing the spin this helps ease

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.449 
when executing the spin this helps ease
been<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> little<00:03:01.390> bit<00:03:01.480> faster<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.459> every

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
been a little bit faster and every

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.130 
been a little bit faster and every
little<00:03:03.730> bit<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.849> speed<00:03:04.090> helps<00:03:04.390> when<00:03:04.930> working

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
little bit of speed helps when working

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.470 
little bit of speed helps when working
on<00:03:05.379> some<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.739> more<00:03:05.920> advanced<00:03:06.480> multiple

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480

the<00:03:13.209> 1080<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.319> can't<00:03:14.560> give<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.799> any<00:03:14.920> tips<00:03:15.069> on

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
the 1080 so I can't give you any tips on

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.300 
the 1080 so I can't give you any tips on
how<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.400> master<00:03:15.849> it<00:03:16.110> however<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.380> would<00:03:18.130> suggest

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
how to master it however I would suggest

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.850 
how to master it however I would suggest
working<00:03:18.910> with<00:03:19.060> three<00:03:19.299> balls<00:03:19.860> concentrating

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
three spins off of one kick if you don't

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.339 
three spins off of one kick if you don't
feel<00:03:27.819> comfortable<00:03:28.030> doing<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.660> 1080<00:03:29.019> with<00:03:29.140> three

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
a consistent spin until you do feel

a consistent spin until you do feel
comfortable<00:03:34.450> with<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.549> then<00:03:36.549> start<00:03:36.940> working

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
comfortable with it then start working

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.680

really<00:03:44.769> important<00:03:45.700> on<00:03:45.850> this<00:03:46.030> one<00:03:46.269> as<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:47.470> need

quite a bit of time to spin around three

times then once you feel comfortable it
get<00:03:54.190> rid<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.370> go<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:55.480> probably<00:03:55.750> won't<00:03:55.870> get

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
get rid of go you probably won't get

your<00:03:56.230> first<00:03:56.410> try<00:03:56.650> but<00:03:56.889> eventually<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.639> will

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
your first try but eventually you will

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:05.800 
your first try but eventually you will
and<00:03:59.130> it's<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.280> pretty<00:04:00.430> cool<00:04:00.609> trick

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810
