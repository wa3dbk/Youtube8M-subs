00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.199 

I<00:02:14.540> don't<00:02:15.260> know<00:02:15.440> if<00:02:15.590> either<00:02:16.129> of<00:02:16.400> them<00:02:16.640> would<00:02:16.940> be

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
I don't know if either of them would be

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.100 
I don't know if either of them would be
a<00:02:17.540> better<00:02:18.530> spawn<00:02:19.190> than<00:02:20.150> Michael<00:02:20.900> Jai<00:02:21.080> White

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
a better spawn than Michael Jai White

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.699 
a better spawn than Michael Jai White
was<00:02:21.620> personally<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:23.599> don't<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.110> think<00:02:24.440> they

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
was personally I just don't I think they

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.930 
was personally I just don't I think they
might<00:02:24.890> want<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.190> get<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.430> unknown<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:26.629> do<00:02:26.780> it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
might want to get it unknown to do it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.150 
might want to get it unknown to do it
that's<00:02:28.940> just<00:02:29.030> my<00:02:29.420> thoughts<00:02:29.810> Jamie<00:02:30.319> doesn't<00:02:30.800> do

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
that's just my thoughts Jamie doesn't do

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.900 
that's just my thoughts Jamie doesn't do
it<00:02:31.310> for<00:02:31.550> me

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910
