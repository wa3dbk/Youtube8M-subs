00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.770
 using centuries of technology can 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.129
 to restore antique figurines and 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.570
 make new to start take the usual 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.910
 beeswax and paraffin wax 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.039
 chalk powder that is needed to make wax 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.260
 was not transparent and a bit solid 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.760
 animal fat without figurines 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.580
 would be too fragile 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.310
 All ingredients are placed in a container and 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.300
 heat this process lasts two hours 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.860
 until the mass is soft and smooth 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.950
 then mix oil tint 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.960
 paint 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.210
 there is no exact recipe here and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.250
 everything is done what is called the eye 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.570
 some time a master 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.910
 experimenting with tones 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.830
 until she gets that color 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.630
 need as soon as the mass becomes 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.070
 monophonic and filter through the stocking 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.320
 Now the mixture is poured into a plaster mold. 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.340
 for each figure it has its own 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.520
 this baby jesus 10 minutes and wax 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.140
 freezes take out the figure is easy because 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.940
 before pouring the mold properly 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 missed peeled lamb fat 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.619
 the figure has already hardened so you can 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.830
 boldly take out of shape but it is not yet 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.830
 everything 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.560
 1 caliph on fire the blade of the skilled worker removes 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:31.250
 excess wax that came out between the two 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:31.880
 the halves of the form then the figure is brought 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.429
 to fire 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.610
 heating up after cleaning 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.590
 wax particles melted 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.659
 after that the surface level 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.229
 special solvent and applied to 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.899
 stick figure 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.799
 master initials then and again 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.799
 bring to the fire 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.250
 Now you can go to work on 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.170
 details in the head figures cover 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.150
 melted glue 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.840
 pine gum and beeswax 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.940
 Now is the time to do a hairstyle for 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.280
 this take a bunch of human hair 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.610
 usually customers bring their hair 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.490
 children and rallies them in the water 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.900
 in addition to the water immersed strips of cloth 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.720
 to make your hair curly 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.880
 reels them on knitting needles then 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 curls covered with a cloth and holds it up 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.180
 drying out 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.640
 there is another way of drying in the oven on 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.300
 slow fire in this case is not important 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.790
 overdo 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.650
 from she figure can remain at all 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.070
 without hair for bigger figures 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.270
 use a thicker knitting needle 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.430
 then take a hot blade and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.830
 melt them glue which then 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.110
 applied separately on each curl 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.940
 as soon as the head is ready for it attach 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.750
 small made of tin wire 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.340
 it would be the extreme heat the wax melts and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.340
 does not allow the wire to disconnect 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.519
 for drawing details uses 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.319
 small sharp tool which 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.590
 occasionally heats about the flame and 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.590
 cuts eyes eyelids nostrils and lips 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.980
 a little solution and all the excess disappears 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.080
 Now you see how the skilled worker rubs 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.760
 a powder figure from penza and pigment so 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.950
 watercolor paints will keep better 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.080
 on wax 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.580
 Now is the time to draw the eyes. 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.580
 eyebrows and lips 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.330
 as soon as the paint has dried eyes 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:47.100
 varnished so they will seem 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.400
 more bright and shining on now 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.710
 the final touch of the figure is dressed and she 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.710
 can take a worthy place on the shelf
