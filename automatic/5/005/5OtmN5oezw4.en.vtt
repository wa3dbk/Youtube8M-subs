tiffen I don't know who makes these
quite<00:00:18.800> honestly<00:00:19.189> I<00:00:19.279> bought<00:00:19.700> it<00:00:19.880> in<00:00:20.029> southern

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
quite honestly I bought it in southern

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.210 
quite honestly I bought it in southern
Europe<00:00:20.779> in<00:00:20.960> fact<00:00:21.140> I<00:00:21.260> bought<00:00:21.380> several<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:22.010> them

Europe in fact I bought several of them

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.179 
Europe in fact I bought several of them
yeah<00:00:22.550> they<00:00:22.759> are<00:00:22.849> pretty<00:00:23.029> good<00:00:23.180> quality<00:00:23.599> lock<00:00:23.779> I

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
yeah they are pretty good quality lock I

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.249 
yeah they are pretty good quality lock I
think<00:00:25.189> it<00:00:25.400> is<00:00:25.520> either<00:00:25.730> Spanish<00:00:26.119> or<00:00:26.390> French<00:00:26.599> I

really don't know but anyway they've
come<00:00:29.270> very<00:00:29.599> common<00:00:29.990> in<00:00:30.079> southern<00:00:30.410> Europe

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
come very common in southern Europe

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.250 
come very common in southern Europe
pretty<00:00:31.730> good<00:00:31.910> quality<00:00:32.269> lock<00:00:32.449> as<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:32.900> can<00:00:33.080> see

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
pretty good quality lock as you can see

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.509 
pretty good quality lock as you can see
we<00:00:33.470> got<00:00:34.239> here's<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.420> bidding<00:00:36.250> so<00:00:37.250> we<00:00:37.340> got<00:00:37.489> a

low<00:00:42.170> one<00:00:42.350> here<00:00:42.530> near<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.769> end<00:00:42.920> could<00:00:43.040> create

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
low one here near the end could create

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.040 
low one here near the end could create
some<00:00:43.790> problem<00:00:44.180> then<00:00:44.300> we<00:00:44.390> got<00:00:44.510> some<00:00:44.660> high<00:00:44.809> one

some problem then we got some high one

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.110 
some problem then we got some high one
so<00:00:45.290> but<00:00:45.980> we'll<00:00:46.129> get<00:00:46.220> it<00:00:46.339> picked<00:00:46.489> I'm<00:00:46.760> not<00:00:46.940> to

you to work for it

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.719 
you to work for it
and<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.470> let's<00:00:57.860> go<00:00:58.010> ahead<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:58.250> get<00:00:58.339> started<00:00:58.430> on

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
and so let's go ahead and get started on

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.420 
and so let's go ahead and get started on
it<00:00:58.879> you<00:00:59.420> can<00:00:59.540> see<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.839> keyway<00:01:00.199> is<00:01:00.229> very<00:01:00.920> open

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
it you can see the keyway is very open

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.990 
it you can see the keyway is very open
oh<00:01:01.750> sorry<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:03.440> again<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.159> y<00:01:04.309> one<00:01:04.580> key<00:01:04.850> way

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
oh sorry it's again the y one key way

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.450 
oh sorry it's again the y one key way
the<00:01:05.180> larger<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.049> Yale<00:01:06.290> key<00:01:06.650> ways<00:01:06.830> again

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
the larger of the Yale key ways again

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.420 
the larger of the Yale key ways again
very<00:01:07.700> common<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.210> Europe<00:01:08.500> there's<00:01:09.500> no<00:01:09.860> play<00:01:10.189> in

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
very common in Europe there's no play in

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.770 
very common in Europe there's no play in
here<00:01:10.670> which<00:01:10.850> might<00:01:11.090> lead<00:01:11.299> you<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.570> believe

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
here which might lead you to believe

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.770 
here which might lead you to believe
that<00:01:12.200> there's<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:13.210> standard<00:01:14.210> pin<00:01:14.510> but<00:01:14.750> I

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
that there's a a standard pin but I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.170 
that there's a a standard pin but I
don't<00:01:15.140> believe<00:01:15.409> there<00:01:15.680> is<00:01:15.860> there<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:16.850> no

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
don't believe there is there is no

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.389 
don't believe there is there is no
locking<00:01:17.750> pin<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.350> bottom<00:01:18.530> as<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:18.950> find<00:01:19.280> in

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
locking pin on the bottom as you find in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:20.160 
locking pin on the bottom as you find in
the<00:01:19.520> bureau

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
the bureau

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.889 
the bureau
so<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.850> tolerances<00:01:23.299> on<00:01:23.420> these<00:01:23.570> are<00:01:23.719> very

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
so the tolerances on these are very

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.749 
so the tolerances on these are very
tight<00:01:24.140> you're<00:01:24.740> gonna<00:01:24.829> get<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.039> lot<00:01:25.189> of<00:01:25.250> a<00:01:25.520> lot<00:01:25.670> of

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
tight you're gonna get a lot of a lot of

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.020 
tight you're gonna get a lot of a lot of
pins<00:01:25.909> binding<00:01:26.420> at<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.630> same<00:01:26.840> time<00:01:28.000> ok<00:01:29.000> so

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
pins binding at the same time ok so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.599 
pins binding at the same time ok so
again<00:01:29.600> like<00:01:29.990> all<00:01:30.200> high<00:01:30.619> security<00:01:31.100> locks<00:01:31.310> or

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
again like all high security locks or

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.730 
again like all high security locks or
locks<00:01:32.149> containing<00:01:32.630> security<00:01:33.020> pins<00:01:33.229> let's<00:01:33.499> go

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
locks containing security pins let's go

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.109 
locks containing security pins let's go
ahead<00:01:33.859> and<00:01:34.070> see<00:01:34.189> if<00:01:34.219> we<00:01:34.310> can't<00:01:34.579> get<00:01:34.700> us<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.909> false

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
ahead and see if we can't get us a false

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.370 
ahead and see if we can't get us a false
set<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.659> was<00:01:35.749> a<00:01:35.780> little<00:01:35.929> variety<00:01:36.350> of

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
set and that was a little variety of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.770 
set and that was a little variety of
ways<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.710> do<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.159> we<00:01:38.060> can<00:01:38.149> use<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.420> rocking

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
ways to do that we can use the rocking

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.899 
ways to do that we can use the rocking
technique<00:01:39.170> which<00:01:39.409> for<00:01:39.619> me<00:01:39.740> works<00:01:40.429> almost

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
technique which for me works almost

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.719 
technique which for me works almost
every<00:01:41.299> time<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.929> basis<00:01:42.259> but<00:01:42.499> it<00:01:43.340> doesn't

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
every time on a basis but it doesn't

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.450 
every time on a basis but it doesn't
work<00:01:43.850> on<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.420> tip<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.469> don't<00:01:45.859> know<00:01:46.130> why<00:01:46.280> I've

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
work on the tip on I don't know why I've

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.730 
work on the tip on I don't know why I've
written<00:01:46.670> dive<00:01:46.999> uh<00:01:47.049> rock<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.200> heck<00:01:48.380> out<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.560> it

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
written dive uh rock the heck out of it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.880 
written dive uh rock the heck out of it
and<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:48.979> just<00:01:49.009> never<00:01:49.399> seem<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.670> get<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.060> in<00:01:50.210> fact

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
and I just never seem to get it in fact

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.959 
and I just never seem to get it in fact
unlike<00:01:51.890> them<00:01:52.039> almost<00:01:52.280> all<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.549> other<00:01:52.700> locks

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
unlike them almost all the other locks

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.139 
unlike them almost all the other locks
when<00:01:53.299> I<00:01:53.329> do<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:54.079> with<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.619> tip<00:01:54.799> on<00:01:55.119> not<00:01:56.119> a

when I do this with the tip on not a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.090 
when I do this with the tip on not a
single<00:01:56.630> pin<00:01:56.899> appears<00:01:57.109> to<00:01:57.469> be<00:01:57.560> setting<00:01:57.920> here

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
nothing in there crunching around so I

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.469 
nothing in there crunching around so I

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
know right away that a they're all

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.179 
know right away that a they're all
security<00:02:02.899> pins<00:02:03.109> and<00:02:03.289> B<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.590> it's<00:02:03.770> pretty

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
security pins and B that it's pretty

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.999 
security pins and B that it's pretty
tight<00:02:04.670> specifications<00:02:05.090> on<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.840> machining<00:02:06.350> so

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
tight specifications on the machining so

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.830 
tight specifications on the machining so
I've<00:02:07.100> gotten<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.399> choice<00:02:07.639> I<00:02:07.969> literally<00:02:08.569> have<00:02:08.810> to

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
I've gotten a choice I literally have to

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.620 
I've gotten a choice I literally have to
go<00:02:08.960> pin<00:02:09.350> by<00:02:09.560> pin<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.670> can<00:02:10.970> try<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.270> just

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
go pin by pin so I can try to just

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.130 
go pin by pin so I can try to just
randomly<00:02:12.260> throw<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:12.980> there<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:14.240> happen

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
randomly throw it in there and I happen

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.530 
randomly throw it in there and I happen
to<00:02:15.170> get<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> fault<00:02:15.709> set<00:02:16.100> there<00:02:16.340> or<00:02:16.970> I'll<00:02:17.360> release

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
to get a fault set there or I'll release

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.800 
to get a fault set there or I'll release
this<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.990> can<00:02:18.140> go<00:02:18.260> pin<00:02:18.620> by<00:02:18.800> pin

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
this you can go pin by pin

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.800

and I don't need to go back to one till
we<00:02:34.690> find<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.959> one<00:02:35.080> pin<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.430> gives

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
we find the one pin that that it gives

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.449 
we find the one pin that that it gives
us<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.850> false<00:02:37.030> set<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:38.319> lock<00:02:38.560> that's<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
us a false set in this lock that's the

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.699 
us a false set in this lock that's the
most<00:02:39.670> effective<00:02:40.270> technique<00:02:40.690> because<00:02:41.530> they

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
most effective technique because they

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.860 
most effective technique because they
all<00:02:41.890> bind<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.819> when<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.300> put<00:02:43.510> tension<00:02:43.690> on

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
all bind so when you put tension on

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.170 
all bind so when you put tension on
there<00:02:44.050> they're<00:02:44.200> all<00:02:44.440> bound<00:02:44.770> up<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.850> again

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
there they're all bound up so that again

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.240 
there they're all bound up so that again
again<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.690> an<00:02:46.780> indication<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.380> pretty<00:02:48.100> high

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
again is an indication of pretty high

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.490 
again is an indication of pretty high
quality<00:02:48.660> machining<00:02:49.660> inside<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.140> these<00:02:50.260> two

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
quality machining inside of these two

step<00:02:53.739> done<00:02:53.920> we<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.640> fault<00:02:54.820> set<00:02:55.060> let's

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
step done we have the fault set let's

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.479 
step done we have the fault set let's
just<00:02:55.570> go<00:02:55.750> ahead<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.110> start<00:02:56.380> pulling<00:02:56.620> go<00:02:57.430> to

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
just go ahead and start pulling go to

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.070 
just go ahead and start pulling go to
the<00:02:57.610> rear<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.970> start<00:02:58.209> moving<00:02:58.360> forward<00:02:58.540> and

the rear and start moving forward and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.170 
the rear and start moving forward and
we're<00:02:59.410> gonna<00:02:59.500> find<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.070> binding<00:03:00.550> pin<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
we're gonna find the binding pin and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.370 
we're gonna find the binding pin and
there<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.290> go<00:03:02.440> if<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.830> put<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.810> can<00:03:04.930> see<00:03:05.170> we're

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
there we go if you put you can see we're

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.070 
there we go if you put you can see we're

it<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.760> again<00:03:58.000> same<00:03:58.510> procedure<00:03:59.079> of<00:03:59.320> tension<00:03:59.799> on

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
it so again same procedure of tension on

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.640 
it so again same procedure of tension on
the<00:04:00.910> pick<00:04:01.120> release<00:04:01.690> tension<00:04:02.109> on<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.290> tension

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
the pick release tension on the tension

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.280 
the pick release tension on the tension

moving<00:04:08.650> up<00:04:08.769> I<00:04:09.250> got<00:04:09.820> feedback<00:04:10.150> on<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.660> looks

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
moving up I got feedback on it looks

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.259 
moving up I got feedback on it looks
like<00:04:10.870> pin<00:04:11.230> three<00:04:11.650> there<00:04:13.890> okay<00:04:15.060> same<00:04:16.060> procedure

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
like pin three there okay same procedure

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.449 
like pin three there okay same procedure

tension send him home
okay<00:04:23.280> now<00:04:23.460> if<00:04:23.879> we<00:04:24.539> should<00:04:24.750> start<00:04:25.020> dropping

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
okay now if we should start dropping

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.929 
okay now if we should start dropping
pins<00:04:25.710> here<00:04:25.949> pretty<00:04:26.159> quick<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.610> that's<00:04:26.669> what

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
pins here pretty quick and that's what

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:30.999 
pins here pretty quick and that's what
makes<00:04:27.120> these<00:04:27.300> things<00:04:27.360> fun<00:04:28.669> I'm<00:04:29.669> back<00:04:29.879> on<00:04:30.030> pin<00:04:30.330> 4

there's our feedback quite dramatic 10
pressure<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:47.009> pic<00:04:47.250> release<00:04:47.849> tension

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.850 

let<00:04:53.460> me<00:04:53.580> get<00:04:53.699> centered<00:04:54.030> on<00:04:54.180> that<00:04:54.210> pin<00:04:54.900> head<00:04:55.199> do

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
let me get centered on that pin head do

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.839 
let me get centered on that pin head do
this<00:04:56.009> right<00:04:57.139> ok<00:04:58.139> we<00:04:58.319> sent<00:04:58.560> him<00:04:58.680> ok<00:04:59.310> continue

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
this right ok we sent him ok continue

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.369 
this right ok we sent him ok continue
poling<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.830> looks<00:05:01.979> like<00:05:02.039> somebody<00:05:02.550> dropped

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
poling so it looks like somebody dropped

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.469 
poling so it looks like somebody dropped
looks<00:05:04.379> like<00:05:04.560> pin<00:05:04.800> 3<00:05:05.159> let's<00:05:05.550> send<00:05:06.150> him<00:05:06.300> home

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
looks like pin 3 let's send him home

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.839 
looks like pin 3 let's send him home
again<00:05:08.719> there<00:05:09.719> we<00:05:09.810> go<00:05:10.080> no<00:05:10.710> mr.<00:05:11.370> rolled<00:05:11.639> off<00:05:11.819> the

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
again there we go no mr. rolled off the

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.779 
again there we go no mr. rolled off the
pin<00:05:12.330> head<00:05:12.599> we'll<00:05:12.870> do<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:13.050> again<00:05:13.490> there<00:05:14.490> we<00:05:14.610> go

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
pin head we'll do it again there we go

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.689 
pin head we'll do it again there we go
and<00:05:15.090> we<00:05:15.210> lost<00:05:15.419> our<00:05:15.599> false<00:05:15.900> set<00:05:16.229> so<00:05:17.129> we<00:05:17.490> know

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
and we lost our false set so we know

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.730 
and we lost our false set so we know
that<00:05:18.060> 2<00:05:18.300> is<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.629> binding<00:05:19.020> one<00:05:19.139> will<00:05:19.319> pop<00:05:19.469> him

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
that 2 is the binding one will pop him

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.300 
that 2 is the binding one will pop him
back<00:05:19.979> in<00:05:20.900> we<00:05:21.900> did<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.229> we<00:05:22.529> got<00:05:22.590> our<00:05:22.800> fault<00:05:23.039> set

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
back in we did it we got our fault set

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.219 
back in we did it we got our fault set
back<00:05:25.940> looks<00:05:26.940> like<00:05:27.029> 10<00:05:27.300> ones<00:05:27.539> back<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:27.990> forward

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
back looks like 10 ones back and forward

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.320 
back looks like 10 ones back and forward
again

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
again

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:37.519 
again
there<00:05:30.330> we<00:05:30.419> go<00:05:31.250> back<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.490> rear<00:05:35.719> pin<00:05:36.719> 4<00:05:37.050> he's

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
there we go back to the rear pin 4 he's

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:43.149 
there we go back to the rear pin 4 he's
home<00:05:37.800> ok<00:05:38.219> pin<00:05:38.490> 3<00:05:38.849> again<00:05:39.860> ok<00:05:40.860> what<00:05:41.219> Jen<00:05:41.490> him<00:05:41.729> home

home ok pin 3 again ok what Jen him home

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.490 
home ok pin 3 again ok what Jen him home
he<00:05:44.159> just<00:05:44.339> double<00:05:44.669> check<00:05:44.940> yep<00:05:45.509> he's<00:05:46.139> the<00:05:46.349> only

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.230 

there<00:05:53.849> we<00:05:53.969> go<00:05:54.529> see<00:05:55.529> who<00:05:55.710> else<00:05:55.949> wants<00:05:56.400> it<00:05:56.520> now

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
there we go see who else wants it now

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.640 
there we go see who else wants it now
obviously<00:05:57.599> we<00:05:57.779> didn't<00:05:58.020> get<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.229> binding

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
obviously we didn't get the binding

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.439 
obviously we didn't get the binding
sequence<00:05:58.830> right<00:05:59.310> but<00:05:59.639> that's<00:05:59.939> ok<00:06:00.270> because

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
sequence right but that's ok because

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.480 
sequence right but that's ok because
this<00:06:00.689> is<00:06:00.839> all<00:06:00.960> about<00:06:01.199> practice<00:06:02.069> this<00:06:02.219> is<00:06:02.370> all

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490

okay you saw him and I lost my fault set

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.269 
okay you saw him and I lost my fault set
so<00:06:09.900> it's<00:06:10.050> got<00:06:10.229> to<00:06:10.319> be<00:06:10.349> pinned<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.800> would<00:06:11.159> come

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
so it's got to be pinned to would come

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.510 
so it's got to be pinned to would come
up<00:06:11.430> here<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:11.729> take<00:06:11.879> a<00:06:11.909> look<00:06:12.800> back<00:06:13.800> to<00:06:13.979> fall<00:06:14.189> set

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
up here and take a look back to fall set

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.689 
up here and take a look back to fall set
ok<00:06:15.060> cool

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699
