for the performance now why did it mean
that<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.460> meant<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.759> in<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.179> past<00:01:09.450> because

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:09.929 
that it meant that in the past because

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.520 
that it meant that in the past because
Hardware<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.679> fucking<00:01:11.369> weird<00:01:12.259> nobody<00:01:13.259> knew

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
Hardware was fucking weird nobody knew

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.050 
Hardware was fucking weird nobody knew
how<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.800> code<00:01:14.069> for<00:01:14.099> it<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.700> were<00:01:14.789> RISC

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
how to code for it there were RISC

was<00:01:17.759> XDR<00:01:18.300> memory<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.410> stuff<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.649> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
was XDR memory there was stuff that you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.650 
was XDR memory there was stuff that you
just<00:01:20.069> didn't<00:01:20.459> learn<00:01:20.610> how<00:01:20.849> to<00:01:20.880> program<00:01:21.179> for

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
when you went to school so you had to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.040 
when you went to school so you had to
figure<00:01:23.459> out<00:01:23.640> what<00:01:23.849> to<00:01:23.940> do<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.300> teams<00:01:24.539> overtime

figure out what to do in teams overtime

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.270 
figure out what to do in teams overtime
would<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.380> better<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.800> better<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.160> getting

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280

you've got what is something that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.029 
you've got what is something that
everyone<00:01:48.270> learns<00:01:48.599> how<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.319> program<00:01:49.709> for<00:01:49.860> when

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
they go to game design school

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.690 
they go to game design school
so<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.929> optimization<00:01:52.649> means<00:01:52.830> now<00:01:53.160> is<00:01:53.520> not

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so what optimization means now is not

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.760 
so what optimization means now is not

let's write an algorithm that can use

let's write an algorithm that can use

this portion of the XDR memory as a

this portion of the XDR memory as a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
cache because the hard drive is so slow

we're<00:02:06.599> not<00:02:06.750> seeing<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.319> anymore

what<00:02:08.459> optimization<00:02:09.149> means<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:10.020> oK<00:02:10.890> we've

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
what optimization means now is oK we've

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.800 
what optimization means now is oK we've
maxed<00:02:11.489> out<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> hardware<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> frame

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
maxed out this hardware and the frame

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.110 
maxed out this hardware and the frame
rate<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.170> really<00:02:13.350> derpy<00:02:13.890> well<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.520> guess<00:02:14.820> we<00:02:15.000> can

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
rate is really derpy well I guess we can

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.910 
rate is really derpy well I guess we can
scale<00:02:15.390> back<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.810> anti-aliasing<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.620> guess<00:02:16.770> we

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
scale back the anti-aliasing I guess we

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.340 
scale back the anti-aliasing I guess we
can<00:02:17.070> scale<00:02:17.370> back<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.760> resolution

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
can scale back the resolution

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.830 
can scale back the resolution
optimization<00:02:19.350> now<00:02:19.800> does<00:02:20.310> not<00:02:20.340> mean<00:02:20.840> make

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
optimization now does not mean make

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.290 
optimization now does not mean make
better<00:02:22.200> software<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.640> take<00:02:23.970> better<00:02:24.240> advantage

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
better software to take better advantage

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.200 
better software to take better advantage
of<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> hardware<00:02:25.080> optimization<00:02:26.040> now<00:02:26.730> means

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
of the hardware optimization now means

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.360 
of the hardware optimization now means
shit<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.170> hardware's<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:28.800> good<00:02:29.040> enough<00:02:29.250> I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
shit the hardware's not good enough I

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.010 
shit the hardware's not good enough I
guess<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.700> need<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.910> scale<00:02:30.120> back<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.540> graphics

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
guess we need to scale back the graphics

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.280 
guess we need to scale back the graphics
so<00:02:31.830> an<00:02:32.040> example<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.730> would<00:02:32.910> be<00:02:33.260> Ryse<00:02:34.260> son

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
so an example of that would be Ryse son

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.130 
so an example of that would be Ryse son

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
character model so they took back the

and<00:02:48.240> 1080p<00:02:48.720> requires<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.740> they<00:02:49.860> scaled<00:02:50.160> it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280

back to 900 P they did some stuff with

the lighting effects to make it look a

the lighting effects to make it look a
little<00:02:53.850> bit<00:02:54.060> better<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:54.480> they<00:02:54.930> scaled

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
little bit better and then they scaled

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.960 
little bit better and then they scaled
