00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:47.129
 but intended for boys and welcome in 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.140
 this new gameplay I'm laughing because 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.520
 I've been trying for months 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.500
 pronounce this name of this game 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.149
 but it's impossible 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.680
 I try guys then here is mine 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.140
 sister next door who will be the American 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 perfectly therefore as themes of the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.420
 Chinese boxing is wrong the name however the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.939
 title is never of quest for happy claude 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.799
 ok i said just fine anyway 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.479
 we tried the boys this morning at 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.540
 this fantastic game I have to say that 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 from the presentation of ubisoft in tea 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 in the los angeles theater they did 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.020
 see a movie in computer graphics 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.630
 very very nice of this one 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.610
 this character who went around and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.610
 yes, it was a disaster 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.350
 in fact I don't have in computer graphics by 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.579
 what it was and therefore it was given between 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.439
 quotes for children for kids 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.060
 in fact , after trying it guys 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.979
 with the neighbor developer I am 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.600
 noticed that they died other times me 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.039
 I realize that it is not so much for children 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:54.640
 also because the developer himself 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:57.200
 died a great man to explain to us 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.950
 tell us how the various skills are there 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.350
 in the game how hard and bad it is 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.080
 however touches this boys game is a 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.459
 therefore, free to play is free 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.319
 completely free surfaces 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.269
 obviously it is developed by ubisoft 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.140
 montreal is set in a world 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.910
 medieval fantasy called opulence yes 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.720
 it had to be opulence ever ok 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.950
 pronounced more anxiety 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.049
 at the beginning of the game you can choose 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.870
 a hero is among a series of characters 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.080
 rather I have to say how extravagant it is 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.090
 it is said right it was I came on the net 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.590
 fantastic improving dis-Tokyo 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.380
 or an archer with a hawk on the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.940
 shoulder but it's practically 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.060
 you will have to deal with your friends 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.890
 neighbors because they immediately try to cheat 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.540
 your belongings as all are neighbors of 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.730
 all the world how to do so for 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.060
 become the richest and most envied hero 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.680
 of the whole simple kingdom but not too much 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.840
 practically in the game you can play 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.770
 make a castle create a castle 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.720
 every person ie every player will 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.820
 can create his castle 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.890
 obviously everything online and us 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.810
 we could skip sonics and always repeat 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.940
 castles but of course only castles e 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.280
 enough and you can choose and you can 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.740
 sorry to occasional others ' home for 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.360
 steal the treasure that is practically there 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.250
 inside, however, to do so we will need to 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.230
 overcome a mess of traps issued 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.580
 by the player himself 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.020
 it also seems to me the various monsters enemies 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.720
 in fact jim that turns so to the fuck if 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.890
 all things like that and it's hard 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.470
 no, but we are so cagata 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.030
 guys but here i can assure you that for 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.890
 die the developer who did the 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.580
 game practically it takes is not that 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:44.840
 a developer dies like this and it is a lot 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:46.370
 difficult to play nice 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.530
 in most boys it will obviously not be possible 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.000
 it is only to attack the castles of the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.500
 others because it is not that others are 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.920
 more losers than you so they too 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.480
 in fact, they will have to attack yours 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.400
 defend it by age of empires 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.410
 let's say two must create you as I said 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.330
 first traps and you have to create monsters 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.599
 you have to buy monsters indeed there are various 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.610
 categories for example partisan with the 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.459
 larger buses then there is the one more 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.680
 let's say small but has the power to 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.760
 resurrect others then killed him 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.709
 first otherwise a lot of stuff 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.470
 fundamental girls who can 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.880
 buy armor weapons and therefore for 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.479
 completely customize ours 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.220
 hero and you can do it both with credits 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.100
 of the game earned by looting the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.690
 castles or through tele gems that 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.610
 you will earn both in the game however in 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.169
 less can be said like this 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.210
 or we could buy these gems 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.590
 with credit card and other things like i 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.810
 free to play like all free to play that 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.190
 there are on the market we say and through 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.139
 this could really be armor 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.600
 together with ever more powerful swords 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.870
 traps new ultra gatsu exhibits ti 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.220
 show you something that I was 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.110
 forgetting is that you can also 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.260
 pass from level to level increase 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.789
 in fact, after a series of killings 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.979
 we will gain experience and increase 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.660
 of the level we could also spend the 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.320
 our skill points to acquire new ones 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.479
 moves 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.280
 in fact in the demo we had three super 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.770
 moves are to call them so that 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.570
 consumed mana more killing yes 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.139
 they did with the normal attack more yes 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.310
 acquired manà manà you could spend 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.050
 using these attacks 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.100
 so maybe there was the blow 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.230
 ultra-powerful for running with 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.750
 yes with the comito a stuff like that that 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.330
 throws the crossed enemy to the ground 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.210
 in fact therefore boys I must say that 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.410
 I was wonderfully impressed 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.070
 it can be said wonderful while on the 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.050
 withdrawal because I would never have said that a 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.230
 such game could attract the 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.090
 our attention indeed the compliments 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.800
 to developers indeed very very much 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.020
 available but it is also the fact that 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.880
 we could talk extensively with him 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.260
 developer has changed not serious about a 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.240
 game because he showed it to us 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.460
 in short, therefore, from other eyes thanks to 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.110
 developer thanks to the game and I hope that 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.520
