amplifier the GA 212 is a brand new
stage<00:00:20.180> amplifier<00:00:20.810> from<00:00:21.290> roland<00:00:21.710> this<00:00:22.009> is<00:00:22.130> a

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
stage amplifier from roland this is a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.019 
stage amplifier from roland this is a
200<00:00:22.730> watt<00:00:22.930> 212<00:00:23.930> amp<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:25.220> is<00:00:25.400> really<00:00:25.910> really

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
200 watt 212 amp this is really really

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.779 
200 watt 212 amp this is really really
loud<00:00:26.330> if<00:00:27.050> we<00:00:27.140> look<00:00:27.410> at<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:28.160> front<00:00:28.400> you<00:00:28.640> can

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
loud if we look at the the front you can

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.310 
loud if we look at the the front you can
see<00:00:28.820> it's<00:00:29.150> it's<00:00:29.359> pretty<00:00:29.630> straight<00:00:29.990> for<00:00:30.230> is

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
see it's it's pretty straight for is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.890 
see it's it's pretty straight for is
actually<00:00:30.470> very<00:00:30.769> straightforward<00:00:31.460> very

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
actually very straightforward very

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.840 
actually very straightforward very
simple<00:00:32.900> we<00:00:33.800> have<00:00:33.830> our<00:00:34.160> gain<00:00:34.519> and<00:00:34.820> volume

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
simple we have our gain and volume

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.160 
simple we have our gain and volume
controls<00:00:35.510> here<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:36.110> have<00:00:36.230> a<00:00:36.290> 3<00:00:36.530> band<00:00:36.739> eq

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
controls here we have a 3 band eq

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.259 
controls here we have a 3 band eq

straight<00:00:44.390> ahead<00:00:44.530> basic<00:00:45.530> great<00:00:46.010> amp<00:00:46.280> tone<00:00:47.049> we

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:48.049 
straight ahead basic great amp tone we

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.000 
straight ahead basic great amp tone we
have<00:00:48.170> 4<00:00:48.409> channels<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.220> each<00:00:49.790> channel<00:00:50.690> has<00:00:51.010> an

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
have 4 channels and each channel has an

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.549 
have 4 channels and each channel has an
identical<00:00:52.430> gain<00:00:52.790> stage<00:00:53.119> so<00:00:53.930> if<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.110> wanted<00:00:54.409> to

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
identical gain stage so if you wanted to

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.799 
identical gain stage so if you wanted to
we<00:00:54.739> could<00:00:54.890> actually<00:00:55.070> have<00:00:55.309> 4<00:00:55.699> clean<00:00:56.420> channels

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
we could actually have 4 clean channels

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.840 
we could actually have 4 clean channels
with<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:56.960> same<00:00:57.199> tone<00:00:57.500> or<00:00:57.920> maybe<00:00:58.400> 4<00:00:58.670> different

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
with the same tone or maybe 4 different

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.270 
with the same tone or maybe 4 different
clean<00:00:59.239> channels<00:00:59.629> of<00:00:59.780> 4<00:00:59.989> different<00:01:00.280> crunch

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
clean channels of 4 different crunch

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.820 
clean channels of 4 different crunch
tones<00:01:01.580> or<00:01:01.820> whatever<00:01:02.150> you<00:01:02.269> want<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.960> GA<00:01:03.199> 212

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
tones or whatever you want the GA 212

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.429 
tones or whatever you want the GA 212
also<00:01:04.400> has<00:01:04.549> two<00:01:04.820> effects<00:01:05.180> loops<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.290> can

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
also has two effects loops that you can

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.800 
also has two effects loops that you can
run<00:01:06.590> either<00:01:06.830> series<00:01:07.159> or<00:01:07.430> parallel<00:01:07.659> so<00:01:08.659> this

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
run either series or parallel so this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.120 
run either series or parallel so this
makes<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.080> of<00:01:09.200> course<00:01:09.380> really<00:01:09.920> really

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
makes it of course really really

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.880 
makes it of course really really
flexible<00:01:10.490> we<00:01:11.480> also<00:01:11.630> have<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.840> manual<00:01:12.140> mode<00:01:12.500> here

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
flexible we also have a manual mode here

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.850 
flexible we also have a manual mode here
and<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:13.850> basically<00:01:14.090> have<00:01:14.480> actually<00:01:15.140> five

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
and so you basically have actually five

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.420 
and so you basically have actually five
channels<00:01:17.080> let's<00:01:18.080> take<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.740> listen<00:01:18.980> to<00:01:19.190> some<00:01:19.220> of

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
channels let's take a listen to some of

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.780 
channels let's take a listen to some of
the<00:01:19.490> sounds<00:01:20.650> on<00:01:21.650> channel<00:01:22.070> one<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.280> set<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:22.700> up

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
the sounds on channel one I set it up

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.540 
the sounds on channel one I set it up
for<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:23.600> nice<00:01:23.780> clean<00:01:24.140> sound<00:01:24.520> something<00:01:25.520> like

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
for a nice clean sound something like

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:44.510 
for a nice clean sound something like
this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.249 

all<00:01:45.520> right<00:01:45.729> let's<00:01:46.030> check<00:01:46.090> out<00:01:46.390> channel<00:01:46.810> 2<00:01:47.020> and

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
all right let's check out channel 2 and

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.499 
all right let's check out channel 2 and
this<00:01:47.409> one<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.590> set<00:01:47.920> for<00:01:48.189> more<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.579> crunch<00:01:49.210> tone

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
this one I set for more of a crunch tone

00:01:49.509 --> 00:02:28.940 
this one I set for more of a crunch tone
and<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:49.960> can<00:01:50.079> sound<00:01:50.229> like<00:01:50.409> this

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.190 

this<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.100> channel<00:02:30.400> 3<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.660> set<00:02:31.900> up<00:02:32.050> to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
this is channel 3 and this I set up to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:48.450 
this is channel 3 and this I set up to
be<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> good<00:02:33.190> lead<00:02:33.430> tone<00:02:46.620> ok<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.740> is<00:02:47.890> channel<00:02:48.190> 4

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
be a good lead tone ok this is channel 4

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.970 
be a good lead tone ok this is channel 4
and<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.820> set<00:02:49.000> up<00:02:49.120> like<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.360> real<00:02:49.600> heavy

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
and this I set up like a real heavy

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.680 
and this I set up like a real heavy
rhythm<00:02:50.980> town<00:02:51.190> with<00:02:51.490> totally<00:02:51.940> scoop<00:02:52.210> mids<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
rhythm town with totally scoop mids and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:30.080 
rhythm town with totally scoop mids and
it<00:02:52.840> can<00:02:52.960> sound<00:02:53.050> like<00:02:53.230> this

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.310 

all<00:03:31.090> right<00:03:31.270> so<00:03:31.420> there<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.600> have<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.810> -<00:03:32.020> rolling

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
all right so there you have it - rolling

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.100 
all right so there you have it - rolling
