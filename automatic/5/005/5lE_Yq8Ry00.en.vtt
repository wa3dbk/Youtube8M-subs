00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.900
 I'm doing the chair now 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.730
 The Austrian can take off the front doors the luck that me 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.569
 some water 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.269
 and 13 to four tablespoons of oil 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.320
 then take different amounts of water and you do not get the recipe like that 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.799
 can indicate exactly if you need to test the dough or too liquid 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.350
 if it is too liquid to yield a little more I must have some water now 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 give in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.640
 in the whirlpool shared - something firmer is namely the one compact 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.340
 Electric machine to knead if you do not have them then you have to go with them 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.340
 knead the hand and run really nice 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.220
 currently separates from shots edge it loosens the dough well kneaded 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.440
 Beijing but again with his hands 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.950
 he should already be very elastic now 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 and not a round ball in front 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.480
 which then comes in an ethical way 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.630
 so that no skin forms 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.630
 Brush not quite for oil on it 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 health with cling film 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.430
 and then have to do something and relax Zacher an hour if that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.630
 Room of the car is in the fridge all the way to the mains always temperature 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.030
 to a strudel dough has now threatened nicely 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.580
 and relaxes the oil comes a little bit dappled 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.830
 Voted 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.830
 then I have my whirlpool here 2 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.260
 so you can roll the dough after a nice together 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.460
 nice to me 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.240
 Do not knead in the dough anymore because otherwise it will not be possible to tell 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.670
 so good of roles 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.670
 just press it flat 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.639
 now and then turn around 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.449
 with the Rolls Royce from the middle outwards role 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.259
 from time to time give and turn around 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.030
 get back a bit to the oceans and from the center to the outside 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.579
 and who would like to have the strudel dough 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.529
 he's giving him up now 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 and pull him out over his hands 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 usually one notices shortly before that he starts to make 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.499
 then put it down again 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.619
 the reviews corners you can 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.459
 to 7 if one 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.249
 so the strudel dough is scanty now you can fill it I've got here for 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.249
 Example apples 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.349
 Leave the top edge to the sides 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.519
 so you can do it 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.700
 for catching juice have something bigger for the taste cool 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.499
 with it are and sugar 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.909
 and some whipped cream I have already pitched fresh so that the vortex 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.909
 gets a little more juicy 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.269
 so that goes well 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.579
 even more taste gets in Zurich 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.579
 in top and on the edge with buster 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.439
 Now I cut off the thick countries 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.439
 because they do not taste so good 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.869
 only the top keep it to my turn 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.869
 below something is beaten 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.759
 and rolled up with the help of Touch Lanza 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.469
 then the upper part 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.669
 take over it 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.849
 squeeze at the edge 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.120
 so that the apples do not come out wrap 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.949
 and with the help of touch 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.949
 Can I then put the strudel on a baking sheet? 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.020
 still nice as u-shape 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.189
 with butter and cancer 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.819
 and to make it nice and crispy, sprinkle with a little more cinnamon and sugar 1 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.499
 and then call the call golden brown
