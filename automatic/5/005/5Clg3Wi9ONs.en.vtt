booster

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
booster

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
booster
I<00:00:26.820> guess<00:00:27.710> Oracle<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:28.890> tank<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:30.740> NOPA

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
I guess Oracle think tank and NOPA

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.030 
I guess Oracle think tank and NOPA
grapplers<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.510> also<00:00:33.510> extra<00:00:34.350> booster<00:00:34.680> planets

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
grapplers are also extra booster planets

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.970 
grapplers are also extra booster planets
or<00:00:35.160> something<00:00:35.430> oh<00:00:35.489> they<00:00:36.030> both<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.899> two<00:00:37.170> extra

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
or something oh they both have two extra

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.580 
or something oh they both have two extra
boosters<00:00:38.309> now<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:38.760> um<00:00:38.969> let's<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.719> hop<00:00:40.290> right

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
boosters now but um let's just hop right

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.840 
boosters now but um let's just hop right
into<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:42.230> unboxing<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.530> we've<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.160> six<00:00:44.610> boxes

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
into the unboxing so we've got six boxes

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.819 
into the unboxing so we've got six boxes
and<00:00:45.860> I'll<00:00:46.860> probably<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.489> two<00:00:47.809> or<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.200> but

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and I'll probably do like two or so but

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.970 
and I'll probably do like two or so but
if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.219> want<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:51.410> also<00:00:52.410> I'll<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
if you want to see also I'll see how the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
if you want to see also I'll see how the
time<00:00:53.219> goes<00:00:56.210> maybe<00:00:57.210> I'll<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.570> keep<00:00:57.719> opening

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
time goes maybe I'll just keep opening

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
time goes maybe I'll just keep opening
until<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.469> SP<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.489> don't<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.820> SP

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
until I get SP and if I don't get SP

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.490 
until I get SP and if I don't get SP
well<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:03.229> guess<00:01:05.270> all<00:01:06.270> six<00:01:06.810> boxes<00:01:07.140> will<00:01:07.470> be

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
well then I guess all six boxes will be

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.980 
well then I guess all six boxes will be
open<00:01:09.470> my<00:01:10.470> friend<00:01:10.680> opened<00:01:10.939> eight<00:01:11.939> boxes<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.810> he

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
open my friend opened eight boxes and he

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:25.899 
open my friend opened eight boxes and he
didn't<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.350> an<00:01:13.439> SP<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> yeah<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.570> get

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
didn't get an SP so so yeah so we get

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.030 
didn't get an SP so so yeah so we get
muscle<00:01:26.909> Hercules<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> muscle<00:01:28.409> Hercules<00:01:28.829> I

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
encounter last three and something I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.630 
encounter last three and something I
think<00:02:25.530> he<00:02:25.590> stands<00:02:25.830> up<00:02:25.980> or<00:02:26.130> something<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.490> don't

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
think he stands up or something I don't

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.880 
think he stands up or something I don't
know

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
know

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.750 
know
and<00:02:28.910> then<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.860> yeah<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.890> don't<00:02:32.070> roll<00:02:32.430> over

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.480 

when<00:02:35.760> something<00:02:36.090> stands<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:37.490> think

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
when something stands I think I think

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.460 
when something stands I think I think
it's<00:02:38.580> cause<00:02:38.700> he's<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.000> beatdown<00:02:39.870> guy<00:02:40.110> for<00:02:40.350> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
it's cause he's the beatdown guy for the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.220 
it's cause he's the beatdown guy for the
szura<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:41.460> when<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:41.730> an<00:02:41.850> guard<00:02:42.230> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
szura so when you have an guard and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.410 
szura so when you have an guard and
something<00:02:43.530> stands<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.520> server<00:02:45.030> Vanguard

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
something stands as a server Vanguard

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.730 
something stands as a server Vanguard
and<00:02:45.540> something<00:02:45.810> stands<00:02:46.020> he<00:02:46.200> gets<00:02:46.380> he<00:02:46.710> gets

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
and something stands he gets he gets

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.360 
and something stands he gets he gets
past<00:02:47.010> three<00:02:47.190> K<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.550> think<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:49.100> think<00:02:50.100> that's<00:02:50.250> how

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
past three K I think I think that's how

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.340 
past three K I think I think that's how
he<00:02:50.400> works

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
he works

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.590 
he works
