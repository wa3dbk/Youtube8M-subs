00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello to all of you so 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.790
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.309
 new little video with ao so a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.650
 change of dust off 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 so here I am before I was 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.160
 equipped with a panoplie at home 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.060
 so associated with a power a killer 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.789
 dazzling but I found with y had 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.289
 a lack of vitamins that it was seven 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.900
 panels so has 2552 so there the the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.369
 vita is a bit higher but it's 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.829
 that I also wanted called on the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.420
 power so we went to inventory 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.620
 no no i pay for harmless maps 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.230
 rugged major instead of a pusher 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.090
 a pilgrim two shih lol so at the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.539
 place a hood and a hbo chain 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.850
 so already it compares to the capital 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.809
 chemistry and already 108 has more of the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.910
 wisdom 48 power and criticism 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.160
 so it's less peace to a pmp at 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.160
 xviii so she is almost perfect g 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.660
 here 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:15.700
 so that's why I added a good echo 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.120
 Place a cap from the village oak which 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:27.400
 408 is pretty much so it's really a 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:30.940
 big lives so normally squeeze my 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.540
 hand up to 300 there is a new one of 98 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.300
 a vitality 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.610
 it's pretty much after that 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.490
 wisdom when this power so ap to 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.960
 my apn so that's equivalent to iksan blow 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.040
 that it cancels vinci up of tit 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.220
 critical resistances so the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.100
 resistances are bof rant initiative 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.250
 so here are keep objects we see when 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.150
 same as two days lack of vida there 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.370
 had vitality yeah I have some of the 3rd 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.490
 wore a little higher knox always 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.580
 not super great either but so here 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.670
 then here it is in Swiss time j 191 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.830
 and instead of a nani at home I 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.620
 added a ring or tent obss we see 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.760
 the jug 1 222 power with it 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.130
 found in soft but generally I 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.739
 put this talisman so he does that when 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.450
 we brace messei but almost 100 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:34.080
 quote so my parents I reached 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:37.180
 515 of intel for 222 of power and 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.280
 2777 of vita so it's still not 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.950
 badly I then find after a little 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.900
 we can put another thing in relation 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.280
 to men with trophies instead by 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.530
 example it's not my judo up 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.610
 as much as we can put one another 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.370
 +42 power trophy to reach 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.840
 266.2 in the south but hey I think this 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.459
 is being done for the moment not bad so put 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:08.500
 except that even the cloak of jl is 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.140
 awful hall so put support 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.610
 specially 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.030
 not very serious so I Cuban a 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.740
 tribute 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.740
 the resistances are not great apart 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.480
 I have ten fires dissolved but after that it's 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:25.780
 how much can talk by sludge 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:28.330
 so it's okay then so here 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.230
 that's about all I have 33 of 6 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.410
 base points 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.800
 so after if I find it is rather not 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.270
 wrong so we'll test that or the coach has 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.270
 now 25 books 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.190
 here I am going to do the little tour 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.490
 basic I usually do it's 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.490
 ie a trap tournament a death trap 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.160
 concentration and a sure hit when at our 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.740
 dishes as I already power them 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.530
 deadly traps have typed a bit more so 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.040
 that's a trick to my 1000 trap 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.200
 mortal who are fishing at 195 so as I 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.290
 I'm not told but we leave either steve of 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.670
 11.6 so the resistances here they are good 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.989
 they are not great in frank average 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.480
 to be like us the wrongs resistance 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.720
 which kg plus I feel I have more than 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.020
 leaks and tackles that smart alc 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:31.150
 are more important then why are 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:32.910
 booster up and hop on location at 500 long 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.650
 course or tic 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.910
 we will make a small network because 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.910
 I'm not bad network 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:52.729
 a small network of 3.4 trap beyond 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:58.120
 with a small death trap 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.120
 so he saw neither 105 of life concentration 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.410
 he will move on to 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:12.599
 5800 show that it's 2200 

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:13.529
 almost in trap is a trap 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.039
 deadly 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:23.969
 we did not get too bad so 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:26.879
 hop there sneaky little shots up so 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.759
 otherwise it can only play a little 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:31.860
 more on the island the other attacks 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.119
 tight hautmont it's still not that 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.610
 but that's already done more damage 

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:40.649
 so usually the men the 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.689
 networks games games couples with 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:47.369
 mass traps or things like 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:50.339
 it quickly does for example to do 

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:52.050
 simple usually after I do a 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:06:00.269
 little perspective like that for two 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:04.669
 points can so there to worry paper 

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:04.669
 but if holy man 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:14.580
 he's at 2900 so that's almost 1625 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:16.919
 102 laps it's pretty good I 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.899
 so find the flamiches that pass 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:25.909
 always centered 130 voices life does one 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:29.009
 no longer follows boosted with the anchors and 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:31.409
 after that it's true that I do not love you 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.239
 in poison for example I can do some 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:37.619
 poisons a little more powerful but serves 

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:39.449
 excess it remains that remains low wanted to do 

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:41.489
 an instrument 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.499
 r but here it was especially for you 

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:45.929
 introduce my new mode that I can 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:49.099
 couple is also lived with the old 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:51.300
 mode there is no any problem with that 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.819
 here I am boosted for example 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:03.209
 yes it's him to finish with a little 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:07:10.769
 network all quiet hop hop and we're going 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:13.589
 to show if some the 1400 were 

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:14.849
 rejected at the end so that's so 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:16.769
 I hope this video will have pleased you 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.689
 it was just to show you the little 

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.229
 round man q how to evolve my 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:21.209
 character 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:24.649
 so it's true that after I can I can 

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:27.479
 deliver bread damage 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:31.979
 here I was the tab had killed the cloak 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:34.079
 road hop on here shuts my 12.5 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.569
 because suddenly he's going to lead us 

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:42.689
 add a father my calves 20 pm so 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:44.069
 in 12.5 after I can put like that there 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:46.199
 down is not too bad either 

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:48.929
 adds 577 but it is true that it in 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:52.639
 is a fan of power but I found 

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:55.050
 that the not noted was pretty good 

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.000
 so here are the cm1 comments said 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.350
 me if you liked it 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.889
 that's all going to the next 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.889
 it's him
