I<00:00:29.130> used<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.150> 17<00:00:30.750> millimeter<00:00:30.960> socket<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:32.309> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
I used a 17 millimeter socket on this

I used a 17 millimeter socket on this
long<00:00:32.730> handle<00:00:33.120> wrench<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:34.440> turn<00:00:34.620> the

long handle wrench here to turn the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.660 
long handle wrench here to turn the
crankshaft<00:00:35.280> counterclockwise<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.050> know

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670

most<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.790> form<00:00:39.030> they're<00:00:39.180> saying<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
most of the form they're saying that it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
most of the form they're saying that it
goes<00:00:39.809> around<00:00:39.989> several<00:00:40.350> times<00:00:40.500> before<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.040> hit

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
goes around several times before you hit

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
goes around several times before you hit

with<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> lobes<00:00:43.890> off<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.289> valves<00:00:46.289> there

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
with the lobes off of the valves there

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.299 
with the lobes off of the valves there
at<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> top<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.100> turn<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.760> guy<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:49.039> if<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.129> can

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
at the top so turn that guy and if I can

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.860 
at the top so turn that guy and if I can
get<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> focus<00:00:51.980> there<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.280> go

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
get this to focus there we go

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
get this to focus there we go
you<00:00:54.870> might<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.199> able<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.550> CRTC<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> there<00:00:56.850> if

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
you might be able to CRTC it there if

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.240 
you might be able to CRTC it there if
you<00:00:57.390> line<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.870> eyeball<00:00:58.379> straight<00:00:58.800> almost

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you line it up eyeball straight almost

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
you line it up eyeball straight almost
you're<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> video<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.020> kind<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> tell

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you're with the video and kind of tell

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.290 
you're with the video and kind of tell
it's<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.770> dead<00:01:01.949> center<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.910> let's<00:01:03.030> go<00:01:03.149> up

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it's right dead center so let's go up

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.789 
it's right dead center so let's go up
look<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> vowel<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> lobes

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
look at the vowel and there the lobes

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
look at the vowel and there the lobes
sticking<00:01:07.799> straight<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.130> let's<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.270> around<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
sticking straight up let's go around the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
sticking straight up let's go around the
other<00:01:09.630> side<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:13.340> here's<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> should

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
other side and here's what it should

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.330 
other side and here's what it should
look<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.030> our<00:01:15.750> eye<00:01:15.810> I'm<00:01:16.619> assuming<00:01:17.159> that's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
look like our eye I'm assuming that's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.280 
look like our eye I'm assuming that's
for<00:01:17.549> intake<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.159> kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> line<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.909> up

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
for intake and if you kind of line it up

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.330 
for intake and if you kind of line it up
it's<00:01:22.290> about<00:01:22.680> dead<00:01:23.100> even<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.450> our<00:01:25.380> ease<00:01:25.950> down

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it's about dead even and our ease down

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's about dead even and our ease down
there<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:27.390> dead<00:01:27.659> even<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> that's<00:01:29.970> what

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
there about dead even to so that's what

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550 
there about dead even to so that's what
she<00:01:30.270> look<00:01:30.390> okay<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.140> did<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> front

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
she look okay so I just did the front

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
she look okay so I just did the front
and<00:01:31.920> when<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> did<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.090> heard<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> click

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and when I did it I heard a click

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.950 
and when I did it I heard a click
the<00:01:34.170> infamous<00:01:34.970> click<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.090> doom<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.780> call

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the infamous click of doom as they call

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.160 
the infamous click of doom as they call
it<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> did<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.180> basically<00:01:39.720> told

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it so what I did was that basically told

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.210 
it so what I did was that basically told
me<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.560> while<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:42.450> definitely<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
me that while I was definitely on the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.749 
me that while I was definitely on the
top<00:01:44.670> dead<00:01:44.880> center<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.509> was<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.950> exhaust

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.280 

stroke<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> compression<00:01:51.630> stroke<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
stroke and not the compression stroke so

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.100 
stroke and not the compression stroke so
pull<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> valve<00:01:53.070> cover<00:01:53.310> off<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.899> when<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
pull the valve cover off and when that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.130 
pull the valve cover off and when that
happens<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:56.250> cam<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.840> under<00:01:58.110> pressure

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
happens this cam is not under pressure

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.340 
happens this cam is not under pressure
and<00:01:58.790> that<00:01:59.790> well<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> top<00:02:01.200> one

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and that well not as much as the top one

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.899 
and that well not as much as the top one
but<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> top<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.310> definitely<00:02:02.759> under

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
but the top one is definitely under

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.520 
but the top one is definitely under
pressure<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.509> can't<00:02:03.869> move<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.229> really

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
pressure and you can't move it really

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
pressure and you can't move it really
well<00:02:04.680> by<00:02:05.460> hand<00:02:05.850> or<00:02:06.240> even<00:02:06.540> by<00:02:06.659> using<00:02:06.930> some<00:02:07.440> sort
