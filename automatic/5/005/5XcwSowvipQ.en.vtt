00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.010
 I want warm colors 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.559
 So today I'm going to teach and I'm going to explain. 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.230
 the basics of skateboarding 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 but I'll do it in separate episodes 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.359
 I found this episode in itself but I'm going 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.960
 explain today's episode of easy 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:27.119
 almost 2 hot as on record 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.269
 I know it will be 20 today for those who do not 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.160
 know to explain and in the next episode I go 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 explain more about the concept of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.360
 Hot 42 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.040
 this is so then follow the video here we go 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.040
 new is so from groups 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.770
 then guys to get here I will 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.570
 base ball of the golf ball that is only 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.620
 from what I'm seeing is the basis that I 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.379
 use is so the base bush is when you 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.530
 puts your right foot in front and foot 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.710
 left behind that was you love conped 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.280
 conped brings here in which would be the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.710
 left and makes maneuvers with the right 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.270
 vote and shake the base bush and it 's more or 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.270
 less as soon as you walk with her 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.770
 So this is the belly and I 'm going now. 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.770
 explain to you the voice in regular nÃ© 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:31.320
 so come on then now is here only 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 base, the left foot of which is in the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.100
 front and the back pet is the right that who 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.659
 also loves the right foot does not ask him to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.490
 what that difference stated that arrived 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.079
 and I did not reverse the image I'm going to try 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 irregular floor staff I do not know 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.659
 much easier to even rhyme then there are 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.720
 adjusting the foot here since the front 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.270
 It brings the right to turn within 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.540
 so come on 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.470
 then that here the ball is then the hi 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.570
 I just fell and I accidentally cut 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.190
 which eventually fell on the button on account 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.540
 Here it 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.890
 You're seeing this damn stone. 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.760
 so let's put the video and let that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.300
 let's go 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.030
 then're guys I will try again ep 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:27.820
 left on right front 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.640
 so come on now works then this 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.760
 difference more or less for this one 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.550
 Unlike the regular basic course in 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.550
 needle is so with asks with the right foot 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.070
 behind and the front breaks 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.709
 ops the right foot on the left front 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.520
 behind and non-regular is a lighter in the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.550
 front 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.690
 the right back then this difference of 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.880
 regular course 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.920
 Now I'll explain the basis made for 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.160
 Come on then, let's go. 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.709
 although the fake base is when you place 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.120
 your pec brings so much that you will be 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.730
 regular or bad 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.150
 I do not have the front here I do not have to 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.900
 fatigue and the front foot is more or 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.989
 less or screw the name of the skateboard and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.100
 You give the impulse is as follows. 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:22.840
 simple way and will help in the treatment 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.160
 it is in this position that in this case would be the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.030
 the way it will perform a maneuver of 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.430
 It is made 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.430
 I think maybe I can walk 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.750
 irregular at an hour like this one is 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:38.680
 because it's time for speech 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.680
 It's already here. 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.030
 that base of faith that you use to 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.780
 make the newest effect 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.870
 concept pop show of eye funk did like 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.920
 hell fipe is a young man that I can give and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:03.530
 there is some and now I will wait for the 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.350
 mondo skateboarding is called here and then 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.000
 Come on, let's go there to explain in one 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.130
 concept then let's go let's go 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.410
 good guys long way is a way of 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.140
 shot that's you 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.180
 you put it in its normal base only 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.980
 what come you paddle confech brings like 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.410
 majority do weekly with the foot of the 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.859
 forward by making this happen from 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.859
 Cuba 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.690
 I do not know why but I noticed when 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.950
 play well with your head 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.930
 the kits the kits play is in vain at the base 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.250
 mobile do not know how to get it 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:47.410
 but that is what now there closing 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.410
 Let's talk a little about what it was worth 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.940
 then of the season as you can see this 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.750
 hence the most learned video 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.710
 about is the concept of skateboarding that is basic 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.590
 regular fi 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.580
 the way you walk in the next episode 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:13.390
 will stay below the pace I will explain and 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:23.020
 is also name of opting for obstacles 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:26.850
 As for father who is or top is our ramp. 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.410
