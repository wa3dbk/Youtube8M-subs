Napoli<00:00:41.010> last<00:00:41.219> night<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.879> well<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.300> was

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
Napoli last night in there well it was

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.330 
Napoli last night in there well it was
like<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.719> yeah<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.739> no<00:00:43.890> win<00:00:44.100> over

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
like that yeah in there one no win over

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.790 
like that yeah in there one no win over
Rome<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.940> make<00:00:45.090> six<00:00:45.660> days<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.170> well

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
Rome I think you make six days and well

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.930 
Rome I think you make six days and well
obviously<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.280> clean<00:00:47.520> sheet<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
obviously it's clean sheet in that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.330 
obviously it's clean sheet in that
important<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.510> no<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.809> over<00:00:48.930> Roma<00:00:49.440> which

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
important one no one over Roma which

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.610 
important one no one over Roma which
keeps<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:51.059> quite<00:00:51.360> close<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:51.870> Napoli<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
keeps them quite close I think Napoli a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.080 
keeps them quite close I think Napoli a
third<00:00:52.920> free<00:00:53.190> points<00:00:53.460> behind<00:00:53.579> remember<00:00:53.969> at<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
third free points behind remember at the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.520 
third free points behind remember at the
moment<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.510> stopped<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> gap<00:00:55.230> from<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
moment so that stopped the gap from it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
moment so that stopped the gap from it
massively<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> could<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.600> them<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.930> with

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
massively so I could see them going with

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510 
massively so I could see them going with
him<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.289> there's<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:58.649> many<00:00:58.949> there<00:00:59.399> was

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
him because there's not many there was

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.270 
him because there's not many there was
leno<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.629> he<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.770> Ospina

the inner went from awesome said it just

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.020 
the inner went from awesome said it just
was<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> bit<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> bigger<00:01:47.189> name<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.700> rather

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
was a bit of a bigger name that rather

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.819 
was a bit of a bigger name that rather
than<00:01:48.180> having<00:01:48.420> freed<00:01:48.840> low-rated<00:01:49.259> set<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> box

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
than having freed low-rated set the box

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.410 
than having freed low-rated set the box
and<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.100> feel<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> EA<00:01:50.579> could<00:01:50.850> give<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.149> Mar

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and I feel the EA could give it to Mar

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
and I feel the EA could give it to Mar
so<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:52.439> nice<00:01:52.710> card<00:01:53.040> as

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so that would be a very nice card as

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.219 
so that would be a very nice card as
well<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:54.060> corner<00:01:54.360> free<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.840> when<00:01:55.049> she

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
well but one corner free know when she

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.569 
well but one corner free know when she
got<00:01:55.320> clean<00:01:55.560> she<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.770> holding<00:01:55.920> its<00:01:56.130> Levin<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590

week EA will throw Rooney hours just

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.790 
week EA will throw Rooney hours just
because<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.630> was<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.020> packed<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.590> think

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
because it was so packed and I think

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.520 
because it was so packed and I think
that's<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.070> wild<00:02:39.430> card<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.850> I've<00:02:39.970> gone<00:02:40.210> with

Florentina left mid spot it is like a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.550 
Florentina left mid spot it is like a
free<00:02:51.640> for<00:02:51.880> two<00:02:52.150> you've<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.930> place<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.380> would<00:02:53.470> be

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
free for two you've a place it would be

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.890 
free for two you've a place it would be

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
quite a good defensive left mid be a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.900 
quite a good defensive left mid be a
wall<00:02:56.140> around<00:02:56.230> accorded<00:02:56.860> with<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.370> starts<00:02:57.700> and

wall around accorded with the starts and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.960 
wall around accorded with the starts and
I<00:02:57.970> think<00:02:58.180> he<00:02:58.420> could<00:02:58.630> sneak<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.340> like<00:03:00.340> he's<00:03:00.700> also
