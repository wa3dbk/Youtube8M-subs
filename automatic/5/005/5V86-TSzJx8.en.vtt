00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello dear spectator my name is khan 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.400
 gustafsson and I are a bit 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.269
 Excited I wanted to be my first 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.550
 broadcasting of chatter flashing story 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.560
 I will take up for this reason 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.169
 equal to a random user 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.059
 play jazz 24 and give me someone 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.279
 in the place where we hopefully one 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:28.079
 find the format mostly understood 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 I am playing a lightning game 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.430
 and talk about my profound ones 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 thoughts during this partie 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.660
 mostly in my thoughts i hope 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.100
 create something quickly or I hope 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.999
 he plays slowly and I am also time 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.320
 and I think it's already happening 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:48.030
 springer f3 I'm against zwickau 78 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.809
 1800 should I want to be favorite we want 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 in any case open 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.879
 dvfg four springer 6c fourth main thing 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.909
 I play it classic and solid like 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.399
 usual e6 springer c3 and c6 r half 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.879
 I have used for many years 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.159
 he plays e3 i jump b7 the seaans 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.900
 Variant all world plays with two 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.200
 now the six runners the three a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.760
 or b 3 b 3 is a bit boring 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.240
 position 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.650
 let's see when the b 205 is played 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.260
 maybe I'll do the three ways 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.270
 believe here too sv 4 2 is the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.070
 I do point'm from from cocos 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.430
 happens he hits me he hits 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.080
 suggests I was weak drives b22 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.640
 some options i can on c4 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.610
 beat what i will do 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 the four is also in question but the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.420
 They actually look quite normal 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.790
 now of course is to find out 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.620
 where he wants to enlighten he briefly 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.800
 shaved you could be running bad 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.270
 h2 and springer ag 4chan think of themselves as 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.580
 of course, do not make famous player 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.750
 but become an aggressive player 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.150
 think about it a lot 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.760
 I 'm the same g4 speaker and head what 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.010
 H3 happens then I have to do it myself 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.170
 something new 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.750
 I'm not sure if this is fun 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.960
 Things like springer h20g make five 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.960
 can 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.110
 I try to play ladies after h4 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.490
 probably makes something felt 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.810
 everything is a bit shaky what I am 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.030
 Here I make hope that one 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 springer beats from after 28 would be 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.780
 that's the depth of my thoughts 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.320
 springer je 4 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.950
 I will follow r5 this springer 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.840
 tie up 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.970
 but he can not beat here yet 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.040
 when a runner beats at 45, namely 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.770
 again with sprenger and now I have 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.040
 all at once his springer tied up 56 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.990
 failed then it beats 64 should 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.420
 but he also plays well then 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:46.200
 I probably write on c4 lady 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.580
 at the time 37 probably beat the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200
 worse time still no 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.520
 thought about how to give one second 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.739
 I can see how it works 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.270
 play bowling every time 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.770
 I used to be a dreaded one 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.170
 the players today is enough 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.090
 basic speed must be lost for that 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.000
 which figure is more right for me 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.450
 optimistic in this situation 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.920
 I can not leave a minute 50 left 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.540
 so much go wrong of the game 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.280
 usual solid go out of the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.190
 Bondage returns here have seven poses 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.950
 the runner after the 5 and so he runs 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.269
 is already a good starting point for a 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.250
 be partie and around the 2 he says so 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.950
 beautiful it is a question of technique I 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.250
 I never fully understood what that meant 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.540
 should 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.310
 I think it just means that one 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.790
 tries to make normal moves though 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.160
 you know that you can win on stands is 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.860
 significantly more material and I will 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.049
 try to cheat my lady after f3 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.170
 what would force him his tower for 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.620
 to give the runner so i think mine 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.730
 chances are pretty good here and there 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.760
 abandoned 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.540
 an important victory against the zwicker 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.739
 of course that has brought me to 2 567 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.650
 Leaderboard always in view of my 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.209
 main goal is alias in front of tile man 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.760
 franziska to stay 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.440
 I did that and I thank you 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.540
 make me for the attention we 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.209
 many thanks for watching 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.110
 and listening partie was not that difficult 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.110
 back a nice one
