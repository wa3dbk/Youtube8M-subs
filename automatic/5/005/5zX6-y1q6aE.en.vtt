00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.540
 new box in the course I got the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.160
 lust complete series bought in blu ray 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.590
 dvd has is in single boxes i will 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.769
 also prepare because i lost in big 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.519
 I'm a fan and therefore not mine 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.590
 to give away treasures there are still 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.359
 another box that is my dice 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.640
 it looks similar but I can 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.050
 also work the right book because that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.059
 here I can do it in advance 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 betrayed focus everything look exactly 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.070
 we're just being a shooter with 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.290
 the whole fat fat blu-ray cases 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.590
 Of course, that's not what I'm into 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.230
 optimal but think that there was gentleman 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 salamander for 50 60 euro believing what 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.850
 I believe that 65 euros and rotatable that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.170
 You can not buy that anymore 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 certainly do not do anything wrong 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.550
 the big thing with blu-ray costs 120 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.350
 on ebay that's really about it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 spend but you can do that too 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.729
 spend a lot more so do it now 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.320
 but the whole thing makes you do that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.650
 show what you see so already one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 it's about how things are here 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.700
 and a little bit here and there and 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.470
 made there and gone and thrown away like that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.409
 So that's why it's here 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.420
 glossy everything made the fsk 18 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.990
 bottles ugly wise imprinted 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.090
 was the point here 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.630
 the stone board we already know that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.530
 from other photographs and here 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.090
 this fashion that you also know lost 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.750
 Engraved on the back is just 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 cards similar to that I believe and hint 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.340
 what a little year from the island 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.799
 the radiation and so on 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.730
 complete season is on it year 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.940
 stands on it 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.170
 of course , the studios and on the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.390
 back we look with pleasure again with the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.560
 all the residents can behind the fans 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 of course not recognize now 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.260
 raises normal text which is all like 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.170
 involves and and and and yes 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.880
 also a complete run on it no only 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.810
 a few hints again is in cuba 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.470
 is and so on 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.850
 But more is not there so cool now 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.810
 I just like here 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.940
 for now simply good is the last 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.260
 Staffel times look what us here with 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.800
 So deliver here it is in black 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.740
 held 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.900
 the fat thick ugly emery box and 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.070
 from the back all the extra 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.420
 and fit everything on it is and 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.170
 exclusive bonus what only for the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.180
 Blu-ray thing is there so there is 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.130
 just they are play that saves that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.450
 automatically where you forget that needs 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.160
 you do not remember because if you 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.650
 Watch series watched as defended 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.030
 I always have that big problem 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.770
 I do not know where I am the rest 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.630
 what this play is not the case 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.320
 this is a very nice facility 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.390
 I think I'm on the whole time and 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.570
 we see what I am doing here 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.190
 just had a few photos 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.209
 on it as the tour is now really good 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.840
 of them can be quite 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.660
 take out 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.080
 This is how the mouse looks in the extras 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.570
 are good at the south but more 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.040
 then maybe not, we at 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.400
 the first time happiness the first one became yes 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.739
 Let's get that out there maybe 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.060
 sometimes a booklet is missing 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.540
 the venice as the main actor on it 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.750
 and here 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.000
 who says break of course shit 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.820
 but I think I will anyway 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.709
 elections made back on Amazon is 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.489
 not great where they cost you something 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.020
 and is holding here so so is coming 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.730
 that here often in the garbage season but already 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.569
 it is broken here 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.709
 here again seven to ten on it and 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.629
 the whole main actor 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.549
 yes I can also as a packet 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.440
 look into 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.620
 here is nothing more in it just 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.540
 very short of their slipcase so it is 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.799
 not very stable so a whole 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.720
 normal school and here is always the 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.560
 all technical specifications of the border 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:16.380
 Forgot to tell you runtime 1071 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:20.220
 minutes only the first season 1239 the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.520
 293 the third fourth 600 the fifth 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.039
 733 sixth grade 7 95 and the seventh 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.600
 ask where is the seventh echelon of 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.800
 seat can say so that was going on 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.270
 I have here 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.039
 I can tell you all the stuff 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.800
 I show each one of them 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.669
 because that will be the same in the end 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.410
 is in there 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.910
 I hope you liked that 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.580
 unboxing you can my comments 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.130
 write it down as you find us lost 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.200
 so many lost fans are what 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.880
 Staffel me especially well when is at 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.320
 I've clicked you so slightly 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.220
 have to admit to me honestly so after 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.110
 the third season 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.880
 I was really hooked but so off 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.430
 the fourth of the level a bit 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.270
 down to the fifth to sixth 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.039
 relay 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:09.250
 there are no mistakes whatsoever 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:12.370
 embarrassing but 365 has such a bit 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.229
 subsided and found the series exit 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.539
 I do not like that either 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.889
 yes, I look forward to your comments 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.889
 Until next time
