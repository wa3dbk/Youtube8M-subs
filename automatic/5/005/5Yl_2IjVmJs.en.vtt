on eBay please excuse the amateur nature

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.060 
on eBay please excuse the amateur nature
of<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> video<00:00:09.480> I'm<00:00:09.900> not<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.290> professional<00:00:10.830> but

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
of the video I'm not a professional but

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.160 
of the video I'm not a professional but
I<00:00:11.969> thought<00:00:12.179> it'd<00:00:12.269> be<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.389> good<00:00:12.540> idea<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:13.019> produce

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
I thought it'd be a good idea to produce

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.400 
I thought it'd be a good idea to produce
a<00:00:13.469> video<00:00:13.700> as<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.059> watch<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.570> really<00:00:15.960> beautiful

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
a video as the watch is really beautiful

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.050 
a video as the watch is really beautiful
and<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.890> believe<00:00:17.690> the<00:00:18.690> commentary<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
and I believe the commentary and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.880 
and I believe the commentary and
pictures<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.180> eBay<00:00:21.480> won't<00:00:21.869> really<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> just

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
pictures on eBay won't really do it just

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.240 
pictures on eBay won't really do it just
this<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.779> purchased<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.769> watch<00:00:25.949> in

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this so I purchased the watch in

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.089 
this so I purchased the watch in
September<00:00:26.849> 2012<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.779> I've<00:00:28.560> worn<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.830> very

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
September 2012 and I've worn it very

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.609 
September 2012 and I've worn it very
sparingly<00:00:29.720> just<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> number<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> special

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.709 
sparingly just on a number of special
occasions<00:00:32.130> I've<00:00:33.000> even<00:00:33.329> had<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.570> watch

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
occasions I've even had to watch

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.840 
occasions I've even had to watch
serviced<00:00:34.230> after<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.920> year<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.399> recommended

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
serviced after one year as recommended

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.440 
serviced after one year as recommended
by<00:00:36.059> young<00:00:36.960> hands<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.879> I<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> receipt

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
by young hands and I have the receipt

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.410 
by young hands and I have the receipt
for<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.230> would<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
for that if you would like to see it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
for that if you would like to see it
since<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.719> service<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.290> year<00:00:43.530> ago<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> don't

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
since that service a year ago I don't

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.650 
since that service a year ago I don't
think<00:00:44.670> I've<00:00:44.879> even<00:00:45.000> worn<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.570> watch<00:00:45.719> once<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
think I've even worn the watch once and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.470 
think I've even worn the watch once and
so<00:00:49.460> let's<00:00:51.079> have<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> closer<00:00:52.620> look<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.329> watch

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
so let's have a closer look at the watch

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.950 
so let's have a closer look at the watch
and<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.850> using<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.210> phone<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and so I'm just using my phone for this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.740 
and so I'm just using my phone for this
this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> box<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.940> watch<00:01:00.120> comes<00:01:00.510> in

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this is the box that the watch comes in

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.410 
this is the box that the watch comes in
so<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.739> housed<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> nice<00:01:03.320> velvet<00:01:05.420> material

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
so it's housed in a nice velvet material

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.190 
so it's housed in a nice velvet material
so<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> bat<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.990> focus<00:01:09.990> on

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
so I'm just going on a bat and focus on

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.950 
so I'm just going on a bat and focus on
on<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:14.250> hopefully<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.330> illustrates

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
on this so hopefully this illustrates

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.010 
on this so hopefully this illustrates
that<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:17.009> watch<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.720> perfect<00:01:18.720> working

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that the watch is in perfect working

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.969 
that the watch is in perfect working
order<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.299> an<00:01:21.630> automatic<00:01:22.049> watch<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
order it is an automatic watch with a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
order it is an automatic watch with a
mechanical<00:01:23.520> movement<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.930> means<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
mechanical movement so that means you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.130 
mechanical movement so that means you
can<00:01:25.439> either<00:01:25.560> wind<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.610> give<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> shake<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
can either wind it or give it a shake it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.039 
can either wind it or give it a shake it
responds<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.680> movement<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> wear

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
responds to movement and so if you wear

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.429 
responds to movement and so if you wear
it<00:01:31.079> everyday<00:01:32.630> you'll<00:01:33.630> never<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.170> even

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it everyday you'll never have to even

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.359 
it everyday you'll never have to even
wind<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:36.810> try<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.049> alter<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.130> light

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
wind it just try and alter the light

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.170 
wind it just try and alter the light

test here yeah so you can see there that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.949

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
the green luminous strips are working

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.330 
the green luminous strips are working
one<00:02:54.959> thing<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.230> would<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> mention<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
one thing I would like to mention is the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.580 
one thing I would like to mention is the
strap<00:02:57.050> it's<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:59.850> a<00:03:00.150> calfskin<00:03:00.870> leather<00:03:01.170> strap

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
strap it's it's a calfskin leather strap

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.660 
strap it's it's a calfskin leather strap
so<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.370> really<00:03:02.519> simple<00:03:02.850> really<00:03:03.750> beautiful

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
so it's really simple really beautiful

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.930 
so it's really simple really beautiful
and<00:03:06.560> there<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.950> sign<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.489> wear<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.700> tear

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
and there is a sign of wear and tear

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.660 
and there is a sign of wear and tear
here<00:03:09.330> nothing<00:03:10.170> serious<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.280> wear<00:03:11.640> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
here nothing serious and if you wear it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.110 
here nothing serious and if you wear it
no<00:03:12.540> one<00:03:12.690> will<00:03:12.840> even<00:03:12.959> even<00:03:13.739> see<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.910> is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
no one will even even see but it is

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.300 
no one will even even see but it is
worth<00:03:15.510> mentioning<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.170> would<00:03:16.680> say<00:03:17.040> probably

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
worth mentioning I would say probably

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.470 
worth mentioning I would say probably
the<00:03:17.519> only<00:03:18.560> defect<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.799> sorts<00:03:20.340> with<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.090> watch

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
the only defect of sorts with the watch

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.120 
the only defect of sorts with the watch
so<00:03:22.230> turning<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.709> over<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:25.650> quite<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:25.860> shiny

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
so turning it over it's quite a shiny

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.190 
so turning it over it's quite a shiny
surface<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.180> can<00:03:27.600> see<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:30.510> max<00:03:30.959> bill

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
surface but you can see the max bill

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
surface but you can see the max bill
signature<00:03:33.500> I'll<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:34.650> try<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.040> good

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
signature I'll just try and get a good

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.940 
signature I'll just try and get a good
shot<00:03:36.019> so<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.049> think<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.590> about<00:03:37.890> see
