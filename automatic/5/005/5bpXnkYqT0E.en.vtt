hey guys black ops cheats today I'm
showing<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.339> RC<00:00:05.910> car<00:00:06.089> glitch<00:00:06.330> where<00:00:07.049> you

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
showing you a RC car glitch where you

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.900 
showing you a RC car glitch where you
can<00:00:07.440> fly<00:00:07.919> your<00:00:08.160> RC<00:00:08.429> car<00:00:08.990> around<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> map<00:00:10.910> it's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
can fly your RC car around the map it's

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.480 
can fly your RC car around the map it's
not<00:00:12.030> too<00:00:12.269> consistent<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:13.650> actually<00:00:14.460> doing

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
not too consistent about actually doing

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.880 
not too consistent about actually doing
the<00:00:14.790> exact<00:00:15.030> same<00:00:15.059> thing<00:00:15.450> every<00:00:15.660> time<00:00:15.740> you<00:00:16.740> get

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the exact same thing every time you get

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.519 
the exact same thing every time you get
different<00:00:17.130> views<00:00:18.050> actually<00:00:19.050> had<00:00:19.140> two<00:00:19.289> times

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
different views actually had two times

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.200 
different views actually had two times
where<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> call<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.730> side<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> map

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
where I call it it on one side the map

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.390 
where I call it it on one side the map
and<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.410> teleports<00:00:22.920> me<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> other

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and it like teleports me to the other

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.910 
and it like teleports me to the other
side<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.330> consistent<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.619> ever<00:00:25.710> go

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
side but it is consistent if I ever go

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.540 
side but it is consistent if I ever go
back<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.210> theater<00:00:27.210> mode<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.779> am<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.429> air

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
back to theater mode I am in the air

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.269 
back to theater mode I am in the air
tall<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.269> other<00:00:30.390> players<00:00:30.830> so<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> can

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
tall to other players so you can

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
tall to other players so you can
basically<00:00:32.399> factor<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.329> any<00:00:33.690> chance

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
basically factor out any chance

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.510 
basically factor out any chance
whatsoever<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.680> getting<00:00:35.340> shot<00:00:36.320> unless<00:00:37.520> people

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
whatsoever of getting shot unless people

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.569 
whatsoever of getting shot unless people
are<00:00:38.809> stargazing<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:41.010> middle<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> day

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
are stargazing in the middle of the day

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.869 
are stargazing in the middle of the day
but<00:00:42.540> um<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> yeah<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:47.460> she's<00:00:47.670> getting

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
but um so yeah the good she's getting

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.220 
but um so yeah the good she's getting
ready<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> come<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.969> killed<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.840> hand

didn't catch it I just flew out from
under<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> map

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.140 

you're<00:02:43.030> our<00:02:43.120> show

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.720 

they're<00:02:47.720> um<00:02:48.200> here<00:02:48.890> let<00:02:49.220> me<00:02:49.250> try<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.519> one

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.750 

they're<00:02:55.330> okay<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.830> flew<00:02:57.010> out<00:02:57.099> from<00:02:57.400> under

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
they're okay it just flew out from under

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.550 
they're okay it just flew out from under
the<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.269> always<00:02:58.510> flies<00:02:58.659> out<00:02:58.930> from<00:02:59.110> like<00:02:59.290> under

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
the it always flies out from like under

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.530 
the it always flies out from like under
the<00:02:59.680> box<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:02.549> guess<00:03:03.549> because<00:03:03.819> it's<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.239> like<00:03:04.510> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
the box I guess because it's just like a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.940 
the box I guess because it's just like a
weak<00:03:04.810> point<00:03:05.080> in<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.349> map<00:03:05.500> or<00:03:05.709> something<00:03:06.420> but<00:03:07.420> I

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
weak point in the map or something but I

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.390 
weak point in the map or something but I
fly<00:03:08.950> up<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:11.410> just<00:03:11.590> kind<00:03:11.799> of<00:03:11.830> lets<00:03:12.040> me<00:03:12.190> drive

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
fly up and it just kind of lets me drive

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.089 
fly up and it just kind of lets me drive
around<00:03:15.569> but<00:03:16.569> uh<00:03:16.599> yeah<00:03:17.440> from<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.769> way<00:03:17.980> I'm

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
around but uh yeah from the way I'm

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.890 
around but uh yeah from the way I'm
looking<00:03:18.280> at<00:03:18.519> just<00:03:18.700> looking<00:03:19.060> straight<00:03:19.269> down<00:03:19.360> so

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
looking at just looking straight down so

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.789 
looking at just looking straight down so
I<00:03:19.930> can<00:03:20.049> actually<00:03:20.470> find<00:03:20.709> people<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:23.470> almost

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
I can actually find people it's almost

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.250 
I can actually find people it's almost
like<00:03:23.980> they<00:03:24.129> purposely<00:03:24.610> put<00:03:24.849> in<00:03:25.030> here<00:03:25.209> but<00:03:25.629> yeah

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
like they purposely put in here but yeah

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.199 
like they purposely put in here but yeah
let<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.560> go<00:03:26.680> actually<00:03:26.890> outside<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.579> map<00:03:27.910> as

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
let you go actually outside the map as

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.119 
let you go actually outside the map as
you<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.540> see<00:03:28.690> i'm<00:03:28.810> not<00:03:28.959> even<00:03:29.110> close<00:03:29.379> I'm<00:03:29.799> above

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
you can see i'm not even close I'm above

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.210 
you can see i'm not even close I'm above
the<00:03:30.160> map<00:03:30.430> obviously<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.920> might<00:03:32.920> just<00:03:33.069> fly

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
the map obviously I might just fly

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.479 
the map obviously I might just fly
around<00:03:33.340> for<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.819> little<00:03:33.940> bit<00:03:34.060> longer<00:03:35.489> it's

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
around for a little bit longer it's

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:43.380 
around for a little bit longer it's
always<00:03:36.670> been<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:37.000> demolition<00:03:38.670> but<00:03:39.670> uh<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:43.239> it's

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390
