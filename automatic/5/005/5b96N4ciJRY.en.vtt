00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
undertone to it

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.030

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
but it looks great considering that it

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.880 
but it looks great considering that it
has<00:05:11.160> a<00:05:11.190> pink<00:05:11.520> undertone<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.530> this<00:05:13.530> is<00:05:13.710> when
