season<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.649> have<00:00:08.340> my<00:00:08.460> chance<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.790> mess<00:00:09.090> around

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
season to have my chance to mess around

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.700 
season to have my chance to mess around
with<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> lot<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.690> different<00:00:09.809> characters<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.650> I

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
with a lot of different characters and I

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.589 
with a lot of different characters and I
probably<00:00:10.920> put<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> most<00:00:11.519> time<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.150> teach<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
probably put the most time in to teach a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.749 
probably put the most time in to teach a
combo<00:00:12.990> specifically<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.250> think<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.549> got<00:00:14.730> a

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
combo specifically but I think I got a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.910 
combo specifically but I think I got a
pretty<00:00:14.849> good<00:00:15.240> grasp<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.929> how<00:00:15.990> everyone<00:00:16.650> plays

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
pretty good grasp of how everyone plays

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
pretty good grasp of how everyone plays
in<00:00:17.160> season<00:00:17.550> two<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.420> kind<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.690> wanted<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
in season two and I kind of wanted to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.570 
in season two and I kind of wanted to
talk<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.650> because<00:00:19.740> season<00:00:20.130> two<00:00:20.250> isn't

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
talk about it because season two isn't

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.130 
talk about it because season two isn't
just<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> balance<00:00:21.359> adjustments<00:00:22.020> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
just about the balance adjustments that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.259 
just about the balance adjustments that
were<00:00:22.260> made<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:23.100> every<00:00:23.460> character<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.180> how

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
were made for every character and how

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
were made for every character and how
they<00:00:24.449> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> change<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> ways<00:00:25.680> things<00:00:25.920> are

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
they kind of change the ways things are

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.320 
they kind of change the ways things are
breaking<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.670> stuff<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.000> there's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330

playing with it and you feel how the
game<00:00:38.940> feels<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> wanted<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
game feels that's what I wanted to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
game feels that's what I wanted to
discuss<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.550> how<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.879> overall<00:00:42.450> killer

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750

instinct<00:00:43.079> game<00:00:43.230> feels<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.829> comparison<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
instinct game feels in comparison and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.889 
instinct game feels in comparison and
what<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> look<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.510> now

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
what do you have to look out for now

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.740 
what do you have to look out for now
because<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.770> quite<00:00:47.160> literally<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> different

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
because it's quite literally a different

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.410 
because it's quite literally a different
game<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.340> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> assuming<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> based

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
game I I was kind of assuming this based

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
game I I was kind of assuming this based
off<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:51.870> they<00:00:52.020> were<00:00:52.079> explaining<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
off what they were explaining with the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.830 
off what they were explaining with the
air<00:00:53.430> breaker<00:00:53.730> system<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> air<00:00:54.510> counter

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
air breaker system and air counter

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.330 
air breaker system and air counter
breakers<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> everything<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.860> does

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
breakers and everything and it does

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.459 
breakers and everything and it does
change<00:00:56.760> quite<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.140> kind<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
change quite a bit it is kind of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.410 
change quite a bit it is kind of
striking<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> see<00:00:59.579> special<00:01:00.000> moves<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.390> are

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
striking to see special moves that are

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.060 
striking to see special moves that are
thrown<00:01:00.750> out<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.260> realize<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.859> wow<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
thrown out and to realize that wow you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770 
thrown out and to realize that wow you
can<00:01:02.399> actually<00:01:02.430> count<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.059> break<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.390> uppercut

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
can actually count a break an uppercut

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.899 
can actually count a break an uppercut
now<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.710> actually<00:01:05.070> count<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.489> break<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
now you can actually count a break and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.670 
now you can actually count a break and
catch<00:01:06.360> somebody<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.080> could<00:01:07.229> break<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
catch somebody or you could break that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 
catch somebody or you could break that
uppercut<00:01:07.979> literally<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.090> Jago<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.840> throw

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
uppercut literally if Jago was to throw

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.200 
uppercut literally if Jago was to throw
you<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.770> um<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.490> Ford<00:01:11.790> roundhouse

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you and do um you know Ford roundhouse

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.179 
you and do um you know Ford roundhouse
uppercut<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.350> don't<00:01:13.740> even<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> break

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
uppercut you don't even have to break

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.289 
uppercut you don't even have to break
the<00:01:14.310> foreground<00:01:14.670> house<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.150> actually

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the foreground house you can actually

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
the foreground house you can actually
break<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> uppercut<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.259> Jago<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.920> even

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
break the uppercut and Jago can even

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
break the uppercut and Jago can even
counter<00:01:17.490> break<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.479> top<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
counter break you at the top of the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.649 
counter break you at the top of the
uppercut<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.950> looks<00:01:20.189> kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> insane<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.330> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
uppercut it looks kind of insane and I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.910 
uppercut it looks kind of insane and I
think<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> biggest<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
think that's the biggest one of the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.289 
think that's the biggest one of the
bigger<00:01:23.100> gripes<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
bigger gripes I have with it is that a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.789 
bigger gripes I have with it is that a
lot<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> fluidity<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.350> some<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
lot of the fluidity of some of the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
lot of the fluidity of some of the

like Glacia sand you still see a lot of
Glacia<00:01:46.619> saz<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.189> stuff<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.549> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
Glacia saz going for stuff like that I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.670 
Glacia saz going for stuff like that I
think<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.509> stuff<00:01:48.720> visually<00:01:49.200> looks<00:01:49.409> good

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
think that stuff visually looks good

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.200 
think that stuff visually looks good
when<00:01:49.890> glazed<00:01:50.159> he<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.369> gonna<00:01:50.549> teleports<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
when glazed he is gonna teleports at the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.399 
when glazed he is gonna teleports at the
bottom<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> screen<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> opposite

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
bottom of the screen to the opposite

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
bottom of the screen to the opposite
side<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.340> comes<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.360> looks

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
side and then comes up that that looks

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.380 
side and then comes up that that looks
cool<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.200> when<00:01:55.409> he<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.610> he<00:01:56.729> misses<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
cool it's when he is when he misses and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
cool it's when he is when he misses and
he<00:01:57.450> goes<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.750> lunging<00:01:58.320> forward<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.979> stuff

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
he goes like lunging forward and stuff

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.130 
he goes like lunging forward and stuff
like<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.670> think<00:01:59.969> sometimes<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.869> stuff

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
like that I think sometimes that stuff

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.780 
like that I think sometimes that stuff
comes<00:02:01.320> across<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.829> little<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.640> odd

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
comes across as little as a little odd

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.510 
comes across as little as a little odd
but<00:02:03.060> either<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.829> counter<00:02:05.100> breaker<00:02:05.340> stuff

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
but either way the counter breaker stuff

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
but either way the counter breaker stuff
I<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.060> functionality<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.079> i<00:02:07.170> think

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
I like the functionality of it i think

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.900 
I like the functionality of it i think
the<00:02:07.469> looks<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.950> gonna<00:02:08.039> need<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.340> waking<00:02:08.640> over

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the looks are gonna need to waking over

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.150 
the looks are gonna need to waking over
time<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.599> big<00:02:09.869> thing<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.259> has<00:02:10.560> changed<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
time the big thing that has changed that

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.800 
time the big thing that has changed that
a<00:02:11.190> lot<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.489> people<00:02:11.640> seem<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.239> talking<00:02:12.420> about

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
a lot of people seem to be talking about

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.320 
a lot of people seem to be talking about
is<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
is the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.140 
is the
speed<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.080> game<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.850> what's<00:02:15.850> funny<00:02:16.060> is

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
speed of the game and what's funny is

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.760 
speed of the game and what's funny is
that<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.510> don't<00:02:16.630> feel<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.110> killer<00:02:17.350> instinct

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
that I don't feel that killer instinct

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.400 
that I don't feel that killer instinct
got<00:02:18.040> any<00:02:18.280> slower<00:02:18.730> specifically<00:02:19.570> it's<00:02:19.810> just

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
got any slower specifically it's just

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.470 
got any slower specifically it's just
that<00:02:20.560> some<00:02:20.950> things<00:02:21.310> feel<00:02:21.610> more<00:02:22.000> stiff<00:02:22.450> than

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
that some things feel more stiff than

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.830 
that some things feel more stiff than
they<00:02:22.810> did<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.020> season<00:02:23.560> 1<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.510> what<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.540> mean<00:02:25.630> by

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
they did in season 1 and what I mean by

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.150 
they did in season 1 and what I mean by
this<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.350> i<00:02:26.470> don't<00:02:26.650> think<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.890> moves

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
this is that i don't think the moves

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.040 
this is that i don't think the moves
change<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.970> move<00:02:28.150> specifically<00:02:28.750> did<00:02:28.900> not

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
change the move specifically did not

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.380 
change the move specifically did not
change<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.280> way<00:02:30.400> your<00:02:30.610> attacks<00:02:30.910> act<00:02:31.210> of

change like the way your attacks act of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.270 
change like the way your attacks act of
the<00:02:31.480> way<00:02:31.570> that<00:02:31.780> all<00:02:31.930> your<00:02:32.080> attacks<00:02:32.380> act<00:02:32.710> but<00:02:33.220> a

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the way that all your attacks act but a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.040 
the way that all your attacks act but a
lot<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.640> ways<00:02:33.820> your<00:02:34.090> combos<00:02:34.540> feel<00:02:34.840> when

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050

in<00:03:11.230> season<00:03:11.590> one<00:03:11.770> some<00:03:12.400> substance<00:03:12.910> does<00:03:13.180> still

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
in season one some substance does still

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.150

feel<00:03:13.690> really<00:03:13.990> good<00:03:14.140> like<00:03:14.350> unfold<00:03:14.800> war<00:03:14.950> for

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
feel really good like unfold war for

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.070 
feel really good like unfold war for
some<00:03:15.310> reason<00:03:15.610> his<00:03:15.760> still<00:03:15.970> feels<00:03:16.360> great<00:03:16.840> and

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
some reason his still feels great and

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.479 
some reason his still feels great and
I'm<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.560> don't<00:03:17.739> even<00:03:17.800> know<00:03:18.010> if<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:18.250> anything

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
I'm I don't even know if it's anything

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.670 
I'm I don't even know if it's anything
really<00:03:18.730> changed<00:03:18.850> with<00:03:19.300> folgore<00:03:19.690> but<00:03:20.320> for<00:03:20.500> some

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
really changed with folgore but for some

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.960 
really changed with folgore but for some
characters<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.130> Jago<00:03:21.489> it's<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.730> big

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
characters like Jago it's a big

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.090 
characters like Jago it's a big
difference<00:03:22.390> um<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:23.140> manual<00:03:23.560> system<00:03:23.890> being

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
difference um the manual system being

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.800 
difference um the manual system being
kind<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.459> even<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:25.000> everyone<00:03:25.360> now<00:03:25.540> and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
kind of even for everyone now and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.259 
kind of even for everyone now and
because<00:03:26.800> it's<00:03:26.950> even<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.489> have<00:03:27.670> these<00:03:27.880> this

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
because it's even you have these this

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.990 
because it's even you have these this
kind<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.570> like<00:03:28.830> weird<00:03:29.830> look<00:03:30.220> two<00:03:30.430> combos<00:03:30.820> now

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
kind of like weird look two combos now

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.640 
kind of like weird look two combos now
like<00:03:31.180> everyone's<00:03:31.570> combos<00:03:31.989> kind<00:03:32.200> of<00:03:32.290> feel<00:03:32.440> a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
like everyone's combos kind of feel a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.800 
like everyone's combos kind of feel a
little<00:03:32.950> bit<00:03:33.100> more<00:03:33.250> robotic<00:03:33.700> especially<00:03:34.690> when

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
little bit more robotic especially when

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.420 
little bit more robotic especially when
it<00:03:34.900> comes<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.140> manuals<00:03:35.650> because<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:36.040> how<00:03:36.160> long

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
it comes to manuals because of how long

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.820 
it comes to manuals because of how long
you're<00:03:36.970> kind<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.239> stuck<00:03:37.420> in<00:03:37.570> state<00:03:38.110> while<00:03:38.680> in

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
you're kind of stuck in state while in

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.410 
you're kind of stuck in state while in
season<00:03:39.190> one<00:03:39.340> one<00:03:39.550> thing<00:03:39.760> kind<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:39.970> flow<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.239> the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
season one one thing kind of flow to the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
next is you kind of you did actually

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.830 
next is you kind of you did actually
cancel<00:03:42.610> out<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.660> all<00:03:43.810> very

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
cancel out of it this is all very

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.229 
cancel out of it this is all very
technical<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:45.100> know<00:03:45.220> killer<00:03:45.519> instinct<00:03:45.970> stuff

when<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.810> comes<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.140> how<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.320> game<00:03:47.709> feels<00:03:48.160> but

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
when it comes to how the game feels but

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.180 
when it comes to how the game feels but
I<00:03:48.940> don't<00:03:49.209> think<00:03:49.360> it's<00:03:49.570> necessarily<00:03:50.470> bad<00:03:50.890> but

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
I don't think it's necessarily bad but

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.280 
I don't think it's necessarily bad but
there<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.640> lot<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:51.940> people<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.450> are<00:03:52.600> um<00:03:52.810> you

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
there is a lot of people that are um you

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.080 
there is a lot of people that are um you
know<00:03:53.410> how<00:03:53.560> gripes<00:03:53.890> or<00:03:54.160> guarding<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.640> some

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
know how gripes or guarding it some

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.520 
know how gripes or guarding it some
people<00:03:55.300> like<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.480> because<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.959> makes<00:03:56.050> manuals

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
people like it because it makes manuals

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.930 
people like it because it makes manuals
either<00:03:56.739> easier<00:03:57.130> for<00:03:57.310> everybody<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.760> think

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
either easier for everybody and I think

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.070 
either easier for everybody and I think
that's<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.269> one<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.660> better<00:03:58.870> things

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
that's the one of the better things

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.930 
that's the one of the better things
about<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.560> new<00:03:59.709> manual<00:04:00.070> system<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.550> that<00:04:00.670> yes

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
about the new manual system is that yes

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.210 
about the new manual system is that yes
it<00:04:01.180> did<00:04:01.360> get<00:04:01.600> easier<00:04:02.019> for<00:04:02.709> every<00:04:03.040> character

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
it did get easier for every character

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.220 
it did get easier for every character
the<00:04:03.610> only<00:04:03.850> character<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.300> really<00:04:04.720> kinda

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
the only character it really kinda

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.990 
the only character it really kinda
nerfed<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.739> technically<00:04:06.190> Jago<00:04:06.700> because<00:04:06.880> he

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
nerfed is technically Jago because he

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.210 
nerfed is technically Jago because he
could<00:04:07.150> manual<00:04:07.570> off<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:07.900> everything<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.800> he

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
could manual off of everything and he

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.940 
could manual off of everything and he
was<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.489> manual<00:04:09.880> monster<00:04:10.330> but<00:04:10.900> my<00:04:11.200> my<00:04:11.530> biggest

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
was the manual monster but my my biggest

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.890 
was the manual monster but my my biggest
gripe<00:04:12.190> comes<00:04:12.489> down<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.910> how<00:04:13.060> your<00:04:13.390> kind<00:04:13.810> of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
gripe comes down to how your kind of

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.500 
gripe comes down to how your kind of
locked<00:04:14.170> into<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.769> lot<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.250> animations<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:16.330> good

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
locked into a lot of animations the good

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.060 
locked into a lot of animations the good
thing<00:04:16.540> is<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:16.870> this<00:04:17.140> is<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.739> early

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
thing is that this is the the early

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.520 
thing is that this is the the early
