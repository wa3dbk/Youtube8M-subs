00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:10.570
 Hi, people. Good night. I'm recording here. 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:17.859
 to show and reached the part of the panel 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:24.310
 the mustache of the elite meriva of a 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:27.640
 company that guarulhos or company that 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.340
 I discovered the Corsican Club does 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.790
 quite the demand of Corsica 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.610
 I made the purchase by the free market and arrived 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 and the ballad was poison in class mail 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:46.930
 super fast I bought it on Wednesday 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.430
 today has reached a super fast 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.520
 I've opened all comes well paladinho 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.359
 Separate, right? 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.739
 so the one I bought it is not just the 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:05.549
 acetate is that the here it comes is a 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.760
 The most complete kit comes with an acetate 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.840
 imported from opium itself is to see 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.299
 pointers here from cruze that is the pointer 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.130
 translucent red and comes five 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.990
 lamps she demands throne that she 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.630
 use three on the dashboard 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.259
 are these three here and these other two 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.299
 going on the odometer which is the part that 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.750
 indicates the gear and the other part indicates 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.579
 the mileage came super balladinha that 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.579
 will be able to take it by hand only 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.710
 here I come are the four pointers 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.190
 they are different because they are 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.820
 crystals in this part underneath and it is 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.060
 It gives that very cool lighting are not 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.860
 the hands of a chevrolet cross I 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.220
 exchange for mine that mine are 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.390
 white 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.680
 I did not take it here. 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.810
 this one is the acetate that the lighting 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.810
 as if it were the agile né that is that 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.140
 area said buca nova I was in doubt 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.780
 between this is the other that this is from here 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.600
 white nation in the description of the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.440
 I'll put it where I bought it and the 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.120
 models that have there they're cool 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.680
 put a price that I think goes 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.670
 stay cool in a project I 'm 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 making 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.640
 It's also not legal to roll against the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.830
 another that white and then we exchange is 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.989
 this one is different because instead of 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.690
 see the inscription here on ss né 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.390
 ss girl would come that record that 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.580
 is what indicates the electronic exchange of 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.440
 marches 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.239
 I'm liking you just to 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.850
 Show me that I'm here, I'll see if I can 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.800
 do weekend or Saturday in 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.360
 Sunday and then I put it installed 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.800
 and I'll see if I can do it. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.040
 a video of how to do this 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.290
 transformation than to take such a 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.450
 I believe it helps people a lot 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.420
 to go see the cost of this to do 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.420
 a company charged me around $ 150 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.870
 I think I'm going to make a good 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.010
 economy 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.040
 beauty then when the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.100
 video or installation I can a new one 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.890
 with the lighting of before and after 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.510
 then for us to compare ok 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.510
 Thanks, good night
