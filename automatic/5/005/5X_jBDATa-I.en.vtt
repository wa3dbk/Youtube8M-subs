I'm<00:00:05.220> holding<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.549> crash<00:00:05.790> symbol<00:00:06.240> right<00:00:06.420> here

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
I'm holding the crash symbol right here

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.379 
I'm holding the crash symbol right here
and<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.830> took<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.130> off<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.250> stand<00:00:08.580> first<00:00:09.059> to

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
and I took it off the stand first to

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.660 
and I took it off the stand first to
show<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.719> how<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.230> actually<00:00:10.830> place<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.519> the

typically<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.960> crash<00:00:13.230> cymbal<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.250> be

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
typically a crash cymbal is going to be

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.689 
typically a crash cymbal is going to be
off<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.150> your<00:00:15.210> left<00:00:15.389> side<00:00:15.690> if<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.260> one

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
off to your left side if you have one

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.189 
off to your left side if you have one
drum<00:00:17.699> sets<00:00:17.940> generally<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.690> couple<00:00:19.109> of

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
drum sets generally have a couple of

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
drum sets generally have a couple of
crashes<00:00:19.470> they<00:00:20.250> range<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.699> different<00:00:20.910> sizes

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
crashes they range in different sizes

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.179 
crashes they range in different sizes
and<00:00:21.930> they<00:00:22.140> start<00:00:22.439> normally<00:00:22.800> again<00:00:23.010> off<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and they start normally again off to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.769 
and they start normally again off to
your<00:00:23.310> left<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.820> might<00:00:24.029> see<00:00:24.240> one<00:00:24.359> off<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.689> your

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
your left you might see one off to your

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.009 
your left you might see one off to your
right<00:00:25.080> couple<00:00:26.010> maybe<00:00:26.400> even<00:00:26.820> between<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
right couple maybe even between the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.099 
right couple maybe even between the
drums<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.550> left<00:00:29.820> side<00:00:30.109> drummers

drums here or on the left side drummers

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.990 
drums here or on the left side drummers
often<00:00:31.470> change<00:00:32.070> their<00:00:32.160> crash<00:00:32.460> cymbal<00:00:32.790> setup

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
often change their crash cymbal setup

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
often change their crash cymbal setup
depending<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.480> how<00:00:33.630> big<00:00:33.989> their<00:00:34.200> set<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
depending on how big their set is and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.979 
depending on how big their set is and
also<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.910> type<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> music<00:00:36.360> you're<00:00:36.719> playing

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

the<00:00:37.950> cymbal<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.969> normal<00:00:39.450> cymbal<00:00:39.809> has<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.350> hole

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the cymbal a normal cymbal has a hole

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
the cymbal a normal cymbal has a hole
right<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> center<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.850> that's<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
right in the center and that's going to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.380 
right in the center and that's going to
go<00:00:43.230> right<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.980> stand<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.000> basically

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
go right on your stand you basically

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.690 
go right on your stand you basically
take<00:00:45.600> off<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> wing<00:00:46.110> nut<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.559> take<00:00:47.219> off<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
take off the wing nut and take off the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.389 
take off the wing nut and take off the
first<00:00:47.910> felt<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.739> symbol<00:00:49.980> goes<00:00:50.190> between

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
first felt here the symbol goes between

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.630 
first felt here the symbol goes between
the<00:00:50.700> two<00:00:50.879> felts<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.129> hopefully<00:00:53.129> has<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> little

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the two felts and hopefully has a little

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
the two felts and hopefully has a little
bit<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.910> protection<00:00:54.270> device<00:00:54.750> right<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.079> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
bit of a protection device right here so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
bit of a protection device right here so
it's<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.100> rubbing<00:00:56.489> against<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> metal<00:00:57.270> then

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it's not rubbing against the metal then

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's not rubbing against the metal then
the<00:00:58.170> felt<00:00:58.410> goes<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.829> top<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> wing

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the felt goes on top of it and the wing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.100 
the felt goes on top of it and the wing
nut<00:01:01.620> goes<00:01:02.160> directly<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.730> top<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.870> have

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
nut goes directly on top here now I have

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
nut goes directly on top here now I have
like<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> pinched<00:01:04.799> wing<00:01:05.010> nut<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.970> would

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
like a pinched wing nut which you would

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.940 
like a pinched wing nut which you would
pinch<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> sides<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.619> goes<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:07.890> over

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
pinch the sides and it goes right over

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.560 
pinch the sides and it goes right over
the<00:01:08.130> top<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.670> normally<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.390> just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the top and normally you have like just

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
the top and normally you have like just
sort<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> screwing<00:01:10.650> nut<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.549> want<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
sort of a screwing nut and you want to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.950 
sort of a screwing nut and you want to
make<00:01:11.880> sure<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> cymbal<00:01:12.479> has<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.840> bit<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
make sure the cymbal has a little bit of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.130 
make sure the cymbal has a little bit of
play<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.580> doesn't<00:01:14.790> crack<00:01:15.659> or

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
play in it so that it doesn't crack or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.350 
play in it so that it doesn't crack or
get<00:01:16.770> into<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> position<00:01:17.280> where<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.240> a

get into a position where you have a
little<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.840> breakage<00:01:19.350> along<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> hole

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
little bit of breakage along the hole

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.880 
little bit of breakage along the hole
here<00:01:20.840> when<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.930> hit<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> crash<00:01:22.409> cymbal

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
here when you hit the crash cymbal

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
here when you hit the crash cymbal
you're<00:01:23.310> basically<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> hit<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you're basically going to hit it on the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
you're basically going to hit it on the
edge<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> cymbal<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:26.220> gonna

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
edge of the cymbal and you're gonna

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.730 
edge of the cymbal and you're gonna
swipe<00:01:26.759> through<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> either<00:01:27.900> directly<00:01:28.470> down

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
through it or off to the side depending

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109 
through it or off to the side depending
on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> sound<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.710> big<00:01:32.189> crash<00:01:32.729> sound

on the sound you want a big crash sound

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.890 
on the sound you want a big crash sound
is<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> sound<00:01:33.810> something<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.200> this

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.190 

and<00:01:40.729> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.850> swipe<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:42.960> bit

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and if you swipe out it a little bit

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
and if you swipe out it a little bit
more<00:01:43.350> it'll<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
more it'll have a little more of a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.990 
more it'll have a little more of a
whispered<00:01:45.450> tone<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.079> this

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.610 

now<00:01:52.000> depending<00:01:52.180> on<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.510> size<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.170> symbol

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
now depending on the size of the symbol

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.860
