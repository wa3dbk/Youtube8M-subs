00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.240 
and I'm going to get a shuffling this is
a<00:01:44.579> shuffle<00:01:45.350> obviously<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> dummy

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
a shuffle obviously I'm at the dummy

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
a shuffle obviously I'm at the dummy
card<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.850> there's<00:01:48.000> four<00:01:48.299> cards<00:01:48.780> hit<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
card and there's four cards hit the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.679 
card and there's four cards hit the
table<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.890> day<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.220> work<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
table one day they work and then I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.380 
table one day they work and then I
shuffle<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> rest<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.649> cards<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.390> now

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
obviously this is not difficult what

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.789 
obviously this is not difficult what
we've<00:01:56.340> done<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.939> far<00:01:57.229> hopefully<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.649> can

we've done here so far hopefully you can

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.390 
we've done here so far hopefully you can
just<00:01:58.979> figured<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.340> by<00:01:59.549> yourself

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
just figured out by yourself

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.020 
just figured out by yourself
very<00:02:02.150> simple<00:02:03.040> setup<00:02:04.040> we've<00:02:04.340> got<00:02:04.549> cards<00:02:04.909> we

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
very simple setup we've got cards we

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
for him to cut he just taps the deck

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.400 
for him to cut he just taps the deck
because<00:04:21.120> he<00:04:21.239> doesn't<00:04:21.570> even<00:04:21.630> want<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.079> cut<00:04:22.290> it

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410
