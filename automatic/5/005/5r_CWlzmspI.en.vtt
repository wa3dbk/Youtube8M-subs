today we are going to be taking a look
at<00:00:03.780> just<00:00:03.840> how<00:00:04.230> effective<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:05.130> foregrip<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:06.000> in

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
at just how effective the foregrip is in

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.140 
at just how effective the foregrip is in
Call<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.720> Duty<00:00:07.250> advanced<00:00:08.250> warfare<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.090> is

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
Call of Duty advanced warfare so this is

Call of Duty advanced warfare so this is
an<00:00:09.210> attachment<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.719> can<00:00:09.780> put<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.080> your<00:00:10.110> weapon

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
an attachment you can put in your weapon

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.709 
an attachment you can put in your weapon
to<00:00:10.920> help<00:00:11.099> improve<00:00:11.429> your<00:00:11.550> accuracy<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.240> reduce

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
to help improve your accuracy and reduce

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.499 
to help improve your accuracy and reduce
the<00:00:12.870> recoil<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.559> man<00:00:14.370> oh<00:00:14.639> man<00:00:14.670> does<00:00:15.480> this

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the recoil and man oh man does this

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.050 
the recoil and man oh man does this
thing<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.350> huge<00:00:16.980> difference<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.820> this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
thing make a huge difference in this

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.460 
thing make a huge difference in this
game<00:00:18.150> probably<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.050> biggest

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
game probably like the biggest

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.800 
game probably like the biggest
difference<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.010> made<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.730> long<00:00:20.970> time<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.600> I

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
difference it's made in a long time so I

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.269 
difference it's made in a long time so I
check<00:00:22.230> out<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.470> first<00:00:22.769> clip<00:00:22.890> we're<00:00:23.160> using

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
check out this first clip we're using

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.189 
check out this first clip we're using
the<00:00:23.400> ball<00:00:23.550> 27<00:00:24.119> no<00:00:24.240> attachments<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:25.019> see

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the ball 27 no attachments you can see

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
the ball 27 no attachments you can see
the<00:00:25.500> recoil<00:00:25.920> has<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> pretty<00:00:26.699> good<00:00:27.060> amount<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the recoil has a pretty good amount of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.450 
the recoil has a pretty good amount of
vertical<00:00:28.019> movement<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.470> goes<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.920> pretty<00:00:29.189> far

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
vertical movement it goes up pretty far

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.490 
vertical movement it goes up pretty far
as<00:00:29.670> well<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.570> bit<00:00:30.660> side<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.990> side<00:00:31.199> now

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
as well as a little bit side to side now

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
as well as a little bit side to side now
with<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> grip<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.120> see<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.570> this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
with the grip you can see that this

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.290 
with the grip you can see that this
thing<00:00:33.899> almost<00:00:34.079> has<00:00:34.440> no<00:00:34.980> movement<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
thing almost has no movement it's like a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
thing almost has no movement it's like a
laser<00:00:36.660> man<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> tiny<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:38.040> circle<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
laser man it's a tiny little circle and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.280 
laser man it's a tiny little circle and
if<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.210> them<00:00:39.329> side<00:00:39.570> by<00:00:39.600> side<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.140> can

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
if you look at them side by side you can

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.590 
if you look at them side by side you can
see<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:41.160> least<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.790> 60<00:00:42.239> percent

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
see it's at least a 60 percent

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
see it's at least a 60 percent
improvement<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:44.010> better<00:00:44.309> so

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
improvement like it's a lot better so

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.729 
improvement like it's a lot better so
obviously<00:00:45.539> that's<00:00:45.660> pretty<00:00:45.960> useful<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.379> I'm

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
obviously that's pretty useful now I'm

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.830 
obviously that's pretty useful now I'm
moving<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.190> let's<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> look<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.120> SMG<00:00:48.420> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
moving on let's take a look at an SMG so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
moving on let's take a look at an SMG so
here<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> ASM<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:50.039> without<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
here we have the ASM one without the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
here we have the ASM one without the
grip<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> huge<00:00:51.719> amount<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.320> vertical

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
grip it's got a huge amount of vertical

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010 
grip it's got a huge amount of vertical
recoil<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.430> well<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:54.000> some<00:00:54.510> movement<00:00:54.870> from

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
recoil as well as some movement from

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080 
recoil as well as some movement from
side<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.379> side<00:00:55.410> throw<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> grip<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
side to side throw the grip on there and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.750 
side to side throw the grip on there and
you<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.570> pinpoint-accurate<00:00:58.489> SMG<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you now have a pinpoint-accurate SMG and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150 
you now have a pinpoint-accurate SMG and
again<00:01:00.090> here's<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> side-by-side<00:01:00.770> this<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
again here's a side-by-side this one is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
again here's a side-by-side this one is
even<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.789> more<00:01:03.059> apparent<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.629> it's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
even you know more apparent like it's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
even you know more apparent like it's
just<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.379> insane<00:01:04.890> how<00:01:05.220> much<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> grip

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
just it's insane how much the grip

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
just it's insane how much the grip
affects<00:01:06.750> these<00:01:06.990> weapons<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.920> game<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
affects these weapons in this game now I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
affects these weapons in this game now I
did<00:01:09.299> test<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.720> multiple<00:01:10.140> times<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.590> quite

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
did test this multiple times with quite

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.320 
did test this multiple times with quite
a<00:01:10.860> few<00:01:11.070> different<00:01:11.159> weapons<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
a few different weapons and there is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
a few different weapons and there is
somewhat<00:01:12.869> other<00:01:13.080> randomness<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> like

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
somewhat other randomness to it like

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
somewhat other randomness to it like
sometimes<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> same<00:01:15.330> weapons<00:01:15.689> same

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
sometimes with the same weapons same

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.020 
sometimes with the same weapons same
attachment<00:01:16.140> it'll<00:01:16.950> recoil<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.640> than<00:01:17.790> others

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
attachment it'll recoil more than others

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.249 
attachment it'll recoil more than others
like<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.659> somewhat<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
like that there is somewhat of a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.920 
like that there is somewhat of a
randomness<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.759> general<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.689> grip

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
randomness to it but in general the grip

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.560 
randomness to it but in general the grip
was<00:01:22.080> always<00:01:22.409> much<00:01:22.890> much<00:01:23.310> much<00:01:23.580> better<00:01:23.880> than

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
was always much much much better than

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
was always much much much better than
the<00:01:24.750> regular<00:01:24.960> version<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.040> weapons<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the regular version of the weapons so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.070 
the regular version of the weapons so
yeah<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.450> whether<00:01:27.659> you're<00:01:27.840> using

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
yeah you know whether you're using

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.830 
yeah you know whether you're using
assault<00:01:28.530> rifles<00:01:28.950> SMG<00:01:29.610> slm<00:01:29.670> geez<00:01:30.299> whatever<00:01:30.600> it
