00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
video if you wanted to as well with this

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.319 
video if you wanted to as well with this
and<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.710> that's<00:01:43.979> Instagram<00:01:44.340> Direk<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> very

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and so that's Instagram Direk is a very

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.690 
and so that's Instagram Direk is a very
simple<00:01:46.049> basic<00:01:46.409> update<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> Instagram

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
simple basic update to the Instagram

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.069 
simple basic update to the Instagram
application<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.720> something<00:01:48.960> that's

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
application but I think something that's

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.749 
application but I think something that's
gonna<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.350> useful<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.369> something<00:01:50.640> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
gonna be useful and it's something that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.190 
gonna be useful and it's something that
you<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> doesn't<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you know it doesn't get in the way it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.330 
you know it doesn't get in the way it
doesn't<00:01:52.320> really<00:01:52.560> take<00:01:52.799> away<00:01:52.920> from<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
doesn't really take away from the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.679 
doesn't really take away from the
original<00:01:53.729> field<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.030> Instagram<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
original field of Instagram and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.149 
original field of Instagram and
Instagram<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.259> usually<00:01:55.500> good<00:01:55.680> about<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
Instagram is usually good about that

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
Instagram is usually good about that
just<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.610> did<00:01:56.759> with<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> video<00:01:57.270> update

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
just like you did with the video update

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
just like you did with the video update
to<00:01:57.930> Instagram<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.710> long<00:01:58.950> ago

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
to Instagram not that long ago

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.190 
to Instagram not that long ago

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.630 
so again Instagram to rec is a free
update<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> Instagram<00:02:02.040> application

Instagram or H

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.759 
Instagram or H
trying<00:02:11.999> to<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.329> at<00:02:12.510> snapchat<00:02:13.079> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.499> bit<00:02:13.620> I

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
trying to go at snapchat a little bit I

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.289 
trying to go at snapchat a little bit I
think<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.790> doesn't<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.180> same

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
think so and it doesn't have that same

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.479 
think so and it doesn't have that same
allure<00:02:15.900> appeal<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.859> snapchat<00:02:17.340> has

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
allure appeal that that snapchat has

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.709 
allure appeal that that snapchat has
when<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.790> send<00:02:18.090> something<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.569> just

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
when you send something and it just

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.660 
when you send something and it just
disappears<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.769> can<00:02:19.889> get<00:02:20.010> kind<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.280> freaky

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
disappears so you can get kind of freaky

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.209 
disappears so you can get kind of freaky
and<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.909> kind<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.209> crazy<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:21.689> it<00:02:21.749> but<00:02:22.680> I

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
and get kind of crazy with it but I

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.250 
and get kind of crazy with it but I
think<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.939> is<00:02:24.060> something<00:02:24.329> that<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.989> can<00:02:25.139> kind

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
think it is something that you can kind

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.259 
think it is something that you can kind
of<00:02:25.409> see<00:02:25.560> them<00:02:25.739> trying<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.879> know<00:02:26.969> go
