00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.490 
to race with the fastest car in the game

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
on need for speed shift it's the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.299 
on need for speed shift it's the
Lamborghini<00:00:11.130> Murcielago<00:00:12.620> lp640<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.740> think<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
Lamborghini Murcielago lp640 I think and

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.970 
Lamborghini Murcielago lp640 I think and
I<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.540> every<00:00:15.960> single<00:00:16.139> upgrade<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.850> got

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
I have every single upgrade and I got

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.570 
I have every single upgrade and I got
the<00:00:19.980> works<00:00:20.220> upgrade<00:00:21.050> so<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.500> believe<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.519> is

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the works upgrade so I believe this is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.250 
the works upgrade so I believe this is
the<00:00:23.910> fastest<00:00:24.330> car<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.630> game

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the fastest car in the game

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.670 
the fastest car in the game
besides<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.279> Bugatti<00:00:26.580> Veyron<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:28.380> can't

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
besides the Bugatti Veyron but you can't

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.820 
besides the Bugatti Veyron but you can't
really<00:00:29.189> upgrade<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.650> is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
really upgrade that so I think this is

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.040 
really upgrade that so I think this is
all<00:00:32.219> around<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.880> better<00:00:32.910> car

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
all around a better car

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.400 
all around a better car
but<00:00:35.649> I<00:00:36.550> don't<00:00:37.420> think<00:00:37.510> there's<00:00:37.719> many<00:00:37.960> people

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
but I don't think there's many people

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.869 
but I don't think there's many people
who<00:00:38.500> play<00:00:38.530> this<00:00:38.829> game<00:00:39.070> anymore<00:00:39.309> I<00:00:39.460> don't

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
who play this game anymore I don't

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.590 
who play this game anymore I don't
really<00:00:40.120> know<00:00:40.300> but<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:42.910> pretty<00:00:43.149> cool<00:00:43.420> game

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
I lost the Bugatti because the Bugatti

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.369 
I lost the Bugatti because the Bugatti
Veyron<00:02:21.670> has<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.120> most<00:02:22.329> speed<00:02:22.599> but<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.019> less

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
Veyron has the most speed but it's less

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.599 
Veyron has the most speed but it's less
control<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:26.260> Thwaites<00:02:26.590> Oh<00:02:26.829> Oh<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.459> race

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.420 
control for Thwaites Oh Oh the race
isn't<00:02:27.849> over<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.930> thought<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.859> was<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.129> finish

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
isn't over I thought that was the finish

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.920 
isn't over I thought that was the finish
line<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:33.579> came<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.939> fourth<00:02:34.269> with<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
line and I came in fourth with the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.069 
line and I came in fourth with the
fastest<00:02:35.290> car<00:02:35.469> in<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.650> game<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.689> shows

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
fastest car in the game so that shows

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.309 
fastest car in the game so that shows
how<00:02:38.260> much<00:02:38.409> I<00:02:38.829> suck<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:40.019> recommend<00:02:41.019> getting

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
how much I suck but I recommend getting

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.470 
how much I suck but I recommend getting
this<00:02:41.530> car<00:02:41.799> in<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.159> game<00:02:42.659> and<00:02:43.799> career<00:02:44.969> C<00:02:45.969> it's<00:02:46.269> a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
this car in the game and career C it's a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.599 
this car in the game and career C it's a
good<00:02:46.719> car<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.019> think<00:02:47.260> it's<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.769> best<00:02:48.159> car<00:02:48.459> in

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
good car I think it's the best car in

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.819 
good car I think it's the best car in
the<00:02:48.639> game<00:02:48.989> personally<00:02:49.989> because<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:50.739> the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
the game personally because it's the

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.309 
the game personally because it's the
best<00:02:51.010> all-round<00:02:51.549> but<00:02:51.909> you<00:02:52.419> can<00:02:52.599> still<00:02:52.870> get<00:02:53.079> the

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
best all-round but you can still get the

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.390 
best all-round but you can still get the
Zonda<00:02:54.159> or<00:02:54.370> whatever<00:02:54.639> the<00:02:54.819> car<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:57.280> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
Zonda or whatever the car is but the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.190 
Zonda or whatever the car is but the
only<00:02:57.579> thing<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.909> you<00:02:57.939> cannot<00:02:58.269> upgrade<00:02:58.629> it<00:02:59.049> and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
only thing is you cannot upgrade it and

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.429 
only thing is you cannot upgrade it and
