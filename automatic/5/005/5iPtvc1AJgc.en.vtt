00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.910 

the<00:00:04.480> original<00:00:04.870> stub<00:00:05.080> which<00:00:05.230> we<00:00:05.350> started<00:00:05.770> in

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:05.920 
the original stub which we started in

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.220 
the original stub which we started in
2000<00:00:06.910> so<00:00:07.300> it's<00:00:07.450> been<00:00:07.600> about<00:00:07.780> eight<00:00:07.960> years

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
2000 so it's been about eight years

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.070 
2000 so it's been about eight years
refining<00:00:09.100> this<00:00:09.219> every<00:00:09.820> year<00:00:10.180> or<00:00:10.510> so<00:00:10.690> we<00:00:10.930> just

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
refining this every year or so we just

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.660 
refining this every year or so we just
changed<00:00:11.170> him<00:00:11.590> a<00:00:11.650> little<00:00:11.860> bit<00:00:12.010> we've<00:00:12.459> narrowed

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
changed him a little bit we've narrowed

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.760 
changed him a little bit we've narrowed
down<00:00:12.850> this<00:00:13.150> house<00:00:13.389> not<00:00:13.900> quite<00:00:14.170> as<00:00:14.320> much<00:00:14.500> as<00:00:14.650> the

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
down this house not quite as much as the

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.830 
down this house not quite as much as the
fusion<00:00:15.039> stubby<00:00:15.549> the<00:00:15.969> rails<00:00:16.330> are<00:00:16.480> slightly

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
fusion stubby the rails are slightly

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.919 
fusion stubby the rails are slightly
slimmer<00:00:17.320> as<00:00:17.619> well<00:00:18.480> they<00:00:19.480> put<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.689> little<00:00:19.779> bit

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:19.929 
slimmer as well they put a little bit

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.749 
slimmer as well they put a little bit
more<00:00:19.990> nose<00:00:20.349> lifter<00:00:20.890> than<00:00:21.160> what<00:00:21.279> they<00:00:21.429> used<00:00:21.609> to

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
more nose lifter than what they used to

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.249 
more nose lifter than what they used to
have<00:00:21.910> so<00:00:22.539> they're<00:00:22.720> a<00:00:22.750> little<00:00:22.869> bit<00:00:22.990> more

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
have so they're a little bit more

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.419 
have so they're a little bit more

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
forgiving on takeoffs the thin system

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.849 
forgiving on takeoffs the thin system
can<00:00:27.640> be<00:00:27.789> either<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:28.179> just<00:00:28.990> a<00:00:29.080> normal<00:00:29.410> thruster

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859

accelerate out of your turns that it

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.050 
accelerate out of your turns that it
feels<00:00:59.710> is<00:00:59.860> exciting<00:01:00.400> when<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.580> actually<00:01:00.670> surf

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
feels is exciting when you actually surf

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
them I hadn't written one of these for a

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.380 
them I hadn't written one of these for a
while<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.280> I<00:01:03.370> swapped<00:01:03.640> with<00:01:03.790> a<00:01:03.850> guy<00:01:04.059> out<00:01:04.239> at

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
while and I swapped with a guy out at

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.450 
while and I swapped with a guy out at
Flinders<00:01:04.659> he<00:01:05.229> wanted<00:01:05.530> five<00:01:05.740> my<00:01:05.890> six<00:01:06.100> foot<00:01:06.280> six

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
Flinders he wanted five my six foot six

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.420 
Flinders he wanted five my six foot six
and<00:01:06.729> I<00:01:06.759> wrote<00:01:06.970> his<00:01:07.210> seven<00:01:07.930> foot<00:01:08.080> six<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.560> I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
and I wrote his seven foot six and I

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.920 
and I wrote his seven foot six and I
just<00:01:09.760> couldn't<00:01:10.060> believe<00:01:10.120> how<00:01:10.450> good<00:01:10.480> it<00:01:10.690> went

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
just couldn't believe how good it went

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.420 
just couldn't believe how good it went
you<00:01:11.110> could<00:01:11.230> come<00:01:11.470> off<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.680> bottom<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.040> really

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
you could come off the bottom and really

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.680 
you could come off the bottom and really
set<00:01:12.610> your<00:01:12.730> turns<00:01:12.970> up<00:01:13.210> because<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.480> had<00:01:13.570> the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
set your turns up because you had the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.500 
set your turns up because you had the
volume<00:01:14.020> in<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.230> board<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.180> yeah<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.360> was<00:01:16.480> just

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
volume in the board and yeah it was just

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.170 
volume in the board and yeah it was just
just<00:01:17.080> it<00:01:17.470> was<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.740> pleasure<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.220> serve<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.730> guy

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
just it was a pleasure to serve the guy

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.970 
just it was a pleasure to serve the guy
I<00:01:19.210> couldn't<00:01:19.659> believe<00:01:19.780> how<00:01:20.380> good<00:01:20.440> his<00:01:20.740> board

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
I couldn't believe how good his board

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.160 
I couldn't believe how good his board
actually<00:01:21.159> went<00:01:21.520> when<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:21.700> wrote<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.030> he

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
actually went when I wrote it he

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.320 
actually went when I wrote it he
I<00:01:23.220> thought<00:01:24.220> about<00:01:24.490> he<00:01:24.610> should<00:01:24.790> practice<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.240> bit

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
I thought about he should practice a bit

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.210 
I thought about he should practice a bit
more<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.960> keep<00:01:26.439> with<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.710> same<00:01:26.950> board

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
more and keep with the same board

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.789 
more and keep with the same board
instead<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.610> getting<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> smaller<00:01:28.180> one<00:01:28.799> these

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
instead of getting a smaller one these

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.230 
instead of getting a smaller one these
boards<00:01:30.189> are<00:01:30.310> really<00:01:30.640> good<00:01:30.759> for<00:01:30.880> people<00:01:31.180> that

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
boards are really good for people that

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.760 
boards are really good for people that
are<00:01:31.360> get<00:01:31.479> back<00:01:31.630> into<00:01:31.899> surfing<00:01:32.380> they're<00:01:32.560> heaps

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
are get back into surfing they're heaps

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.440 
are get back into surfing they're heaps
better<00:01:32.950> than<00:01:33.220> mini<00:01:33.430> males<00:01:33.729> because<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.299> can

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
better than mini males because you can

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.600 
better than mini males because you can
drop<00:01:34.630> at<00:01:35.080> least<00:01:35.320> six<00:01:35.560> inches<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> foot<00:01:36.399> in

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
you've got a seven-foot stubby you so

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.810 
you've got a seven-foot stubby you so
anybody<00:01:49.930> that's<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:51.009> know<00:01:51.130> like<00:01:51.310> around<00:01:51.430> 80

kilos<00:01:52.299> these<00:01:52.539> are<00:01:52.689> ideal<00:01:53.020> boards<00:01:53.470> they<00:01:54.810> float

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
kilos these are ideal boards they float

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.330 
kilos these are ideal boards they float
you<00:01:56.319> know<00:01:56.470> if<00:01:56.530> you're<00:01:56.649> more<00:01:56.800> experienced

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
you know if you're more experienced

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.399 
you know if you're more experienced
surfing<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.819> probably<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.270> get<00:01:58.420> away<00:01:58.509> with<00:01:58.869> a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
surfing you probably can get away with a

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.289 
surfing you probably can get away with a
slightly<00:01:59.890> thinner<00:02:00.220> one<00:02:00.429> so<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:00.759> do<00:02:00.909> different

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
slightly thinner one so we do different

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.969 
slightly thinner one so we do different
thicknesses<00:02:01.750> in<00:02:01.929> them<00:02:02.110> we<00:02:02.530> do<00:02:02.679> them<00:02:02.860> from

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
thicknesses in them we do them from

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.850 
thicknesses in them we do them from
three<00:02:03.340> inches<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:04.530> three<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.649> a<00:02:05.679> quarter

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
three inches to three and a quarter

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.620 
three inches to three and a quarter
inches<00:02:06.039> so<00:02:07.000> there's<00:02:07.149> all<00:02:07.270> sorts<00:02:07.569> of

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
inches so there's all sorts of

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.960 
inches so there's all sorts of
variations<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.380> them<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.160> rails<00:02:09.399> too<00:02:09.670> we<00:02:09.850> can

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
variations in them the rails too we can

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.550 
variations in them the rails too we can
beef<00:02:10.149> up<00:02:10.299> a<00:02:10.479> bit<00:02:10.660> if<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.869> need<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.049> bit<00:02:11.230> extra

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
beef up a bit if you need a bit extra

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.110 
beef up a bit if you need a bit extra
buoyancy<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.250> want<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.519> keep<00:02:12.670> down<00:02:12.850> that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
buoyancy and you want to keep down that

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.520 
buoyancy and you want to keep down that
you<00:02:13.510> know<00:02:13.630> under<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.049> seven<00:02:14.350> foot<00:02:14.500> six

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
you know under that seven foot six

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.370 
you know under that seven foot six
lengths<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.790> there's<00:02:15.970> lots<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.299> things<00:02:17.019> we<00:02:17.170> can

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
lengths so there's lots of things we can

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.080 
lengths so there's lots of things we can
do<00:02:17.530> with<00:02:17.650> them<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.040> there's<00:02:18.760> lots<00:02:19.000> of

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
do with them and there's lots of

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.030 
do with them and there's lots of
variations<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.810> them<00:02:20.019> it's<00:02:20.470> still<00:02:20.680> around<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
variations in them it's still around the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.070 
variations in them it's still around the
same<00:02:21.220> sort<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.549> width<00:02:21.730> they're<00:02:21.970> 21<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.930> 1/4

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
same sort of width they're 21 and 1/4

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.229 
same sort of width they're 21 and 1/4
the<00:02:23.319> same<00:02:23.500> as<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> six<00:02:23.950> foot<00:02:24.130> six<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.970> we<00:02:25.090> just

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
the same as a six foot six so we just

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.940 
the same as a six foot six so we just
bread<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.569> out<00:02:25.690> over<00:02:26.019> those<00:02:26.170> three<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.680> six

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
bread it out over those three like six

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.190 
bread it out over those three like six
foot<00:02:27.130> six<00:02:27.310> seven<00:02:27.670> foot<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.209> seven<00:02:28.989> foot<00:02:29.170> six
