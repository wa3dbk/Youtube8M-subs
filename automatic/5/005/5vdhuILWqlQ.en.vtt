00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello and welcome to delicious 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.590
 taster küchenfee turned back on 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.540
 Today is my third one 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.080
 spies try it every time 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.430
 something went wrong and the last one 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.050
 It was actually perfect 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.150
 tasted great but what was that 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.130
 problem my dear technology does not have 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.910
 played along and did not record 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.640
 and that's why we just do it again 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.110
 you need 500 grams of flour for two people 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.840
 some water I have two more now 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.940
 tablespoon of soy flour in the opponent says 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.210
 but I work mail is cheaper 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.210
 and 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.160
 a kettle is just cheaper 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:53.730
 and does the same as a replacement for 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:01:00.400
 you do of course you need cheese 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.540
 Now I have pizza cheese and me 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.730
 must look I write you 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.850
 back down purely what it's all on 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.750
 even the head in the head 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.700
 Spaetzle touch the dough I help me 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.100
 times as a bit with this spätzle 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.570
 boy some especially i was more than 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.520
 laugh unnecessarily but that helps me because 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.009
 I do not swim real I am 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.970
 not have learned had pointed and 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.280
 I think it's a bit easier 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.600
 just fill the dough with it 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.850
 we have already made beautiful by 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.590
 shake and then we need one 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.590
 pot with hot water or boiling 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.810
 and now the spaetzle would be easy 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 purely pressed until no day is there 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.680
 we advise you again together or 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.090
 cut together and then for the 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 The next steps continue straight away 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:21.220
 kappel you should not do it completely 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:22.330
 clear help tip are always per 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.170
 me when you're on top of the water 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.390
 swim 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.430
 then they can be skimmed off if 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.050
 you file seems too tight like mine 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.990
 now simply want a sip 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.910
 water to it 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.100
 because he thinks is reasonable 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.880
 get out 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:44.110
 the doubt top position still cooking 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.490
 Let's start here I would 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.530
 In between, always sometimes 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.200
 a little bit is also the water and the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:57.850
 slice works but now too 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.830
 it does not seem like anything is coming here now 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.650
 triebel i am must have women i have 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:08.200
 finished taken again and again 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.730
 lock time is supposed to help but 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.730
 this cheese mix over here 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.280
 okay all a bit 'already 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.440
 mix 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.840
 and then we just wait for the 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.520
 second layer spaetzle is ready comes 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.940
 on top of that again the same procedure 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.980
 spice up big onions and cheese 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.870
 over it and then the whole thing in the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.060
 oven so I like to call 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.250
 because the cheese is nice to hurt 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.989
 starts and importantly nice a sticky one 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:49.840
 there are solid and that there of course 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:50.620
 very delicious is so hello and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.180
 Welcome back 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.000
 Do not be surprised I got a little bit 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.840
 naughty because I have to be at the same time 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.780
 Of course, that's what you wanted 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.970
 end result is not withheld it stands 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.709

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.660

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.450

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.470
 really nice brown and lost and 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.150

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.410
 Take a leave of your goodbye to the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.060

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.680
 vegan carving with a stable 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.389
 Give cream sauce if I am tomorrow 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.340

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.979
 turns on if you have subscribed me 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.910
 and always get informed without 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.700
 me maybe even on twitter 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.200

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.060
 but they may become silent 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.780
