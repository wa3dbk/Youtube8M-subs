00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.100 

here's<00:00:01.430> something<00:00:01.939> I<00:00:02.060> thought<00:00:02.330> that<00:00:02.840> was

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.110 
here's something I thought that was

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.660 
here's something I thought that was
interesting<00:00:03.320> you<00:00:04.070> know<00:00:04.190> it's<00:00:04.220> kind<00:00:04.520> of<00:00:04.550> an

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
interesting you know it's kind of an

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.150 
interesting you know it's kind of an
interesting<00:00:04.790> way<00:00:05.480> here<00:00:05.870> to<00:00:06.170> construct<00:00:06.860> a

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
interesting way here to construct a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.150 
interesting way here to construct a
wheelchair<00:00:08.149> ramp<00:00:08.450> you<00:00:09.230> know<00:00:09.320> look<00:00:09.530> like<00:00:09.769> the

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
wheelchair ramp you know look like the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.790 
wheelchair ramp you know look like the
door<00:00:10.670> threshold<00:00:11.210> was<00:00:11.420> about<00:00:11.720> 2<00:00:12.050> or<00:00:12.080> 3<00:00:12.470> inches

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
door threshold was about 2 or 3 inches

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.509 
door threshold was about 2 or 3 inches
above<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.910> decking<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:15.230> I<00:00:15.920> thought<00:00:16.159> this<00:00:16.279> was

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
above the decking and I thought this was

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.560 
above the decking and I thought this was
a<00:00:16.900> pretty<00:00:17.900> good<00:00:17.990> idea<00:00:18.890> here<00:00:19.400> however<00:00:20.210> there<00:00:20.449> is

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
a pretty good idea here however there is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.130 
a pretty good idea here however there is
one<00:00:20.599> thing<00:00:21.109> that<00:00:21.470> I<00:00:22.150> do<00:00:23.150> need<00:00:23.480> to<00:00:23.539> point<00:00:23.689> out

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
one thing that I do need to point out

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.169 
one thing that I do need to point out
and<00:00:24.560> that<00:00:24.739> would<00:00:24.919> be<00:00:25.099> that<00:00:25.339> the<00:00:25.460> door<00:00:25.849> of

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
and that would be that the door of

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.380 
and that would be that the door of
course<00:00:26.509> isn't<00:00:27.099> 36<00:00:28.099> inches<00:00:28.550> which<00:00:28.819> there<00:00:29.179> are

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
course isn't 36 inches which there are

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.380 
course isn't 36 inches which there are
wheelchairs<00:00:30.019> I<00:00:30.199> guess<00:00:30.439> that<00:00:30.649> would<00:00:30.769> fit<00:00:31.039> in<00:00:31.519> a

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
wheelchairs I guess that would fit in a

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.869 
wheelchairs I guess that would fit in a
smaller<00:00:33.199> doorway<00:00:34.039> but<00:00:35.079> most<00:00:36.079> ATA

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
smaller doorway but most ATA

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.110 
smaller doorway but most ATA
requirements<00:00:37.879> for<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:38.809> handicapped<00:00:39.469> or

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
requirements for the handicapped or

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.009 
requirements for the handicapped or
disabled<00:00:41.120> require<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:42.410> have<00:00:42.769> a<00:00:42.800> 36<00:00:43.489> inch

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
disabled require you to have a 36 inch

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.889 
disabled require you to have a 36 inch
opening<00:00:45.019> so<00:00:45.469> again<00:00:46.039> sometimes<00:00:46.460> we<00:00:46.940> we<00:00:47.750> get

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
opening so again sometimes we we get

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.829 
opening so again sometimes we we get
carried<00:00:48.350> away<00:00:48.440> with<00:00:48.980> some<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.809> know

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
carried away with some of the you know

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.829 
carried away with some of the you know
some<00:00:51.109> of<00:00:51.230> our<00:00:51.350> great<00:00:51.649> ideas<00:00:51.679> without

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
some of our great ideas without

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.349 
some of our great ideas without
realizing<00:00:53.839> that<00:00:54.550> we<00:00:55.550> still<00:00:55.789> have<00:00:55.969> have

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
realizing that we still have have

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.739 
realizing that we still have have
another<00:00:56.629> obstacle<00:00:57.019> to<00:00:57.379> overcome<00:00:58.449> next<00:00:59.449> up<00:00:59.570> on

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
another obstacle to overcome next up on

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.399 
another obstacle to overcome next up on
the<00:00:59.780> list<00:01:00.109> is<00:01:00.469> you<00:01:00.679> can<00:01:00.829> see<00:01:01.070> where<00:01:01.699> they<00:01:02.409> had

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
the list is you can see where they had

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.370 
the list is you can see where they had
the<00:01:03.890> ramp<00:01:04.250> kind<00:01:04.640> of<00:01:04.730> return<00:01:05.120> over<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:06.050> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
the ramp kind of return over to the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.530 
the ramp kind of return over to the
right<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.340> picture<00:01:07.580> which<00:01:08.030> is<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.240> good

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
right in the picture which is a good

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.540 
right in the picture which is a good
idea<00:01:09.140> however<00:01:10.420> we<00:01:11.420> have<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.990> other<00:01:12.200> side<00:01:12.590> that

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
idea however we have the other side that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.210 
idea however we have the other side that
presents<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.450> problem<00:01:14.830> you<00:01:15.830> know<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:15.950> could<00:01:16.190> just

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
presents a problem you know I could just

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.580 
presents a problem you know I could just
imagine<00:01:16.550> someone<00:01:17.000> trying<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.630> get<00:01:17.870> out<00:01:18.080> of<00:01:18.350> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
imagine someone trying to get out of the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.070 
imagine someone trying to get out of the
building<00:01:18.980> or<00:01:19.130> into<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.760> building<00:01:20.150> having<00:01:20.900> a

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
building or into the building having a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.430 
building or into the building having a
difficult<00:01:21.590> time<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.630> slipping<00:01:23.630> off<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:24.260> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
difficult time and slipping off to the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.100 
difficult time and slipping off to the
side<00:01:24.680> here<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.220> again<00:01:25.730> these<00:01:26.600> are<00:01:26.660> things

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
side here and again these are things

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.010 
side here and again these are things
that<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:29.060> know<00:01:29.180> it's<00:01:29.360> kind<00:01:29.540> of<00:01:29.570> like<00:01:29.720> weed

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
that you know it's kind of like weed

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.570 
that you know it's kind of like weed
we're<00:01:30.350> not<00:01:30.470> thinking<00:01:30.710> clearly<00:01:31.250> we're

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
we're not thinking clearly we're

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.250 
we're not thinking clearly we're
thinking<00:01:31.880> hey<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.030> know<00:01:32.240> what<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.480> solved<00:01:33.110> this

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
thinking hey you know what I solved this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.730 
thinking hey you know what I solved this
problem<00:01:33.500> that's<00:01:33.980> great<00:01:34.960> but<00:01:35.960> we've<00:01:36.350> either

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
problem that's great but we've either

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.420 
problem that's great but we've either
created<00:01:37.370> another<00:01:37.760> problem<00:01:38.590> forgot<00:01:39.590> about<00:01:40.070> a

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
created another problem forgot about a

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.670 
created another problem forgot about a
problem<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:41.570> again<00:01:41.930> like<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.320> door<00:01:42.530> the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
problem like again like the door the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.360 
problem like again like the door the
width<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:42.980> the<00:01:43.100> doorway<00:01:43.630> or<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:45.170> course<00:01:45.530> in

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
width of the doorway or of course in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.490 
width of the doorway or of course in
this<00:01:46.610> case<00:01:46.940> we<00:01:47.810> should<00:01:47.840> have<00:01:48.290> they<00:01:48.470> should

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
this case we should have they should

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.460 
this case we should have they should
have<00:01:48.800> filled<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.520> other<00:01:49.820> area<00:01:50.390> in<00:01:50.600> just<00:01:51.170> in

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
have filled the other area in just in

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.350 
have filled the other area in just in
case<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.070> of<00:01:52.160> course<00:01:52.370> these<00:01:52.580> are<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:53.150> biggest

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
case and of course these are the biggest

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.600 
case and of course these are the biggest
problems<00:01:53.900> when<00:01:54.080> it<00:01:54.170> comes<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.530> safety<00:01:54.800> you

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
problems when it comes to safety you

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.740 
problems when it comes to safety you
know<00:01:55.730> we<00:01:55.910> come<00:01:56.090> up<00:01:56.210> with<00:01:56.360> some<00:01:56.510> great<00:01:56.720> ideas

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
know we come up with some great ideas

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.990 
know we come up with some great ideas
and<00:01:57.230> we<00:01:57.530> have<00:01:57.860> in<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.130> past<00:01:58.400> let's<00:01:58.760> face<00:01:58.970> it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and we have in the past let's face it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.580 
and we have in the past let's face it
we've<00:01:59.840> created<00:02:00.400> great<00:02:01.400> safety<00:02:01.760> ideas<00:02:02.510> only<00:02:03.230> to

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
we've created great safety ideas only to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.550 
we've created great safety ideas only to
find<00:02:03.800> out<00:02:04.040> later<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:05.080> they<00:02:06.080> aren't<00:02:06.260> as<00:02:06.410> good

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
find out later that they aren't as good

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.070 
find out later that they aren't as good
as<00:02:06.620> we<00:02:06.950> thought<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:08.300> course<00:02:08.509> they<00:02:08.690> need<00:02:08.899> to

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
as we thought and of course they need to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.680 
as we thought and of course they need to
be<00:02:09.229> revamped<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.310> again<00:02:10.820> in<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.060> situation<00:02:11.660> like

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
be revamped so again in a situation like

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.750 
be revamped so again in a situation like
this<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.830> know<00:02:12.950> fine
