is<00:00:33.510> quite<00:00:33.809> big<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.100> much<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.460> a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
however economics is not exactly what
everyone<00:02:00.090> needs<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:01.079> worth<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> pay

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
everyone needs it's not worth it to pay

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.530 
everyone needs it's not worth it to pay
that<00:02:02.070> much<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.490> money<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that much more money just for the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.539 
that much more money just for the
ergonomics<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.320> my<00:02:04.439> opinion<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.159> let's<00:02:05.369> see

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
ergonomics in my opinion so let's see

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
ergonomics in my opinion so let's see
what's<00:02:05.700> up<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> video<00:02:06.360> signal<00:02:06.600> inputs

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
what's up with the video signal inputs

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
what's up with the video signal inputs
the<00:02:07.530> cheap<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:08.009> offers<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.670> DVI<00:02:09.030> one

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the cheap one offers one DVI one

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.330 
the cheap one offers one DVI one
DisplayPort<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.800> one<00:02:11.310> VGA<00:02:11.700> input<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:13.050> X

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
DisplayPort and one VGA input the X

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.420 
DisplayPort and one VGA input the X
if<00:02:13.550> one<00:02:13.700> offers<00:02:14.090> one<00:02:14.300> DVI<00:02:14.660> one<00:02:15.500> DisplayPort

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
if one offers one DVI one DisplayPort

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.830 
if one offers one DVI one DisplayPort
one<00:02:17.060> HDMI<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.019> one<00:02:18.590> VGA<00:02:19.010> input<00:02:19.280> 1<00:02:20.120> input<00:02:20.390> more

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
one HDMI and one VGA input 1 input more

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.690 
one HDMI and one VGA input 1 input more
now<00:02:21.470> let's<00:02:21.769> take<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:21.980> look<00:02:22.129> at<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.430> image

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
now let's take a look at the image

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.000 
now let's take a look at the image
quality<00:02:22.879> in<00:02:23.330> terms<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:24.080> backlight<00:02:24.590> bleeding

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
quality in terms of backlight bleeding

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.130 
quality in terms of backlight bleeding
it's<00:02:25.220> pretty<00:02:25.670> much<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:25.940> tie<00:02:26.360> but<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:27.019> is

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
it's pretty much a tie but this is

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.990 
it's pretty much a tie but this is
always<00:02:27.349> depending<00:02:27.890> on<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.099> specific<00:02:28.550> model

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
always depending on the specific model

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.570 
always depending on the specific model
each<00:02:29.360> monitor<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.200> different<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:31.040> cheap<00:02:31.310> one

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
each monitor is different the cheap one

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.210 
each monitor is different the cheap one
shows<00:02:31.849> some<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.330> famous<00:02:32.780> IPS<00:02:33.500> glue<00:02:33.830> the

shows some of that famous IPS glue the
expensive<00:02:34.760> one<00:02:34.970> shows<00:02:35.239> very<00:02:35.569> little<00:02:35.959> of<00:02:36.080> it

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
expensive one shows very little of it

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
a good example for the sharpness as well

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.390 
a good example for the sharpness as well
the<00:03:17.269> cheaper<00:03:17.660> monitor<00:03:18.019> isn't<00:03:18.260> as<00:03:18.500> sharp<00:03:18.739> the

the cheaper monitor isn't as sharp the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
the response time is a bit worse on the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.500 
the response time is a bit worse on the
cheaper<00:03:28.560> one<00:03:28.740> therefore<00:03:29.610> less<00:03:29.849> ghosting<00:03:30.420> on

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
the expensive one both monitors pretty

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.430 
the expensive one both monitors pretty
much<00:03:32.849> offer<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.390> same<00:03:33.599> brightness<00:03:33.959> level

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
much offer the same brightness level

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.979 
much offer the same brightness level
however<00:03:34.739> at<00:03:35.130> brightness<00:03:35.580> 45<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.599> cheaper

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
however at brightness 45 the cheaper

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.350 
however at brightness 45 the cheaper
monitor<00:03:37.349> consumes<00:03:37.800> about<00:03:37.920> 17<00:03:38.550> watts<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360

expensive<00:03:39.959> one<00:03:40.140> 11<00:03:40.709> watts<00:03:40.860> now<00:03:41.550> let's<00:03:41.790> take<00:03:41.970> a

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
expensive one 11 watts now let's take a

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.960 
expensive one 11 watts now let's take a
look<00:03:42.209> at<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.450> OSD<00:03:42.959> menus<00:03:43.350> both<00:03:43.830> OSD<00:03:44.370> menus<00:03:44.760> are

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
look at the OSD menus both OSD menus are

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.970 
look at the OSD menus both OSD menus are
good<00:03:45.270> however<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.989> cheaper<00:03:46.410> monitor<00:03:46.770> does

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
good however the cheaper monitor does

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.800 
good however the cheaper monitor does
not<00:03:47.160> offer<00:03:47.250> as<00:03:47.430> many<00:03:47.580> customization<00:03:48.360> options

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
not offer as many customization options

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.050 
not offer as many customization options

and settings as the expensive one and

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.180

same<00:03:51.600> goes<00:03:51.870> for<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.140> special<00:03:52.590> power<00:03:52.800> saving

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
same goes for the special power saving

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.520 
same goes for the special power saving
features<00:03:53.550> well<00:03:54.090> there<00:03:54.600> certainly<00:03:54.870> are<00:03:55.290> many

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
features well there certainly are many

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.170 
features well there certainly are many
reasons<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.099> spend<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.519> little<00:03:56.640> more<00:03:56.880> money<00:03:56.940> on

reasons to spend a little more money on

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.240 
reasons to spend a little more money on
the<00:03:57.420> expensive<00:03:57.959> one<00:03:58.140> however<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:58.890> terms<00:03:59.040> of
