son to Blackburn and I've experienced
Blackburn<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.090> very

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
Blackburn and a very

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.309 
Blackburn and a very
special<00:02:20.319> time<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.220> heat<00:02:21.370> wave<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.569> I've

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
special time with the heat wave so I've

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.400 
special time with the heat wave so I've
seen<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.800> think<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.400> best<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.260> think

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
seen it I think it's best so I think

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.199 
seen it I think it's best so I think
that<00:02:26.800> it's<00:02:26.950> nice<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.340> reflect<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:27.910> you

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
that it's nice to reflect that in you

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:41.410 
that it's nice to reflect that in you
and<00:02:29.069> here<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.160> is

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.480 

you
