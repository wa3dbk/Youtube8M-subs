00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.840 
what gives it its rigidity and in hopes
that<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.560> skin<00:04:42.860> together<00:04:43.190> tight<00:04:43.460> but<00:04:43.820> you

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
that that skin together tight but you

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.580 
that that skin together tight but you
want<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.090> start<00:04:44.330> from<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.660> tail<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.260> you

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
want to start from the tail and you

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.210 
want to start from the tail and you
basically<00:04:45.830> turn<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.430> knife<00:04:46.580> at<00:04:46.820> about<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:48.220> 35

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
basically turn the knife at about a 35

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.840 
basically turn the knife at about a 35
to<00:04:49.580> 40<00:04:49.940> degree<00:04:50.210> angle<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:51.310> as<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.430> wish<00:04:52.699> you

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
to 40 degree angle and as you wish you

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.310 
to 40 degree angle and as you wish you
push<00:04:53.120> down<00:04:53.150> into<00:04:53.570> it<00:04:53.690> you'll<00:04:53.810> see<00:04:54.080> when<00:04:54.229> you

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
push down into it you'll see when you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.960 
push down into it you'll see when you
hit<00:04:54.560> you'll<00:04:54.860> feel<00:04:55.070> when<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.310> hit<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.550> skin<00:04:55.820> if

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
hit you'll feel when you hit the skin if

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.000 
hit you'll feel when you hit the skin if
you<00:04:56.060> look<00:04:56.330> right<00:04:56.510> here<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:57.260> can<00:04:57.410> see<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.710> skin

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
you look right here you can see the skin

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.070 
you look right here you can see the skin
and<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.280> meat<00:04:58.430> separated<00:04:59.120> basically<00:04:59.870> do<00:04:59.960> you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
and the meat separated basically do you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080 
and the meat separated basically do you
just<00:05:00.229> grab<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.440> good<00:05:00.710> hold<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.490> skin<00:05:01.820> and

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
just grab a good hold of the skin and

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.080 
just grab a good hold of the skin and
turn<00:05:02.660> your<00:05:02.930> blade<00:05:03.199> at<00:05:03.830> just<00:05:04.190> a<00:05:04.280> slight<00:05:04.760> angle

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090

just<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.930> slight<00:05:06.289> angle<00:05:06.650> just<00:05:06.800> enough<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.580> to

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
just a slight angle just enough to to

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.210 
just a slight angle just enough to to
get<00:05:08.210> between<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.630> meat<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.050> bone<00:05:09.320> I'm

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
get between the meat and the bone I'm

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.189 
get between the meat and the bone I'm
going<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.430> meeting<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.760> skin<00:05:11.030> and<00:05:11.690> then<00:05:12.050> just

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
going to meeting the skin and then just

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.740 
going to meeting the skin and then just
start<00:05:12.410> sliding<00:05:12.979> it<00:05:13.310> back<00:05:13.639> and<00:05:13.880> forth<00:05:14.120> gently

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
start sliding it back and forth gently

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.570 
start sliding it back and forth gently
keep<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.530> in<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:15.650> keeping<00:05:16.039> that<00:05:16.099> angle<00:05:16.490> the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
keep it in that keeping that angle the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.360 
keep it in that keeping that angle the
same<00:05:16.930> and<00:05:17.930> what<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.169> end<00:05:18.289> up<00:05:18.410> with<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:19.250> a
