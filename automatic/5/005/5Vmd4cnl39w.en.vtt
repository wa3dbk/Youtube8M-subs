00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:11.167
 The toy heli FS-IRH100 bought on Amazon One day it suddenly broke down 

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:17.167
 At first take off the cowl 

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:23.167
 Because screw is small, precision driver is necessary 

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:29.234
 Caul has a total of four screws on the right side and two screws on the left side 

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:45.567
 Then remove the cowl 

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:51.567
 Slowly because there is an LED below the nose ... 

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:07.634
 I will remove the side panel so it will come off 

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:13.901
 5 screws on the side panel 

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:38.734
 Be careful not to lose it because the screw is small 

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:55.234
 The fifth is the tail stay together 

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:11.734
 Remove the side panel 

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:17.801
 Do you understand? The large white gear in the center turns the first and second stages of the main propeller 

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:25.367
 The small gear seen before and after that is the gear of the motor that turns each propeller 

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:45.301
 This time, the gear of this motor did not engage with the gear that turns up and turns the propeller 

00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:53.034
