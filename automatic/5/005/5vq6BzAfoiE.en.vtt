00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.940
 so hello next next episode of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.830
 Five-finger minecraft you do not yet 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.030
 knew, now comes again and again 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.949
 Wednesdays I think I'm war too 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.210
 again weekly so the whole thing 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.920
 is as of your submissions as always 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.600
 so far so who has ideas like 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.250
 Send in the sense of a comment 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.320
 under this video because the mailbox 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.340
 moment is total nonsense and see there 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.970
 The easiest way is best 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.400
 sort out 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.539
 then I would say it starts already 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 and big to talk about 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.390
 few you had treasure in the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.120
 comments and off you go and the first 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.559
 thing today is mystic case 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.719
 signs the changes revenge spurs 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 also peaceful mode though it's her 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.680
 actually how should I say that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.170
 Endboss is a way to express that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.660
 Try out the options and once 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.800
 set peace and then do it 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.860
 I just now the following 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.570
 collect command with if it is important 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.899
 then you can summon quite a few 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.899
 and then I had to choose correctly 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.650
 Endres front actually peace conflicts 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.430
 and just stays put here or 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.320
 Here is permanent here I must go 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.930
 quite good with the fist stick comes 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.590
 just hide my effect 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.390
 with 240 behind 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.149
 then I can not with the fist beat 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.770
 and you destroy the world like it 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:33.429
 already another dragon done before 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.409
 has bad evil dragon yes well there you go 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.390
 always experience the portal you always 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.319
 I would then bring the same height 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.469
 say more the next thing is from 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.880
 de strong 933 or the star can be under 3 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.009
 if it rains you can also join 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.390
 day in bed put on this factor 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.039
 I take myself before some 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.349
 time the question had asked galaxy 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.729
 even if he did come exactly the day 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.259
 oscillates when it rains or so then 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.000
 It just goes away when it does 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.200
 normally it rains very briefly with rain 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 you can not sleep because of that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.549
 come or the thing is not quite correct 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.239
 You can sleep at night though 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.970
 if it is a thunderstorm so investigator 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.489
 and it flashes to stormy weather when it does 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.769
 really storms then you can also on 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.980
 interestingly enough that day 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.510
 next is from tank teller tank tv and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.060
 He writes but you have to know 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.680
 hell go now 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 you can if a gas the portal 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.180
 shoot out without a lighter 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.310
 In doing so , light the portal again 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.239
 Taken here now by the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.530
 portal is excluded 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.359
 There is no style of flinging 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.450
 nothing could still do me anyway 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:47.660
 the resources in the elfer you the portal 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.959
 re-ignite you can 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.269
 make such celebration charges and to 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.470
 again worth of dust and rewarding as 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.870
 coal from britta skeletons and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.579
 get black powder from gas and then get it 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.230
 we the celebration of chargers in the order 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.169
 can shoot if you are fed up but pen 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.480
 They work even if you put them in 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.500
 keep hand vehicle I have to 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.209
 honestly not now 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.680
 probably long games I have 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.389
 this left force in doubt but it 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.709
 You can do simple things like that 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.639
 front shows benefits in the portal again 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.650
 turn on awesome and the next s of 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.989
 braingame hde and heat interesting 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.549
 sound bug at filing and repeater 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.160
 namely when you create a bell 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.980
 write there then you can with arrows 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.750
 Close on the Jupiter and the arrows 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.900
 then bake the whole drum so to speak 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.920
 give another arrow impact 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.030
 noise 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.580
 Why do not you try the whole thing sometimes? 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:44.270
 assures then it will also hear at the 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:45.830
 Sounds also the part however and 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.340
 then I made it clear it shoots 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.780
 You can stop it as remember 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.300
 they do not fall and fall and fall 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.569
 do not fall 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.220
 that's so funny oh yes it works 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.040
 I can continue that forever 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.650
 collect as at the moment the fall 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.489
 arrows are but only want a degrading 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.569
 and it can be quiet again 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:16.190
 Okay collect and the last one today 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.590
 is from ul 20010 25 15 or whatever 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.510
 maybe short maybe other number 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.760
 The following was a little knowledge fax 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.460
 I had not strapped like that yet 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.320
 until now and although there is a secret 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.830
 texture did not make it into the game 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.110
 this texture is called ruby dot png 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.510
 and you can find it just when you are 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.220
 minecraft folder goes into versions then 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.770
 open again with winrar or 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.900
 Target what you unopened then it goes 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.570
 minecraft textures and items of water 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.130
 scroll down there then gives it since it has 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.390
 nothing to do with the gameplay 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.950
 but still interesting in any case 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.870
 that means maybe once was 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.220
 someday planned a ruby blog 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.450
 but somebody introduce that 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.800
 apparently made it into the game 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.880
 whoever founds who is the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.470
 know or have an idea why 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.660
 why not write a comment but 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.669
 sometimes good to know that not always 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.740
 everything you saw was planned 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.630
 that means that people really are 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.740
 more thoughts make a lot of testing 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.530
 and the best things with pure 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.450
 quotation marks also a bit 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.580
 discard or reject ideas 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.720
 that are just not good so that is 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.800
 it will never be thought about again 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.690
 what is introduced to the game because 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.160
 Apparently that's how it would be 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.140
 been happy how many of the parts 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.810
 did you know that was coming ? 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.729
 the not many, then would 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.180
 Let me say it until next time 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.180
 followed 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.970
 there
