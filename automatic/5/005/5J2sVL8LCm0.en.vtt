specifically a lot of intro to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
specifically a lot of intro to
development<00:00:33.090> specifically<00:00:33.600> Android

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
development specifically Android

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.540 
development specifically Android
development<00:00:34.559> topics<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> the

development topics and one of the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
development topics and one of the
easiest<00:00:35.850> ways<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.360> develop<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:36.930> Android<00:00:37.050> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
easiest ways to develop for Android is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.799 
easiest ways to develop for Android is
to<00:00:37.649> use<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> Linux<00:00:38.399> platform<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.300> free<00:00:39.600> it's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to use the Linux platform it's free it's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.479 
to use the Linux platform it's free it's
open<00:00:39.930> source<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.530> relatively<00:00:40.980> easy<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
open source and it's relatively easy to

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.250 
open source and it's relatively easy to
use<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.270> been<00:00:42.390> asked<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> show<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
use so I have been asked to show you a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.750 
use so I have been asked to show you a
few<00:00:43.590> things<00:00:43.770> about<00:00:43.980> using<00:00:44.460> Linux

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
few things about using Linux

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
few things about using Linux
specifically<00:00:45.390> using<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> Linux<00:00:46.110> terminal

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
specifically using the Linux terminal

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.440 
specifically using the Linux terminal
just<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.219> eased<00:00:47.460> into<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.210> just

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
just to get you eased into it and just

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.760 
just to get you eased into it and just
so<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:48.629> waste<00:00:48.899> any<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.200> time<00:00:49.379> let's<00:00:49.649> go

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so we don't waste any more time let's go

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010 
so we don't waste any more time let's go
ahead<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.160> started<00:00:50.510> already<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.809> today

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
ahead and get started already so today

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.270 
ahead and get started already so today
we're<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.410> taking<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> look<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.010> some

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
we're going to be taking a look at some

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.790 
we're going to be taking a look at some
relatively<00:00:54.030> basic<00:00:54.449> commands<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.469> Linux

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
relatively basic commands here in Linux

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
relatively basic commands here in Linux
just<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> started<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.329> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
just to get you started and get you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.599 
just to get you started and get you
familiarized<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.590> terminal<00:00:59.039> I'm<00:00:59.309> going

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
familiarized with the terminal I'm going

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.950 
familiarized with the terminal I'm going
to<00:00:59.699> assume<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.270> figure<00:01:00.420> out<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to assume that you can figure out how to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
to assume that you can figure out how to
get<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> copy<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.680> Linux<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.280> system<00:01:02.670> via<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
get a copy of Linux on your system via a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
get a copy of Linux on your system via a
live<00:01:03.390> CD<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.110> actually<00:01:04.619> having<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> installed

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
live CD or actually having it installed

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.890 
live CD or actually having it installed
on<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.549> system<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.210> once<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.720> in

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
on your system and once you do in

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.450 
on your system and once you do in
whatever<00:01:07.080> environment<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.710> happen<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.310> in

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
whatever environment you happen to be in

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.429 
whatever environment you happen to be in
open<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.880> terminal<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.810> case<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
open a terminal in my case I'm in a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.870 
open a terminal in my case I'm in a
balloon<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.770> using<00:01:11.159> unity<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
balloon to using unity so I'm going to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
balloon to using unity so I'm going to
go<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> dash<00:01:12.510> type<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.140> terminal<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
go into the dash type in terminal and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460 
go into the dash type in terminal and
then<00:01:14.310> open<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.760> my<00:01:14.970> terminal<00:01:15.229> now<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.380> is

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
then open up my terminal now this is

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.539 
then open up my terminal now this is
gonna<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:16.830> difficult<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
gonna be a little difficult for you to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.770 
gonna be a little difficult for you to
see<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.000> I'm<00:01:18.060> gonna<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.299> ahead<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.450> change<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
see so I'm gonna go ahead and change it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
see so I'm gonna go ahead and change it
over<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> profile<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> created<00:01:20.430> that's<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
over to a profile I created that's a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.530 
over to a profile I created that's a
little<00:01:20.880> larger

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
little larger

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.910 
little larger
now<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> first<00:01:22.140> command<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.560> gonna<00:01:22.680> show<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
now the first command I'm gonna show you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.249 
now the first command I'm gonna show you
here<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.369> LS<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.420> basically<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.960> does

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
here is LS and basically what that does

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.780 
here is LS and basically what that does
it<00:01:25.500> lists<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> contents<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> directory

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it lists the contents of the directory

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359

arguments for the LS command and for
every<00:02:15.660> other<00:02:15.690> command<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.500> think<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.860> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
every other command you can think of so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.100 
every other command you can think of so
that<00:02:17.550> leads<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.940> another<00:02:18.210> excellent<00:02:18.690> command

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that leads to another excellent command

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.020 
that leads to another excellent command
to<00:02:19.260> show<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.430> man<00:02:20.730> command

to show you and that is the man command

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.970 
to show you and that is the man command
so<00:02:21.630> we'll<00:02:21.780> go<00:02:21.870> ahead<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.020> type<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.410> man<00:02:22.710> and

will<00:05:51.789> have<00:05:51.969> Python<00:05:52.240> two<00:05:52.630> point<00:05:52.930> five<00:05:53.080> point

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
will have Python two point five point

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.589 
will have Python two point five point
six<00:05:53.590> downloaded<00:05:54.370> of<00:05:55.000> course<00:05:55.270> there<00:05:55.449> are<00:05:55.569> a

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
six downloaded of course there are a

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.689 
six downloaded of course there are a
bevy<00:05:56.380> of<00:05:56.409> other<00:05:56.590> switches<00:05:56.979> you<00:05:57.219> could<00:05:57.370> add<00:05:57.520> on

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
bevy of other switches you could add on

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.010 
bevy of other switches you could add on
top<00:05:57.880> of<00:05:57.940> this<00:05:58.150> there's<00:05:58.419> one<00:05:58.659> that<00:05:58.810> will<00:05:58.900> allow

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
top of this there's one that will allow

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.140 
top of this there's one that will allow
auto<00:05:59.440> resuming<00:05:59.919> of<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.280> file<00:06:00.520> if<00:06:00.759> something

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
auto resuming of the file if something

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.999 
auto resuming of the file if something
goes<00:06:01.300> wrong<00:06:01.419> but<00:06:02.080> for<00:06:02.289> now<00:06:02.409> just<00:06:02.440> double<00:06:02.919> you

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
goes wrong but for now just double you

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.279 
goes wrong but for now just double you
get<00:06:03.219> and<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.729> file<00:06:04.000> name<00:06:04.240> with<00:06:04.479> the<00:06:04.599> full<00:06:04.780> URL

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
get and the file name with the full URL

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.629 
get and the file name with the full URL
we'll<00:06:05.590> go<00:06:05.710> ahead<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:05.949> pull<00:06:06.069> that<00:06:06.219> down<00:06:06.400> for

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
we'll go ahead and pull that down for

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.159 
we'll go ahead and pull that down for
you<00:06:06.789> and<00:06:06.969> actually<00:06:07.509> now<00:06:07.630> that<00:06:07.750> we've<00:06:07.870> got<00:06:08.020> that

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
you and actually now that we've got that

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.899 
you and actually now that we've got that
downloaded<00:06:08.590> we<00:06:08.740> should<00:06:08.949> be<00:06:09.099> able<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.400> extract

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
downloaded we should be able to extract

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.149 
downloaded we should be able to extract
it<00:06:10.120> by<00:06:10.270> using<00:06:10.479> the<00:06:10.690> tar<00:06:10.930> command<00:06:11.139> to<00:06:11.740> extract

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
it by using the tar command to extract

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:17.070 
it by using the tar command to extract
it<00:06:12.280> it's<00:06:12.430> as<00:06:12.550> easy<00:06:12.580> as<00:06:12.849> typing<00:06:13.120> tar<00:06:13.719> -<00:06:14.620> X<00:06:15.370> v<00:06:16.120> ZF

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
it it's as easy as typing tar - X v ZF

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.779 
it it's as easy as typing tar - X v ZF
and<00:06:17.409> then<00:06:17.830> the<00:06:18.069> file<00:06:18.370> name<00:06:18.550> that<00:06:18.580> you've

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
and then the file name that you've

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.490 
and then the file name that you've
downloaded<00:06:18.969> so<00:06:19.509> in<00:06:19.659> this<00:06:19.719> case<00:06:19.930> it's<00:06:20.080> Python

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
downloaded so in this case it's Python

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.439 
downloaded so in this case it's Python
I'm<00:06:20.740> just<00:06:20.889> gonna<00:06:20.979> type<00:06:21.219> a<00:06:21.310> P<00:06:21.550> hit<00:06:22.090> the<00:06:22.210> tab<00:06:22.419> key

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
I'm just gonna type a P hit the tab key

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.559 
I'm just gonna type a P hit the tab key
and<00:06:22.810> let<00:06:22.900> it<00:06:23.020> autocomplete<00:06:24.210> there<00:06:25.210> you<00:06:25.360> go<00:06:25.539> a

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
and let it autocomplete there you go a

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.180 
and let it autocomplete there you go a
few<00:06:25.930> seconds<00:06:26.259> later<00:06:26.409> it's<00:06:26.740> gone<00:06:26.919> ahead<00:06:27.039> and

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
few seconds later it's gone ahead and

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.830 
few seconds later it's gone ahead and
done<00:06:27.490> all<00:06:27.729> of<00:06:27.759> this<00:06:27.969> stuff<00:06:28.180> that<00:06:28.419> looks<00:06:28.599> like

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
done all of this stuff that looks like

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.870 
done all of this stuff that looks like
gibberish<00:06:29.110> to<00:06:29.380> a<00:06:29.560> lot<00:06:29.830> of<00:06:29.949> people<00:06:30.190> however

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
gibberish to a lot of people however

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.629 
gibberish to a lot of people however
what<00:06:31.120> that<00:06:31.270> did<00:06:31.479> if<00:06:31.780> you<00:06:31.930> type<00:06:32.229> LS<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:33.490> see

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
what that did if you type LS you see

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.329 
what that did if you type LS you see
here<00:06:33.819> we've<00:06:33.909> got<00:06:33.940> our<00:06:34.120> Python<00:06:34.860> tgz<00:06:35.860> file<00:06:36.070> that

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:36.339 
here we've got our Python tgz file that

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.670 
here we've got our Python tgz file that
we<00:06:36.430> downloaded<00:06:36.570> we've<00:06:37.570> also<00:06:37.719> got<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.080> directory

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
we downloaded we've also got a directory

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.959 
we downloaded we've also got a directory
that<00:06:38.830> was<00:06:38.949> created<00:06:39.400> when

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
that was created when

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:42.719 
that was created when
and<00:06:40.179> the<00:06:40.299> tar<00:06:40.509> command<00:06:40.689> on<00:06:41.019> it<00:06:41.049> if<00:06:41.799> I<00:06:41.979> type<00:06:42.189> CD

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
and the tar command on it if I type CD

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.749 
and the tar command on it if I type CD
to<00:06:43.029> change<00:06:43.269> directory<00:06:43.779> and<00:06:43.989> then<00:06:44.229> P<00:06:44.579> and<00:06:45.579> hit

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
to change directory and then P and hit

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.129 
to change directory and then P and hit
tab<00:06:45.969> it's<00:06:46.329> gonna<00:06:46.449> go<00:06:46.629> ahead<00:06:46.689> and<00:06:46.809> autocomplete

tab it's gonna go ahead and autocomplete
to<00:06:47.529> the<00:06:47.619> first<00:06:47.829> one<00:06:48.039> it<00:06:48.159> finds<00:06:48.399> which<00:06:48.759> is<00:06:48.969> the

to the first one it finds which is the

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:52.019 
to the first one it finds which is the
directory<00:06:49.599> we<00:06:49.779> want<00:06:50.049> hit<00:06:50.919> enter<00:06:51.279> we're<00:06:51.669> now<00:06:51.789> in

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:52.029 
directory we want hit enter we're now in

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.259 
directory we want hit enter we're now in
the<00:06:52.149> Python<00:06:52.360> 256<00:06:53.259> directory<00:06:53.799> wonderful<00:06:54.579> type

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:55.269 
the Python 256 directory wonderful type

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:58.049 
the Python 256 directory wonderful type
LS<00:06:55.629> again<00:06:55.659> and<00:06:56.469> you<00:06:56.829> see<00:06:57.009> there<00:06:57.249> that's<00:06:57.909> the

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:58.059 
LS again and you see there that's the

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:00.329 
LS again and you see there that's the
entire<00:06:58.329> contents<00:06:58.839> of<00:06:58.869> the<00:06:59.019> Python<00:06:59.860> two<00:07:00.069> point

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:00.339 
entire contents of the Python two point

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.579 
entire contents of the Python two point
five<00:07:00.459> point<00:07:00.699> six<00:07:00.909> directory<00:07:01.449> and<00:07:01.659> this<00:07:02.469> is

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:02.589 
five point six directory and this is

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.049 
five point six directory and this is
actually<00:07:02.919> where<00:07:03.039> I'm<00:07:03.159> going<00:07:03.399> to<00:07:03.519> stop<00:07:03.759> things

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:04.059 
actually where I'm going to stop things

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:05.249 
actually where I'm going to stop things
because<00:07:04.419> this<00:07:04.539> is<00:07:04.689> where<00:07:04.839> it<00:07:04.899> gets<00:07:05.049> a<00:07:05.110> little

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:05.259 
because this is where it gets a little

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.079 
because this is where it gets a little
bit<00:07:05.439> more<00:07:05.589> involved<00:07:06.159> if<00:07:06.339> you<00:07:06.669> want<00:07:06.879> to<00:07:06.969> see

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:07.089 
bit more involved if you want to see

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:08.819 
bit more involved if you want to see
more<00:07:07.299> complicated<00:07:08.229> more<00:07:08.409> involved

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:08.829 
more complicated more involved

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:11.219 
more complicated more involved
development<00:07:09.429> type<00:07:09.579> stuff<00:07:09.909> the<00:07:10.779> next<00:07:11.019> part<00:07:11.199> of

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:11.229 
development type stuff the next part of

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.659 
development type stuff the next part of
this<00:07:11.349> isn't<00:07:11.649> terribly<00:07:11.979> complicated<00:07:12.279> it's

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
this isn't terribly complicated it's

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.819 
this isn't terribly complicated it's
just<00:07:12.759> installing<00:07:13.569> Python<00:07:14.169> on<00:07:14.259> your<00:07:14.439> system

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:14.829 
just installing Python on your system

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:16.679 
just installing Python on your system
but<00:07:15.369> you<00:07:15.489> have<00:07:15.639> to<00:07:15.849> install<00:07:16.329> some

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:16.689 
but you have to install some

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.139 
but you have to install some
prerequisite<00:07:17.499> software<00:07:17.889> before<00:07:18.039> that<00:07:18.369> anyway

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:19.149 
prerequisite software before that anyway

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:20.369 
prerequisite software before that anyway
I've<00:07:19.329> gone<00:07:19.479> on<00:07:19.539> for<00:07:19.809> a<00:07:19.839> lot<00:07:19.989> longer<00:07:20.110> than<00:07:20.259> I

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:20.379 
I've gone on for a lot longer than I

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:22.019 
I've gone on for a lot longer than I
