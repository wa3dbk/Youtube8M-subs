00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.130
 what a fan of andrew but the 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.840
 daily the language bring back a 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.889
 I play a video game 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.920
 it's about dragon ball I hope it's your 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.920
 liking 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.969
 in the game is the only one 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.460
 difficulty of the good game you can not 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.640
 and difficult because he does not have but the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.470
 I play well and in Japanese I hope it's not a 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.960
 obstacle for you to be able to 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.290
 play or try it the player does not weigh 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.290
 much 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 I'll leave it link in the description 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.500
 of the installation procedure is that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.829
 you proceed try to install it 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.750
 without wifi although there is because it is going to 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.480
 detect that you have to download data already 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.059
 they do not need anything ok so they carry that 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.910
 procedure and there is no 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.920
 inconvenient with the game that I'm going to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.920
 show what the game is about 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.470
 and here is 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.700
 I was playing 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:16.340
 I'm getting there that is being difficult 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.340
 We go to a quick sample sample 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.880
 those who are just entering my 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.880

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.470

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:43.080
 And for what 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.070
 saying that I just 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.150
 and 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.370
 Any doubt I comment 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.370
 they do know on channel just answer 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.950

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.189
 ah 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.189
 but each position 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.570
 ah 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.079

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.160

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.860
 the future 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.620
 true 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.520
 one 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.410
 I can not say it 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.920

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.290
 but if we go 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.310
 but half 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.320
 so 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.930

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:11.200
