00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.920
 did you know that consuming foods like 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.950
 sugar salt sweetener and bread could 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.660
 to put it older like this is because according to a 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.039
 study conducted by the newspaper of 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.930
 hub then post 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.970
 you have to erase from your diet a series of 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.970
 food if you want to look younger 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.760
 I took pencil and paper by who tomorrow 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.760
 We are listed from 1 to almost no 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.260
 the call comes still 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.050
 that sugar is one of the foods 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.510
 that we use daily and that its excess 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 came out the collagen making the skin 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.399
 it looks rigid and therefore with wrinkles 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.769
 there is no food that does not have salt and this 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.109
 can be very harmful to health and 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.260
 that its excess damages the kidney produces 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.490
 hypertension and eye because also 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.980
 deteriorates the bones 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.020
 also be careful with children already 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.450
 that they like a lot of goodies 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.820
 and soft drinks 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.340
 the first ones produce inflammation of the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.180
 body while the latter tend 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.180
 to dehydrate 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.850
 the rather more complex problem that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.400
 that's because the fact that a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.050
 present today eat at any time 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.510
 anywhere and at any time 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.090
 has to be available something has a 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.070
 body that can be eaten 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.590
 as a consequence of what we are going to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.750
 eating is a super elaborate product not 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.180
 it is food prepared at home the food 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.070
 prepared at home in general has a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.160
 amount of salt and a quantity of sugar 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.320
 which is rather small since one does not 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.420
 like if you miss too much and instead 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.170
 in the processed products can have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.750
 large quantities and does not realize 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.270
 the breakfast time or the eleven you like 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.640
 have a cup of coffee with bread 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.979
 because the consumption of carbohydrates as 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.440
 those who have the bread damage the collagen and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.750
 the fibers of the skin while the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.350
 coffee dehydrates and gives a look 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.350
 fatigue 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.450
 I want to make sweet before they are something very 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.790
 healthy look that the study done by 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.400
 the newspaper also showed that some 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.800
 Sweeteners like aspartame are associated 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.050
 headache and joint the 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.170
 that can generate anxiety to consume 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.710
 sweets in the case of sugar every time 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.020
 that one does not eat sugar is absorbed and 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.030
 absorbed as glucose then if you 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.070
 you sharply raise the amount of 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.490
 glucose that one has in the blood the 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.070
 pancreas has to fit inside the 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.110
 blood in very fast form a pulse of 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.640
 insulin to make it so that it is capable 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.460
 to handle that glucose load that 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.980
 you put in then that's the best way 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.130
 of harming the pancreas in the long term 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.540
 in the case of salt you have hypertension 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.920
 diseases begin 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.050
 cardiovascular diseases and you get sick 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.270
 if you're a fast food lover 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.670
 we have a terrible news because the 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.069
 stir- fries skin and wears 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.959
 while fats clog and 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.569
 harden the arteries and shrink 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.230
 blood vessels in conclusion the skin 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.230
 she looks tired 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.490
 the spool apart from cancer and do 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.420
 sleeping little fluids that consume 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.210
 like alcohol and drinks 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.690
 energetics make you look older the 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.370
 excess alcohol causes dehydration 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.270
 redness loss of collagen e 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.430
 swelling 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.620
 so much that the energy ones give in the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.960
 tooth enamel eight times more 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.200
 that soda and yellows 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.140
 what gives an appearance of little health already 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.500
 what do you think these foods 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.610
 get old I would stop consuming them good 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.520
 with this industrialization 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.630
 everything is 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.319
 I imagine myself 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.629
 in the doors where I am healthiest 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.780
 all the old things that make me 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.569
 my mom patrolled the beans though 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.689
 that actually the foods are 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.879
 genetically engineered so that one 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.049
 let's age was faster you would leave 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.040
 of consuming these foods that 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.230
 age of the truth I believe that if I 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.629
 avoid a little bit what you hear a little 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.799
 if they are healthier, fruits will last 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.349
 vegetables 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.720
 so you know you'll have to avoid these 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.050
 food if you want to stay 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.050
 young
