rendered them out and also we created

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.340 
rendered them out and also we created
some<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.910> interesting<00:00:33.360> logical<00:00:33.989> tensed

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
this case we are going to use the my

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
this case we are going to use the my
itself<00:01:01.289> we're<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> open<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.489> visor

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
itself we're going to open that visor

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.440 
itself we're going to open that visor
and<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.589> human<00:01:05.460> eye<00:01:05.580> example<00:01:06.299> an

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and in use the human eye example an

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.920 
and in use the human eye example an
important<00:01:07.350> agreement<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.510> you<00:01:09.510> may<00:01:09.630> notice

that<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.350> gremlin<00:01:10.560> character<00:01:11.220> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that the gremlin character is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
that the gremlin character is
combination<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> geometries

bone had the parent of the asset bone

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.070 
bone had the parent of the asset bone
and<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:25.500> cannot<00:01:25.740> broken<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> owning

things<00:01:28.350> need<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.070> notice<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> Miami<00:01:30.240> in

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
things need to notice in the Miami in

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.590 
things need to notice in the Miami in
production<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.470> each<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> bone<00:01:32.970> have

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
production and each one of the bone have

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.170 
production and each one of the bone have
that<00:01:33.810> parents<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.500> also<00:01:34.890> born<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.790> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that parents have to also born if you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
that parents have to also born if you
have<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.720> character<00:01:37.290> head<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.040> this

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
have this character head just like this

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.840 
have this character head just like this
for<00:01:38.729> example<00:01:38.990> let's<00:01:39.990> ship<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> P<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.100> P

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
for example let's ship the P and the P

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.690 
for example let's ship the P and the P
and<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.390> parent<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.990> back

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
and the parent that back

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.399 
and the parent that back
this<00:01:44.700> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> things<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.600> seems<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.140> they

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
this kind of things this seems like they

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
this kind of things this seems like they
are<00:01:46.530> connected<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.340> actually<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.630> are

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
are connected but actually they are

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.249 
are connected but actually they are
broken<00:01:49.200> through<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.909> broken<00:01:51.240> by<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
broken through the the broken by the the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.480 
broken through the the broken by the the
transform<00:01:52.770> node<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.229> case<00:01:55.530> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
transform node and in this case you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.289 
transform node and in this case you
should<00:01:56.520> avoid<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
should avoid that you can use the

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.749 
should avoid that you can use the
skeleton<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.990> skeleton<00:02:01.500> they<00:02:01.670> for<00:02:02.670> example

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
skeleton the skeleton they for example

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.330 
skeleton the skeleton they for example
to<00:02:03.090> connect<00:02:03.540> joint<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.259> connect<00:02:04.710> them<00:02:04.860> back<00:02:05.180> so

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
to connect joint to connect them back so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.400 
to connect joint to connect them back so
let's<00:02:08.340> create<00:02:08.550> our<00:02:08.849> character<00:02:09.390> rig<00:02:09.569> from<00:02:10.229> this

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
let's create our character rig from this

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650 
let's create our character rig from this
bone<00:02:10.619> shapes<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.190> character<00:02:11.370> rig<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.480> any

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
bone shapes the character rig can be any

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.610 
bone shapes the character rig can be any
of<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.020> controls

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
of the controls

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
of the controls
system<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.069> here<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.360> example<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:16.140> are

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
system and here in this example we are

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.430 
system and here in this example we are
going<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.560> use<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.920> human<00:02:17.069> eye<00:02:17.340> K<00:02:18.260> Skelton<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
going to use the human eye K Skelton the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.190 
going to use the human eye K Skelton the
human<00:02:19.799> I<00:02:19.920> came<00:02:20.159> here<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:21.209> first<00:02:21.540> step<00:02:21.750> we're

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
human I came here as first step we're

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.820 
human I came here as first step we're
going<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.730> unlock<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.569> make<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> skill

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
going to unlock this and make the skill

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.960 
going to unlock this and make the skill
down<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:30.860> then<00:02:31.860> lock<00:02:32.519> them<00:02:32.700> back

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
down to the one and then lock them back

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.039 
down to the one and then lock them back
and<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> character<00:02:35.720> control<00:02:36.720> here

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
and in the character control here

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.750 
and in the character control here
created<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.040> control<00:02:38.489> system<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:40.400> think<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.579> is

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
created a control system I think this is

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.360 
created a control system I think this is
the<00:02:41.909> most<00:02:42.120> convenient<00:02:42.720> way<00:02:43.079> to<00:02:43.260> create<00:02:44.069> our

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the most convenient way to create our

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.759 
the most convenient way to create our
the<00:02:45.090> character<00:02:45.540> thence<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.170> later<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.560> can
