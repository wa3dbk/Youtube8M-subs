00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.340 

so<00:00:01.620> like<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:02.520> thought<00:00:02.929> doesn't<00:00:03.929> have<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
so like I thought doesn't have the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.950 
so like I thought doesn't have the
little<00:00:04.589> job'<00:00:04.890> in<00:00:05.130> there<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:06.120> I'm<00:00:06.569> gonna<00:00:06.690> have

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
little job' in there so I'm gonna have

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.980 
little job' in there so I'm gonna have
to<00:00:07.160> figure<00:00:08.160> out<00:00:08.189> how<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.610> comes<00:00:08.880> off<00:00:09.120> oh<00:00:09.450> this

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
to figure out how that comes off oh this

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.419 
to figure out how that comes off oh this
is<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.349> exhaust<00:00:10.710> by<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.130> way<00:00:11.480> so<00:00:13.190> if<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.219> look

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
is the exhaust by the way so if you look

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.269 
is the exhaust by the way so if you look
at<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.379> don't<00:00:16.379> know<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.800> part<00:00:17.100> is

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
at that I don't know what that part is

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.099 
at that I don't know what that part is
it's<00:00:17.580> not<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.789> catalytic<00:00:18.300> converter<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.990> it's

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it's not a catalytic converter and it's

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.040 
it's not a catalytic converter and it's
also<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.590> muffler<00:00:20.480> resonator<00:00:21.480> that's<00:00:21.869> what

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
also not a muffler resonator that's what

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050 
also not a muffler resonator that's what
a<00:00:22.080> little<00:00:22.320> optimal<00:00:22.710> call<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
a little optimal call it so the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.960 
a little optimal call it so the
resonator<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.350> flat<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.369> this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
resonator you can see is flat and this

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.830 
resonator you can see is flat and this
tip<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> need<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.330> rotate<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
tip is not so I need to rotate this and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
tip is not so I need to rotate this and
then<00:00:31.560> reinstall<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.430> need<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> make

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
then reinstall it and I need to make

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.930 
then reinstall it and I need to make
this<00:00:33.059> mount<00:00:33.450> better<00:00:34.340> it's<00:00:35.340> never<00:00:35.520> been<00:00:35.700> very

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this mount better it's never been very

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.319 
this mount better it's never been very
good<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:38.450> what<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.700> is<00:00:41.700> find<00:00:42.270> my

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
good so what I have to do is find my

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
good so what I have to do is find my
screwdriver<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:46.520> see<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:48.829> figure<00:00:49.829> out

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
screwdriver and see if I can figure out

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.430 
screwdriver and see if I can figure out
how<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.280> thing<00:00:50.520> works<00:00:52.219> have<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:54.030> type<00:00:54.270> of

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
how this thing works have a some type of

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
how this thing works have a some type of
circle<00:00:56.149> maybe<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.329> twists<00:00:59.090> you<00:01:00.090> know<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
circle maybe it twists you know the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.869 
circle maybe it twists you know the
worst<00:01:00.480> part<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.949> don't

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
worst part about this is that I don't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:15.460 
worst part about this is that I don't
even<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.449> works

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.550 

okay<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.460> thingy<00:01:17.790> off

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
okay so I got the little thingy off

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.870 
okay so I got the little thingy off
it<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.390> let<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.159> sort<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it was a let it go it was sort of a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.520 
it was a let it go it was sort of a
thread<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.750> thread<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.950> sorts<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.630> spins<00:01:28.200> off

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
thread a thread of sorts so it spins off

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.039 
thread a thread of sorts so it spins off
like<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.189> thing

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
like this and then this little thing

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.880 
like this and then this little thing
apparently<00:01:34.049> has<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> gasket<00:01:34.710> that's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
apparently has a gasket that's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.100 
apparently has a gasket that's
completely<00:01:35.250> gone<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.759> believe<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:36.810> has

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
completely gone I believe it also has

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.429 
completely gone I believe it also has
another<00:01:37.350> wire<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:40.110> should

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
another wire right there this should

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.510 
another wire right there this should
just<00:01:40.710> kind<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.659> come<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:43.100> hopefully<00:01:44.100> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
just kind of come out hopefully this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.620 
just kind of come out hopefully this
thing<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.970> meant<00:01:47.180> absolutely<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> doesn't

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
thing is meant absolutely it doesn't

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.880 
thing is meant absolutely it doesn't
look<00:01:48.750> too<00:01:48.869> bad<00:01:48.899> except<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> fact<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
look too bad except for the fact that I

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.340 
look too bad except for the fact that I
thought<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.070> was<00:01:53.960> looks<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.259> was

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
thought it was looks like there was

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.219 
thought it was looks like there was
liquid<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.979> float<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:02:00.619> don't<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.799> all

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
liquid in that float so I don't know all

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.899 
liquid in that float so I don't know all
right<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.439> me

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
right to me

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.199 
right to me
um<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.150> think<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:08.520> new<00:02:09.520> oh<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.940> need<00:02:10.090> to

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
um I think this new oh I need to

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.840 
um I think this new oh I need to
remember<00:02:10.330> which<00:02:10.569> way<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.840> one<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:12.640> was

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
remember which way that one in so it was

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.790 
remember which way that one in so it was
kind<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.300> like<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:16.230> was<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.440> like<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
kind of like that and I was it like that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.940 
kind of like that and I was it like that
I<00:02:18.069> think<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.400> was<00:02:18.489> just<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.950> I'm

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
I think it was just like that so I'm

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.760 
I think it was just like that so I'm
gonna<00:02:21.130> assume<00:02:21.340> that's<00:02:21.550> positive<00:02:22.209> side

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
gonna assume that's positive side

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:37.650 
gonna assume that's positive side
towards<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.890> bottom<00:02:24.239> around<00:02:32.640> go<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.910> like<00:02:36.660> but

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
towards the bottom around go in like but

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.090 
towards the bottom around go in like but
before<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.959> put<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.560> want<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.830> see<00:02:39.010> if

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
before I put it in I want to see if

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.960 
before I put it in I want to see if
there's<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:41.910> bag<00:02:42.989> oh<00:02:44.310> cool<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.519> comes<00:02:45.670> with<00:02:45.880> new

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
there's a bag oh cool it comes with new

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.430 
there's a bag oh cool it comes with new
ring<00:02:46.239> too<00:02:46.540> awesome

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
ring too awesome

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.050 
ring too awesome
I<00:02:47.760> might<00:02:48.760> get<00:02:48.940> away<00:02:49.150> with<00:02:49.530> with<00:02:50.530> just<00:02:51.060> reusing

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
I might get away with with just reusing

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.880 
I might get away with with just reusing
this<00:02:52.300> one<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.840> seem<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.410> remember<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.769> gas

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
this one I seem to remember the gas

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.520 
this one I seem to remember the gas
gauge<00:02:54.250> working<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.780> that's<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.050> plus

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
gauge working so so that's a plus

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.220 
gauge working so so that's a plus
