 and press start server 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.480
 also here you can still customize 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.090
 Your server opens like this 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.489
 console normal console on startup 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.709
 normal server cs 1 6 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.900
 See if you have this 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.720
 connect on the server 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.569
 you and kuramoto from the archive that means 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 the server is running it is visible on the internet to 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.109
 you will be able to go friends not to 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.880
 arose further such stupid 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.829
 questions why they can not come to me 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.989
 friends and why we server is not visible in 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.030
 the internet is actually visible to us 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.310
 because I personally tested it himself in 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.200
 I can see it because I'm open 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.480
 ports you can have ports closed 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.700
 so try to open them if you 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.599
 can not go to friends 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.940
 this is not my problem also you 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.800
 Click here in the tray will be such 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.260
 file 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.970
 tracking server crash here too 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.890
 server management can do it 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.739
 stop can run 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.110
 windows with errors tab there is such 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.739
 here you can watch the errors which 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.080
 the server also provides an error log viewer 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.150
 mistakes 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.180
 everything here is nothing more to do 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.180
 from me all good luck for now
