make<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> little<00:00:20.160> easier<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.970> already

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
make it a little easier I already

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.599 
make it a little easier I already
unboxed<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> little<00:00:22.859> bit<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.160> like<00:00:23.519> I

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
unboxed it a little bit because like I

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.160 
unboxed it a little bit because like I
took<00:00:23.670> off<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.910> tape<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> side<00:00:24.960> because

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
took off the tape on the side because

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
took off the tape on the side because
it's<00:00:25.380> annoying<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.130> camera<00:00:26.400> it's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
in you put the top part in first and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.200 
in you put the top part in first and
then<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.920> go<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.400> push<00:01:18.030> down

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
then you just go like this push down

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.380 
then you just go like this push down
there<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.080> pops<00:01:19.500> right<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.799> now<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
there you go pops right in now the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
there you go pops right in now the
buttons<00:01:21.689> got<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> nice<00:01:22.320> feel<00:01:22.560> tone<00:01:22.830> feels<00:01:23.520> about

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
buttons got a nice feel tone feels about

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
buttons got a nice feel tone feels about
the<00:01:23.759> same<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.090> normal<00:01:24.299> buttons<00:01:24.750> they're

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the same as normal buttons they're

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
the same as normal buttons they're
slightly<00:01:26.009> harder<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> click<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.900> think

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
slightly harder to click but I think

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.999 
slightly harder to click but I think
you'll<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.470> used<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> them<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.920> they'll

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you'll get used to them and they'll

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.410 
you'll get used to them and they'll
probably<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.369> easier<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> click<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> more<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
probably be easier to click the more you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.340 
probably be easier to click the more you
use<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:32.729> feels<00:01:32.909> more<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:34.110> an

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
use them and it feels more like like an

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.730 
use them and it feels more like like an
xbox<00:01:34.799> remote<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> lot<00:01:37.350> easier<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
xbox remote then so it's a lot easier to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.960 
xbox remote then so it's a lot easier to
use<00:01:37.890> I'm<00:01:38.009> sure<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.460> people<00:01:38.549> aren't<00:01:38.820> used

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
use I'm sure a lot of people aren't used

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
use I'm sure a lot of people aren't used
to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> PSP<00:01:39.960> does<00:01:40.140> little<00:01:40.710> setup<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.189> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
to the PSP does little setup but this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.700 
to the PSP does little setup but this
makes<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.970> lot<00:01:42.960> easier<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.380> use<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> normal

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
makes it a lot easier to use the normal

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.819 
makes it a lot easier to use the normal
but<00:01:44.579> yeah<00:01:44.700> um<00:01:45.200> overall<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.470> thing<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.710> pretty

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
but yeah um overall this thing is pretty

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.219 
but yeah um overall this thing is pretty
cool<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.970> ditch<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.990> shows

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
cool as the to ditch it like shows

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.050 
cool as the to ditch it like shows

but I figured hey it's probably gonna
drop<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:38.860> price<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.280> then<00:04:39.670> eventually<00:04:39.940> it's

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
drop in price and then eventually it's

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.390 
drop in price and then eventually it's
gonna<00:04:40.420> be<00:04:40.600> as<00:04:40.690> cheap<00:04:40.840> as<00:04:40.930> this<00:04:41.080> one<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.500> I<00:04:42.190> only
