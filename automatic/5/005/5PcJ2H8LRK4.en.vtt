00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
they're coded into the game uh he

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.890 
they're coded into the game uh he
apparently<00:00:22.830> has<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.220> leaked<00:00:23.699> page<00:00:24.060> which<00:00:24.480> I

actually<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> coding<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> is

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
actually was in the coding but it is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.010 
actually was in the coding but it is
still<00:00:44.760> interesting<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> come<00:00:45.989> up

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
going crazy over this now think about

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.429 
going crazy over this now think about
this<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:38.060> well<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.689> thing<00:01:39.840> about<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.200> is

this is well the thing about this is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.130 
this is well the thing about this is
that<00:01:40.530> there<00:01:41.189> are<00:01:41.340> no<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.640> don't<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:42.210> any<00:01:42.479> new

that's<00:02:04.229> new<00:02:04.530> i<00:02:04.560> believe<00:02:04.950> that's<00:02:05.130> old<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.210> only

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
that's new i believe that's old the only

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.990 
that's new i believe that's old the only
ones<00:02:06.600> i<00:02:06.689> really<00:02:06.960> didn't<00:02:07.140> recognize<00:02:07.590> were<00:02:08.000> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
ones i really didn't recognize were the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.119 
ones i really didn't recognize were the
fur<00:02:09.270> coat<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.869> competitive<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.739> i<00:02:10.770> think

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
fur coat and competitive but i think

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.070 
fur coat and competitive but i think
those<00:02:11.340> are<00:02:11.370> right<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.090> currently<00:02:12.540> abilities

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.900 
this because he says the abilities are
allegedly<00:03:43.709> coated<00:03:44.130> somewhere<00:03:44.459> in<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.700> game

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
allegedly coated somewhere in the game

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.569 
allegedly coated somewhere in the game
right<00:03:45.239> now<00:03:45.440> which<00:03:46.440> means<00:03:46.709> we<00:03:46.859> can<00:03:47.010> play<00:03:47.250> that

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
right now which means we can play that

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.849 
right now which means we can play that
with<00:03:47.760> them<00:03:47.940> early<00:03:48.810> once<00:03:49.079> we<00:03:49.290> find<00:03:49.560> out<00:03:49.680> how<00:03:49.799> to

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
with them early once we find out how to

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.309 
with them early once we find out how to
extract<00:03:50.519> them<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:53.220> know<00:03:53.400> if<00:03:53.819> they<00:03:54.540> were<00:03:54.600> coded

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
extract them you know if they were coded

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.250 
extract them you know if they were coded
into<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.769> game<00:03:56.389> you<00:03:57.389> know<00:03:57.510> project<00:03:57.930> pokemon

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
into the game you know project pokemon

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.629 
into the game you know project pokemon
would<00:03:58.380> have<00:03:58.500> said<00:03:58.650> something<00:03:58.829> about<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.310> so

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
i don't i don't think this could be real

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.440 
i don't i don't think this could be real
and<00:04:02.910> unfortunately<00:04:03.829> i<00:04:05.150> mean<00:04:06.150> there's<00:04:06.329> a<00:04:06.420> lot

really interested in it but um i really
don't<00:04:21.299> know<00:04:21.599> so<00:04:21.900> we'll<00:04:22.079> have<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.320> figure<00:04:22.500> out

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
don't know so we'll have to figure out

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.409 
don't know so we'll have to figure out
you<00:04:23.099> know<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.220> lot<00:04:23.640> spread<00:04:23.909> your<00:04:24.060> pokemon<00:04:24.390> to

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
you know a lot spread your pokemon to

you know a lot spread your pokemon to
see<00:04:24.599> what<00:04:24.720> they<00:04:24.840> think<00:04:25.050> about<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.919> but<00:04:26.250> i'm

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
see what they think about this but i'm

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.620 
see what they think about this but i'm
going<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.150> think

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
going to think

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.850 
going to think
that<00:04:27.750> they're<00:04:27.900> going<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.080> say<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.470> there<00:04:28.740> is

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
that they're going to say that there is

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.830 
that they're going to say that there is
nothing<00:04:29.100> about<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:30.390> coding<00:04:30.750> if

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
nothing about this and the coding if

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
nothing about this and the coding if
there<00:04:30.990> was<00:04:31.140> they<00:04:31.290> would<00:04:31.410> have<00:04:31.530> said<00:04:31.680> something

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
there was they would have said something

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.930 
there was they would have said something
about<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.250> why<00:04:32.400> would<00:04:32.550> they<00:04:32.640> hide<00:04:32.790> this

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
about that why would they hide this

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.190 
about that why would they hide this
whenever<00:04:33.210> they<00:04:33.420> find<00:04:33.630> something<00:04:33.930> new<00:04:34.020> in<00:04:34.110> the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
whenever they find something new in the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.020 
whenever they find something new in the
coding<00:04:34.410> it's<00:04:35.370> not<00:04:35.490> like<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:35.790> know<00:04:35.880> they're

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
coding it's not like you know they're

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.760 
coding it's not like you know they're
going<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.210> get<00:04:36.300> dmca<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:37.020> y<00:04:37.110> 8<00:04:37.320> or<00:04:37.500> anything

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
going to get dmca it's y 8 or anything

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.760 
going to get dmca it's y 8 or anything
like<00:04:37.800> that<00:04:37.950> they're<00:04:38.160> going<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.340> go<00:04:39.330> ahead<00:04:39.450> and

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
like that they're going to go ahead and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.350 
like that they're going to go ahead and
exploit<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.800> no<00:04:41.100> matter<00:04:41.280> how<00:04:41.580> precious<00:04:42.240> or

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
exploit it no matter how precious or

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.470 
exploit it no matter how precious or
anything<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.750> is<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.820> again<00:04:44.820> this<00:04:45.180> will<00:04:45.330> be<00:04:45.420> in

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
anything it is so again this will be in

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.620 
anything it is so again this will be in
the<00:04:45.540> coding<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:46.080> would<00:04:46.860> be<00:04:47.070> really<00:04:47.340> odd<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:48.000> you

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
the coding a would be really odd to you

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.960 
the coding a would be really odd to you
know<00:04:48.750> see<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.620> this<00:04:49.920> just<00:04:50.160> this<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.850> have
