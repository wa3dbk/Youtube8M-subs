I really believe in this guy I called it
in<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> video<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.860> did<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.039> couple<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.340> weeks

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
in a in a video we did a couple of weeks

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.770 
in a in a video we did a couple of weeks
ago<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.670> said<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.940> Patrick<00:00:57.239> benefit<00:00:57.660> would

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
ago I said that Patrick benefit would

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.830 
ago I said that Patrick benefit would
score<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.320> excess<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.219> 16<00:01:00.120> goals<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
score in excess of 16 goals so that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.950 
score in excess of 16 goals so that
that's<00:01:01.170> 17<00:01:01.649> goals<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.789> opinion

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
that's 17 goals or more in my opinion

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
that's 17 goals or more in my opinion
and<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.589> can't<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:04.979> where<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> would

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and I really can't see where that would

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
and I really can't see where that would
go<00:01:05.519> wrong<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.060> truly<00:01:06.600> hope<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.110> time

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

interesting move I've done a bit
research<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.180> looking<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.450> Callaghan

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
research and it's looking like Callaghan

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 
research and it's looking like Callaghan
mm-hmm<00:01:28.560> could<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.310> through<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.820> had<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
mm-hmm could be going through we had a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
mm-hmm could be going through we had a
15<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> half<00:01:31.229> million<00:01:31.560> pound<00:01:31.799> beads<00:01:32.100> has

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
15 and a half million pound beads has

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.230 
15 and a half million pound beads has
been<00:01:32.509> at<00:01:33.509> least<00:01:33.570> received<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.909> yet

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
been at least received but as yet

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
been at least received but as yet
nothing's<00:01:36.600> been<00:01:36.840> nothing's<00:01:37.409> been<00:01:37.560> confirmed

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
nothing's been nothing's been confirmed

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.890 
nothing's been nothing's been confirmed
from<00:01:38.400> Napoli<00:01:38.970> mmm<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:39.780> they're

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
from Napoli mmm I think what they're

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.080 
from Napoli mmm I think what they're
trying<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.829> trying<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> start<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
trying to do is trying to start a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.130 
trying to do is trying to start a
bidding<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.540> well<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.110> think

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
bidding there well I think I think

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020 
bidding there well I think I think
Napoli<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.649> hoping<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.159> having<00:01:44.549> Arsenal

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
Napoli are hoping that having Arsenal

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
Napoli are hoping that having Arsenal
sniffing<00:01:45.329> around<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.930> Arsenal<00:01:46.290> will<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.649> in

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
sniffing around the Arsenal will go in

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.410 
sniffing around the Arsenal will go in
with<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> slightly<00:01:47.549> higher<00:01:47.790> bid<00:01:47.970> than<00:01:48.000> us<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
with a slightly higher bid than us and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
with a slightly higher bid than us and
then<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> same<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
then we would have to do the same and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.139 
then we would have to do the same and
then<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> third-party<00:01:50.700> through<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
then if the third-party through this

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.850 
then if the third-party through this
yeah<00:01:51.479> exactly<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> price<00:01:52.740> would

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
yeah exactly and then the price would

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.030 
yeah exactly and then the price would
rocket<00:01:53.280> Callaghan<00:01:54.180> obviously<00:01:54.890> wants<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
rocket Callaghan obviously wants to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.289

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the right deal for themselves and nobody

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
the right deal for themselves and nobody
can<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.399> blamed<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
can be blamed for that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
can be blamed for that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
a bit more confusion to the mix has come

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.800 
a bit more confusion to the mix has come
out<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.550> saying<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:17.000> actually<00:02:17.450> Callahan

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
out and saying that actually Callahan

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.810 
out and saying that actually Callahan
will<00:02:17.990> stay<00:02:18.290> at<00:02:18.410> Napoli<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.460> he<00:02:19.610> hasn't

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
will stay at Napoli and that he hasn't

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.820 
will stay at Napoli and that he hasn't
been<00:02:20.060> contacted<00:02:20.270> by<00:02:20.630> Chelsea<00:02:21.170> at<00:02:21.230> all<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:21.620> I

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
been contacted by Chelsea at all so I

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.170 
been contacted by Chelsea at all so I
don't<00:02:21.980> really<00:02:22.400> know<00:02:22.490> what's<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:22.670> on<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.060> May

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.120 
don't really know what's going on in May
I<00:02:23.360> think<00:02:23.720> again<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.170> agent<00:02:24.500> could<00:02:24.620> be<00:02:24.710> working

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
I think again the agent could be working

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.450 
I think again the agent could be working
the<00:02:25.700> dark<00:02:25.940> magic<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.600> just<00:02:27.500> trying<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.040> secure

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
the dark magic and just trying to secure

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.240 
the dark magic and just trying to secure
his<00:02:28.820> player<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.110> best<00:02:30.530> contract<00:02:30.920> possible

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
his player the best contract possible

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.640 
his player the best contract possible
fair<00:02:31.940> enough<00:02:32.090> but<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.900> still<00:02:33.230> it's<00:02:33.500> still

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
fair enough but it's still it's still

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.110 
fair enough but it's still it's still
