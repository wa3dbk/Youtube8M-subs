 that's actually it really has one 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.690
 very focused care 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.490

 Really a repair and care here 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.650
 a really extra care kick too 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.650
 to get 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.800
 she now has a portion of your h 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.240
 am on the palm and I find 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.670
 It does not surprise much better than me 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.810
 thought and it is totally supple what 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.430
 is there really in there now 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.440
 yes that's really exciting because that is 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.810
 a combination of natural and 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.220
 synthetic very high quality oils in 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.320
 combinations then, of course, too 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.330
 you just smelled a pavilion 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.040
 because that happens, of course, that's what 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.479
 the customer initially really perceives 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.820
 and that brings already this 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.950
 nourishing the hlz by the smell 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.760
 really good then the customer 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.440
 to be aware 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.470
 you said a combination 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.120
 natural and chemical agents 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.950
 why a combination 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.650
 That's how you can really make the most of it 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.209
 both worlds are connected by natural ones 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.440
 Oils have their synthetic advantages 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.390
 also have their advantage 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.340
 that means you can thereby the power of 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.930
 natural and synthetic ingredients 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.820
 Just connect very well and then for 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.200
 the hair structure or the hair type of 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.920
 Consumer individually 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.920
 compile 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:48.630
 peter wieder gmbh oils what we do 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.380
 instructions for use so if that 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.950
 right 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.290
 in principle it is so that you have in the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.160
 wet condition can apply as well 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.290
 as well as in the dry state it is 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.180
 is a little easier to distribute when it is 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.560
 print in the manual and 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.230
 is there such a fast as the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.660
 should apply often I get or can 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.769
 So you can have in principle by 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.600
 each wash apply 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.000
 but you can also do it in between 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.800
 Apply for the style a bit too 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 rhi are cheeky about suppleness 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.959
 to optimize again for the shine again 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.390
 to push for the curls like this one 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.190
 looks more supple and makes 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.060
 bundling more is just the optics 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.860
 will be nice again 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.900
 He really hates it very sparingly 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.819
 you should only really dosed there 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.950
 apply a small amount 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.980
 you should in principle with small 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.860
 catching up to catch that is important because 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.780
 as with other things also and always 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.310
 Again the dose is just that 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.860
 decisive is when I have too much 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.280
 my hair will eventually take over 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.049
 hard is rocky and that is in 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.269
 First and foremost a problem for customers with 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.579
 fine have the okay is not katja 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.860
 fine and beautifully curly hair 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.239
 You would not use it if you did 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.810
 Do not apply for curls 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.090
 allowed 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.890
 But what does that make you curious? 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.340
 become the thereby voluminous or 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.709
 smoother So yes see here he volume 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.180
 not indirectly, maybe you see 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.090
 Here on the page where I find the oil 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.950
 I applied a beautiful 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.299
 bundle this curl when you look at that 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.370
 Immediately the differences that shine 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.200
 Everything did wonderful 100 land but 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.200
 a very smooth texture 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.599
 that one does not have to say it 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:37.759
 but it can be washed out 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.129
 the correct it can be easily 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:44.509
 wash out after a shampooing is the 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.919
 oil away, I can not help with oil 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.879
 always a little bit also to 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.319
 To bring greasy hair is no that 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.119
 It is not like that when I mention that 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.610
 apply the right places and the 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:59.229
 I have no idea at all 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.229
 problem with a finished look 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.539
 the mixer and I wanted to know 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.499

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.349
 name google 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:16.779
 the name google comes from gustav kuhn 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.749
 Gustav google was in its thirties 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:21.300

 China was introduced and it was also very 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.909

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.139
