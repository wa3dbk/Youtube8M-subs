okay and I use you I've got another
trick<00:00:05.250> it<00:00:06.049> most<00:00:07.049> people<00:00:07.379> know<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.560> when<00:00:08.040> you

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
trick it most people know that when you

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.970 
trick it most people know that when you
inherit<00:00:09.019> helium-filled<00:00:10.019> here<00:00:10.500> I've<00:00:10.650> got<00:00:10.830> my

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
inherit helium-filled here I've got my

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.980 
inherit helium-filled here I've got my
brother<00:00:11.340> healing<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:11.940> got<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> triple<00:00:12.630> messes

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
brother healing it's got a triple messes

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
brother healing it's got a triple messes
that's<00:00:13.230> why<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.530> not<00:00:13.650> floating<00:00:13.860> oh<00:00:14.190> if<00:00:14.969> you

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
that's why it's not floating oh if you

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.750 
that's why it's not floating oh if you
mean<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.660> your<00:00:16.410> voice<00:00:16.619> goes<00:00:16.949> very<00:00:17.400> squeaky

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
mean is it your voice goes very squeaky

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.910 
mean is it your voice goes very squeaky
and<00:00:18.000> high<00:00:19.220> all<00:00:20.220> you've<00:00:20.520> walked<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:21.710> that<00:00:22.710> if

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and high all you've walked out that if

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.490 
and high all you've walked out that if
you<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.310> water<00:00:24.269> with<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> little<00:00:25.170> bit<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.320> sugar

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
you get water with a little bit of sugar

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.580 
you get water with a little bit of sugar
in<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.800> okay<00:00:27.289> now<00:00:28.910> it's<00:00:29.910> same<00:00:30.300> thing<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.960> helium

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
in it okay now it's same thing as helium

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.209 
in it okay now it's same thing as helium
but<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.250> liquid<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:34.739> holds<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
but it's a liquid and it holds the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:44.690 
but it's a liquid and it holds the
helium<00:00:35.700> much<00:00:35.969> better<00:00:37.550> things<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:38.820> come<00:00:43.700> life

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
helium much better things just come life

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.979 
helium much better things just come life
I<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.800> take<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:48.050> convenient<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.379> pinups

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
I just take this so convenient it pinups

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.729 
I just take this so convenient it pinups
now<00:00:53.090> he<00:00:54.090> live<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.780> an<00:00:54.960> S<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.559> up

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
now he live is like an S it would go up

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
now he live is like an S it would go up
get<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.760> cup<00:00:57.030> title<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> DES

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
get a cup title to DES

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:11.850 
get a cup title to DES
this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.280> there

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.490 

so<00:01:12.860> what's<00:01:13.520> healing<00:01:13.820> in<00:01:13.970> there<00:01:17.259> now<00:01:18.259> what

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
so what's healing in there now what

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.020 
so what's healing in there now what
you're<00:01:18.650> going<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:18.860> do<00:01:19.009> is<00:01:19.070> cap<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:19.700> take<00:01:19.909> your

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
you're going to do is cap you take your

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.120 
you're going to do is cap you take your
Union<00:01:20.710> it's<00:01:21.710> over<00:01:22.100> another<00:01:22.340> cup<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.790> water

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
Union it's over another cup of water

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.170 
Union it's over another cup of water
helium<00:01:25.990> as<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.200> swirl<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.710> should<00:01:28.670> sort<00:01:28.940> you

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
helium as you swirl it should sort you

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.270 
helium as you swirl it should sort you
get<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:30.050> same<00:01:30.259> tenses<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:31.299> keeps<00:01:32.299> rubbing<00:01:32.659> it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
get the same tenses it keeps rubbing it

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.730 
get the same tenses it keeps rubbing it
gets<00:01:34.280> slightly<00:01:34.610> heavier<00:01:37.030> so<00:01:38.030> now<00:01:38.500> some<00:01:39.500> of<00:01:39.530> its

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
gets slightly heavier so now some of its

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.460 
gets slightly heavier so now some of its
getting<00:01:39.979> mixed<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.880> water<00:01:41.090> now<00:01:42.020> just<00:01:42.320> keep

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
getting mixed in the water now just keep

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.840 
getting mixed in the water now just keep
that<00:01:42.679> there<00:01:42.890> in<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.399> minute

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that there in a minute

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.660 
that there in a minute
leave<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:46.070> I'll<00:01:46.160> tell<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.399> what<00:01:46.550> we're

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
leave that and I'll tell you what we're

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.960 
leave that and I'll tell you what we're
doing<00:01:46.820> here<00:01:47.470> absolutely<00:01:48.640> what<00:01:49.640> we're<00:01:49.820> making

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
doing here absolutely what we're making

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.669 
doing here absolutely what we're making
is<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:51.740> juice<00:01:52.610> or<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:52.970> drink<00:01:53.450> when<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.259> drink<00:01:54.500> it

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
is a juice or a drink when you drink it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.980 
is a juice or a drink when you drink it
it<00:01:54.740> acts<00:01:55.159> like<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.940> helium<00:01:56.270> gas<00:01:56.509> but<00:01:56.869> it's

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
it acts like the helium gas but it's

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.859 
it acts like the helium gas but it's
actually<00:01:57.289> liquid<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:59.000> basically<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.659> leave

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
actually liquid so basically you leave

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.190 
actually liquid so basically you leave
that<00:02:00.020> for<00:02:00.140> 30<00:02:00.380> seconds

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
that for 30 seconds

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.070 
that for 30 seconds
so<00:02:03.200> far<00:02:03.409> I've<00:02:03.470> left<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:03.830> for<00:02:04.009> about<00:02:04.130> cut<00:02:05.080> off

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
so far I've left it for about cut off

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.919 
so far I've left it for about cut off
that<00:02:06.470> it's<00:02:07.460> basically<00:02:07.940> when<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.450> drink<00:02:08.720> it

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
that it's basically when you drink it

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.479 
that it's basically when you drink it
and<00:02:09.340> come<00:02:10.340> out<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.120> speak<00:02:11.650> normalize<00:02:12.650> shower

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
and come out and speak normalize shower

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.140 
and come out and speak normalize shower
like<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> chipmunk<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.220> basically<00:02:16.549> I<00:02:16.670> can't<00:02:17.000> do

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
like a chipmunk so basically I can't do

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.850 
like a chipmunk so basically I can't do
it<00:02:17.209> without<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.720> helium<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.410> I've<00:02:18.500> used<00:02:18.530> all

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
it without the helium so I've used all

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.729 
it without the helium so I've used all
that<00:02:19.070> making<00:02:19.519> this<00:02:19.670> drink<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.500> about<00:02:21.500> now

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
that making this drink so about now

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.699 
that making this drink so about now
we're<00:02:22.280> done<00:02:22.549> take<00:02:23.510> some<00:02:23.720> he'll<00:02:23.930> take<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
we're done take some he'll take the

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.600 
we're done take some he'll take the
healing<00:02:25.010> thing<00:02:25.220> off

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
healing thing off

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.380 
healing thing off
don't<00:02:26.390> need<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.320> just<00:02:27.380> let<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.709> go

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
don't need that you can just let it go

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.030 
don't need that you can just let it go
so<00:02:29.390> that's<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.140> healing<00:02:30.530> done<00:02:31.450> now<00:02:32.450> got<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
so that's that healing done now got the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.069 
so that's that healing done now got the
drink<00:02:34.340> which<00:02:34.549> is<00:02:34.579> now<00:02:34.850> hot<00:02:35.090> helium<00:02:35.570> mix<00:02:35.870> it

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
drink which is now hot helium mix it

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.710 
drink which is now hot helium mix it
with<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.700> somewhere<00:02:37.700> now<00:02:37.850> here<00:02:38.269> comes<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.600> fun

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
with it somewhere now here comes the fun

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:48.500 
with it somewhere now here comes the fun
bit<00:02:39.310> let's<00:02:40.310> try<00:02:40.579> it<00:02:40.640> out

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.910 

basically<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:52.030> will<00:02:52.150> work<00:02:52.180> same<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.409> helium

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
basically it it will work same of helium

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.940 
basically it it will work same of helium
but<00:02:54.420> over<00:02:55.420> PI<00:02:55.689> out<00:02:55.840> with<00:02:56.049> famous<00:02:56.379> helium

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
but over PI out with famous helium

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.280 
but over PI out with famous helium
because<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.549> seems<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.909> liquid<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.659> so

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
because it seems a liquid and so
