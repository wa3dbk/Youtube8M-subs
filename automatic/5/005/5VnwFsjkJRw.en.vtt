00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that he had been at the scene it's not a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.650 
that he had been at the scene it's not a
crime<00:01:50.760> to<00:01:50.790> discover<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:53.760> most<00:01:53.880> likely<00:01:54.360> reason

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
crime to discover the most likely reason

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:04.740

reduced<00:04:01.830> up<00:04:01.980> bone<00:04:02.220> but<00:04:02.910> some<00:04:03.360> ticks<00:04:03.660> burrow

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
reduced up bone but some ticks burrow

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.690 
reduced up bone but some ticks burrow
underground<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.800> remain<00:04:05.070> there<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.490> while

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
underground and remain there for a while

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.960 
underground and remain there for a while
afterwards<00:04:06.120> mm-hmm<00:04:07.170> true<00:04:07.800> they'll<00:04:08.760> leave

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
afterwards mm-hmm true they'll leave

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.449 
afterwards mm-hmm true they'll leave
eventually<00:04:09.480> as<00:04:09.600> well<00:04:09.840> but<00:04:10.260> perhaps<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:11.220> ticks

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
eventually as well but perhaps the ticks

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:23.450 
eventually as well but perhaps the ticks
could<00:04:11.730> tell<00:04:11.910> us<00:04:12.060> something

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.370 

right<00:04:24.460> we<00:04:25.450> could<00:04:25.570> use<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.960> ticks<00:04:26.170> to

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
right we could use the ticks to

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.020 
right we could use the ticks to
determine<00:04:26.800> how<00:04:26.980> long<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.400> corpse<00:04:27.700> had<00:04:27.880> been

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
determine how long the corpse had been

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.800 
determine how long the corpse had been
there<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.850> was<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.420> time<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.660> death

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
there so was the time of death

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:44.790 
there so was the time of death
calculated<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:42.010> month<00:04:43.200> true<00:04:44.200> that<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:44.560> rather

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
calculated a month true that is rather

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.260 
calculated a month true that is rather
fast<00:04:45.160> for<00:04:45.460> a<00:04:45.490> corpse<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:46.060> have<00:04:46.150> been

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
fast for a corpse to have been

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.900 
fast for a corpse to have been
skeletonized<00:04:47.080> all<00:04:47.500> right<00:04:47.680> thank<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.640> little

that's<00:04:50.110> all<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.440> information<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:51.010> can<00:04:51.250> obtain

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
that's all the information we can obtain

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.460 
that's all the information we can obtain
from<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.910> corpse<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.450> other<00:04:52.720> articles<00:04:53.200> up<00:04:53.350> to

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
from the corpse and other articles up to

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.330 
from the corpse and other articles up to
this<00:04:53.590> point<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:55.570> dr.<00:04:55.930> King<00:04:56.080> Mishima<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:57.010> the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
this point so dr. King Mishima is the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.490 
this point so dr. King Mishima is the
cause<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.880> death<00:04:58.060> drowning<00:04:58.360> after<00:04:58.690> all<00:04:58.960> no

cause of death drowning after all no

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.050 
cause of death drowning after all no
there's<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.010> good<00:05:00.190> possibility<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.880> the

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
there's a good possibility that the

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.730 
there's a good possibility that the
cause<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.270> death<00:05:01.570> was<00:05:01.630> something<00:05:02.020> else<00:05:02.320> the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
cause of death was something else the

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.740 
cause of death was something else the
damage<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.400> skeleton<00:05:03.910> is<00:05:04.000> too<00:05:04.180> severe<00:05:04.510> for

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
damage to the skeleton is too severe for

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.450 
damage to the skeleton is too severe for
drowning<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.230> have<00:05:05.350> been<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.560> cause<00:05:05.710> her

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
drowning to have been the cause her

drowning to have been the cause her
skull<00:05:06.790> itself<00:05:07.180> was<00:05:12.840> yes<00:05:13.840> it<00:05:14.140> was<00:05:14.590> completely

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
skull itself was yes it was completely

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.430 
skull itself was yes it was completely
shattered

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.050 

even<00:05:18.440> if<00:05:18.560> animals<00:05:18.920> had<00:05:19.220> damaged<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:19.790> bones

even if animals had damaged the bones

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.270 
even if animals had damaged the bones
they<00:05:20.360> wouldn't<00:05:20.630> have<00:05:20.720> done<00:05:20.750> that<00:05:20.980> her<00:05:21.980> skull

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
they wouldn't have done that her skull

they wouldn't have done that her skull
was<00:05:22.310> shattered<00:05:22.880> by<00:05:22.910> an<00:05:23.150> extremely<00:05:23.840> strong

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.180 

there's<00:05:30.110> more<00:05:30.350> to<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.560> than<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:30.830> though

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
there's more to it than that though

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.820 
there's more to it than that though
during<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:32.000> autopsy<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.930> corpses<00:05:33.350> femurs

during the autopsy the corpses femurs

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:42.400 
during the autopsy the corpses femurs
were<00:05:39.460> right<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:41.300> femur<00:05:41.690> is<00:05:41.720> supposed<00:05:42.170> to<00:05:42.290> be

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
were right the femur is supposed to be

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.870 
were right the femur is supposed to be
the<00:05:42.530> most<00:05:42.680> durable<00:05:43.100> bone<00:05:43.400> in<00:05:43.640> the<00:05:43.730> human

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
the most durable bone in the human

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.720 
the most durable bone in the human
skeletal<00:05:44.570> system<00:05:44.960> however<00:05:45.650> both<00:05:46.070> her<00:05:46.310> femurs

skeletal system however both her femurs
were<00:05:46.910> completely<00:05:47.390> fractured<00:05:47.990> this<00:05:48.680> also

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
were completely fractured this also

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.710 
were completely fractured this also
suggests<00:05:49.640> that<00:05:49.700> some<00:05:50.030> kind<00:05:50.270> of<00:05:50.390> powerful

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
suggests that some kind of powerful

impact damage to the corpse yes but

impact damage to the corpse yes but
that's<00:06:06.380> all<00:06:06.620> we<00:06:06.770> know<00:06:06.920> for<00:06:07.100> now<00:06:07.160> it's<00:06:08.000> risky
