really cool looking one um coordinates

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.980 
really cool looking one um coordinates
for<00:04:44.600> this<00:04:44.870> UFO<00:04:45.710> are<00:04:47.320> x<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.770> going<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.370> be

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
for this UFO are x is going to be

00:04:49.990 --> 00:05:00.970 
for this UFO are x is going to be
negative<00:04:51.880> 2050<00:04:53.320> why<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:57.910> 3160<00:04:59.320> z<00:05:00.320> is<00:05:00.500> going<00:05:00.860> to

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
negative 2050 why is 3160 z is going to

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.900 
negative 2050 why is 3160 z is going to
be<00:05:01.100> zero<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:03.710> elevation<00:05:04.250> is<00:05:04.670> going<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.000> be

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
be zero and the elevation is going to be

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.210 
be zero and the elevation is going to be
1445<00:05:07.910> feet<00:05:08.830> all<00:05:09.830> numbers<00:05:10.400> are<00:05:10.610> rounded<00:05:11.740> 20<00:05:12.740> for

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
1445 feet all numbers are rounded 20 for

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.550 
1445 feet all numbers are rounded 20 for
the<00:05:13.250> decimal<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.810> can<00:05:14.930> tweak<00:05:15.170> this<00:05:15.380> you

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
the decimal and you can tweak this you

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.230 
the decimal and you can tweak this you
can<00:05:15.680> push<00:05:15.830> it<00:05:15.980> a<00:05:16.040> little<00:05:16.070> bit<00:05:16.460> further<00:05:16.700> left<00:05:17.060> to

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
can push it a little bit further left to

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.050 
can push it a little bit further left to
get<00:05:17.360> a<00:05:17.390> dead<00:05:17.660> center<00:05:17.990> if<00:05:18.140> you<00:05:18.440> like<00:05:18.710> but<00:05:19.580> i

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
get a dead center if you like but i

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.210 
get a dead center if you like but i
figured<00:05:20.600> for<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.110> sake<00:05:21.320> of<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.530> video<00:05:21.830> this

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
figured for the sake of the video this

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.020 
figured for the sake of the video this
was<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:23.000> fine

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.240 

so<00:05:29.630> you<00:05:29.720> can<00:05:29.930> take<00:05:30.140> your<00:05:30.170> time<00:05:30.380> you<00:05:30.620> can<00:05:30.890> have<00:05:31.220> a

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
so you can take your time you can have a

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.390 
so you can take your time you can have a
look

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.730 

you<00:05:37.910> know<00:05:38.060> raise<00:05:38.389> the<00:05:38.630> elevation<00:05:39.290> lower<00:05:39.500> the

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
you know raise the elevation lower the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.249 
you know raise the elevation lower the
elevation<00:05:40.400> change<00:05:40.850> your<00:05:41.120> angle<00:05:44.229> sky's<00:05:45.229> the

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
elevation change your angle sky's the

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:54.850 
elevation change your angle sky's the
limit<00:05:46.900> so<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:47.960> speak

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.980 

there's<00:05:55.340> really

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
there's really

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.990 
there's really
not<00:05:57.650> much<00:05:57.860> else<00:05:57.890> to<00:05:58.220> this<00:05:58.640> um<00:06:00.670> again<00:06:01.670> I'd<00:06:01.850> like

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
not much else to this um again I'd like

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.980 
not much else to this um again I'd like

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
to remind you that your jet will remain

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.080 
to remind you that your jet will remain
stationary<00:06:07.240> until<00:06:08.240> you<00:06:08.480> either<00:06:09.430> press<00:06:10.430> one<00:06:11.060> of
