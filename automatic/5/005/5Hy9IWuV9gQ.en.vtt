see the difference in the levels the
ground<00:01:44.150> levels<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.470> what<00:01:45.620> they<00:01:45.710> did<00:01:45.920> was<00:01:45.980> they

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
ground levels so what they did was they

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.000 
ground levels so what they did was they
raised<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.300> building<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.750> ground<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.290> it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
raised the building to the ground and it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.500 
raised the building to the ground and it
formed<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.280> foundation<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:50.180> they<00:01:50.300> didn't

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
formed the foundation so they didn't

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.510 
formed the foundation so they didn't
actually<00:01:50.660> have<00:01:50.870> to<00:01:51.110> take<00:01:51.350> any<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.340> old
