let's take a look we're going to do two

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.180 
let's take a look we're going to do two
things<00:04:18.239> usually<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.080> don't<00:04:19.500> necessarily<00:04:19.710> start

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
things usually I don't necessarily start

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.260 
things usually I don't necessarily start
a<00:04:20.280> but<00:04:20.400> we're<00:04:20.489> gonna<00:04:20.609> take<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.910> look<00:04:21.060> under<00:04:21.239> the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
a but we're gonna take a look under the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.640 
a but we're gonna take a look under the
hood<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.600> we're<00:04:21.810> gonna<00:04:21.900> start<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:22.560> you

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
hood and we're gonna start it so you

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.810 
hood and we're gonna start it so you
come<00:04:22.800> here<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.580> can<00:04:23.729> hear<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:23.940> Hemi

yep<00:04:25.980> or<00:04:26.980> maybe<00:04:27.190> we<00:04:27.370> should<00:04:27.400> start<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.910> first

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
yep or maybe we should start it first

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.720 
yep or maybe we should start it first
before<00:04:28.540> he<00:04:28.780> popped<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.140> hood<00:04:29.290> this<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.460> can

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
before he popped the hood this so I can

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:44.010 
before he popped the hood this so I can
