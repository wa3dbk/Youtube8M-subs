rocks tile even got new gen consoles and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.949 
rocks tile even got new gen consoles and
you<00:03:32.790> know<00:03:32.880> bringing<00:03:33.030> an<00:03:33.239> extra<00:03:33.330> eyes<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.750> lash

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.540 
you know bringing an extra eyes to lash
gen<00:03:34.200> that's<00:03:34.680> something<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.400> doesn't

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
gen that's something that just doesn't

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.729 
gen that's something that just doesn't
really<00:03:35.910> seem<00:03:36.300> viable<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:37.110> my<00:03:37.200> opinion<00:03:37.440> you

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
really seem viable in my opinion you

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.840 
really seem viable in my opinion you
know<00:03:37.830> if<00:03:37.920> anything<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.340> feel<00:03:38.459> like<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:38.700> would<00:03:38.820> be

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
know if anything I feel like it would be

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.970 
know if anything I feel like it would be
the<00:03:39.000> opposite<00:03:39.390> way<00:03:39.510> around<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.440> new<00:03:40.739> gem

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
the opposite way around and a new gem

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.320 
the opposite way around and a new gem
would<00:03:41.130> get<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.340> extra<00:03:41.610> high<00:03:41.700> Sun<00:03:41.940> lation

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
would get the extra high Sun lation

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.180 
would get the extra high Sun lation
would<00:03:42.510> be<00:03:42.630> more<00:03:42.840> left<00:03:43.049> out<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.830> at<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.010> same

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
would be more left out but at the same

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.400 
would be more left out but at the same
time<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.459> think<00:03:44.610> Rockstar<00:03:45.390> kind<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.840> excluding

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
time I think Rockstar kind of excluding

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.930 
time I think Rockstar kind of excluding
certain<00:03:46.590> consoles<00:03:47.190> or<00:03:47.340> sun<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.820> know

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
certain consoles or sun and you know

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.910 
certain consoles or sun and you know
generation<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.810> consoles<00:03:49.170> from<00:03:49.470> certain

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
generation of consoles from certain

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.530 
generation of consoles from certain
things<00:03:50.160> is<00:03:50.400> definitely<00:03:50.820> kind<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> bad

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
things is definitely kind of like a bad

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.150 
things is definitely kind of like a bad
business<00:03:52.110> move<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.380> their<00:03:52.560> part<00:03:52.590> do<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.010> have

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
business move on their part do you have

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.890

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
so being excluded from certain things is

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.370 
so being excluded from certain things is
definitely<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> bad<00:04:06.330> move<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.630> my<00:04:06.750> opinion<00:04:06.989> from
