 the 4l trophy 2012 this is the first 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.219
 change of this edition was a 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.350
 new starting point the French stadium 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.180
 in his place at the futuroscope of Poitiers 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.190
 another meeting point has 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.350
 also held in saint-jean-de-luz 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.250
 but for the rest the habits remain 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.809
 the same 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.670
 the four they are checked and 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.979
 getting ready to face taizÃ© remark 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.409
 participating students took care 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.379
 to decorate their self sometimes soberly 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.089
 where with a little more madness have 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.149
 of course these last ones who have our 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.149
 preference

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.350
 and shared with us their 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.299
 impressions just before departure and 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.259
 so we'll trade to go a little 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:39.880
 faster on the highway because they 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:41.649
 do not cling belgian wake that 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.940
 on the highway that we have not so 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.250
 behind the trucks it missed it was 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.979
 all our friends logged the car I m 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.750
 and coll in fact yeah we were told that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.979
 the management had said I believe we 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.539
 is seeing if everything had a 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.429
 salary in order to leave the risk of 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.190
 break the direction what would be when 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.569
 we have to filter change there that has 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.399
 reinforced for sand 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.530
 we have a water pump one of the parts for 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.889
 change that we have the straps and have 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.060

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.230

 brother does him a little bit the year 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:38.629
 to prevent that sand against in the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.099
 case you have you have a table and then 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.450
