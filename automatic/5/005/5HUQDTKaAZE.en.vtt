00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
did my own research and looked it up for

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.470 
did my own research and looked it up for
myself<00:00:19.230> from<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.160> other<00:00:20.430> youtubers<00:00:20.939> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
myself from like other youtubers and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.359 
myself from like other youtubers and
stuff<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.710> other<00:00:22.830> thing<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.160> lot

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
stuff and then the other thing is a lot

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.220 
stuff and then the other thing is a lot
of<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.699> trial<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.240> error<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.689> it's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
of it is just trial and error so it's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.080 
of it is just trial and error so it's
really<00:00:25.500> hard<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.920> show<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.310> exactly<00:00:26.910> how<00:00:27.029> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
really hard to show like exactly how you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.670 
really hard to show like exactly how you
make<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.570> when<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.080> make<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> differently

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.819 
show how to make just plain white basic
formula<00:00:47.460> um<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:48.780> change<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> colors<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.649> think

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
formula um to change the colors I think

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.990 
formula um to change the colors I think
everybody<00:00:50.129> knows<00:00:50.309> now<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.850> use

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
everybody knows now that you can use

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.369 
everybody knows now that you can use
yellow<00:00:51.329> food<00:00:51.570> coloring<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:54.230> what's<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> other

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
yellow food coloring or what's the other

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
yellow food coloring or what's the other
one<00:00:55.530> called<00:00:55.559> vanilla<00:00:56.520> extract<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.239> couldn't

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
one called vanilla extract I couldn't

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.670 
one called vanilla extract I couldn't
think<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> yeah<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.530> change

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
think so yeah you can do that to change

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
think so yeah you can do that to change
the<00:01:01.890> color<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.520> bit<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:03.780> course

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the color in a little bit of course

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.969 
the color in a little bit of course
there's<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.439> ton<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> different<00:01:05.100> ways<00:01:05.309> um<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:07.380> lot

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
there's a ton of different ways um a lot

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
there's a ton of different ways um a lot
of<00:01:08.010> people<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.490> flour<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.180> recommend<00:01:09.510> not

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
of people use flour and I recommend not

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.929 
of people use flour and I recommend not
doing<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.380> because<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.890> will<00:01:11.100> mold<00:01:11.369> within

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
doing that because it will mold within

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.780 
doing that because it will mold within
just<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.450> real<00:01:12.869> short<00:01:13.110> amount<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.439> time<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:14.400> lot

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
just a real short amount of time a lot

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
just a real short amount of time a lot
of<00:01:14.909> people<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.299> use<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:16.290> white<00:01:16.830> school

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
of people also use like white school

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.570 
of people also use like white school
glue<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.479> something<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> I

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
glue and it's just something that I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.620 
glue and it's just something that I
don't<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.060> kind<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> mess

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
don't know I think it's kind of a mess

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.140 
don't know I think it's kind of a mess
to<00:01:21.659> try<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.100> I've<00:01:23.369> got<00:01:23.549> three<00:01:23.759> bottles

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
different ways to do it so yeah the
first<00:01:30.750> way<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> my

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
first way is not really one of my

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.999 
first way is not really one of my
favorites<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> way<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.829> used

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
don't think it has to be warm the next

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.200 
don't think it has to be warm the next
way<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> I'm<00:01:56.430> gonna<00:01:56.520> show<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> guys<00:01:56.880> it's

better if you do use warm water but so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
better if you do use warm water but so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you just put the water in there and then

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.109 
you just put the water in there and then
you<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.840> um<00:02:04.469> squeeze<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> whole<00:02:05.969> bunch

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
you just um squeeze like a whole bunch

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.320 
you just um squeeze like a whole bunch
of<00:02:06.479> baby<00:02:07.140> powder<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.649> there

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.340 

so<00:02:12.770> whoa<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.720> when<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.750> put<00:02:16.260> it

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350

back<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:17.480> um<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.690> don't<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.260> way<00:02:19.440> because

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
the bottom and maybe it's just cuz I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
one way to do it I mean it does bubble

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.550 
one way to do it I mean it does bubble
up<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.330> stuff<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.810> does<00:02:51.930> look<00:02:52.140> cool<00:02:52.380> but

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
up and stuff and it does look cool but

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.930 
up and stuff and it does look cool but
I'm<00:02:52.680> gonna<00:02:52.800> set<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.190> down<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.640> little<00:02:53.820> while

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
I'm gonna set it down for a little while

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.370 
I'm gonna set it down for a little while
and<00:02:54.210> like<00:02:54.360> move<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> side<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.260> I'll

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
and like move it to the side and I'll

and like move it to the side and I'll
show<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.650> guys<00:02:55.800> how<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.100> settles<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.650> second

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
foods and I know a bunch of you probably

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.270 
foods and I know a bunch of you probably
get<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.850> request<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.360> see<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.720> too<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.830> we'll

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
get a request to see that too so we'll

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:27.560 
get a request to see that too so we'll
see<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:22.220> whoops<00:03:23.220> 3<00:03:23.610> ounces<00:03:23.970> whatever<00:03:26.300> um<00:03:27.300> I

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
see but whoops 3 ounces whatever um I

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.030 
see but whoops 3 ounces whatever um I
found<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:28.200> works<00:03:28.440> best<00:03:28.709> if<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.010> use

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
found that this works best if you use

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.990 
found that this works best if you use
warm<00:03:29.520> water<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.390> mean<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:31.050> warm<00:03:31.500> ish<00:03:32.000> out

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
warm water so I mean it's warm ish out

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.729 
warm water so I mean it's warm ish out
of<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.270> tap<00:03:33.480> one<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:37.020> like<00:03:37.290> squeeze

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
of the tap one you just like squeeze

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.130 
of the tap one you just like squeeze
some<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.190> into<00:03:38.610> there<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:41.750> have<00:03:42.750> no<00:03:42.930> clue

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
some of this into there I have no clue

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.140 
some of this into there I have no clue
how<00:03:43.260> much<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.530> just<00:03:43.739> put<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.010> there<00:03:44.100> probably<00:03:45.090> a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
how much I just put in there probably a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.070 
how much I just put in there probably a
lot<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.670> this<00:03:47.910> almost<00:03:48.090> works<00:03:48.480> like<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
lot so and this almost works like the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.979 
lot so and this almost works like the
glue<00:03:49.440> does<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:56.209> yeah<00:03:57.209> once<00:03:57.510> again<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.959> just

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
glue does so yeah once again it just

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.900 
glue does so yeah once again it just
makes<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.530> like<00:03:58.680> white<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.400> doesn't<00:03:59.580> make<00:03:59.880> it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
makes it like white it doesn't make it

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.229 
makes it like white it doesn't make it
like<00:04:00.209> um<00:04:00.590> like<00:04:01.590> creamy<00:04:02.100> though<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.910> guess<00:04:03.120> you

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
like um like creamy though I guess you

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:10.880 
like um like creamy though I guess you
could<00:04:03.420> say<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:09.630> think<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:10.019> got<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.350> Dollar

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
could say so I think I got the Dollar

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.770 
could say so I think I got the Dollar
Tree

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.689 

so<00:04:18.780> yeah<00:04:19.109> that's<00:04:19.320> how<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.530> one<00:04:19.769> looks<00:04:20.040> let<00:04:20.609> me

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
so yeah that's how that one looks let me

this one's okay I mean if you're looking
for<00:04:33.960> just<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.259> cheap<00:04:34.440> way<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.650> do<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.009> but<00:04:35.850> I

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
for just a cheap way to do it but I

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.640 
for just a cheap way to do it but I
don't<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.449> always<00:04:36.600> looks<00:04:36.870> like<00:04:36.930> way<00:04:37.139> too<00:04:37.199> thin

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
don't it always looks like way too thin

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.820 
don't it always looks like way too thin
and<00:04:37.830> too<00:04:37.889> watery<00:04:38.400> for<00:04:38.970> my<00:04:39.090> liking<00:04:39.620> it<00:04:40.620> might

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
and too watery for my liking it might

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.310 
and too watery for my liking it might
look<00:04:40.979> different<00:04:41.400> on<00:04:41.460> camera<00:04:41.850> but<00:04:42.240> okay<00:04:43.110> and

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
look different on camera but okay and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.200 
look different on camera but okay and
the<00:04:43.530> last<00:04:43.710> way<00:04:44.009> is<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.310> way<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.610> usually

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210

ways that I recommend you make it like I

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.249 
ways that I recommend you make it like I
said<00:07:18.789> you<00:07:18.940> can<00:07:19.150> use<00:07:19.229> flour<00:07:20.229> but<00:07:20.620> it<00:07:20.710> does<00:07:20.919> mold

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 
said you can use flour but it does mold

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:25.820 
said you can use flour but it does mold
real<00:07:23.259> fast<00:07:23.560> and<00:07:23.889> you<00:07:24.250> can<00:07:24.520> use<00:07:24.699> a<00:07:24.729> glue<00:07:25.090> I<00:07:25.419> just

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830 
real fast and you can use a glue I just

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.430 
real fast and you can use a glue I just
don't<00:07:26.889> good<00:07:27.219> I<00:07:27.250> guess<00:07:27.779> but<00:07:28.779> and<00:07:29.020> of<00:07:29.110> course<00:07:29.319> you

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 
don't good I guess but and of course you

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.050 
don't good I guess but and of course you
can<00:07:29.560> always<00:07:29.680> just<00:07:29.889> use<00:07:29.979> real<00:07:30.340> baby<00:07:30.610> formula

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
can always just use real baby formula

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.399 
can always just use real baby formula
but<00:07:31.240> you<00:07:31.300> have<00:07:31.479> to<00:07:31.569> remember<00:07:31.750> that<00:07:31.990> that<00:07:32.169> does

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:32.409 
but you have to remember that that does

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:34.589 
but you have to remember that that does
go<00:07:32.650> bad<00:07:32.830> too<00:07:33.130> and<00:07:33.340> that<00:07:33.969> you<00:07:34.060> can't<00:07:34.300> leave<00:07:34.449> it
