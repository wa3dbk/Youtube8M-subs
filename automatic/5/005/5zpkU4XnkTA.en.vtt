 important objectives the objectives that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.329
 for many, many weeks and even 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.550
 months we have been dreaming the 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.070
 We already have competitions around the corner 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.590
 from the corner in a few weeks I was 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.750

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.399
 competitive the period that we have been 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.469
 working for many months 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.539

 we hope and if we have done well 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.160
 previous periods we will pick up 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.500
 our successes do not miss it today you

 let's explain the keys of the period 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.070
 competitive 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.739
 as in the previous chapters 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.570
 we want to explain the characteristics 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.280
 of the competitive period through a 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680
 real testimony through one of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 our athletes he is once again 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.070
 good fan rafa that like us 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.540
 explained the keys of the periods 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.299
 the above preparatory 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.759
 specific is going to tell us his keys in 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.369
 the competition period 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.619
 rafa hello again the truth thank you 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.750
 again for being here with us and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.520
 let's see if they reveal us again 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 its characteristics in that training 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.229
 competitive we had talked in the two 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.149
 previous chapters of the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.220
 characteristics of both the preparatory 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.590
 as the specific but we are already in the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.080
 competitive that period that all 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.810
 we want to arrive because they approach us 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.850
 our most important competitions 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.140
 tell us rafa we talked about the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.270
 periods of training 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.429
 extensive in the other two periods in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.380
 this training the extended period or 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.479
 extensive trainings what 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.280
 importance they have and if you do it to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.380
 the same intensities or the same 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.869
 volumes that the previous periods 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.060
 well now in these weeks that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 about the rhythms and competition 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.750
 intensive yes they are still the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.360
 but to a lesser extent we are going to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.729
 try to rest and relax the body 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.829
 that is what is to come as 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.039
 maximum freshness to the day of the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.349
 competition well fine is to say that the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.630
 main objective is that during this 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.540
 period we have to take care more than ever 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.670
 all those aspects of recovery for 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.130
 arrive with total freshness to the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.770
 competition to Sunday to get the 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.930
 dorsal 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.630
 there is a significant volume load 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.550
 imagine or achieve or previous weeks 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.110
 we have given a lot of intensity to work 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.190
 we have accumulated many kilometers 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.140
 mainly very extensive and 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.570
 accompanied with live rhythms and 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.360
 of the series and now already well facing 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.760
 this week of competition then what 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.470
 we have been saying we have to recover and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.450
 assimilate all that is the burden of 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.730
 work for race day 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.459
 hydrate that comes 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.730
 the series in case you do not compete 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.170
 on Sunday how do you usually do what day 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.090
 you have series and with what intensity 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.560
 we do series on Wednesdays and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.500
 normally more expensive at the end of the week 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.450
 a Friday or a Saturday we have the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.569
 long series let's say we make some 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.299
 series or thousands or 2000 is for 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.900
 also try the live rhythm if 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.030
 we hold a 2003 thousand at that rate of 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.799
 that in the case that in that week there 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.040
 let's have the clear competition that 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.709
 distance is clearly between 48 and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.780
 72 hours that is two or three hours in 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.230
 a quality session to another session of 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.629
 quality have also reduced us the 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.109
 part of the bodybuilding I imagined now 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:45.530
 there is now a muscle is already on top this 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.170
 fullness of strong already and already what 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.870
 is trying to recover this week and in 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.180
 perfect tell us rafa in your week of 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.040
 training that is a week where the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.870
 Sunday you have the competition tell us 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.669
 a little how would that model or that 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.930
 week structure before the 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.060
 competition so that the entities 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.120
 athletes in my case this week on Monday 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.609
 we would start with a break then the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.130
 Tuesday we would have a shoot of 45 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.590
 minutes an extensive to 425 and has gone down 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.230
 a little bit later we would have a series 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.260
 100 slices to catch a little bit of 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.340
 spark the progressives in two points and 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.479
 45 minutes accessibility provided 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.200
 stretching then on Wednesday 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.750
 we would make 25 soft minutes 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.290
 other changes of rhythm of a 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.870
 minute to keep that sparkle I am 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.210
 Thursday 45 minutes extensive soft 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.300
 as well 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.720
 on Friday another break again 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.419
 back to retrieve the Saturday before 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.430
 the soft soft 20 minute competition 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.740
 soft and progressive very short 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.740
 in this case 50 meters enough or 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.900
 60 to find Sunday to reach the top 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.330
 that is, we clearly see the 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.060
 difference of charges between that period 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.979
 that we had initial preparation or 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.960
 that period specific to what is a 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.120
 week before the competition nothing a 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.770
 week where pretty much what you 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.539
 I want to give the greatest importance to you 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.970
 I want to give my body at rest 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.210
 is the recovery is the assimilation of 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.979
 arrive with freshness as it is done 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.000
 you have to assimilate it and rest 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.770
 touches a question also rafa when 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.289
 you compete every week because there are 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.240
 occasions that the competitive part 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.310
 he demands to be competing every Sunday 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.710
 those weeks between competition and 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.590
 competition as they usually are ie they are 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.810
 also strong not strong weeks that 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.390
 they are good according to the test or the test 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.030
 want to make 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.610
 we take advantage there are week load weeks 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.160
 of download when you have the week of 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.930
 charge to take advantage and know that 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.650
 really the work is going well 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.840
 you put a strong competition then 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.230
 you value there yes if you are assimilating well 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.410
 work that week then comes a 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.600
 download to be able to recover and 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.090
 return again to put a period of 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.550
 load already 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.910
 any recommendation from the point of 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.500
 view of recovery greater hydration 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.090
 take more care of food and 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.270
 hydration and feeding as 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.550
 always fundamental 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.740
 I recommend it if it can be through 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.900
 of a dietitian who takes food 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.750
 of all the preparation so that it is 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.150
 everything in its place very well 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.890
 thank you very much for your advice in 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.080
 these last three chapters have you gone 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.120
 unveiling their training plans 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.890
 those weeks models in each of the 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.190
 periods and I'm sure everyone 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.990
 our athletes will take it from a lot 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.410
 grade and it's going to be very useful 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.080
 help 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.540
 thank you very much well we have 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.180
 proven throughout these three 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.950
 chapters like the training is not 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.090
 a linear question like the 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.700
 training we have to be 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.950
 absolutely pending of those charges 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.900
 of work where we will have weeks of 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.640
 greater number of kilometers other weeks 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.040
 of download we will stop it weeks of 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.750
 more intense other weeks where the 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.690
 intensity decreases and we increase the 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.700
 volume the combination of all these 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.490
 elements make us able 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.690
 get that expected performance we have 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.820
 to be able to find the 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.170
 balance in everything we do to 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.270
 level of work and at the level of 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.760
 training you have to have patience 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.110
 must have quiet the 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.540
 performance is not achieved 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.790
 in a few weeks of training I see 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.130
 many people who in a few weeks 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.530
 they dedicate to wanting to compete and compete 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.200
 great distances my personal advice 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.390
 is that we have peace of mind that we do 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.830
 things well done and as always 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.750
 let us put ourselves in the hands of 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.820
 specialists in the hands of people 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.160
 that they advise us correctly and that 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:47.010
 understand and know what we are 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.310
 talking, I encourage you to continue 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.970
 working correctly and see you in 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.970

 and the 

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:04.000
 do not 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.409
 Y 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.019
 yes
