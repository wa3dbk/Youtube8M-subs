Ryder you had this board really appeal

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.729 
Ryder you had this board really appeal
to<00:02:32.750> while<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:33.840> try<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.049> make<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> board<00:02:34.620> that's

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
to while we try to make a board that's

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.190 
to while we try to make a board that's
versatile<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.790> competition's<00:02:36.420> easy<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.989> use

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
versatile the competition's easy to use

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.850 
versatile the competition's easy to use
and<00:02:37.519> has<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.870> performance<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.500> less<00:02:40.680> than

and has the performance in less than
perfect<00:02:41.310> conditions<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:42.810> run<00:02:42.959> a

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
perfect conditions so you know we run a

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.390 
perfect conditions so you know we run a
double<00:02:43.200> concave<00:02:43.500> bottom<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.130> flipped

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
two main lines through the flow and the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.479 
two main lines through the flow and the
and<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.239> vapor<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.170> vapor<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.709> 5-line

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
and the vapor the vapor is a 5-line

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.490 
and the vapor the vapor is a 5-line
configuration<00:03:33.299> which<00:03:33.720> one's<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.049> one<00:03:34.260> yeah

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
configuration which one's this one yeah

configuration which one's this one yeah
that's<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.889> vapor<00:03:35.160> over<00:03:35.519> there<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:36.109> looking

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
that's the vapor over there so looking

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.400 
that's the vapor over there so looking
at<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.310> flat<00:03:38.310> five<00:03:38.579> design<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.989> don't<00:03:40.139> use

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
at a flat five design we we don't use

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.170 
at a flat five design we we don't use
the<00:03:40.590> word<00:03:40.620> bow<00:03:40.950> part<00:03:41.280> when<00:03:41.579> we<00:03:41.670> talk<00:03:41.850> about<00:03:41.880> a

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
vapor witches are flat five design then

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.250 
vapor witches are flat five design then
new<00:03:53.910> for<00:03:54.329> this<00:03:54.389> year<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.690> what<00:03:54.870> we<00:03:54.989> call<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
new for this year is what we call the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.319 
new for this year is what we call the
generator<00:03:55.709> which<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.130> still<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.370> dedicated<00:03:56.970> see

kite<00:03:57.600> we<00:03:58.199> developed<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.769> with<00:03:59.209> Felix<00:04:00.209> and

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
kite we developed that with Felix and

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.430 
kite we developed that with Felix and
and<00:04:01.370> with<00:04:01.730> Tom<00:04:01.940> Herbert's<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:02.690> they<00:04:03.230> won't

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
and with Tom Herbert's so they won't

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.080 
and with Tom Herbert's so they won't
write<00:04:03.620> anything<00:04:03.650> else<00:04:04.160> so<00:04:04.430> we<00:04:04.610> put<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.820> lot<00:04:05.060> of

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
write anything else so we put a lot of

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.670 
write anything else so we put a lot of
work<00:04:05.300> into<00:04:05.510> making<00:04:05.660> a<00:04:05.930> really<00:04:06.290> good<00:04:06.440> see

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
have a stuffer system that's pretty

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.900

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
that it is a full lock so you can run it

on<00:06:24.090> shore<00:06:24.360> spot<00:06:24.750> and<00:06:25.020> we're<00:06:25.800> really<00:06:25.949> starting

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
on shore spot and we're really starting

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.040 
on shore spot and we're really starting
to<00:06:26.550> get<00:06:26.729> a<00:06:26.790> lot<00:06:26.940> of<00:06:27.000> fun<00:06:27.270> out<00:06:27.419> of<00:06:27.449> cutting<00:06:27.960> in

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
to get a lot of fun out of cutting in

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.409 
to get a lot of fun out of cutting in
straight<00:06:28.320> onshore<00:06:28.530> and<00:06:28.800> the<00:06:29.100> reality<00:06:29.370> is<00:06:29.729> not

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
straight onshore and the reality is not

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.800 
straight onshore and the reality is not
everywhere<00:06:30.900> is<00:06:31.169> down<00:06:31.500> the<00:06:31.650> line<00:06:31.680> 6<00:06:32.190> foot<00:06:32.810> so

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
everywhere is down the line 6 foot so

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.260 
everywhere is down the line 6 foot so
what<00:06:34.620> we<00:06:34.740> try<00:06:34.889> to<00:06:34.919> do<00:06:35.160> is<00:06:35.340> must<00:06:35.729> take<00:06:35.910> a<00:06:35.940> board

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
what we try to do is must take a board

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.120 
what we try to do is must take a board
that<00:06:36.360> was<00:06:36.570> just<00:06:36.810> a<00:06:36.930> toy<00:06:37.139> that's<00:06:37.410> throw<00:06:38.039> around

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
that was just a toy that's throw around

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.490 
that was just a toy that's throw around
factor<00:06:38.789> and<00:06:38.970> you<00:06:39.419> could<00:06:39.600> write<00:06:39.810> down<00:06:40.169> the<00:06:40.350> line

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
factor and you could write down the line

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.830 
factor and you could write down the line
if<00:06:40.710> you<00:06:40.830> need<00:06:41.009> to<00:06:41.100> do<00:06:41.250> that<00:06:41.280> you<00:06:41.610> can<00:06:41.820> kind<00:06:42.780> of

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
if you need to do that you can kind of

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.770 
if you need to do that you can kind of
combine<00:06:43.080> the<00:06:43.470> idea<00:06:43.770> of<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.340> skimboard<00:06:44.759> to<00:06:45.449> kind

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
combine the idea of a skimboard to kind

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.540 
combine the idea of a skimboard to kind
of<00:06:45.810> throw<00:06:46.050> around<00:06:46.110> ability<00:06:47.100> of<00:06:47.190> a<00:06:47.280> skimboard

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
of throw around ability of a skimboard

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.210 
of throw around ability of a skimboard
with<00:06:48.000> a<00:06:48.300> bit<00:06:48.630> more<00:06:48.840> than<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.440> surf<00:06:49.680> ability<00:06:50.100> of

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
with a bit more than the surf ability of

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.430 
with a bit more than the surf ability of
a<00:06:50.340> surfboard<00:06:50.580> so<00:06:51.180> full<00:06:51.990> surf<00:06:52.260> rail<00:06:52.560> slack
