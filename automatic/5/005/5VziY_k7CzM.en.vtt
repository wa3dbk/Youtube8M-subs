00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
update I will tell you but this is only

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.580 
update I will tell you but this is only
one<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> dock<00:01:35.970> decks<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.990> apparently<00:01:37.439> if

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
one of the dock decks and apparently if

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.010 
one of the dock decks and apparently if
you<00:01:37.710> equip<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.790> light<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> elevator

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you equip it the light on the elevator

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.889 
you equip it the light on the elevator
starts<00:01:40.439> blinking<00:01:41.240> but<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.390> about<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
starts blinking but that's about it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.960 
starts blinking but that's about it
so<00:01:43.229> we're<00:01:43.710> pretty<00:01:43.920> sure<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.640> need<00:01:44.759> all

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
four of them that eteri is the DOS tags

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.249 
four of them that eteri is the DOS tags
are<00:01:49.110> hidden<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.920> each<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.970> every<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.020> them

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
are hidden on each and every one of them
