00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
leaning over the top rope Steve I think

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.690

where<00:01:43.320> he<00:01:43.350> wants<00:01:43.800> well<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.280> thinking<00:01:44.610> he

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
where he wants well I was thinking he

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.249 
where he wants well I was thinking he
was<00:01:44.790> trying<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> decide<00:01:45.390> whether<00:01:45.720> he<00:01:45.840> wanted

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259

was trying to decide whether he wanted
to<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.070> he<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.310> 10<00:01:47.550> seconds<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
to go or not but he got 10 seconds to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.180 
to go or not but he got 10 seconds to
think<00:01:48.300> about<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.780> decided<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.800> out<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
think about it decided to go out and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.359 
think about it decided to go out and
give<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.570> try<00:01:52.080> he's<00:01:53.070> just
