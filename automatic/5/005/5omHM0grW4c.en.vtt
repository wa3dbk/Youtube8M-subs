 everything that is in the middle but the most 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.290
 important is the security code that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.610

 always put at the expense of paypal that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.680
 in another video we can explain how it is 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.020
 I wanted but it's the easiest way. 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.340

 15 years you will use practically as 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.840
 investments and will recover this 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.670
 money plus the six mistakes that we are 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.710
 to explain from the beginning of the video 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.460

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.370

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.220

 I'll click here and the two 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.410
 paypal options the credit card or 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.410
 paypal I always use is much easier 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.630
 You have already paid and now 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.690
 I'm here to show you here already 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.030
 there are 600 bits up and now that 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.630
 Let's start bidding on the auction for 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.660
 recover our money is the first 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.800
 point the next step then we should give 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.050
 and click here they appear to be good 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.370
 Welcome and everything is the most important animal 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.520
 is to follow here in the upper left corner 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.830
 and seek all here on auction 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.290
 and from now on we will look for the 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.970
 Right auction I'm here looking at 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.430
 first page is not gonna look for me 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.870
 in the second he explained what people 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.180
 Look who's looking at this one. 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.980
 this auction the right auction to start 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.290
 because there is in the left corner this 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.850
 part premiere 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.590
 these auctions are the most 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.930
 because you're not going to 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.520
 to compete with almost anyone with the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.470
 people who are competing for the 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.230
 the first time they have never won anything 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.860
 auction ready and if 18 are still missing 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.980
 minutes but it's really good to start the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.780
 Trying good, we're back here. 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.459
 I jumped to another auction because he did not 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.350
 it worked out but do not worry too much 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.080
 because every 20 minutes it appears 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.000
 so I'll bid 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.000
 I'm just going to show that I'm already 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.739
 will stay here quietly and 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.600
 mark my position if it ends like this 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.039
 it would be good I already won 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.930
 Now I'm going to spend a little time to 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.200
 front and let's go to the last 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.320
 seconds that is where the game really 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.570
 this now somewhat lacking in legal or 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.970
 I'm going to face it is to mark 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.210
 my position right at the moment 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.830
 and to see if we win then it seems like 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.600
 It will not show anyone else 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.090
 if so, it will be easy to see more 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.740
 A guy and I'm going to bid again now. 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.540
 Let's wait a little bit Friday too. 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.670
 It does not work, I'll go with the next one here. 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.670
 20 minutes but let's wait for this 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.890
 point missing three seconds we'll see 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.210
 if we stay like this it seems like a nobody theme 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.210
 look, it's over 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.230
 We won then from here it's very 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.330
 You come here, you want it up here. 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.050
 even when finished we spent few 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.050
 bits and I go here on my account and 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.160
 to look for any auction will have a 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.810
 part tunnel the lions I won now I go 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.200
 run here on the verification I will send 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.210
 my details by to bid and I will come back here 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.740
 at the point where I have already sent the data and 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.660
 that everything is correct 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.780
 now if I came here in the auctions I won 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.520
 I already have the option to pay here. 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.430
 I'll click to send my money 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.860
 for my account on paypal already seems 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.800
 exactly 20 years 37 years that are the 15 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.960
 Euros and 16 Euros to be won 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.340
 I'll stay here and confirm that I 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.730
 I always want to send my account 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.910
 paypal confirmed again and this already 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.490
 will send that whole amount to 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.780
 my paypal account and from there I 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.430
 I can do whatever I want with that one. 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.490
 money ready 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.440
 I still keep all those media that 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.880
 They are here that are the ones I have spent 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.160
 few at the beginning and end with this 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.590
 bid is the team the money was 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.510
 stage will show up here and still are 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.130
 those lives that quote 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.980
 I'm going to have a party here, I did not have 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.530
 nothing and looks ja ta aki 21 euros and 23 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.000
 centers and so you have earned your 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.000
 six more mistakes
