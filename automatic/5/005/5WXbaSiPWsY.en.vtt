00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
sets downfall not only is it difficult

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.350 
sets downfall not only is it difficult
to<00:04:43.170> acquire<00:04:43.350> but<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.190> also<00:04:44.550> want<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:45.030> get<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
to acquire but you also want to get the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.350 
to acquire but you also want to get the
entire<00:04:45.510> set<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.500> now<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.310> suppose<00:04:47.880> just<00:04:48.090> having

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
entire set and now I suppose just having

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.270 
entire set and now I suppose just having
one<00:04:48.480> can<00:04:48.780> suffice<00:04:49.110> if<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.800> are<00:04:49.890> a<00:04:49.920> fan<00:04:50.100> of<00:04:50.160> that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
one can suffice if you are a fan of that

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.190 
one can suffice if you are a fan of that
one<00:04:50.490> particular<00:04:51.030> character<00:04:51.450> for<00:04:51.960> instance

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
one particular character for instance

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.670 
one particular character for instance
only<00:04:52.590> getting<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:52.920> pink<00:04:53.370> for<00:04:54.060> Yui<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.530> me

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
only getting the pink for Yui but to me

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.880 
only getting the pink for Yui but to me
I<00:04:55.890> think<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:57.030> these<00:04:57.270> work<00:04:57.750> best<00:04:58.110> as<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.410> set

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
I think that these work best as a set

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.760 
I think that these work best as a set
they<00:04:59.700> not<00:04:59.880> only<00:05:00.000> look<00:05:00.180> great<00:05:00.540> on<00:05:00.720> display<00:05:01.260> but

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
they not only look great on display but

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.260 
they not only look great on display but
you<00:05:01.860> can<00:05:01.980> also<00:05:02.130> use<00:05:02.250> them<00:05:02.550> for<00:05:02.700> cosplay<00:05:02.970> or

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
you can also use them for cosplay or

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.030 
you can also use them for cosplay or
share<00:05:03.780> them<00:05:03.930> amongst<00:05:04.260> your<00:05:04.410> key<00:05:04.560> on<00:05:04.710> loving

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
share them amongst your key on loving
