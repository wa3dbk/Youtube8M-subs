00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
talking very small different so pretty

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.859 
talking very small different so pretty
much<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.400> each<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.970> same<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.450> both<00:01:06.630> come

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
much this each the same they both come

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960

with<00:01:06.900> baby<00:01:07.530> bumper<00:01:08.040> bars<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.700> come

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
with baby bumper bars they will come

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
with baby bumper bars they will come
with<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.570> adjustable<00:01:10.140> five-point<00:01:10.799> harness

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with the adjustable five-point harness

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.190 
with the adjustable five-point harness
um<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> big<00:01:12.689> difference<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
um there is a big difference in the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.580 
um there is a big difference in the
weight<00:01:13.409> capacity<00:01:13.619> though<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:15.000> Indy<00:01:15.450> has<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.750> 45

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
weight capacity though the Indy has a 45

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.940 
weight capacity though the Indy has a 45
pound<00:01:16.830> weight<00:01:17.100> capacity<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.180> d4<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.500> 10

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
pound weight capacity and in d4 has 10

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.490 
pound weight capacity and in d4 has 10
more<00:01:20.189> pounds<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.790> 55<00:01:21.630> pound<00:01:22.170> weight<00:01:22.380> capacity

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
more pounds at 55 pound weight capacity

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.490 
more pounds at 55 pound weight capacity
so<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.009> could<00:01:23.400> put<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> bigger<00:01:23.970> child<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
so you could put a bigger child into the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.819 
so you could put a bigger child into the
Indy<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:27.060> campus<00:01:27.600> they're<00:01:28.259> pretty<00:01:28.680> much

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
so there's where the biggest differences

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.509 
so there's where the biggest differences
are<00:04:08.540> going<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.720> be<00:04:08.840> so<00:04:09.709> there's<00:04:09.860> two<00:04:10.070> more<00:04:10.220> main

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
are going to be so there's two more main

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.430 
are going to be so there's two more main
differences<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.510> first<00:04:11.540> main<00:04:12.019> difference<00:04:12.320> is

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
differences the first main difference is

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.860 
differences the first main difference is
the<00:04:12.470> weight<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.310> stroller<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:14.180> Indian

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
the weight of the stroller the Indian

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.730 
the weight of the stroller the Indian
which<00:04:15.049> is<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> three

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
which is a three

which is a three
roller<00:04:16.010> weighs<00:04:16.730> in<00:04:16.880> at<00:04:17.000> 20<00:04:17.480> pounds<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:18.350> nd4<00:04:19.280> is

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
roller weighs in at 20 pounds the nd4 is

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.790 
roller weighs in at 20 pounds the nd4 is
2<00:04:19.880> pounds<00:04:20.300> heavier<00:04:20.780> at<00:04:21.020> 22<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.709> that's

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
2 pounds heavier at 22 and that's

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.590 
2 pounds heavier at 22 and that's

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
much more expensive than that so you're

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.710 
much more expensive than that so you're
kind<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.890> getting<00:05:04.040> a<00:05:04.250> deal<00:05:04.550> with<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.150> nd<00:05:05.450> for

because it has the bassinet but again if

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.600 
because it has the bassinet but again if
you're<00:05:09.290> a<00:05:09.320> jogger<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:09.920> need<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.220> stick<00:05:10.460> with

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
same time because they've this is kind

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.420

is the bomb brides I'm relased roller

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.410 
is the bomb brides I'm relased roller
really<00:05:21.350> lightweight<00:05:21.610> only<00:05:22.610> smooth<00:05:22.880> surfaces

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
really lightweight only smooth surfaces

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.020 
really lightweight only smooth surfaces
it's<00:05:23.720> best<00:05:24.080> for<00:05:24.380> then<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:25.430> have<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.700> jogging

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
it's best for then you have the jogging

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.060 
it's best for then you have the jogging
stroller<00:05:26.600> so<00:05:27.020> this<00:05:27.170> kind<00:05:27.440> of<00:05:27.470> goes<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:27.920> between

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
stroller so this kind of goes in between

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.310 
stroller so this kind of goes in between
a<00:05:28.310> little<00:05:28.670> bit<00:05:28.760> more<00:05:28.940> obviously<00:05:29.420> toward<00:05:29.780> the

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
a little bit more obviously toward the

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.170 
a little bit more obviously toward the
Indy<00:05:30.920> because<00:05:31.220> it's<00:05:31.490> still<00:05:31.730> an<00:05:31.850> all-terrain

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
Indy because it's still an all-terrain
