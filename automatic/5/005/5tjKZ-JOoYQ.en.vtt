about<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.539> my<00:00:45.660> cube<00:00:45.930> world<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.350> you've

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
about so this is my cube world if you've

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.100 
about so this is my cube world if you've
seen<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.920> other<00:00:47.070> other<00:00:47.700> tutorials<00:00:48.450> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
world actually is one big cube of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.369 
world actually is one big cube of
bedrock<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:51.840> doing<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> math<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
bedrock and I was doing the math and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.200 
bedrock and I was doing the math and
there<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.460> nearly<00:00:53.850> half<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.719> million<00:00:55.260> blocks

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
there is nearly half a million blocks

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.479 
there is nearly half a million blocks
creating<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.390> cube<00:00:57.949> that's<00:00:58.949> crazy

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
creating this cube that's crazy

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
creating this cube that's crazy
I<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.539> all<00:01:00.930> inspired<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
have a huge cube like that but you know

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
have a huge cube like that but you know
what<00:01:20.189> sometimes<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.090> regret<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.750> bit

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900
