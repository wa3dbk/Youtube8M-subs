00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
converging upon me and this is this is

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.299 
converging upon me and this is this is
one<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> main<00:00:31.260> challenges<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.949> found

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
one of the main challenges that I found

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.630 
one of the main challenges that I found
this<00:00:32.520> fight<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.969> both<00:00:33.360> healing<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> tank<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
this fight was both healing the tank and

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.459 
this fight was both healing the tank and
trying<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> heal<00:00:35.969> through<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.840> ad<00:00:36.989> damage

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
trying to heal through the the ad damage

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
trying to heal through the the ad damage
as<00:00:37.649> well<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> other<00:00:38.399> stuff<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.910> was

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
as well as the other stuff that was

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.600 
as well as the other stuff that was
going<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.390> our<00:00:39.660> approach<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.100> attempt

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
going on our approach on this attempt

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.119 
going on our approach on this attempt
wasn't<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.840> ideal<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.010> we

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
wasn't the ideal one because when we

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.220 
wasn't the ideal one because when we
kill<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> ads<00:00:44.550> they<00:00:44.820> drop<00:00:45.090> pools<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.600> fire<00:00:45.930> in

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
kill the ads they drop pools of fire in

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
kill the ads they drop pools of fire in
the<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:47.280> know<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.579> where<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.059> died<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the you know when where they died and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.660 
the you know when where they died and
when<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> boss<00:00:49.680> run<00:00:49.920> over<00:00:50.100> top<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
when the boss run over top of it you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.010 
when the boss run over top of it you
know<00:00:50.789> he<00:00:50.940> would<00:00:51.059> get<00:00:51.180> super<00:00:51.510> heated<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:51.840> well

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
know he would get super heated as well

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.529 
know he would get super heated as well
but<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.739> he<00:00:52.860> would<00:00:52.980> lose<00:00:53.129> his<00:00:53.420> armor<00:00:54.420> d

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
but then he would lose his armor d

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150 
but then he would lose his armor d
wealth<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.320> trigger<00:00:55.980> additional

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
wealth like that and trigger additional

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.959 
wealth like that and trigger additional
ads<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.129> exactly<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
ads so you know that's not exactly the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.260 
ads so you know that's not exactly the
way<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.120> did<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:01.010> most<00:01:02.010> groups<00:01:02.250> tried<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.789> skim

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
way we did it most groups tried to skim

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.899 
way we did it most groups tried to skim
the<00:01:03.629> center<00:01:04.049> column<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> fire<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.729> my

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the center column of the fire but in my

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.810 
the center column of the fire but in my
experience<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.540> found<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.580> from<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.729> I've

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
experience I found that from what I've

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.550 
experience I found that from what I've
heard<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> tanks<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.930> difficult<00:01:10.500> time

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
heard the tanks have a difficult time

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.980 
heard the tanks have a difficult time
trying<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.299> trying<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> move<00:01:12.630> him<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
trying to trying to move him and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.499 
trying to trying to move him and
maneuver<00:01:13.380> him<00:01:13.500> around<00:01:13.710> basically<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.119> we

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
maneuver him around basically so we

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.270 
maneuver him around basically so we
tried<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> different<00:01:16.080> tactic<00:01:16.530> altogether<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
tried a different tactic altogether you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.429 
tried a different tactic altogether you
know<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.490> case<00:01:17.670> your<00:01:17.909> group<00:01:18.119> isn't<00:01:18.360> quite<00:01:18.900> able

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
know in case your group isn't quite able

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.300 
know in case your group isn't quite able
to<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.439> ended<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.710> doing<00:01:22.770> was

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
to to do that what we ended up doing was

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.520 
to to do that what we ended up doing was
you<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.240> figured<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.600> since<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.200> healer

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you know we figured out since the healer

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.859 
you know we figured out since the healer
attracts<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.159> lot<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.670> threat<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.390> figured<00:01:27.750> we

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
attracts a lot of a threat we figured we

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.210 
attracts a lot of a threat we figured we
would<00:01:28.049> use<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> outside<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> room

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
would use the outside of the room

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.090 
would use the outside of the room
instead<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.810> would<00:01:30.960> move<00:01:31.170> around<00:01:31.470> from

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
instead so we would move around from

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100 
instead so we would move around from
quadrant<00:01:32.640> 2<00:01:32.759> quadrant<00:01:33.000> around<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> outside

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
quadrant 2 quadrant around the outside

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.210 
quadrant 2 quadrant around the outside
of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> area<00:01:35.880> outside<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> grape

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
of the of the area outside of the grape

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
of the of the area outside of the grape
we<00:01:38.220> would<00:01:38.369> gradually<00:01:38.880> stack<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> armor

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
we would gradually stack up the armor

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.260 
we would gradually stack up the armor
debuff<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> about<00:01:40.890> six<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.670> seven<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.150> so
