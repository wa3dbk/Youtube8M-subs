Tuscany<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.309> mean<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:38.790> know<00:00:38.940> most<00:00:39.120> artists

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360

Tuscany I mean I don't know most artists
yet<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.780> let's<00:00:40.020> play<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.379> pouring<00:00:41.190> times

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
yet in this let's play but pouring times

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
yet in this let's play but pouring times
are<00:00:41.640> instant<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.980> our<00:00:43.980> culture<00:00:44.730> conversions<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
are instant as our culture conversions I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.160 
are instant as our culture conversions I
think<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.829> mean<00:00:46.980> I'm<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.190> totally<00:00:47.399> clear<00:00:47.760> on

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
think I mean I'm not totally clear on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.470 
think I mean I'm not totally clear on
what<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.530> mod<00:00:49.800> puts<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.489> basically<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
what this mod puts in but basically it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049 
what this mod puts in but basically it
allows<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.410> blob<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.579> quickly

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
allows you to blob up really quickly

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.600 
allows you to blob up really quickly
which<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.620> mean<00:00:55.800> maybe<00:00:56.160> I'll<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
which I think I mean maybe I'll do a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.200 
which I think I mean maybe I'll do a
standard<00:00:57.090> wats<00:00:57.300> play<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.690> no<00:00:57.930> mods<00:00:58.260> or

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
standard wats play with no mods or

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.250 
standard wats play with no mods or
another<00:01:00.210> time<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.719> model<00:01:01.140> actually

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
another time but this model actually

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.340 
another time but this model actually
looks<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.649> fun<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.219> fast-paced<00:01:02.910> game

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
looks really fun for a fast-paced game

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.770 
looks really fun for a fast-paced game
you<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> cassis<00:01:05.369> belly<00:01:05.850> conquest<00:01:06.570> on

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
every country and there's no like I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.649 
every country and there's no like I

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
don't think there's any aggressive

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.620 
don't think there's any aggressive
expansion<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.310> game<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> should<00:01:15.600> be

America but I think I'll play is Tuscany
this<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.810> what's<00:01:58.290> probably<00:01:58.560> end<00:01:58.829> up

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
this one and what's probably end up

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.700 
this one and what's probably end up
happening<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.820> will<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.210> shut<00:02:00.659> down

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
happening is that we will get shut down

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.929 
happening is that we will get shut down
will<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.920> shut<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> game<00:02:02.700> shuts

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
will not shut down like the game shuts

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.810 
will not shut down like the game shuts
down<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.329> another<00:02:04.200> country<00:02:04.710> maybe<00:02:04.890> Venice

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
down but another country maybe Venice

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.130
