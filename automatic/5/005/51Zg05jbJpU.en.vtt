00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 how are you welcome to my recipe book 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.490
 I am susana 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.710
 remember that in the first video talk 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.900
 how to freeze food so as not to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.269
 waste it good well here where 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.639
 I live in these bags of potatoes 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.789
 I can not buy the loose ones then 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.859
 it 's very difficult for me to do them all 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.920
 they are from the time I get spoiled 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.750
 then I decided to freeze the but if 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.670
 the beaks are frozen they are going to make me 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.890
 black then then then I'm going to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 teach the way he froze them 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.320
 so that they last me a long time 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.630
 the api that the potatoes 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.750
 then the salle while in water for 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.210
 Do not get bold 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.579
 and I started to bite more 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 You can indicate the way you want 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.690
 If you want to leave 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.370
 I will cut them into strips in my case 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.190
 because it's like like my children 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 here I already have some cuts 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.750
 I already have boiling water here 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.750
 my dads ready and chopped like me 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.519
 I wanted to now I'm going to use them in the water 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.429
 boiling 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.079
 what grass in about three minutes and the 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:11.929
 magazines as my parents can see 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.149
 they were spent like five minutes going to 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.219
 be depending on the size of the potato 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.409
 and how many to form as you can see 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.869
 they are not well cooked they are very 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.509
 hot ones are not well cooked 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.799
 undo they're still yellow I'm going to do 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.799
 is to pass the ice water 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.920
 I'm going to put them on a towel 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.840
 to the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.189
 [Music] 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.189
 and we will wait for it to cool 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.850
 I already put them all here, it's going to put them 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.229
 to the paper freezer are cold now 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.259
 I'm going to show you what I do with 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.969
 any food that you want to freeze 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.220
 so that at the time of taking it out I was not 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.600
 make balls you see that sometimes battle does not 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.190
 to choose things because they are 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.610
 all those little balls then to be able 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.890
 take it out more easily this is what 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.890
 what am I going to put in this 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.000
 metal mold 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.330
 the potatoes do not have to be well 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.660
 accommodated or what are not stuck 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.050
 on top of others 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.890
 so tight 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.720
 I'm going to put them all and place them 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.960
 everyone here is going to put them in the freezer 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.960
 well the potatoes are already frozen 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.200
 I left in the freezer about two hours and 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.290
 we can put them in bags maybe 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.540
 it's going to be a bit difficult to separate them but 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.969
 very little 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.700
 the less we make it more dreaded 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:58.240
 unless we are going to struggle to put them 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.510
 and with this heat then if then 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.519
 they are going to separate 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.379
 so when we put them back in 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.230
 the freezer a little bag are no longer going to 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.959
 be all those balls and stuck too 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.599
 you have to try not to throw the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.970
 denounce many because then the 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.530
 we crush too much and can no longer be 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.990
 close for what 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.340
 this is what I do with all the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.220
 food that I'm going to freeze from 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.530
 stop them but not cruises only the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.860
 because they are the ones that are issued but 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.560
 in case of chilies or anything else 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.760
 only the beaks separate them the froze and 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.760
 then I put them in sachets 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.410
