00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
allow a little tiny breeze to come

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.739 
allow a little tiny breeze to come
through<00:00:39.100> actually<00:00:39.460> 3<00:00:39.699> miles<00:00:39.909> an<00:00:40.059> hour<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.600> come

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
through actually 3 miles an hour to come

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.720 
through actually 3 miles an hour to come
we<00:00:40.960> can<00:00:41.109> reduce<00:00:41.379> 100-mile<00:00:41.980> air<00:00:42.129> I<00:00:42.159> went<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.489> 3

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
we can reduce 100-mile air I went to 3

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.069 
we can reduce 100-mile air I went to 3
miles<00:00:42.940> an<00:00:43.089> hour<00:00:43.210> on<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.359> other<00:00:43.510> side<00:00:43.690> that's

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
miles an hour on the other side that's

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.139 
miles an hour on the other side that's
correct<00:00:44.379> and<00:00:44.649> if<00:00:44.829> rain<00:00:45.069> hits<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:45.789> surface

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
correct and if rain hits it the surface

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.880 
correct and if rain hits it the surface
tension<00:00:46.480> sheets<00:00:46.719> it<00:00:46.870> up<00:00:46.989> solid<00:00:47.409> so<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.679> wind

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
tension sheets it up solid so the wind

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.069 
tension sheets it up solid so the wind
stops<00:00:48.219> completely<00:00:48.909> really<00:00:49.449> it's<00:00:49.870> it's

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
stops completely really it's it's

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.439 
stops completely really it's it's
terrific<00:00:50.409> so<00:00:51.069> it's<00:00:51.399> not<00:00:51.579> just<00:00:51.879> a<00:00:51.999> product<00:00:52.239> to

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
terrific so it's not just a product to

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.750 
terrific so it's not just a product to

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
we have bolts and clips at the top and

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.420 
we have bolts and clips at the top and
and<00:01:16.000> at<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.690> side<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:18.280> have<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.430> clip<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.400> you

and at the side we have a clip so you
can<00:01:21.760> double<00:01:22.060> snap<00:01:22.300> it<00:01:22.480> and<00:01:22.540> then<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.870> batten

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
can double snap it and then you batten

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.070 
can double snap it and then you batten
it<00:01:23.410> down<00:01:23.440> like<00:01:23.890> that<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:25.420> reason<00:01:25.750> for<00:01:25.870> back

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
it down like that the reason for back

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.480 
it down like that the reason for back
through<00:01:26.530> like<00:01:26.710> this<00:01:26.890> is<00:01:27.100> there's<00:01:27.280> tremendous

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
through like this is there's tremendous

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.290 
through like this is there's tremendous
of<00:01:29.130> battering<00:01:30.130> from<00:01:30.310> them<00:01:30.520> from<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.850> wind<00:01:31.030> and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
of battering from them from the wind and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.690 
of battering from them from the wind and
and<00:01:31.570> if<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:32.080> final<00:01:32.500> locking<00:01:32.860> thing<00:01:33.160> stops<00:01:33.520> it

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
and if that final locking thing stops it

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.310 
and if that final locking thing stops it
from<00:01:33.730> moving<00:01:33.880> alright<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.690> can<00:01:34.840> also<00:01:34.960> tie<00:01:35.260> it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
from moving alright you can also tie it

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.560 
from moving alright you can also tie it
down<00:01:35.530> through<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:36.130> wiggler<00:01:36.970> eyeball<00:01:37.360> and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
down through a wiggler eyeball and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.940 
down through a wiggler eyeball and
eyebolt<00:01:37.990> is<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.230> different<00:01:38.590> method<00:01:38.860> of

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
eyebolt is a different method of

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.680 
eyebolt is a different method of
fastening<00:01:39.340> yeah<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.820> then<00:01:40.210> down<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.450> the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
fastening yeah and then down on the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.390 
fastening yeah and then down on the
ground<00:01:40.930> you've<00:01:41.140> got<00:01:41.320> eyeballs<00:01:41.710> but<00:01:42.070> when

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
ground you've got eyeballs but when

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.070 
ground you've got eyeballs but when
you're<00:01:42.550> not<00:01:42.730> using<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.390> eye<00:01:43.420> bolts<00:01:43.840> come

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
you're not using it the eye bolts come

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.720 
you're not using it the eye bolts come
out<00:01:44.230> you<00:01:44.410> just<00:01:44.440> plug<00:01:44.830> it<00:01:44.980> we<00:01:45.160> have<00:01:45.280> sidewalk

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
out you just plug it we have sidewalk

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.110 
out you just plug it we have sidewalk
bolts<00:01:46.150> that<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:46.480> put<00:01:46.660> in<00:01:46.780> yes<00:01:47.050> okay<00:01:47.500> now<00:01:48.120> this

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
bolts that we put in yes okay now this

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.110 
bolts that we put in yes okay now this
is<00:01:49.180> very<00:01:49.480> interesting<00:01:49.600> as<00:01:50.110> an<00:01:50.230> alternative<00:01:50.830> to

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
is very interesting as an alternative to

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.730 
is very interesting as an alternative to

up in miami-dade which is a little
different<00:02:19.060> standard<00:02:19.480> okay<00:02:19.870> what<00:02:20.860> about<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
different standard okay what about the

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.890 
different standard okay what about the
cost<00:02:21.370> though<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.670> looks<00:02:21.819> expensive

just slightly under $200 for a three by
five<00:02:25.959> window<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:26.650> you're<00:02:26.860> approximating<00:02:27.129> but

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
five window so you're approximating but

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.040 
five window so you're approximating but
a<00:02:27.819> couple<00:02:28.180> hundred<00:02:28.300> bucks<00:02:28.569> for<00:02:28.840> an<00:02:28.930> average

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
a couple hundred bucks for an average

a couple hundred bucks for an average
sized<00:02:29.349> window<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.890> sounds<00:02:30.220> but<00:02:30.370> yeah<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.730> a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
sized window that sounds but yeah it's a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.460 
sized window that sounds but yeah it's a
