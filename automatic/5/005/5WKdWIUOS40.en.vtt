00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.290 
it's very nice but you can see that that
would<00:02:21.830> add<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.520> little<00:02:22.790> bit<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.030> extra

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
would add just a little bit of extra

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.210 
would add just a little bit of extra
bulk<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.170> front<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.590> your<00:02:24.709> pants<00:02:25.100> so

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
bulk to the front of your pants so

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.400 
bulk to the front of your pants so
that's<00:02:25.400> something<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.060> can<00:02:26.300> choose<00:02:26.690> to

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
that's something that you can choose to

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.590 
that's something that you can choose to
add<00:02:27.740> or<00:02:28.100> not<00:02:28.250> add<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.819> we'll<00:02:28.940> talk<00:02:29.180> about<00:02:29.360> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
add or not add and we'll talk about the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.690 
add or not add and we'll talk about the
construction<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.770> later<00:02:30.920> video

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
construction of that in a later video

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.970 
construction of that in a later video
as<00:02:32.540> far<00:02:32.780> as<00:02:32.810> fabric<00:02:33.470> choice<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:33.950> concerned<00:02:35.980> one

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
as far as fabric choice is concerned one

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.059 
as far as fabric choice is concerned one
of<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.190> things<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.640> would<00:02:38.000> do<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:39.069> because

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
of the things that I would do is because

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.970 
of the things that I would do is because
of<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.310> fact<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.940> pants<00:02:41.330> should<00:02:41.540> be

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
of the fact that the pants should be

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.240 
of the fact that the pants should be
made<00:02:42.980> with<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:44.090> strut<00:02:44.959> some<00:02:45.560> fabric<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:45.980> has

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
made with a strut some fabric that has

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.660 
made with a strut some fabric that has
stretch<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.770> making<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.010> pants<00:02:49.280> out<00:02:49.489> of<00:02:49.580> a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
stretch to it making the pants out of a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.120 
stretch to it making the pants out of a
pair<00:02:49.850> out<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.270> muslin<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.959> not<00:02:51.800> going<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.040> be

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
pair out of muslin is not going to be

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.500 
pair out of muslin is not going to be
such<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.370> great<00:02:52.640> idea<00:02:52.940> because<00:02:53.060> you're<00:02:53.360> not

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
such a great idea because you're not

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.850 
such a great idea because you're not
going<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.750> get<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.019> same<00:02:54.200> fit<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.680> you'll

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
going to get the same fit that you'll

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.060 
going to get the same fit that you'll
get<00:02:55.100> if<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.850> have<00:02:56.090> fabric<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.110> has<00:02:57.320> some

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
get if you have fabric that has some

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.990 
get if you have fabric that has some
lycra<00:02:58.580> stretch<00:02:59.300> to<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.830> my<00:03:01.459> suggestion

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
lycra stretch to it so my suggestion

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.059 
lycra stretch to it so my suggestion
would<00:03:02.269> be<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.420> buy<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.780> piece<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.260> fabric<00:03:03.590> that

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
would be to buy a piece of fabric that

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.840 
would be to buy a piece of fabric that
is<00:03:04.840> inexpensive<00:03:05.840> or<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.280> got<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.550> sale

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
is inexpensive or that you got on sale

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.220 
is inexpensive or that you got on sale
for<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.269> great<00:03:08.510> price

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
for a great price

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.979 
for a great price
but<00:03:09.620> has<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> lot<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.280> stretch<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:11.780> is<00:03:11.959> a

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
but has a lot of stretch to it this is a

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.410 
but has a lot of stretch to it this is a
stretch<00:03:12.440> denim<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.640> can<00:03:13.850> see<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.330> it

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
stretch denim and you can see that it

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.380 
stretch denim and you can see that it
really<00:03:15.110> stretches<00:03:15.560> quite<00:03:16.130> nicely<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:17.120> would

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
really stretches quite nicely this would

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.190 
really stretches quite nicely this would
make<00:03:17.569> for<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.870> great<00:03:18.260> first<00:03:19.569> muslin<00:03:20.569> pair<00:03:20.959> and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
make for a great first muslin pair and

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.759 
make for a great first muslin pair and
if<00:03:22.130> they<00:03:22.250> fit<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.610> first<00:03:22.790> time<00:03:23.090> fabulous<00:03:24.049> then

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
if they fit the first time fabulous then

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.520 
if they fit the first time fabulous then
you've<00:03:24.920> got<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.100> great<00:03:25.280> pair<00:03:25.579> of<00:03:25.610> pants<00:03:25.910> I

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
you've got a great pair of pants I

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.850 
you've got a great pair of pants I
showed<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.829> wool<00:03:28.340> version<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.090> made

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
showed you the wool version that I made

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.720 
showed you the wool version that I made
this<00:03:30.860> also<00:03:31.489> has<00:03:32.170> stretch<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:33.890> but<00:03:34.549> not

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
this also has stretch to it but not

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.100 
this also has stretch to it but not
nearly<00:03:35.540> as<00:03:35.900> much<00:03:36.350> as<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:38.120> stretch<00:03:38.420> denim<00:03:38.720> does

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
nearly as much as the stretch denim does

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.740 
nearly as much as the stretch denim does
so<00:03:39.680> my<00:03:40.220> suggestion<00:03:40.820> would<00:03:40.940> be<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.150> get

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
so my suggestion would be to get

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.600 
so my suggestion would be to get
something<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.170> has<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.530> really<00:03:43.070> nice<00:03:43.190> stretch

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
something it has a really nice stretch

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.789 
something it has a really nice stretch
not<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.420> knit<00:03:44.930> but<00:03:45.530> something<00:03:46.459> with<00:03:46.610> cotton<00:03:47.120> and

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
not a knit but something with cotton and

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.640 
not a knit but something with cotton and
Micra<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:48.980> then<00:03:49.609> move<00:03:50.150> on<00:03:50.690> once<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.470> get<00:03:51.620> a

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
Micra and then move on once you get a

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.880 
Micra and then move on once you get a
good<00:03:51.829> fit<00:03:52.070> then<00:03:52.340> move<00:03:52.640> on<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.780> fabric<00:03:54.530> that

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
good fit then move on to a fabric that

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.080 
good fit then move on to a fabric that
doesn't<00:03:55.700> have<00:03:56.030> as<00:03:56.269> much<00:03:56.540> stretch<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:58.090> next

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
doesn't have as much stretch to it next

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.819 
doesn't have as much stretch to it next
we're<00:03:59.269> going<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.540> talk<00:03:59.780> about<00:03:59.959> how<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.350> pants

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
we're going to talk about how the pants

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.070 
we're going to talk about how the pants
fit
