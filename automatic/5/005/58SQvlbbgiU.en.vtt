just hatch the dragon and then take a
look<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.229> its<00:01:10.500> breeding<00:01:10.830> time<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> know

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
look at its breeding time because I know

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.480 
look at its breeding time because I know

this is the spark dragon in its baby
form<00:01:34.350> relatively<00:01:35.009> small<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.610> I've<00:01:35.759> been

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
saying we're going to level it up to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.020 
saying we're going to level it up to
level<00:01:38.880> 4<00:01:39.540> which<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.979> teenager<00:01:41.610> form

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
level 4 which is it some teenager form

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.440 
level 4 which is it some teenager form
and<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.990> has<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> sort<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.009> Devil<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.790> horn<00:01:45.180> not

and it has a sort of Devil like horn not

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.819 
and it has a sort of Devil like horn not
bad<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.619> Dark<00:01:46.920> Dragon<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:48.560> guess<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
bad for Dark Dragon but I guess it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.539 
bad for Dark Dragon but I guess it
doesn't<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.990> scary<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:53.130> looks<00:01:53.310> kind<00:01:53.520> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
doesn't look that scary it looks kind of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.609 
doesn't look that scary it looks kind of
kooky<00:01:54.000> though<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.930> we're<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.290> level<00:01:55.439> it

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
kooky though but we're going to level it

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.130 
kooky though but we're going to level it
up<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:56.310> its<00:01:57.000> adult<00:01:57.509> form<00:01:59.659> alright<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.869> here

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
up into its adult form alright so here

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.090 
up into its adult form alright so here
is<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.500> Dark<00:02:01.829> Dragon<00:02:02.600> which<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.950> my<00:02:04.950> opinion

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
is the Dark Dragon which in my opinion

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.730 
is the Dark Dragon which in my opinion
looks<00:02:05.670> more<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> light<00:02:06.509> dragon<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.290> mean

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
compared to the I guess spark dragon

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.020 
compared to the I guess spark dragon
which<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.799> supposed<00:03:08.129> to<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.489> dark-type

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
which is supposed to be a dark-type

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.509 
which is supposed to be a dark-type
dragon<00:03:10.940> anyways<00:03:11.940> that's<00:03:12.480> just<00:03:12.810> my<00:03:12.989> opinion<00:03:13.519> um

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
dragon anyways that's just my opinion um

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.199 
dragon anyways that's just my opinion um
I<00:03:15.359> think<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.989> they<00:03:16.170> should<00:03:16.200> swap<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:18.120> know

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
I think that they should swap you know

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.569 
I think that they should swap you know
kind<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.599> swap<00:03:19.079> areas<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.130> one<00:03:20.340> should<00:03:20.549> be

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
kind of swap areas that one should be

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.360 
kind of swap areas that one should be
light<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:22.200> other<00:03:22.319> one<00:03:22.530> should<00:03:22.769> be<00:03:22.799> dark<00:03:23.220> I

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
light and the other one should be dark I

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.490 
light and the other one should be dark I

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.449 
mean just look at the flag dragon it
looks<00:03:25.769> more<00:03:26.069> evil<00:03:26.700> devilish<00:03:27.359> than<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.980> spark

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
looks more evil devilish than this spark

element<00:03:32.700> they're<00:03:32.880> both<00:03:33.090> lightning<00:03:33.630> but<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
element they're both lightning but the

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.690 
element they're both lightning but the
only<00:03:34.260> difference<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.919> light<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.430> dark

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
only difference is light and dark

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
anyways that is about it that is how you
