chemistry<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.460> don't<00:01:29.850> blame<00:01:30.000> him<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.360> he's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
chemistry I don't blame him because he's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
chemistry I don't blame him because he's
probably<00:01:31.049> new<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.590> game<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.490> knew

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
probably new to this game and I knew

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.890 
probably new to this game and I knew
what<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.939> doing<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.390> built<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.720> team

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
what I was doing when I built this team

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
what I was doing when I built this team
so<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.259> got<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> fourth<00:01:34.710> go<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
so we got a fourth go right here just to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.429 
so we got a fourth go right here just to
maximize<00:01:35.939> or<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.479> maximize<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.259> Korn

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
maximize or not maximize to get up Korn

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.380 
maximize or not maximize to get up Korn
show<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:37.950> higher<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.790> get<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
show a little bit higher and get a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.819 
show a little bit higher and get a
little<00:01:39.720> bit<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:39.930> coins<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.409> scoring<00:01:40.710> those

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
little bit more coins for scoring those

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.319 
little bit more coins for scoring those
goals<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> match<00:01:41.430> ends<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.939> one<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.270> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
goals so the match ends for one and we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 
goals so the match ends for one and we
move<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> next<00:01:43.320> bit<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> the

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
find anyone and we actually only come up

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.640 
find anyone and we actually only come up
with<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.120> player<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.840> every<00:02:25.019> by<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:25.500> that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
with one player with every by but that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.309 
with one player with every by but that
is<00:02:25.769> also<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.129> hell<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:27.000> good<00:02:27.120> player<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.629> it

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
is also a hell of a good player but it

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.380 
is also a hell of a good player but it
none<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:28.920> related<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:30.000> striker

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
none really related to the striker

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.149 
none really related to the striker
position<00:02:31.290> but<00:02:32.030> at<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.239> point<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.810> FIFA<00:02:34.530> 13<00:02:34.560> I

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
position but at this point in FIFA 13 I

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.179 
position but at this point in FIFA 13 I
think<00:02:35.909> skill<00:02:36.720> skill<00:02:37.079> moves<00:02:37.409> are<00:02:37.680> kind<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.040> like

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
think skill skill moves are kind of like

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.099 
think skill skill moves are kind of like
I<00:02:38.400> don't<00:02:38.489> really<00:02:38.670> know<00:02:38.909> sometimes<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.989> fun

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
I don't really know sometimes it's fun

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.809 
I don't really know sometimes it's fun
to<00:02:40.139> skill<00:02:40.439> and<00:02:40.590> sometimes<00:02:40.889> it<00:02:41.010> works<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.579> it's

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
to skill and sometimes it works but it's

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.339 
to skill and sometimes it works but it's
kind<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.030> hard<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.299> skill<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:43.049> was<00:02:43.170> much

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
kind of hard to skill is it was much

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.979 
kind of hard to skill is it was much
more<00:02:43.530> fun<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.769> skill<00:02:44.069> in<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.819> fifa<00:02:45.510> 12<00:02:45.720> there
