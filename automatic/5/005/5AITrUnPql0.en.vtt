where the driver side doors used to be

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.670 
where the driver side doors used to be
there's<00:00:47.500> just<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:47.980> gaping<00:00:48.280> hole<00:00:48.520> I<00:00:49.680> inspected

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
there's just a gaping hole I inspected

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.740 
there's just a gaping hole I inspected
the<00:00:50.800> remains<00:00:51.160> with<00:00:51.460> vehicle<00:00:51.910> safety<00:00:52.180> expert

Roy<00:00:53.200> quinny<00:00:53.620> I<00:00:54.930> mean<00:00:55.930> do<00:00:55.989> you<00:00:56.050> think<00:00:56.080> there's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
Roy quinny I mean do you think there's

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.689 
Roy quinny I mean do you think there's
any<00:00:56.410> chance<00:00:56.500> anyone<00:00:56.980> would<00:00:57.129> have<00:00:57.220> survived<00:00:57.519> in

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
any chance anyone would have survived in

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.250 
any chance anyone would have survived in
this<00:00:57.790> it's<00:00:58.300> highly<00:00:58.570> unlikely<00:00:58.690> mean<00:00:59.140> as<00:00:59.230> you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
this it's highly unlikely mean as you

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.410 
this it's highly unlikely mean as you
can<00:00:59.470> see<00:00:59.589> from<00:00:59.650> the<00:00:59.920> intrusion<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.460> this<00:01:00.670> here

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
can see from the intrusion of this here

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.149 
can see from the intrusion of this here
we<00:01:01.540> have<00:01:01.720> here<00:01:01.900> this<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.260> driver's<00:01:02.739> door<00:01:02.890> over

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
we have here this the driver's door over

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.820 
we have here this the driver's door over
here<00:01:03.190> that's<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.269> handle<00:01:04.600> release<00:01:04.839> there<00:01:05.110> but

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
here that's the handle release there but

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.430 
here that's the handle release there but
as<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.010> can<00:01:06.100> see<00:01:06.340> through<00:01:06.520> here<00:01:07.440> there's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
as you can see through here there's

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.240

car<00:02:51.070> that's<00:02:51.670> exactly<00:02:51.940> what<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.660> does<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:55.240> what

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
car that's exactly what it does so what

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.000 
car that's exactly what it does so what
would<00:02:55.540> have<00:02:55.630> happened<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.320> people<00:02:56.500> inside

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
would have happened to the people inside

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.490 
would have happened to the people inside
it<00:02:57.330> well<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.480> basis<00:02:58.810> maintain<00:02:59.200> its<00:02:59.380> integrity

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
it well the basis maintain its integrity

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.920 
it well the basis maintain its integrity
I<00:03:00.040> maintained<00:03:00.970> its<00:03:01.120> shape<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.690> good

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
I maintained its shape this is a good

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.390 
I maintained its shape this is a good
for<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.170> Aqua<00:03:02.410> because<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:02.890> maintain<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
for the Aqua because you maintain the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.940 
for the Aqua because you maintain the
distance<00:03:03.550> between<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.030> head<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.420> route

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
distance between the head and the route

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.830 
distance between the head and the route
now<00:03:05.950> obviously<00:03:06.190> there's<00:03:06.520> minimal<00:03:07.270> restraints

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
now obviously there's minimal restraints

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.270 
now obviously there's minimal restraints
on<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:07.990> vehicle<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:08.710> only<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> belts

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
on this vehicle so it's only the belts

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.620 
on this vehicle so it's only the belts
of<00:03:09.400> hell<00:03:09.550> them<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.820> so<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.090> passengers<00:03:10.510> done

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
of hell them in so the passengers done

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.240 
of hell them in so the passengers done
really<00:03:10.900> well<00:03:11.050> although<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:11.740> footage<00:03:12.040> trying

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
really well although it's footage trying

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.460 
really well although it's footage trying
to<00:03:12.310> hold<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.520> door<00:03:12.670> open<00:03:12.700> there<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:14.080> downside

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
to hold the door open there the downside

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.630 
to hold the door open there the downside
is<00:03:14.620> because<00:03:14.920> there's<00:03:15.100> no<00:03:15.190> inflatable

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
is because there's no inflatable

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.730 
is because there's no inflatable
restraints<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.390> arms<00:03:16.690> have<00:03:16.810> come<00:03:17.530> out<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
restraints the arms have come out the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.110 
restraints the arms have come out the
window<00:03:17.980> for<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> driver<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:18.970> reality

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
window for the driver and in reality

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.510 
window for the driver and in reality
he's<00:03:19.480> probably<00:03:19.630> would've<00:03:19.870> bled<00:03:19.990> to<00:03:20.140> death<00:03:20.520> hmm

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
he's probably would've bled to death hmm

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.850 
he's probably would've bled to death hmm
so<00:03:21.910> curtain<00:03:22.540> airbags<00:03:23.020> would<00:03:23.320> have<00:03:23.530> helped

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
so curtain airbags would have helped

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.160 
so curtain airbags would have helped

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
helped anyone in the other car at these

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.800
