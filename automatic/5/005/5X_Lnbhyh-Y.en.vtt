00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.260
 hello to all the friends of youtube good 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.630
 Well today I'm going to bring you a video of how 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.500
 make a homemade incubator 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.360
 well it's not really an incubator and 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.550
 I think this may interest 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.279
 many since many people do not have the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.640
 money to spend an incubator or 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.590
 he caught the eggs improvised and did not 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.579
 has an incubator and needs to incubate 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.710
 and this can be a good method and 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:35.630
 they need very few materials you need 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.260
 a tupper like this from here substrate 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.420
 for the eggs I recommend the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.120
 Vermiculite that I think is the best 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.699
 for reptile eggs to incubate us 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.239
 something that hot I'm going to use a 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.260
 thermal blanket of the old ones themselves and a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.140
 place that is 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.059
 that does not have temperature changes or 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.149
 be a place where you keep the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.350
 constant temperature because I have here 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.350
 the tupper with the eggs 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.250
 this is in 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.840
 also that I'm going to choose can be a 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.170
 normal afternoon is to have a 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.170
 tupper 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.450
 I've made some holes so that 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.670
 ventilate 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.230
 and this is a tupper that closes 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.350
 hermetically 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.909
 I will not do it 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.369
 all right 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.819
 the tupper and the following are already closed 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.380
 it's a place without ventilation without anything I 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.020
 directly, I'm going to put them in a 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.119
 closet with thermal blanket that causes 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.579
 normal hooked to some cables so that 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.740
 can enter or be hooked 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.320
 and plugged in and have heat then 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.800
 I'm going to put it here 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.229
 and that's how it would stay you can see 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.780
 perfectly how is the blanket in the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.810
 closet 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.259
 and the tupper with the eggs 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.570
 and so you can have an incubator 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.150
 improvised 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.550
 and we'll see if it works or not 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.520
 but theoretically the theory can 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.500
 work because it heats up or has the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.450
 humidity enough temperature 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.260
 vermiculite are isolated and it is a site 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.840
 closed not hermetically but 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.520
 probably yes that is, there are no changes 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.750
 sudden temperature or anything that is what 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.470
 what else could affect the incubation 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.940
 so it can perfectly work 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:40.450
 I'll say if this works or if it does not 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.990
 and I do not expect anything to have helped people 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.240
 that they need it because of course what is 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.960
 put your female some eggs and you do not know 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.700
 what to do with them 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.340
 because you do not have an incubator or you have 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.960
 caught without warning and of course this 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.500
 can you get out of trouble can you serve 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.950
 and they can come out perfectly so 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.290
 I hope to help and nothing a greeting to all 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.000
 I like if you liked it 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.000
 the video and goodbye
