down yeah are you doing great yeah there
we<00:03:43.040> go<00:03:48.189> and<00:03:49.189> then<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:50.060> bottom<00:03:50.209> left<00:03:50.599> we<00:03:50.959> hit

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
we go and then the bottom left we hit

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.670 
we go and then the bottom left we hit
that<00:03:51.469> it's<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:52.639> it's<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.150> boost<00:03:53.389> so<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.290> get<00:03:54.620> a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
that it's so it's a boost so you get a

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.740 
that it's so it's a boost so you get a
little<00:03:55.040> speed<00:03:55.370> boost<00:03:55.579> great<00:03:56.209> which<00:03:56.480> allows

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
little speed boost great which allows

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.780 
little speed boost great which allows
you<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:56.989> propel<00:03:57.319> right-click<00:03:58.219> very

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
you to propel right-click very

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.610 
you to propel right-click very
efficiently<00:03:59.150> on<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.870> red<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:00.530> yellow

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
efficiently on the red and yellow

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.559 
efficiently on the red and yellow
buttons<00:04:01.099> what<00:04:01.310> do<00:04:01.370> those<00:04:01.489> do<00:04:01.760> so<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.450> red

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
buttons what do those do so the red

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.349 
buttons what do those do so the red
button<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:02.989> break<00:04:03.590> slow<00:04:04.549> down<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.239> the

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
button is a break slow down and the

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.349 
button is a break slow down and the
yellow<00:04:05.629> button<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:06.139> bridge<00:04:06.939> so<00:04:07.939> you<00:04:08.000> do<00:04:08.209> that

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
yellow button is bridge so you do that

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.020 
yellow button is bridge so you do that
do<00:04:08.629> it<00:04:08.719> correctly<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.079> get<00:04:09.199> a<00:04:09.230> speed<00:04:09.469> boost<00:04:09.680> and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
do it correctly to get a speed boost and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.640 
do it correctly to get a speed boost and
again<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.329> this<00:04:11.449> is<00:04:11.689> a<00:04:11.719> very<00:04:12.199> early<00:04:12.469> build

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
again as this is a very early build

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.050 
again as this is a very early build
these<00:04:13.299> buttons<00:04:14.299> don't<00:04:14.449> finalized<00:04:14.810> yet<00:04:16.060> well

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
these buttons don't finalized yet well

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.699 
these buttons don't finalized yet well
