I<00:00:43.560> think<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> looks<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.140> horrible<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.380> it

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470

I think it looks just horrible and it
keeps<00:00:47.360> twisting<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.540> me<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.140> let's<00:00:49.770> go<00:00:49.829> ahead

keeps twisting on me so let's go ahead

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.260 
keeps twisting on me so let's go ahead
and<00:00:50.160> transform<00:00:50.579> him<00:00:50.850> well<00:00:51.090> first<00:00:52.399> gray<00:00:53.399> black

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and transform him well first gray black

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.100 
and transform him well first gray black
silver<00:00:54.989> red<00:00:55.350> those<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.280> colors<00:00:56.960> will<00:00:57.960> be

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
silver red those are the colors will be

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.520 
silver red those are the colors will be
alright<00:00:59.040> let's<00:00:59.250> go<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.489> transform<00:01:00.530> unlike

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
alright let's go and transform unlike

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.889 
alright let's go and transform unlike
the<00:01:01.860> Voyager<00:01:02.730> version<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> actually<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the Voyager version you actually have to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.349 
the Voyager version you actually have to
pop<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.829> entire<00:01:05.159> gun<00:01:05.489> assembly<00:01:05.789> off<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.329> I

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:06.359 
pop the entire gun assembly off and I

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:09.379 
pop the entire gun assembly off and I
want<00:01:06.509> to<00:01:06.569> talk<00:01:06.719> about<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.079> real<00:01:07.289> quick<00:01:08.389> even

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:09.389 
want to talk about this real quick even

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:11.059 
want to talk about this real quick even
though<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> gun<00:01:09.990> assembly<00:01:10.259> looks<00:01:10.740> better

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:11.069 
though the gun assembly looks better

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.270 
though the gun assembly looks better
it<00:01:11.249> still<00:01:11.549> has<00:01:11.789> a<00:01:11.819> sword<00:01:12.299> gimmick<00:01:12.749> which<00:01:13.469> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it still has a sword gimmick which you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.139 
it still has a sword gimmick which you
break<00:01:15.079> this<00:01:16.079> part<00:01:16.679> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:19.429> swing<00:01:20.429> this

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
break this part and then you swing this

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.199 
break this part and then you swing this
up<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.840> he's<00:01:22.649> got<00:01:22.859> kind<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.399> a<00:01:23.609> a<00:01:24.950> sword<00:01:26.209> thing

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209 
up and he's got kind of a a sword thing

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.289 
up and he's got kind of a a sword thing
night<00:01:27.840> he<00:01:28.799> holds<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.249> it<00:01:29.490> fits<00:01:29.819> on<00:01:29.999> his<00:01:30.119> arm

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
night he holds it it fits on his arm

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.730 
night he holds it it fits on his arm
like<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.429> he<00:01:32.429> can<00:01:32.609> poke<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.619> could

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
like this so he can poke you you could

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.300 
like this so he can poke you you could
poke<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> real<00:01:35.429> good<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.289> don't<00:01:37.649> know<00:01:37.770> if

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
poke you real good so I don't know if

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.410 
poke you real good so I don't know if
this<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.119> even<00:01:39.499> useful<00:01:40.499> I<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.639> think<00:01:42.329> it's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
this is even useful I I think it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
this is even useful I I think it's
stupid<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.319> I<00:01:44.209> don't<00:01:45.209> like<00:01:45.359> just<00:01:45.719> a<00:01:45.869> fan<00:01:46.490> all

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
stupid but I don't like just a fan all

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.199 
stupid but I don't like just a fan all
right<00:01:47.639> so<00:01:48.209> let's<00:01:48.359> look<00:01:48.450> at<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.749> figure

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
right so let's look at the figure

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.389 
right so let's look at the figure
virtually<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:51.420> same<00:01:51.529> exact<00:01:52.529> transformation

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
virtually the same exact transformation

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.899 
virtually the same exact transformation
as<00:01:53.929> his<00:01:54.929> Voyager<00:01:55.439> counterpart<00:01:56.039> so<00:01:56.759> we're<00:01:56.880> just

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
as his Voyager counterpart so we're just

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.359 
as his Voyager counterpart so we're just
gonna<00:01:57.149> split<00:01:57.509> those<00:01:57.719> apart<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.349> fold<00:01:59.039> them<00:01:59.189> up

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
gonna split those apart and fold them up

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.950 
gonna split those apart and fold them up
like<00:02:00.359> that

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
like that

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.670 
like that
we're<00:02:01.740> gonna<00:02:01.890> take<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> legs<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.650> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
we're gonna take the legs and this is a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
we're gonna take the legs and this is a
major<00:02:04.950> problem<00:02:05.370> with<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.820> figure<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.330> I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
major problem with this figure that I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.889 
major problem with this figure that I
have<00:02:06.470> he<00:02:07.470> keeps<00:02:07.740> falling<00:02:07.980> apart<00:02:08.490> I've<00:02:09.479> used<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
have he keeps falling apart I've used a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.020 
have he keeps falling apart I've used a
little<00:02:10.050> bit<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.259> Elmer's<00:02:10.619> glue<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.310> keep<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
little bit of Elmer's glue to keep the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.280 
little bit of Elmer's glue to keep the
legs<00:02:12.300> together<00:02:13.730> especially<00:02:14.730> here<00:02:15.570> because

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
legs together especially here because

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.830 
legs together especially here because
before<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.280> could<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:17.820> lift<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.570> it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
before I could just lift this up and it

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.630 
before I could just lift this up and it
would<00:02:18.959> move<00:02:19.320> I'm<00:02:19.470> sorry<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.920> could<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.459> lift

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
would move I'm sorry I could just lift

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.010 
would move I'm sorry I could just lift
this<00:02:20.820> part<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.180> his<00:02:21.300> leg<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.930> would

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
this part of his leg up and it would

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.080 
this part of his leg up and it would
just<00:02:22.170> drop<00:02:22.350> straight<00:02:22.560> down<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.610> went<00:02:23.790> stand

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
just drop straight down and I went stand

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.360 
just drop straight down and I went stand
them<00:02:24.209> up<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.450> he<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> splits<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.920> used<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
them up and he do the splits so I used a

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.310 
them up and he do the splits so I used a
little<00:02:26.520> bit<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.760> glue

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
little bit of glue

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.300 
little bit of glue
unfortunately<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.440> glue<00:02:28.650> didn't<00:02:28.890> work<00:02:29.040> for

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
unfortunately the glue didn't work for

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.300 
unfortunately the glue didn't work for
this<00:02:29.459> joint<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.270> every<00:02:31.260> time<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.500> turn<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.130> it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
this joint and every time I turn it it

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.840 
this joint and every time I turn it it
pops<00:02:32.580> off<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.070> be<00:02:35.190> very<00:02:35.520> very

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
pops off so I have to be very very

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.729 
pops off so I have to be very very
careful<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.600> transforming<00:02:37.470> him<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.790> oh<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.590> I

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
careful on transforming him so oh and I

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.260 
careful on transforming him so oh and I
forgot<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.010> mention<00:02:41.100> when<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.820> one<00:02:42.060> mode

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
forgot to mention when in the one mode

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.210

he has a big-ass landing gear which

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.900 
he has a big-ass landing gear which
looks<00:02:44.430> ridiculous<00:02:45.420> oh<00:02:45.690> well<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.520> we're<00:02:47.880> just

looks ridiculous oh well so we're just

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910 
looks ridiculous oh well so we're just
gonna<00:02:48.150> fold<00:02:48.480> out<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> feet<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.500> fiddle<00:02:49.800> with

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
gonna fold out the feet and fiddle with

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.630 
gonna fold out the feet and fiddle with
the<00:02:50.040> feet<00:02:50.900> get<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.050> feet<00:02:52.260> up<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:55.640> then

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
the feet get the feet up like that then

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.000 
the feet get the feet up like that then
we're<00:02:56.790> gonna<00:02:56.940> take<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.270> top<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.830> just

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
we're gonna take the top and just

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.560 
we're gonna take the top and just
literally<00:02:59.310> fold<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.570> arms<00:03:01.020> around<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:02.570> then

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
literally fold the arms around and then

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.220 
literally fold the arms around and then
and<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.930> Prime<00:03:07.260> before<00:03:07.739> him<00:03:07.950> he<00:03:08.160> has<00:03:08.340> this

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
and like Prime before him he has this

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.740 
and like Prime before him he has this
really<00:03:10.230> stupid<00:03:10.980> punching<00:03:11.700> gimmick<00:03:12.060> which

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
really stupid punching gimmick which

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.479 
really stupid punching gimmick which
makes<00:03:12.989> no<00:03:13.200> sense<00:03:13.739> whatsoever<00:03:15.590> it's<00:03:16.590> lame<00:03:16.950> it's

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
makes no sense whatsoever it's lame it's

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.270 
makes no sense whatsoever it's lame it's
stupid<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.720> it's<00:03:19.380> useless<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:22.680> being<00:03:22.950> said

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
stupid and it's useless that being said

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.930 
stupid and it's useless that being said
I<00:03:24.380> think<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.680> Megatron<00:03:26.250> looks<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.549> lot<00:03:26.700> better

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
I think this Megatron looks a lot better

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.000 
I think this Megatron looks a lot better
than<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.209> Voyager<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> colours

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
than the Voyager I like the colours

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.539 
than the Voyager I like the colours
better

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
better

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.220 
better
I<00:03:29.580> like<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:32.120> just<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> overall<00:03:33.630> look<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
I like the just the overall look of the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.979 
I like the just the overall look of the
figure<00:03:34.530> he's<00:03:35.100> got<00:03:35.280> battle<00:03:35.580> damaged<00:03:36.090> his<00:03:36.630> foot

opening and closing at the chest like on
the<00:03:48.690> Voyager<00:03:49.079> figure<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:50.489> just<00:03:50.700> looks

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
the Voyager figure and it just looks

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.020 
the Voyager figure and it just looks
better<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:52.079> got<00:03:52.200> better<00:03:52.410> pose<00:03:52.769> ability<00:03:53.280> now

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
better it's got better pose ability now

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.390 
better it's got better pose ability now
the<00:03:54.510> cannon<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.110> lot<00:03:55.410> lighter<00:03:55.739> but<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.250> is

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
the cannon is a lot lighter but this is

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.080 
the cannon is a lot lighter but this is
a<00:03:56.430> deluxe<00:03:56.760> figures<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.510> then<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:57.810> find

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
a deluxe figures and then we find

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.619 
a deluxe figures and then we find
plug<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.569> in<00:04:01.560> even<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.650> cannon<00:04:03.310> looks<00:04:03.970> better

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
plug it in even the cannon looks better

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.390 
plug it in even the cannon looks better
I<00:04:05.110> mean<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:07.120> can<00:04:07.239> actually<00:04:07.569> pose<00:04:07.989> him<00:04:08.560> with

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
I mean you can actually pose him with

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.850 
I mean you can actually pose him with
the<00:04:09.610> cannon<00:04:10.090> cannons<00:04:10.959> still<00:04:11.170> freakin<00:04:11.560> huge

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
the cannon cannons still freakin huge

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.339 
the cannon cannons still freakin huge
but<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.790> joints<00:04:13.150> are<00:04:13.269> a<00:04:13.300> lot<00:04:13.480> better<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:14.080> the

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
but the joints are a lot better and the

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.520 
but the joints are a lot better and the
cannon<00:04:14.709> itself<00:04:14.860> is<00:04:15.370> much<00:04:15.730> much<00:04:16.150> lighter<00:04:16.540> so

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
cannon itself is much much lighter so

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.920 
cannon itself is much much lighter so
you<00:04:17.590> can<00:04:17.739> actually<00:04:18.100> pose<00:04:18.549> him<00:04:19.120> with<00:04:19.540> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
you can actually pose him with the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.400 
you can actually pose him with the
cannon<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:21.540> like<00:04:22.540> this<00:04:22.660> figure<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:23.020> lot<00:04:23.199> better

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
cannon I like this figure a lot better

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.510 
cannon I like this figure a lot better
than<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.710> Voyager<00:04:25.020> even<00:04:26.020> though<00:04:26.169> his<00:04:26.680> work

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
than the Voyager even though his work

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.690 
than the Voyager even though his work
his<00:04:28.350> vehicle<00:04:29.350> mode<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.770> terrible

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
his vehicle mode is terrible

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.270 
his vehicle mode is terrible
his<00:04:31.180> robot<00:04:31.810> mode<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:32.050> fantastic<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:33.190> his

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
his robot mode is fantastic and his

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.060 
his robot mode is fantastic and his
fantastic<00:04:33.750> poseability<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:35.889> need<00:04:36.040> a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
fantastic poseability you just need a

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.790 
fantastic poseability you just need a
little<00:04:36.250> bit<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.550> glue<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.150> keep<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.800> joints

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
little bit of glue to keep the joints

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.960 
little bit of glue to keep the joints
from<00:04:39.660> flopping<00:04:40.660> all<00:04:40.960> around<00:04:40.990> I<00:04:41.979> didn't<00:04:42.790> wanted

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
from flopping all around I didn't wanted

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.510 
from flopping all around I didn't wanted
to<00:04:43.090> do<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.389> video<00:04:43.600> review<00:04:43.810> until<00:04:44.320> I<00:04:44.350> had<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
to do the video review until I had the

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.950 
to do the video review until I had the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
joints locked up so that I could

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.900 
joints locked up so that I could
actually<00:04:47.110> put<00:04:48.040> them<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.340> table<00:04:48.669> and<00:04:48.760> not

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
actually put them on the table and not

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.159 
actually put them on the table and not
have<00:04:49.060> them<00:04:49.180> do<00:04:49.360> that<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:52.450> just<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:52.900> little<00:04:52.990> bit

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
have them do that so just a little bit

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.840 
have them do that so just a little bit
of<00:04:53.260> glue<00:04:53.380> of<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.590> joints<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.100> he<00:04:54.370> turns<00:04:54.669> out

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
of glue of the joints and he turns out

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.680 
of glue of the joints and he turns out
to<00:04:55.000> be<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.150> very<00:04:55.660> good<00:04:56.139> figure<00:04:57.539> except<00:04:58.539> the

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
to be a very good figure except the

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.580 
to be a very good figure except the
vehicle<00:04:59.229> mode<00:04:59.380> which<00:04:59.770> is<00:05:00.330> hideous<00:05:01.330> but<00:05:01.930> other

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
vehicle mode which is hideous but other

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.670 
vehicle mode which is hideous but other
than<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:03.389> pick<00:05:04.389> that<00:05:04.600> tooth<00:05:04.780> back<00:05:04.990> up<00:05:05.200> you

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
than that pick that tooth back up you

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.440 
than that pick that tooth back up you
won't<00:05:05.830> be<00:05:05.919> I<00:05:06.220> don't<00:05:07.150> think<00:05:07.330> it'd<00:05:07.419> be

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
won't be I don't think it'd be

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.050 
won't be I don't think it'd be
disappointed
