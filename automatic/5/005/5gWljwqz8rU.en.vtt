00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.339
 the catering industry 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.619
 at the end of a state era are bills 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.050
 through the night in a suburb 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.010
 before the summer it appears that it is finally clear again 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.000
 the annual dinner 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Jan was particularly impressed by his popularity 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630

 what are the last 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 well the acquisition 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.280
 I don't always think so 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.740
 the last album 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.090
 nice year 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.880
 well done 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.940
 the first year ago 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 dropped a few years 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.300
 but stand there 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.580
 the fact that the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.580
 I agree with you 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.140
 He is on a whole list 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.140
 would have eleven games 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.230
 armed with a knife 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.660
 on top of 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.660
 And then there is another time 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.440
 let alone 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.150
 they really disagreed 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.620
 and then what appears 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.349
 over the years 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.939
 device known as 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.939
 I can stay 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.139
 moreno 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.139
 really 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.779
 roj 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.469
 what were 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.189
 all eyes were long 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.249
 the public road from the south and some points for improvement 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.889
 the cyclist fell 6 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.739
 it will now be very easy to remove and if all that happens 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.999
 similarly with 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.999
 that's why i'm gonna me 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.779
 become the final 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:02.700
 the catering industry 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.139
 Korea 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.229
 eindhoven 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.229
 that awakens 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.429
 her work 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.629
 he drove 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.249
 h 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.569
 killed the Taliban 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.569
 complete 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 the ocean 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.159
 so all are 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.869
 live on a waterway 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.749
 so 2 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.449
 heineken house 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.959
 the statistics have been taking his own hand for quite some time 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.309
 then there is an end to his nose 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:53.309
 as a loss of one 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.269
 I don't hear anything about the work 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.299
 from marshmallows 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.279
 more than a year earlier 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:05.939

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.649
 he is originally from North Holland 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.800
 3 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.229
 almost all probability 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.039
 after consideration with his work 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.629
 several times 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.650
 paramaribo 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.699
 you can still find the whole netherlands against spain 9 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.889
 that said rutte 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.620
 that would go to my work 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.169
 nice job to keep in a row 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.169
 and 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.139
 that's it then 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.029
 the party is going 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.029
 reversed a grade of 7 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.599
 the entire supervisory board on which the members' council must work do not have marwijk there 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.110
 afraid of all traffic 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.110
 and some more 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:09.469
 nicely finished what happened 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.809
 it must have hit a tree 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:17.789
 population counts 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.409
