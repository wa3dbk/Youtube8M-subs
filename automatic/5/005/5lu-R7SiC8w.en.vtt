00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so today of course I have my book in

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.879 
so today of course I have my book in
front<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.030> me<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:13.170> drawing<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.590> couple

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
front of me and I'm drawing a couple

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.129 
front of me and I'm drawing a couple
more<00:00:14.009> pictures<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.730> couple<00:00:15.450> more<00:00:15.599> pages<00:00:15.780> of

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
more pictures on a couple more pages of

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.830 
more pictures on a couple more pages of
it<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.640> these<00:00:17.640> two<00:00:17.880> drawings<00:00:18.330> are<00:00:18.480> kind<00:00:18.720> of

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
it and these two drawings are kind of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.019 
it and these two drawings are kind of
experimental<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.859> exploratory<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.760> some

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
experimental and exploratory in some

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.960 
experimental and exploratory in some
ways<00:00:21.380> you'll<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.710> mostly<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> drawing

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
ways you'll see it mostly in the drawing

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939 
ways you'll see it mostly in the drawing
on<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.119> second<00:00:24.510> page<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.529> was<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.800> doing

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
on the second page that I was just doing

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.720 
on the second page that I was just doing
a<00:00:26.160> bunch<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.519> cross<00:00:26.789> hatching<00:00:28.460> it's<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.550> fun

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
a bunch of cross hatching it's a fun

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.450 
a bunch of cross hatching it's a fun
thing<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.939> practice<00:00:30.210> at<00:00:30.689> least<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.080> me

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
thing to practice at least for me

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.709 
thing to practice at least for me
sometimes<00:00:32.460> when<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.790> watching<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.210> show<00:00:33.450> on

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
sometimes when I'm watching a show on

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.970 
sometimes when I'm watching a show on
Netflix<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.410> something

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
Netflix or something

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.119 
Netflix or something
I'll<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> sketch<00:00:36.030> pad<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> pen<00:00:37.129> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I'll just have a sketch pad in a pen and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.500 
I'll just have a sketch pad in a pen and
I'll<00:00:38.250> fill<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> whole<00:00:38.790> page<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.270> cross

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
I'll fill the whole page with cross

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
I'll fill the whole page with cross
hatching<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.800> don't<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.340> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
hatching if you don't know how to do it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.400 
hatching if you don't know how to do it
just<00:00:42.030> look<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.540> Google<00:00:42.899> or<00:00:42.989> something

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
just look it up on Google or something

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.020 
just look it up on Google or something
I'm<00:00:43.920> sure<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.820> simple

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I'm sure there are some really simple

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.830 
I'm sure there are some really simple
directions<00:00:45.440> it's<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:46.680> easy<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.719> keep<00:00:48.719> in

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
directions it's really easy and keep in

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.970 
directions it's really easy and keep in
mind<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.230> there<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.440> tons<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.920> different

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
mind that there are tons of different

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.799 
mind that there are tons of different
ways<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.610> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
ways to do it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
ways to do it
I<00:00:51.840> don't<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.340> mess<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.550> or

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
I don't think you can really mess up or

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.600 
I don't think you can really mess up or
do<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> wrong<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.469> broad<00:00:55.710> term<00:00:56.070> but

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
do it wrong it's a really broad term but

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.119 
do it wrong it's a really broad term but
yeah<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.559> drawing<00:00:58.980> all

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
yeah I really like it just drawing all

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.150 
yeah I really like it just drawing all
these<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.489> parallel<00:01:00.120> lines<00:01:00.800> I'm<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:01.949> even

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
these little parallel lines I'm not even

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.619 
these little parallel lines I'm not even
sure<00:01:02.309> why<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.789> there's<00:01:03.030> something<00:01:03.420> really

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
sure why but there's something really

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.700 
sure why but there's something really
satisfying<00:01:04.909> just<00:01:06.380> something<00:01:07.380> cathartic

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
satisfying just something cathartic

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.310 
satisfying just something cathartic
about<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.570> it's<00:01:12.570> good<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
about it you know it's good to have a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.670 
about it you know it's good to have a
strong<00:01:13.770> style<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.720> certain<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.020> drawing

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
strong style or certain way of drawing

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.539 
strong style or certain way of drawing
or<00:01:17.659> certain<00:01:18.659> things<00:01:19.020> you're<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.130> good<00:01:20.369> at

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
or certain things you're really good at

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.330 
or certain things you're really good at
that<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.909> normally<00:01:21.360> draw<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.950> good<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> have

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that you normally draw it's good to have

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
that you normally draw it's good to have
something<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> bag

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
something like that in the bag

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.840 
something like that in the bag
maybe<00:01:26.100> something<00:01:26.460> you're<00:01:26.580> known<00:01:26.820> for

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
maybe something you're known for

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.510 
maybe something you're known for
something<00:01:27.860> you're<00:01:28.860> comfortable<00:01:29.400> with

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
something you're comfortable with

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700 
something you're comfortable with
drawing<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.810> always<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.200> back<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
drawing that you can always go back to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.420 
drawing that you can always go back to
and<00:01:31.950> work<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> need<00:01:33.259> reliability

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
and work with if you need reliability

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.590 
and work with if you need reliability
but<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.850> also<00:01:36.000> important<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
but I think it's also important to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.569 
but I think it's also important to
continue<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> try<00:01:37.500> new<00:01:37.740> things<00:01:37.770> from<00:01:38.250> time<00:01:38.430> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
continue to try new things from time to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.480 
continue to try new things from time to
time<00:01:38.659> even<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:41.310> ways

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
time even if it's just in little ways

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.600 
time even if it's just in little ways
you<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.600> I'm<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.049> saying<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.220> normally

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you know I'm not saying if you normally

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.600 
you know I'm not saying if you normally
like<00:01:44.759> drawing<00:01:45.149> say<00:01:46.159> pictures<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.310> people's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
like drawing say pictures of people's

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.889 
like drawing say pictures of people's
faces<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> pencil<00:01:50.509> I'm<00:01:51.509> not<00:01:51.659> saying<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
faces with a pencil I'm not saying you

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.289 
faces with a pencil I'm not saying you
need<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.530> some<00:01:52.680> oil<00:01:52.890> paints<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.060> start

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
need to go get some oil paints and start

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.709 
need to go get some oil paints and start
doing<00:01:54.689> abstract<00:01:55.880> landscapes<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.420> something

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
doing abstract landscapes or something

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.469 
doing abstract landscapes or something
crazy<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:58.229> I'm<00:01:58.469> suggesting<00:01:59.100> maybe<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.240> add

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
crazy I'm I'm suggesting maybe just add

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.200 
crazy I'm I'm suggesting maybe just add
a<00:02:00.509> little<00:02:00.840> twist<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.439> using<00:02:01.880> some<00:02:02.880> colored

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
a little twist like using some colored

to make it a bunch easier or get you
there<00:03:38.049> a<00:03:38.079> lot<00:03:38.319> faster<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:40.359> will<00:03:40.569> say<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.109> will

there a lot faster but I will say I will

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.710 
there a lot faster but I will say I will
say<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.949> it<00:03:42.940> really<00:03:43.060> helps<00:03:43.449> when<00:03:43.569> it's

two kinds of drawing and both are
important<00:04:17.079> there's<00:04:17.979> what<00:04:18.190> I'll<00:04:18.280> call

I<00:04:26.080> just<00:04:26.470> let<00:04:26.620> my<00:04:26.800> imagination<00:04:26.889> take<00:04:27.729> me<00:04:27.940> away

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
I just let my imagination take me away

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.029 
I just let my imagination take me away
and<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.509> have<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.720> blast<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.560> everything<00:04:29.919> is

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
and I have a blast and everything is

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.510 
and I have a blast and everything is
amazing<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.810> incredible<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.280> this<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.430> the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
amazing and incredible and this is the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.100 
amazing and incredible and this is the
kind<00:04:33.699> of<00:04:33.759> drawing<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.150> do<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.509> vast<00:04:34.750> majority

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
kind of drawing I do the vast majority

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.040 
kind of drawing I do the vast majority
of<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.680> time<00:04:35.940> it<00:04:36.940> might<00:04:37.120> sound<00:04:37.360> weird<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.840> say

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
of the time it might sound weird to say

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.640 
of the time it might sound weird to say
it<00:04:38.080> but<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.830> actually<00:04:39.069> regret<00:04:39.550> that<00:04:40.030> some

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
it but I actually regret that some

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.680 
it but I actually regret that some
because<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.770> means<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:42.159> do<00:04:42.220> barely<00:04:42.819> any<00:04:43.090> of<00:04:43.449> the

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
because it means I do barely any of the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.960 
because it means I do barely any of the
other<00:04:43.840> kind<00:04:44.199> of<00:04:44.319> drawing<00:04:44.620> which<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.520> guess<00:04:45.759> I'll

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
other kind of drawing which I guess I'll

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.249 
other kind of drawing which I guess I'll
call<00:04:47.129> studious<00:04:48.129> drawing<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.960> kind<00:04:50.169> of

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
call studious drawing the kind of

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.920 
call studious drawing the kind of
drawing<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:50.819> maybe<00:04:51.819> isn't<00:04:52.090> always<00:04:52.419> quite<00:04:52.780> as

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
drawing that maybe isn't always quite as

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.469 
drawing that maybe isn't always quite as
fun<00:04:53.289> that<00:04:54.099> I<00:04:54.129> categorized<00:04:54.759> in<00:04:54.940> my<00:04:55.090> mind<00:04:55.300> is

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
fun that I categorized in my mind is

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.379 
fun that I categorized in my mind is
practice<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:57.310> is<00:04:57.490> different<00:04:57.879> for<00:04:57.970> everyone

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
practice this is different for everyone

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.809 
practice this is different for everyone
because<00:04:58.690> everyone<00:04:58.990> likes<00:04:59.409> drawing<00:04:59.830> different

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
because everyone likes drawing different

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.980 
because everyone likes drawing different
things<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:03.580> some<00:05:03.819> things<00:05:03.849> get<00:05:04.240> left<00:05:04.449> out<00:05:04.690> and

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
things so some things get left out and

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.350 
things so some things get left out and
