00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.930
 established by that sound as very 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.930
 new 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.930
 I have a musical path of about 22 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.660
 years more or less I put him and in everything 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.180
 this time what I have done is to get 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.580
 head to music is what I 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.650
 passionate I started as a child 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.710
 with rock and roll empirically 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.480
 with the electric guitar then I was 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.700
 classical guitar while university 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.440
 we are going to study jazz but also 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.270
 scholarly composition then I had to 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.770
 see that it 's passion and a lot of theory 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.780
 all that hodgepodge of influences makes 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.540
 they make me a musician I consider versatile 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.060
 and I have done is what I consider 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.430
 important in an artist because all 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.830

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.680
 all styles one nurtures like 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.350
 person and as an artist 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.740
