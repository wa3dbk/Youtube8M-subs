00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
the end is I guess what we're trying to

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:49.990 
the end is I guess what we're trying to
do<00:01:49.070> right<00:01:49.220> now<00:01:49.399> it's<00:01:49.610> getting<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.880> little

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
do right now it's getting a little

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.249 
do right now it's getting a little
little<00:01:50.960> heck<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.350> go<00:01:51.500> there<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:52.930> yeah<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:54.140> would

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
little heck to go there but yeah I would

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.030
