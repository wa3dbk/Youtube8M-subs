00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
the other side we got our USB 3 bracket

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.270 
the other side we got our USB 3 bracket
which<00:03:08.269> has<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> larger<00:03:09.230> than<00:03:09.379> normal<00:03:09.440> connector

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
which has a larger than normal connector

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.809 
which has a larger than normal connector
on<00:03:10.459> there<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.599> my<00:03:11.750> first<00:03:12.110> time<00:03:12.379> using<00:03:13.310> USB

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
on there this is my first time using USB

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.720 
on there this is my first time using USB
3<00:03:14.209> motherboards<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.530> that's<00:03:16.400> going<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.640> be

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
3 motherboards so that's going to be

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.220 
3 motherboards so that's going to be
interesting<00:03:16.879> check<00:03:17.480> out<00:03:17.629> see<00:03:17.840> how<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.110> works

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
interesting check out see how that works

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.520 
interesting check out see how that works
out<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:19.220> then<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.549> got<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:19.879> big<00:03:20.530> thick

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
out and then you got this big thick

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.670 
out and then you got this big thick
manual<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.879> comes<00:03:23.090> with<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.450> obviously<00:03:24.440> driver

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
manual it comes with it obviously driver

codes that you need to look up and will

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.000 
codes that you need to look up and will
tell<00:05:53.430> you<00:05:53.550> what's<00:05:53.760> going<00:05:54.060> on<00:05:54.240> on<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:55.770> side

which<00:05:59.040> that's<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.760> lot<00:06:00.170> I<00:06:01.170> have<00:06:01.620> six<00:06:02.100> hard

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
which that's a lot I have six hard

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.390 
which that's a lot I have six hard
drives<00:06:02.430> so<00:06:03.090> that's<00:06:03.510> very<00:06:03.660> very<00:06:04.140> helpful<00:06:04.620> the

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.070 
drives so that's very very helpful the
black<00:06:05.700> ones<00:06:06.090> you<00:06:06.420> would<00:06:06.540> think<00:06:06.720> would<00:06:06.900> be<00:06:07.050> the

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
black ones you would think would be the

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.990 
black ones you would think would be the
say<00:06:07.410> two<00:06:07.470> threes<00:06:07.920> but<00:06:08.550> this<00:06:08.700> motherboard

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
say two threes but this motherboard

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.680 
say two threes but this motherboard
actually<00:06:09.720> has<00:06:09.870> 6<00:06:10.320> a-2<00:06:10.590> 3<00:06:11.010> ports<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:11.690> these

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
actually has 6 a-2 3 ports and these

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.920 
actually has 6 a-2 3 ports and these
four<00:06:13.050> actually<00:06:13.590> say<00:06:13.800> 22<00:06:14.160> so<00:06:15.090> for<00:06:15.570> blu-ray

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
four actually say 22 so for blu-ray

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
them into the black ones and for your

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.250 
them into the black ones and for your
hard<00:06:21.240> drives<00:06:21.480> you're<00:06:21.660> going<00:06:21.780> to<00:06:21.840> want<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.020> plug

them into the red ones so that's pretty
awesome<00:06:27.710> one<00:06:28.710> more<00:06:28.890> thing<00:06:29.100> to<00:06:29.220> note<00:06:29.400> I'm<00:06:29.640> not

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
awesome one more thing to note I'm not

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.220 
awesome one more thing to note I'm not
really<00:06:30.060> sure<00:06:30.180> if<00:06:30.360> you<00:06:30.540> can<00:06:30.630> see<00:06:30.690> it<00:06:30.900> very<00:06:31.110> well

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
really sure if you can see it very well

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.670 
really sure if you can see it very well
is<00:06:31.590> all<00:06:31.980> the<00:06:32.160> capacitors<00:06:32.790> are<00:06:33.000> gold-plated

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
is all the capacitors are gold-plated

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.140 
is all the capacitors are gold-plated
which<00:06:34.680> makes<00:06:35.040> it<00:06:35.160> the<00:06:35.220> board<00:06:35.610> seem<00:06:35.850> even<00:06:36.120> more

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
which makes it the board seem even more

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.140 
which makes it the board seem even more
premium<00:06:37.250> to<00:06:38.250> be<00:06:38.370> honest<00:06:38.610> I'm<00:06:38.730> not<00:06:38.760> really<00:06:38.910> sure

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
premium to be honest I'm not really sure

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.910 
premium to be honest I'm not really sure
if<00:06:39.330> this<00:06:39.540> really<00:06:39.720> helps<00:06:40.170> with<00:06:40.350> anything<00:06:40.740> as

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
if this really helps with anything as

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.880 
if this really helps with anything as
far<00:06:41.100> as<00:06:41.310> protecting<00:06:41.550> the<00:06:41.940> board<00:06:42.180> but<00:06:43.170> it<00:06:43.620> is

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
far as protecting the board but it is

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.130 
far as protecting the board but it is
kind<00:06:44.220> of<00:06:44.340> cool-looking<00:06:44.580> and<00:06:45.120> it<00:06:45.870> makes<00:06:46.020> it

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
kind of cool-looking and it makes it

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.660 
kind of cool-looking and it makes it
look<00:06:46.320> like<00:06:46.350> you're<00:06:46.620> not<00:06:46.680> wasting<00:06:47.070> money<00:06:47.490> on<00:06:47.580> a

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
look like you're not wasting money on a

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.550 
look like you're not wasting money on a
board<00:06:47.940> and<00:06:48.120> they<00:06:48.390> really<00:06:48.660> put<00:06:48.870> a<00:06:48.900> lot<00:06:48.990> of<00:06:49.110> time

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
board and they really put a lot of time

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.610 
board and they really put a lot of time
and<00:06:49.710> care<00:06:49.950> into<00:06:50.130> it<00:06:50.450> also<00:06:51.450> of<00:06:51.600> note<00:06:51.630> is<00:06:52.080> the

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
and care into it also of note is the

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.780 
and care into it also of note is the
fact<00:06:52.830> that<00:06:52.950> the<00:06:53.190> board<00:06:53.460> does<00:06:53.700> for<00:06:54.090> ddr3<00:06:54.570> 2133

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790 
fact that the board does for ddr3 2133

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.850 
fact that the board does for ddr3 2133
which<00:06:56.790> is<00:06:57.000> high<00:06:57.450> quality<00:06:58.020> very<00:06:58.350> very<00:06:58.620> fast

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860
