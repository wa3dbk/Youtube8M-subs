00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that the area in which we are going to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.630 
that the area in which we are going to
give<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.250> injection<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.660> let<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.050> sit<00:00:43.110> for

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
give the injection we let this sit for

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.130 
give the injection we let this sit for
approximately<00:00:44.640> two<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> three<00:00:45.450> minutes<00:00:45.809> and

it numbs the outer three cell layers of
the<00:00:49.440> mucosa<00:00:50.270> then<00:00:51.289> we<00:00:52.289> use<00:00:52.500> our<00:00:52.680> comfort

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the mucosa then we use our comfort

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.850 
the mucosa then we use our comfort
control<00:00:53.309> syringe<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> preset<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.739> the

control syringe that is preset to the
setting<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.430> where<00:00:56.699> we're<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.090> give<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
setting of where we're going to give the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.610 
setting of where we're going to give the
injection<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> controlled<00:01:00.930> rate<00:01:01.260> comes

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
injection and the controlled rate comes

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.000 
injection and the controlled rate comes
out<00:01:01.859> initially<00:01:02.160> very<00:01:02.789> slowly<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.719> few<00:01:04.409> drops<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
out initially very slowly a few drops of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.960 
out initially very slowly a few drops of
anesthesia<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.600> first<00:01:06.900> 10<00:01:07.260> seconds<00:01:07.970> this

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
anesthesia for the first 10 seconds this

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
anesthesia for the first 10 seconds this
eliminates<00:01:09.810> any<00:01:10.590> bulbus<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:12.409> liquid<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.740> in

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
eliminates any bulbus of liquid going in

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.550 
eliminates any bulbus of liquid going in
which<00:01:14.460> would<00:01:14.700> spread<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> tissue<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.900> cause

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
which would spread the tissue and cause

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.200 
which would spread the tissue and cause
discomfort

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.420 

we<00:01:19.660> remove<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.310> poo<00:01:22.120> tip<00:01:22.360> with<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.810> topical

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
we remove the poo tip with the topical

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.140 
we remove the poo tip with the topical
we<00:01:24.450> use<00:01:25.450> our<00:01:25.660> thumb<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.200> turn<00:01:26.470> on<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:27.250> syringe

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
we use our thumb to turn on the syringe

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.060 
we use our thumb to turn on the syringe
which<00:01:28.570> has<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.810> little<00:01:29.140> bit<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.380> clicking<00:01:29.830> and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
which has a little bit of clicking and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.840 
which has a little bit of clicking and
then<00:01:31.060> we<00:01:31.300> just<00:01:31.510> ever<00:01:31.870> so<00:01:32.350> slightly<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:33.190> gently

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
then we just ever so slightly and gently

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.010 
then we just ever so slightly and gently
begin<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:35.200> inject<00:01:36.330> after<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.479> first<00:01:37.720> 10

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
seconds it automatically begins to move

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.600
