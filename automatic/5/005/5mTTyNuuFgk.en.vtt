so we first have it the cleanser which

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
so we first have it the cleanser which
is<00:01:25.680> step<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.030> stuck<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> which

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
is step one then we have stuck to which

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
is step one then we have stuck to which
is<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.930> benzoyl<00:01:28.320> peroxide<00:01:28.890> acne<00:01:29.310> treatment

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
is the benzoyl peroxide acne treatment

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
is the benzoyl peroxide acne treatment
and<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> acne<00:01:30.450> lotion<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.290> there's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and this is acne lotion so there's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
and this is acne lotion so there's
actually<00:01:31.680> no<00:01:32.070> toner<00:01:32.369> required<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.299> this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
actually no toner required in this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.359 
actually no toner required in this
two-step<00:01:34.290> process<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
two-step process you just get the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.950 
two-step process you just get the
cleanser<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> lotion<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.630> you'll<00:01:36.750> want

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
cleanser and the lotion so you'll want

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
cleanser and the lotion so you'll want
to<00:01:36.990> cleanse<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.710> treat<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to cleanse with this treat with this and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
to cleanse with this treat with this and
they<00:01:39.540> also<00:01:39.750> include<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.470> tiny<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:41.100> bonus

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
they also include a tiny little bonus

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.010 
they also include a tiny little bonus
and<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> acne<00:01:42.720> spot<00:01:42.990> corrector

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and this is the acne spot corrector

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560 
and this is the acne spot corrector
which<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.649> five<00:01:43.829> percent<00:01:44.250> benzoyl<00:01:44.909> peroxide

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
which is five percent benzoyl peroxide

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
which is five percent benzoyl peroxide
so<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.020> treat<00:01:46.229> acne<00:01:46.470> breakouts<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.130> fade

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
so you can treat acne breakouts and fade

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
so you can treat acne breakouts and fade
dark<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.180> red<00:01:48.329> marks<00:01:48.630> at<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.930> which<00:01:49.110> is

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
dark and red marks at this which is

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.749 
dark and red marks at this which is
really<00:01:49.470> nice<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
really nice so I think that that's a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.609 
really nice so I think that that's a
really<00:01:51.149> nice<00:01:51.390> two-step<00:01:51.869> system<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.500> is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
really nice two-step system and this is

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
really nice two-step system and this is
a<00:01:52.649> great<00:01:52.890> little<00:01:53.310> added<00:01:53.970> bonus<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.689> that's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
a great little added bonus and that's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.870 
a great little added bonus and that's
pretty<00:01:55.470> inexpensive<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.759> get

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
pretty inexpensive for all that you get

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.090 
pretty inexpensive for all that you get
in<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.210> next<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> medicated<00:01:58.590> acne

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
in there next we have the medicated acne

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
in there next we have the medicated acne
cleansing<00:01:59.549> wipes<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.969> 2%<00:02:00.299> salicylic<00:02:01.020> acid

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
cleansing wipes with 2% salicylic acid

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.870 
cleansing wipes with 2% salicylic acid
and<00:02:01.560> these<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.860> only<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.430> seven

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
and these are only like seven
ninety-nine<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:03.810> again<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.439> line

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
ninety-nine I think so again this line

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.609 
ninety-nine I think so again this line
is<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.340> really<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:06.090> inexpensive<00:02:06.990> Dr
