stretchy<00:00:05.910> bind-off<00:00:07.010> our<00:00:08.059> supplies<00:00:09.650> yarn<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
stretchy bind-off our supplies yarn and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.749 
stretchy bind-off our supplies yarn and
needles<00:00:12.290> now<00:00:13.290> we're<00:00:13.769> starting<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.580> this

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
needles now we're starting with this

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.670 
needles now we're starting with this
little<00:00:15.000> square<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:17.000> stockinette<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.680> we're

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
little square of stockinette and we're

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.730 
little square of stockinette and we're
going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.130> bind<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.850> off<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.560> right

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
going to bind this off now on the right

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.230 
going to bind this off now on the right
side<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:26.250> we're<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.699> knit<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.060> first

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
side so we're going to knit the first

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.210 
side so we're going to knit the first
stitch<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.380> would<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.859> regular

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
stitch just like we would for a regular

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.400 
stitch just like we would for a regular
bind<00:00:29.519> off<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.120> where<00:00:33.450> things<00:00:33.690> change

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
bind off so this is where things change

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.049 
bind off so this is where things change
and<00:00:34.770> we're<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.200> yarn<00:00:38.190> over<00:00:38.370> purl

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and we're going to do a yarn over purl

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
and we're going to do a yarn over purl
wise<00:00:39.300> which<00:00:40.170> means<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> goes<00:00:40.710> from<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> back

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
wise which means it goes from the back

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.209 
wise which means it goes from the back
to<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.239> front<00:00:42.510> over<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.899> top<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:44.010> we're

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
to the front over the top and then we're

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.400 
to the front over the top and then we're
going<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> knit<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:47.660> we're<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> drop

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
going to knit and we're going to drop

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
going to knit and we're going to drop
the<00:00:49.920> bind<00:00:50.160> off<00:00:50.930> off<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:53.789> needle<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:58.430> then

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the bind off off the needle and then

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.250 
the bind off off the needle and then
we're<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> drop<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.510> original<00:01:00.960> stitch

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
we're going to drop the original stitch

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
we're going to drop the original stitch
off<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.559> needle<00:01:01.940> now<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> trick<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
off the needle now the trick to a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
off the needle now the trick to a
stretchy<00:01:04.080> bind<00:01:04.470> off<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.949> how<00:01:05.159> much<00:01:05.339> yarn<00:01:05.640> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
stretchy bind off is how much yarn you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.140 
stretchy bind off is how much yarn you
put<00:01:06.119> into<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> bind<00:01:06.780> off<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:08.130> has<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.820> lot

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
put into the bind off and this has a lot

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.410 
put into the bind off and this has a lot
of<00:01:09.210> extra<00:01:09.659> yarn<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.350> once<00:01:10.680> again<00:01:11.210> we're<00:01:12.210> going

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
of extra yarn so once again we're going

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.590 
of extra yarn so once again we're going
to<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> yarn<00:01:13.170> over<00:01:14.150> we're<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> knit

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
to do a yarn over we're going to knit

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.510 
to do a yarn over we're going to knit
we're<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> pull<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> yarn<00:01:19.140> over<00:01:19.680> over

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
we're going to pull the yarn over over

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
we're going to pull the yarn over over
the<00:01:20.640> top<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.810> we're<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> pass

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the top and then we're going to pass

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.640 
the top and then we're going to pass
that<00:01:23.180> left<00:01:24.180> first<00:01:24.450> stitch<00:01:24.720> over<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> top<00:01:25.439> as

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that left first stitch over the top as

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.569 
that left first stitch over the top as
well<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.799> stitch<00:01:29.040> left<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
well so we have one stitch left on the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.850 
well so we have one stitch left on the
needle<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.450> time<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.740> yarn<00:01:31.950> over<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
needle so it's time to yarn over and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.910 
needle so it's time to yarn over and
that's<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.009> purlwise<00:01:35.369> yarn<00:01:35.520> over<00:01:36.320> or<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that's a purlwise yarn over or it's the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.090 
that's a purlwise yarn over or it's the
normal<00:01:38.280> yarn<00:01:38.700> over<00:01:38.850> before<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.210> purl<00:01:39.479> stitch

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
normal yarn over before a purl stitch

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.929 
normal yarn over before a purl stitch
drop<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.340> yarn<00:01:41.520> over<00:01:41.700> over<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> top<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.939> then

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
drop the yarn over over the top and then

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.520 
drop the yarn over over the top and then
drop<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> stitch

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.150 

so<00:01:49.420> before<00:01:50.420> if<00:01:50.510> we<00:01:50.690> do<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.440> next<00:01:51.650> stitch<00:01:51.890> let's

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
so before if we do the next stitch let's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.550 
so before if we do the next stitch let's
go<00:01:52.310> ahead<00:01:52.400> we'll<00:01:52.670> do<00:01:52.820> our<00:01:52.940> yarn<00:01:53.210> over<00:01:53.570> knit<00:01:53.780> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
go ahead we'll do our yarn over knit a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.780 
go ahead we'll do our yarn over knit a
stitch<00:01:56.110> drop<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.620> yarn<00:01:57.860> over<00:01:58.160> over<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.580> top

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
stitch drop the yarn over over the top

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.610 
stitch drop the yarn over over the top
and<00:02:00.729> then<00:02:01.729> pass<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.300> stitch<00:02:02.570> over<00:02:03.290> as<00:02:03.410> well

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
and then pass that stitch over as well

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.090 
and then pass that stitch over as well
one<00:02:04.070> at<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.280> time<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.440> can<00:02:09.619> see<00:02:09.830> how<00:02:09.979> much

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
one at a time so you can see how much

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.750 
one at a time so you can see how much
yarn<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:10.970> bind<00:02:11.540> off<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.110> how<00:02:12.980> super

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
yarn is in that bind off and how super

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.070 
yarn is in that bind off and how super
stretchy<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:17.330> this<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.630> great<00:02:17.870> way<00:02:18.050> to

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
stretchy it is so this is a great way to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.780 
stretchy it is so this is a great way to
get<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.380> extra<00:02:18.740> yarn<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.280> your<00:02:19.370> bind<00:02:19.610> off

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
get that extra yarn and your bind off

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.810 
get that extra yarn and your bind off
and<00:02:20.350> make<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.380> stretchy<00:02:21.830> without<00:02:22.400> having<00:02:22.730> to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
and make it stretchy without having to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.740 
and make it stretchy without having to
do<00:02:22.940> anything<00:02:23.209> too<00:02:24.080> weird<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:25.239> here<00:02:26.239> we<00:02:26.360> are<00:02:26.390> at

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
do anything too weird so here we are at

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.330 
do anything too weird so here we are at
the<00:02:26.900> last<00:02:27.110> one<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.620> I'll<00:02:27.680> show<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.920> we're

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the last one and I'll show you we're

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.710 
the last one and I'll show you we're
going<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.489> finish<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:28.970> off<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.510> like<00:02:29.660> a

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
going to finish this off just like a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.979 
going to finish this off just like a
regular<00:02:30.050> bind<00:02:30.530> off<00:02:30.850> we're<00:02:31.850> going<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.060> pass<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
regular bind off we're going to pass the

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.910 
regular bind off we're going to pass the
yarn<00:02:33.110> over<00:02:33.489> pass<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.790> stitch<00:02:38.500> we<00:02:39.500> have<00:02:39.650> one

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920
