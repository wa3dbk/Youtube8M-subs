00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
had to replace on my exhaust because I

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.410

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.100 
the cooling ducts that they couldn't put
on<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.819> i<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.270> frame<00:02:21.510> connectors<00:02:21.959> on

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the bottom of the car so off to put them

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.010 
the bottom of the car so off to put them
on<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:26.069> uh<00:02:26.240> it's<00:02:27.240> figured<00:02:27.540> i'd<00:02:27.630> give<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.870> guys

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
on but uh it's figured i'd give you guys

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.730 
on but uh it's figured i'd give you guys
a<00:02:28.050> good<00:02:28.290> once<00:02:29.190> over<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.810> interior<00:02:31.110> pieces<00:02:31.440> i

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
a good once over the interior pieces i

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.880 
a good once over the interior pieces i
guess<00:02:32.550> they<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.790> swap<00:02:33.240> them<00:02:33.420> out<00:02:33.680> cuz<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.770> they

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
guess they just swap them out cuz I they

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.699 
guess they just swap them out cuz I they
can<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> headrest<00:02:36.270> or<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.709> console

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
can get the headrest or the console

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.470 
can get the headrest or the console
cover<00:02:37.890> back<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.459> guess<00:02:39.300> they're<00:02:39.450> just

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
cover back I guess they're just

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.650 
cover back I guess they're just
recovering<00:02:40.080> them<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.209> pretty<00:02:42.420> much<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
recovering them so that's pretty much it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.020 
recovering them so that's pretty much it
I<00:02:43.190> hope<00:02:44.190> if<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.430> guys<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:44.760> any<00:02:44.850> questions
