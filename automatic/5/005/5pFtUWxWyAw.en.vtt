00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
all the way towards the house then the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.940 
all the way towards the house then the

there<00:00:52.510> but<00:00:53.510> i'm<00:00:53.780> actually<00:00:54.110> at<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.160> start<00:00:55.489> of

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
there but i'm actually at the start of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.700 
there but i'm actually at the start of
my<00:00:55.789> property<00:00:56.570> line<00:00:57.309> which<00:00:58.309> is<00:00:58.340> this<00:00:59.590> we<00:01:00.590> have

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
my property line which is this we have

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.859 
my property line which is this we have
about<00:01:00.890> 30<00:01:01.219> feet<00:01:01.460> back<00:01:01.699> into<00:01:01.760> these<00:01:02.149> woods<00:01:04.869> well

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869

about 30 feet back into these woods well
i'm<00:01:06.170> guessing<00:01:06.649> because<00:01:06.799> i<00:01:07.069> can't<00:01:07.279> really<00:01:07.429> walk

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:07.639 
i'm guessing because i can't really walk

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:10.179 
i'm guessing because i can't really walk
all<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.029> way<00:01:08.060> back<00:01:08.149> in<00:01:08.539> there<00:01:08.719> yet<00:01:09.159> vol<00:01:10.159> II

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
shows the length of the area that we're

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.279 
shows the length of the area that we're
going<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.649> be<00:02:02.740> building<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.130> trails<00:02:03.429> so<00:02:04.289> we're

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
going to be building the trails so we're

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.620 
going to be building the trails so we're
going<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.470> have<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> run<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.299> way<00:02:07.330> down

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
going to have a run all the way down

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.590 
going to have a run all the way down
that<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:08.170> doubles<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:10.060> run<00:02:10.239> all<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.569> way<00:02:10.599> back

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
that of doubles to run all the way back

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.699 
that of doubles to run all the way back
and<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.660> might<00:02:13.840> be<00:02:13.930> able<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.170> split<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.530> more

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
and I might be able to split it more

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.670 
and I might be able to split it more
than<00:02:14.799> twice<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.400> we<00:02:16.390> might<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.780> pretty

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
than twice so we might have a pretty

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:59.170 
than twice so we might have a pretty
good<00:02:18.220> setup<00:02:18.459> at<00:02:18.700> here

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180

and right now this is the quarter and

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.029 
and right now this is the quarter and
there's<00:04:25.050> going<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.260> be<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.380> hat<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:25.770> basically

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
there's going to be a hat it's basically

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.050 
there's going to be a hat it's basically
gonna<00:04:26.220> be<00:04:26.310> half<00:04:26.490> height<00:04:26.669> but<00:04:26.760> it's<00:04:26.880> going<00:04:27.000> to

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
gonna be half height but it's going to

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.310 
gonna be half height but it's going to
be<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.150> bowl<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.600> its<00:04:27.780> going<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.960> wrap<00:04:28.140> around

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
be a bowl to its going to wrap around

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.080 
be a bowl to its going to wrap around
we're<00:04:28.620> going<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.800> chop<00:04:29.130> out<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.430> tree<00:04:29.669> is

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
we're going to chop out that tree is

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.940 
we're going to chop out that tree is
going<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.330> wrap<00:04:30.479> around<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.810> be<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.930> bowl<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.410> so

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
going to wrap around to be a bowl and so

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.290 
going to wrap around to be a bowl and so
basically<00:04:32.100> it's<00:04:32.610> going<00:04:32.729> to<00:04:32.789> come<00:04:32.910> up<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.180> this

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
basically it's going to come up to this

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.690 
basically it's going to come up to this
height<00:04:33.539> when<00:04:33.870> we're<00:04:34.020> done<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.860> we're<00:04:35.580> going

height when we're done and we're going

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.640 
height when we're done and we're going
to<00:04:35.760> have<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:35.910> jump<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:36.720> you'll<00:04:36.870> jump<00:04:37.169> into<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
to have a jump so you'll jump into the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.159 
to have a jump so you'll jump into the
berm<00:04:37.890> roll<00:04:38.850> around<00:04:38.970> in<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.330> jump<00:04:39.600> going<00:04:39.900> out<00:04:40.050> of

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
berm roll around in a jump going out of

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.409 
berm roll around in a jump going out of
the<00:04:40.260> burn<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:41.789> will<00:04:41.910> be<00:04:42.030> how<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.240> get

with new of this weird angles we're

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.250 
with new of this weird angles we're
officers<00:05:45.920> have<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.190> main<00:05:46.520> line<00:05:46.930> coming<00:05:47.930> through

officers have a main line coming through

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.160 
officers have a main line coming through
here<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:49.160> when<00:05:49.310> this<00:05:49.400> wraps<00:05:49.670> around<00:05:50.020> this<00:05:51.020> is

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
here and when this wraps around this is

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.110 
here and when this wraps around this is
going<00:05:51.320> to<00:05:51.380> be<00:05:51.470> a<00:05:51.500> landing<00:05:51.890> ramp<00:05:52.040> and<00:05:52.670> decides

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
going to be a landing ramp and decides

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.060 
going to be a landing ramp and decides
put<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.960> line<00:05:54.170> probably<00:05:54.470> start<00:05:54.800> down<00:05:54.920> there

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
put the line probably start down there

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.670 
put the line probably start down there
supposed<00:05:55.730> to<00:05:55.760> be<00:05:55.820> an<00:05:56.000> anagram<00:05:56.350> home<00:05:57.350> it's

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
supposed to be an anagram home it's

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.850 
supposed to be an anagram home it's
gonna<00:05:57.830> probably<00:05:58.100> go<00:05:58.340> way<00:05:58.520> down<00:05:58.580> there

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
gonna probably go way down there

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.750 
gonna probably go way down there
eventually<00:06:00.860> when<00:06:01.010> they<00:06:01.100> get<00:06:01.250> the<00:06:01.340> Bobcat

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
eventually when they get the Bobcat

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.130 
eventually when they get the Bobcat
they'll<00:06:02.000> probably<00:06:02.210> have<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.419> pond<00:06:02.750> out<00:06:02.960> there

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
they'll probably have a pond out there

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.140 
they'll probably have a pond out there
and<00:06:03.350> we're<00:06:03.500> going<00:06:03.620> to<00:06:03.650> build<00:06:03.860> a<00:06:04.190> section<00:06:05.060> of

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
and we're going to build a section of

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.240 
and we're going to build a section of
the<00:06:05.270> wine<00:06:05.450> to<00:06:05.660> go<00:06:05.840> out<00:06:05.990> and<00:06:06.200> jump<00:06:06.770> into<00:06:06.950> the

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
the wine to go out and jump into the

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.520 
the wine to go out and jump into the
pawn<00:06:10.120> but<00:06:11.120> yeah<00:06:11.300> that's<00:06:11.540> basically<00:06:11.930> what<00:06:12.440> we

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
pawn but yeah that's basically what we

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.200 
pawn but yeah that's basically what we
have<00:06:12.710> so<00:06:12.919> far<00:06:12.950> right<00:06:13.910> there<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:15.700> it's<00:06:16.700> two

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
have so far right there and it's two

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.140
