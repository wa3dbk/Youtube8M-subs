right<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.860> still<00:01:53.130> got<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.340> option<00:01:53.880> but

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
right here you still got that option but

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.280 
right here you still got that option but
this<00:01:54.270> TCU<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.649> kind<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
this TCU I think I'm kind of I want to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
this TCU I think I'm kind of I want to
know<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> guess<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
know what this is so I guess we have to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.139 
know what this is so I guess we have to
find<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:01.049> later<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.880> next<00:02:02.880> thing<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
find out later on next thing that I

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.780 
find out later on next thing that I
noticed<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:04.229> fix<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.250> gibberish

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
noticed is that they fix the gibberish

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.510 
noticed is that they fix the gibberish
lettering<00:02:06.509> inside<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> file<00:02:07.799> explorer<00:02:08.280> on

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
lettering inside the file explorer on

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.880 
lettering inside the file explorer on
the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.690 
the
last<00:02:09.190> bill<00:02:09.490> which<00:02:09.729> is<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:09.940> think<00:02:10.920> 174<00:02:11.920> this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
last bill which is I think 174 this

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.670 
last bill which is I think 174 this
right<00:02:12.910> here<00:02:13.060> like<00:02:13.180> gibberish<00:02:13.450> has<00:02:14.260> some<00:02:14.500> crazy

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
right here like gibberish has some crazy

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.510 
right here like gibberish has some crazy
symbols<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:15.760> they<00:02:15.880> fixed<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:18.340> next

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
symbols so they fixed that and the next

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.580 
symbols so they fixed that and the next
thing<00:02:18.670> down<00:02:18.850> notice<00:02:19.240> at<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.660> taskbar<00:02:20.230> they
