00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
suddenly have this unexplainable Lisp

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.089 
suddenly have this unexplainable Lisp
this<00:00:12.059> won't<00:00:12.330> affect<00:00:12.630> my<00:00:12.809> acting<00:00:13.259> at<00:00:13.349> all<00:00:13.500> or<00:00:13.830> my

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
this won't affect my acting at all or my

this won't affect my acting at all or my
voiceover<00:00:14.639> work<00:00:14.940> because<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.719> can't<00:00:15.839> take<00:00:16.350> this

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
voiceover work because I can't take this

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.189 
voiceover work because I can't take this
thing<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.880> when<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.090> do<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.300> sound<00:00:18.690> exactly

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
thing out and when I do I sound exactly

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
thing out and when I do I sound exactly
the<00:00:19.500> same<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.460> can't<00:00:20.850> really<00:00:21.000> tell<00:00:21.240> that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the same and you can't really tell that

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.509 
the same and you can't really tell that
I'm<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> brace<00:00:21.930> fairy<00:00:22.230> which<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.680> really<00:00:22.920> enjoy

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
I'm a brace fairy which I really enjoy

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.820 
I'm a brace fairy which I really enjoy
apparently<00:00:24.449> police<00:00:24.630> will<00:00:25.140> go<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
apparently police will go in for the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.290 
apparently police will go in for the
next<00:00:25.920> couple<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.340> days<00:00:26.580> which<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.150> pretty

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
next couple of days which I'm pretty

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
next couple of days which I'm pretty
hoping<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.810> case<00:00:28.109> because<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> moment

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
hoping is the case because at the moment

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
hoping is the case because at the moment
it<00:00:29.490> feels<00:00:29.730> quite<00:00:30.119> odd<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.109> able<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
it feels quite odd not to be able to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.799 
it feels quite odd not to be able to
speak<00:00:31.830> properly<00:00:32.309> quite<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> few<00:00:33.329> people<00:00:33.510> have

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
speak properly quite a few people have

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.240 
speak properly quite a few people have
said<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> me<00:00:34.260> they<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.649> see<00:00:34.800> why<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> need

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
said to me they don't see why I need

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.100 
said to me they don't see why I need
your<00:00:35.340> brace<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.910> I've<00:00:36.450> got<00:00:36.690> fairly

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
your brace because I've got fairly

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.709 
your brace because I've got fairly
straight<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.710> anyway<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.390> feel

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
straight to you anyway but when you feel

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.750 
straight to you anyway but when you feel
that<00:00:40.200> something<00:00:40.469> about<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.100> doesn't<00:00:41.489> look

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that something about you doesn't look

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.299 
that something about you doesn't look
right<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.660> massively<00:00:43.379> detrimental<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> your

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
right it's massively detrimental to your

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.040 
right it's massively detrimental to your
confidence<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.969> I've<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.840> my

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
confidence and I've really not like my

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.760 
confidence and I've really not like my
teeth<00:00:46.260> since<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.829> about<00:00:46.920> 18<00:00:47.629> or<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
teeth since I was about 18 or so and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.580 
teeth since I was about 18 or so and
it's<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.219> things<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
it's on these things like it's not a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's on these things like it's not a
huge<00:00:52.590> thing<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.550> people<00:00:53.820> probably

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
huge thing like a lot of people probably

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
huge thing like a lot of people probably
won't<00:00:54.270> see<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> huge<00:00:54.989> difference<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> will

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
won't see a huge difference but I will

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
listen in the comments below and I will

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
listen in the comments below and I will
answer<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.159> best<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.760> ability<00:01:09.150> but

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
answer it to the best of my ability but

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
answer it to the best of my ability but
basically<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:10.530> take<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> mold<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.369> mouth

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
basically they take a mold of your mouth

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
basically they take a mold of your mouth
that<00:01:11.970> kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.450> playdough<00:01:12.840> putty<00:01:13.470> stuff<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that kind of playdough putty stuff and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.170 
that kind of playdough putty stuff and
then<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.210> create<00:01:15.540> plastic<00:01:16.369> braces<00:01:17.369> then

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
then they create plastic braces then

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.660 
then they create plastic braces then
every<00:01:18.689> 10<00:01:18.990> days<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.530> 12<00:01:19.799> days<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.250> changed

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
every 10 days to 12 days you changed

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.429 
every 10 days to 12 days you changed
those<00:01:20.850> braces<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> slightly<00:01:21.840> tighter<00:01:22.110> one

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
those braces for a slightly tighter one

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.830 
those braces for a slightly tighter one
and<00:01:23.150> hopefully<00:01:24.150> at<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> end<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.600> them<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
