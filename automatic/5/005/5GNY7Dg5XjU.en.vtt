00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
tea plushie and I stopped on the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.690 
tea plushie and I stopped on the
stitched<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.530> bubbles<00:01:52.530> against<00:01:53.010> using<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
stitched on the bubbles against using a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.730 
stitched on the bubbles against using a
pal<00:01:54.000> stitch<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:55.080> lot<00:01:55.260> of<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.710> been

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
pal stitch and a lot of you have been

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.500 
pal stitch and a lot of you have been
asking<00:01:56.190> me<00:01:56.369> how<00:01:56.580> I<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.970> make<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.390> look

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
asking me how I actually make it look

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.880 
asking me how I actually make it look
like<00:01:57.900> embroider

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
like embroider

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.330 
like embroider
but<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.430> actually<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.750> cells<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.070> going

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
but it's actually just cells just going

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.280 
but it's actually just cells just going
on<00:02:02.550> over<00:02:03.090> each<00:02:03.240> other<00:02:03.540> over<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.020> over<00:02:04.229> again

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
on over each other over and over again

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.960 
on over each other over and over again
until<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:04.830> happy<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.430> way<00:02:05.460> or<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
until I'm happy with the way or the

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.359 
until I'm happy with the way or the
texture<00:02:06.300> it<00:02:06.630> gives<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.560> simply<00:02:08.009> think<00:02:08.280> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
texture it gives and I simply think that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.310 
texture it gives and I simply think that
you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.970> gives<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.420> plushies<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
you know it gives your plushies like a

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.740 
you know it gives your plushies like a
very<00:02:10.649> cute<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.760> I'm<00:02:11.850> like<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> need<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.540> loop

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
very cute and so I'm like I need to loop

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.690 
very cute and so I'm like I need to loop
I<00:02:12.870> guess<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:14.010> optional<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.459> can

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
I guess but this is optional you can

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.880 
I guess but this is optional you can
just<00:02:14.910> do<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.270> normal<00:02:15.420> cell<00:02:15.840> stitches<00:02:16.260> if<00:02:16.500> you

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
just do the normal cell stitches if you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.830 
just do the normal cell stitches if you
want<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.700> you're<00:02:17.910> going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.120> put<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
want so you're going to put on the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330 
want so you're going to put on the
bubbles<00:02:19.230> using<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> file<00:02:19.860> station<00:02:20.100> around

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
bubbles using a file station around

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.280 
bubbles using a file station around
thread<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.120> then<00:02:21.690> you're<00:02:21.900> going<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.110> go<00:02:22.230> ahead

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
thread and then you're going to go ahead

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770
