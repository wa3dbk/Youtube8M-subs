00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.710
 hello dear hungry should actually 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.230
 my theme today is more christmas tree 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.669
 but ground was I was now for 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.919
 Christmas market I'm scared about 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.419
 the prices for burnt almonds or have 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.849
 you just let me do it now 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.710
 myself I promise you 200 grams 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.379
 roasted almonds under ten minutes 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 under one euro and everything completely 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.219
 easy to do there is only one 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.870
 small problem only to later we 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.910
 need for it and actually there is 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.070
 only two compulsory components that is 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.739
 Sugar I recommend powdered sugar you can 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.140
 also to take normal cases and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.840
 of course the almonds so the short 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 that would be because blood sugar then it would be 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.140
 likes a liqueur 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.380
 I think like lisa similar whiskey 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.809
 liquid excellent is suitable amaretto 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.870
 the almond de coeur is our marzipan 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.840
 You can also taste vanilla 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.060
 or take a chocolate liqueur and then 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.950
 spices in any case cinnamon but you 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.020
 Can also be cardamom or coriander to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.479
 For example, he uses an inheritance 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.399
 Of course, it can also be spicy 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.639
 a pinch of salt or pepper or 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.259
 Use chili to heat crude oil 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:22.350
 pan at the highest level give the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.659
 almonds one of these greatest short ones 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.039
 about one to one and a half minutes 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.179
 could also be your own taste 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.950
 decide if he is this highest 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.539
 wanted to have something more intense taste 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.659
 then you come to learn one 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:37.039
 bowl and we add 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.039
 three tablespoons of pure chance 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:48.410
 1 packet of vanilla sugar 25 and whole 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.450
 important two tablespoons of water and one 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.040
 tablespoon of the liqueur you can 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.540
 breeding the body with was natural 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.090
 take three tablespoons of water and 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.770
 at least one and a half water should 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.540
 be if he holds a bit more on 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 wanted to take an alcohol and now 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.480
 stir everything and in the microwave 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.710
 give 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060
 the whole thing works in the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.560
 pan but we do it today in the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.700
 microwave just goes faster and 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.830
 works wonderfully 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.200
 I put in the microwave on 750 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.450
 Wad and communities stay together 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.860
 about three and a half minutes in it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.420
 should you with a different performance 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.280
 work then changes course 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.900
 even the times so higher performance 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.730
 a little shorter time and vice versa 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.410
 However, we interrupt the templates 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.360
 after about one and a half minutes 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.850
 get out of the bowl and stir 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.410
 orderly and stir 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.970
 So there is still liquid 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.970
 so also off to the microwave for 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.270
 about two melodies and now they look like that 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.740
 as we want them 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.180
 we have prepared as packing paper 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.100
 and give the almonds to cool 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.750
 on it and now the problem also emerges 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.010
 I talked about earlier 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.380
 will notice that now the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.300
 Entirely bude enticingly after the 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.709
 burned man and smells and the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.970
 they are most likely to prompt you right away 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.070
 want and now you have to 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.540
 human strengths boysen for her 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.090
 wanted to pack the almond and beautiful 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.010
 acura uncle friend or the hundreds 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.510
 Neighbors give a lot of fun while 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.230
 selbermachen until next time 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.230
 bye bye
