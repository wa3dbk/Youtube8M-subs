hi<00:00:00.960> my<00:00:01.230> name<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.410> Dawson<00:00:01.890> church<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:02.490> I<00:00:03.090> am<00:00:03.360> so

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hi my name is Dawson church and I am so

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.720 
hi my name is Dawson church and I am so
excited<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.650> tell<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:05.100> our<00:00:05.609> new

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
excited to tell you about our new

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.589 
excited to tell you about our new
workshop<00:00:06.390> called<00:00:07.080> eft<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:09.179> awakened

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
workshop called eft and the awakened

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.129 
workshop called eft and the awakened
mind<00:00:10.340> cultivating<00:00:11.340> advanced<00:00:12.300> brain<00:00:12.750> States

mind cultivating advanced brain States
this<00:00:14.040> workshop<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.549> fun<00:00:15.030> partly<00:00:15.809> because<00:00:15.929> we

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
this workshop is fun partly because we

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800 
this workshop is fun partly because we
hook<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.190> up<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> monitor<00:00:17.910> brain<00:00:18.390> wave

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
hook you up to a monitor brain wave

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.320 
hook you up to a monitor brain wave
monitor<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.560> actually<00:00:20.220> monitor<00:00:20.640> your

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
monitor and actually monitor your

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
monitor and actually monitor your
brainwaves<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:22.199> real<00:00:22.350> time<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.920> see<00:00:23.100> what

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
brainwaves in real time you see what

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.279 
brainwaves in real time you see what
your<00:00:23.340> brain<00:00:23.490> looks<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.960> state

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
your brain looks like and what state

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.259 
your brain looks like and what state
sits<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.710> there<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.490> four<00:00:26.820> primary

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
sits in there are four primary

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.779 
sits in there are four primary
frequencies<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.349> measure<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.369> highest

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
frequencies we measure the highest

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.510 
frequencies we measure the highest
frequency<00:00:30.240> waves<00:00:30.449> are<00:00:30.840> beta<00:00:31.289> waves<00:00:31.590> next

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
frequency waves are beta waves next

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.090 
frequency waves are beta waves next
comes<00:00:32.820> alpha<00:00:33.360> waves<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.020> finally<00:00:34.500> there<00:00:35.070> are

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
comes alpha waves and finally there are

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.610 
comes alpha waves and finally there are
fatal<00:00:35.700> waves<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.750> lowest<00:00:37.020> frequency<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
fatal waves and the lowest frequency is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.160 
fatal waves and the lowest frequency is
called<00:00:37.860> delta<00:00:38.399> waves<00:00:38.610> when<00:00:39.510> people<00:00:39.930> are<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.110> a

me training how to do is between what it
feels<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.610> your<00:01:20.820> body<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.930> this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
feels like in your body to have this

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.929 
feels like in your body to have this
awaken<00:01:22.530> line<00:01:22.740> state<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.729> when

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
awaken line state so you know when

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
awaken line state so you know when
you're<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.180> state<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.439> called

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you're in that state and it's called

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.700 
you're in that state and it's called
cultivating<00:01:26.430> these<00:01:26.549> states<00:01:27.180> because<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.470> show

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
cultivating these states because we show

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.160 
cultivating these states because we show
you<00:01:28.799> how<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> invoke<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:29.930> frequencies<00:01:30.930> at

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
you how to invoke these frequencies at

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
you how to invoke these frequencies at
will<00:01:31.619> during<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.490> everyday<00:01:32.670> life<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.210> if

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
will during your everyday life so if

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.760 
will during your everyday life so if
you're<00:01:33.390> feeling<00:01:33.420> stressed<00:01:33.990> everything

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
you're feeling stressed everything

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.440 
you're feeling stressed everything
unbalanced<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:35.939> back<00:01:36.180> into<00:01:36.390> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
unbalanced you can get back into that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
unbalanced you can get back into that
