for<00:00:00.149> one<00:00:00.299> hello<00:00:01.260> everyone<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:02.330> mr.<00:00:03.330> 13

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
for one hello everyone this is mr. 13

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.980 
for one hello everyone this is mr. 13
things<00:00:04.020> I'm<00:00:04.799> putting<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.279> together<00:00:05.930> as<00:00:06.930> a

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
things I'm putting this together as a

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.049 
things I'm putting this together as a
demonstration<00:00:07.440> for<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.550> job<00:00:08.880> interview

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
demonstration for a job interview

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.450 
demonstration for a job interview
actually<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:09.929> if<00:00:10.260> you've<00:00:10.650> gotten<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.160> I

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
actually so if you've gotten to this I

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.629 
actually so if you've gotten to this I
guess<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.000> made<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.540> interview<00:00:13.429> but<00:00:14.429> I'm

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
guess I made it to the interview but I'm

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.369 
guess I made it to the interview but I'm
going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.969> use<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.570> take<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.929> chance<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.350> to

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
going to use the take the chance here to

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.609 
going to use the take the chance here to
do<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> quick<00:00:16.770> demo<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:19.140> differences

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
do a quick demo of the differences

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.779 
do a quick demo of the differences
between<00:00:19.820> paper<00:00:20.820> space<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.420> model<00:00:21.720> space

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
between paper space and model space

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.769 
between paper space and model space
basing<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> fact<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.330> you've<00:00:24.510> already

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
basing on the fact that you've already

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.120 
basing on the fact that you've already
got<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> model<00:00:25.320> developed<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> you've<00:00:25.980> got

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
got a model developed and you've got

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.960 
got a model developed and you've got
basically<00:00:26.490> paper<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.460> model<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.670> any

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
basically paper here and model in any

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.849 
basically paper here and model in any
drawings<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.289> go<00:00:31.410> ahead<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
drawings so I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
drawings so I'm going to go ahead and
this<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> blank<00:00:32.550> drawing<00:00:32.910> i'm<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> go

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
this is a blank drawing i'm going to go

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.340 
this is a blank drawing i'm going to go
ahead<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.870> file<00:00:34.710> open<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:36.170> drawing<00:00:37.170> which

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
ahead and file open up a drawing which

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.319 
ahead and file open up a drawing which
i've<00:00:37.500> done<00:00:37.710> previous<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.210> you

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
i've done previous to this and if you

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
i've done previous to this and if you
notice<00:00:39.690> i<00:00:39.809> come<00:00:40.079> into<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
notice i come into here and you see a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.580 
notice i come into here and you see a
few<00:00:41.280> things<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.780> drawing<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.440> we're

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
few things in the drawing what we're

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
few things in the drawing what we're
looking<00:00:43.950> down<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.879> looks<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.180> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
looking down on it just looks like a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.819 
looking down on it just looks like a
bunch<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.660> lines<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> building<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
bunch of lines it is a building with a

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.139 
bunch of lines it is a building with a
non-symmetrical<00:00:49.829> roofline<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.969> see

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
non-symmetrical roofline and you see

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.580 
non-symmetrical roofline and you see
have<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.390> other<00:00:51.539> information<00:00:51.840> off<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.469> on

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
have some other information off here on

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.819 
have some other information off here on
the<00:00:52.710> side<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> model<00:00:54.989> space<00:00:55.379> now

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the side so this is the model space now

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.549 
the side so this is the model space now
very<00:00:56.250> often<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.090> thing<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.750> only<00:00:58.289> thing

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
very often the one thing and only thing

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.840 
very often the one thing and only thing
the<00:00:58.800> most<00:00:58.920> important<00:00:59.489> thing<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> remember

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the most important thing to remember

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910 
the most important thing to remember
always<00:01:00.359> about<00:01:00.899> model<00:01:01.289> spaces<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.800> are

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
always about model spaces you are

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.450 
always about model spaces you are
drafting<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> 3d

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
drafting it one to one and it is a 3d

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.880 
drafting it one to one and it is a 3d
space<00:01:06.150> x<00:01:08.060> y&amp;z<00:01:09.290> generally<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
space x y&amp;z generally what we do to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
space x y&amp;z generally what we do to
manage<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.610> put<00:01:11.820> our<00:01:11.909> fingers<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> x

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
manage that we put our fingers in the x

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
manage that we put our fingers in the x
direction<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.619> our<00:01:13.770> thumbs<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> Z<00:01:15.000> or

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
direction we put our thumbs in the Z or

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
direction we put our thumbs in the Z or
up<00:01:15.360> direction<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.710> our<00:01:16.979> finger

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
up direction and if we our finger

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.990 
up direction and if we our finger
the<00:01:17.700> expressive<00:01:18.360> finger<00:01:18.810> becomes<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.009> Y<00:01:20.220> so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the expressive finger becomes the Y so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.230 
the expressive finger becomes the Y so
that<00:01:21.180> said<00:01:21.540> I'm<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:23.070> tool<00:01:23.820> here

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
that said I'm going to use the tool here

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.999 
that said I'm going to use the tool here
which<00:01:24.450> lets<00:01:24.720> us<00:01:24.869> orbit<00:01:25.259> around<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.770> show<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
which lets us orbit around to show you

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.700 
which lets us orbit around to show you
what<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.280> building<00:01:26.850> looks<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> let

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
what that building looks like and let

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.200 
what that building looks like and let
you<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.220> off<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> side<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
you know that off here on the side is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.539 
you know that off here on the side is
just<00:01:30.390> something<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.810> demonstrate<00:01:31.549> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
just something to demonstrate the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.469 
just something to demonstrate the
different<00:01:32.850> ways<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.270> go<00:01:33.390> about

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
different ways that you can go about

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.240 
different ways that you can go about
views<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.920> building

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
views so what we have here is a building

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
views so what we have here is a building
and<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.729> building<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.740> some<00:01:37.740> lines

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and in that building we have some lines

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100 
and in that building we have some lines
which<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> inquiry<00:01:39.479> toolbar<00:01:40.079> or

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
which we use the inquiry toolbar or

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.850 
which we use the inquiry toolbar or
lists<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.400> those<00:01:41.579> lines<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.860> XY

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
lists to see that those lines have XY

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.920 
lists to see that those lines have XY
and<00:01:44.310> Z<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.119> they<00:01:45.509> are<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.079> model<00:01:46.649> space<00:01:47.930> we

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and Z and they are in the model space we

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.160 
and Z and they are in the model space we
have<00:01:48.960> polylines<00:01:51.110> lists<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.310> XY<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.600> z

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
have polylines lists that are XY and z

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.660

that looks down in or model world but

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.420 
that looks down in or model world but
they<00:02:22.310> exist<00:02:22.490> on<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.570> paper<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.230> whereas<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
they exist on the paper and whereas the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.450 
they exist on the paper and whereas the
model<00:02:25.880> was<00:02:26.060> infinitely<00:02:26.540> large<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.890> paper<00:02:28.190> in

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
model was infinitely large the paper in

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.400 
model was infinitely large the paper in
this<00:02:28.610> case<00:02:28.820> is<00:02:29.060> eight<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> half<00:02:29.420> by<00:02:29.510> 11<00:02:30.170> so

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
this case is eight and a half by 11 so

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.280 
this case is eight and a half by 11 so
if<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:30.710> list<00:02:31.010> one<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.430> these<00:02:31.580> things<00:02:31.910> l<00:02:32.240> IST<00:02:33.080> the

if we list one of these things l IST the
viewport<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:33.860> see<00:02:34.070> they<00:02:34.250> are<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.580> paper<00:02:35.030> space

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.170 
viewport you see they are on paper space
so<00:02:36.560> one<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.890> predominance<00:02:37.520> things<00:02:37.760> we<00:02:37.970> use

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
so one of the predominance things we use

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.340 
so one of the predominance things we use
paper<00:02:38.540> space<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:40.420> attach<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.720> our<00:02:41.960> view

we also use paper space for now listed

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.290 
we also use paper space for now listed

here for text and notes and you notice

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.390 
here for text and notes and you notice
the<00:02:53.450> paper<00:02:53.690> space<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.500> model<00:02:54.890> space<00:02:55.160> is

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
the paper space and the model space is

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.000 
the paper space and the model space is
one<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.360> properties<00:02:56.990> of<00:02:57.020> any<00:02:57.350> entity<00:02:57.890> and

one of the properties of any entity and
the<00:02:58.070> drawing<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:59.420> said<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.290> can<00:03:00.530> tend<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.040> get

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
the drawing that said it can tend to get

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.560 
the drawing that said it can tend to get
complex<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.030> what<00:03:02.120> I'm<00:03:02.240> going<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.420> do<00:03:02.540> here

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
complex and what I'm going to do here

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.410 
complex and what I'm going to do here
now<00:03:02.810> is<00:03:02.990> turn<00:03:03.440> on<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.890> layer<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.890> layer

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
now is turn on a layer and that layer

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.810 
now is turn on a layer and that layer
was<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.810> layer<00:03:09.230> called<00:03:09.500> demo<00:03:09.950> changing<00:03:10.459> space

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
was a layer called demo changing space

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.790 
was a layer called demo changing space
I'm<00:03:11.150> going<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.360> turn<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.720> layer<00:03:12.080> on<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.709> we

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
I'm going to turn that layer on and we

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.760 
I'm going to turn that layer on and we
see<00:03:13.040> now<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.450> conundrum<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.080> sometimes

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
see now the conundrum that sometimes

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.770 
see now the conundrum that sometimes
when<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.040> see<00:03:16.310> something<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.820> can't<00:03:17.180> tell<00:03:17.510> if

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
when you see something you can't tell if

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.100 
when you see something you can't tell if
it's<00:03:17.900> paper<00:03:18.290> or<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> model<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.550> so<00:03:20.330> as<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.810> click

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
it's paper or a model and so as I click

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.190 
it's paper or a model and so as I click
on<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:21.320> here<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.190> list<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.780> see<00:03:24.019> that

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
on this here and list it you see that

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.240 
on this here and list it you see that
it's<00:03:24.380> paper<00:03:25.390> paper<00:03:26.390> space<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:27.170> text<00:03:27.620> but<00:03:28.160> as

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
it's paper paper space that text but as

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.009 
it's paper paper space that text but as
I<00:03:28.370> look<00:03:28.550> at<00:03:28.640> click<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:29.300> here<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.810> doesn't

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
I look at click on this here it doesn't

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
let me click on it and that's because it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.210 
let me click on it and that's because it
is<00:03:32.150> not<00:03:32.390> on<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.870> paper<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.410> in<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.739> model

that's in the model space how that got
turned<00:04:01.430> around<00:04:01.670> one<00:04:02.600> thing<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.930> also<00:04:03.200> point<00:04:03.620> out

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
turned around one thing I also point out

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.320 
turned around one thing I also point out
is<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.040> there<00:04:04.280> is<00:04:04.430> an<00:04:04.580> in<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.850> relationship

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
is that there is an in a relationship

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.229 
is that there is an in a relationship

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
space and papers place so if i go back

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.880 
space and papers place so if i go back
to<00:04:10.640> hear<00:04:11.269> one<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.110> commands<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.680> don't

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
to hear one of the commands you don't

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.340 
to hear one of the commands you don't
want<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.130> play<00:04:13.250> with<00:04:13.489> too<00:04:13.670> early<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.390> something

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
want to play with too early is something

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.969 
want to play with too early is something
called<00:04:15.560> chain<00:04:16.160> space<00:04:17.169> chain<00:04:18.169> space<00:04:18.709> you

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
called chain space chain space you

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.450 
called chain space chain space you
select<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.519> object<00:04:20.770> in<00:04:21.770> this<00:04:22.039> case<00:04:22.280> you

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
select the object in this case you

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.130 
select the object in this case you
realize<00:04:22.820> because<00:04:23.060> it's<00:04:23.330> highlighted<00:04:23.960> on<00:04:24.050> the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
realize because it's highlighted on the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.290 
realize because it's highlighted on the
outside<00:04:24.710> here<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.250> you're<00:04:25.370> in<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.669> model<00:04:26.090> so

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
outside here that you're in the model so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.780 
outside here that you're in the model so
you<00:04:26.330> go

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
you go

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.390 
you go
back<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.090> forth<00:04:27.420> by<00:04:27.660> generally<00:04:28.260> typing<00:04:28.650> PS<00:04:29.040> or

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
back and forth by generally typing PS or

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.650 
back and forth by generally typing PS or
ms<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:31.080> now<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.380> say<00:04:31.710> CH<00:04:32.370> space<00:04:32.910> all<00:04:33.300> these

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
ms so now you say CH space all these

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.210 
ms so now you say CH space all these
things<00:04:34.020> are<00:04:34.230> commands<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:34.800> are<00:04:34.860> sticking

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
things are commands that are sticking

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.190 
things are commands that are sticking
around<00:04:35.430> from<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.940> past<00:04:36.210> grab<00:04:36.750> something

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
around from the past grab something

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.870 
around from the past grab something
there<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:38.070> going<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.340> tell<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.730> which

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
there it's going to tell you which

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.970 
there it's going to tell you which
viewport<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.810> push<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.140> down<00:04:40.290> into<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.860> now

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
viewport you push it down into and now

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.770 
viewport you push it down into and now
when<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.250> went<00:04:41.490> through<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:42.360> see<00:04:42.600> that

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
when you went through you see that

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.810 
when you went through you see that
you've<00:04:42.900> essentially<00:04:43.320> pushed<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:43.890> down<00:04:44.220> into

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
you've essentially pushed that down into

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.570 
you've essentially pushed that down into
the<00:04:45.780> model<00:04:46.260> though<00:04:46.440> it's<00:04:46.620> very<00:04:46.890> difficult<00:04:47.220> to

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
the model though it's very difficult to

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.690 
the model though it's very difficult to
know<00:04:47.850> where<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.240> will<00:04:48.360> go<00:04:48.390> so<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:50.100> generally<00:04:50.580> do

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
know where it will go so we generally do

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.540 
know where it will go so we generally do
all<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:50.880> our<00:04:51.060> design<00:04:51.540> in<00:04:52.020> model<00:04:52.740> space<00:04:52.770> we<00:04:53.400> use

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
all of our design in model space we use

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.240 
all of our design in model space we use
the<00:04:53.730> paper<00:04:54.000> space<00:04:54.360> for<00:04:54.810> cutting<00:04:55.500> windows<00:04:55.680> into

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
the paper space for cutting windows into

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.820 
the paper space for cutting windows into
our<00:04:56.460> world<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:57.030> for<00:04:57.390> text<00:04:57.840> thanks<00:04:58.590> for
