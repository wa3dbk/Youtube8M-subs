there<00:01:33.000> open<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:34.020> number<00:01:34.200> two

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
there open it up and that's number two

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.450 
there open it up and that's number two
now<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.530> next<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.070> can't<00:01:38.250> actually

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
now then the next one we can't actually

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520 
now then the next one we can't actually
access<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.090> yet<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.079> need<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> make<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
access just yet but we need to make the

access just yet but we need to make the
chest<00:01:40.710> spawn<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.579> access<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
chest spawn so that we can access it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.499 
chest spawn so that we can access it
later<00:01:42.060> on

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
later on

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.030

now then this next one is a little bit

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.240 
now then this next one is a little bit
tricky<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.750> because<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.500> requires<00:02:43.860> precise
