looks like this rushville has worked for

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.150 
looks like this rushville has worked for
me<00:07:04.900> she<00:07:05.900> didn't<00:07:06.140> really<00:07:06.320> pick<00:07:06.470> the<00:07:06.650> best<00:07:06.830> built

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160

it just picked a lot of hoplites which I

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.270 
it just picked a lot of hoplites which I
guess<00:07:10.070> can<00:07:10.580> work<00:07:10.880> but<00:07:11.830> wasn't<00:07:12.830> the<00:07:12.890> proper

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 
guess can work but wasn't the proper

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.460 
guess can work but wasn't the proper
build<00:07:15.160> and<00:07:16.160> not<00:07:16.580> on<00:07:16.730> the<00:07:16.760> proper<00:07:17.180> map<00:07:17.470> let's

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
build and not on the proper map let's

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.710 
build and not on the proper map let's
see<00:07:18.740> the<00:07:18.860> unit<00:07:19.100> statistics<00:07:19.670> so<00:07:20.060> obviously<00:07:20.600> it
