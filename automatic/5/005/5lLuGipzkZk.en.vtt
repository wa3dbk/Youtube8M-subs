00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.819
 I introduce you to the misano wave today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 rank five before and the first thing when you 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.840
 You have to talk about the shoe 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.139
 mention low weight because of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.480
 my size 43 only 216 217 grams 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.880
 That's because he's in competition 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.310
 Shoe is yes is on fast runs 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.750
 Aligned and can be made by coarse mesh 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.769
 material and a thin middle sole very 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.769
 save a lot of weight 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.600
 yes I got my shoe yesterday 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.680
 I bought him for a month 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.469
 studied in the internet and the day before yesterday 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.579
 finally in a shop nearby 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.340
 have found 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.860
 even in larger cities had no 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.260
 only behind this shoe and then 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.390
 just in my little place 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 small dealer 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.489
 wonderfully , he has this shoe for 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 had had 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.689
 Unfortunately, I have it only on the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 treadmill can therefore test 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.939
 I will be around one more month 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.650
 upload another video after watching the 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.360
 first went well and also 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 on hard surfaces so as not on the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.240
 treadmill tested for the strengths 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.240
 to fully enjoy the shoe 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.430
 yes the shoe still has eight times eight 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:39.090
 millimeter blasting what a very 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:43.560
 pleasant feeling generated and the g3 on 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.329
 console in blue is very nice 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 soft and can bump very well 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.070
 absorb 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.009
 but it was important in it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.010
 connection with the middle sole and the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.780
 I will come to this one 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:08.369
 this is one of the most efficient shoes 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:11.280
 I've ever walked the white one 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.780
 conclusion midsole is a 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.150
 pleasant compromise between fighters 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.440
 and felt right in the run , especially in the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.420
 it is medium and in front of the foot area 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.610
 wonderful if you push off 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.700
 think you would go straight to the barefoot 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.840
 so asphalt can run very directly 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.740
 and pleasant the waves plate you 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.430
 here in the house that from the rear foot 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.880
 extends to the midfoot area 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.910
 distributes the impact forces over the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.760
 G3 sole come across a wider one 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.180
 surface what a pleasant dampen 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.980
 caused and it has all and the sole 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.459
 has a tremendous energy recovery 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.550
 so that has me after me 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.430
 heard this is very surprised 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.650
 Technology really convinced me, too 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.280
 if you have other running shoe models from 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.280
 mini sumo still something 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:17.780
 the energy recovery yet 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.780
 more active is yes 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.150
 The energy is also in the foro 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.939
 middle foot area very strong to remember 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:35.189
 this is among other things and divide 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:37.650
 at the middle of the runoff 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:42.989
 midsole and also the architecture of 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.469
 flex notches and on these two rubber 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.590
 medium bridges 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:51.359
 this generates a very high tension 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.480
 but when rolling that delivers no 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.919
 problems it only produces one again 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.919
 back spring effect 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.910
 the outsole here in black is off 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.710
 x10 carbon around that should be the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.710
 be abrasion resistant and durable 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.710
 It is also more temperature resistant too 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.640
 if it has the disadvantage that the carbon 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.800
 rubber heavier and who is heavier 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.830
 and less steaming offers but that is 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.990
 actually irrelevant 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.940
 because you really have to say that 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.170
 breathtaking pace through the api plus 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.690
 middle sole and the wave plate so 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.720
 in and of itself that is one in mine 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.640
 eyes almost perfect shoe 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.500
 maybe you can still be around ten 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.390
 sick easier but more 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.940
 be because he will know a month when 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.500
 I started it right 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.620
 maybe I'll be at the same time 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.240
 hermannslauf in Bielefeld use there 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.160
 I'm not so sure yet 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.650
 I think I'll take my old one 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.650
 kick, yes
