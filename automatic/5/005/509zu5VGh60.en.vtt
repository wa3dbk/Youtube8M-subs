actually pretty well it's got it's got a
pretty<00:01:06.320> good<00:01:06.470> low-end<00:01:06.979> it's<00:01:07.759> not<00:01:07.940> not<00:01:08.840> the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
pretty good low-end it's not not the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.550 
pretty good low-end it's not not the
best<00:01:09.170> in<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.409> world<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:10.400> highs<00:01:11.080> are<00:01:12.080> good<00:01:13.070> too

would<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:15.680> suggest<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.159> drive<00:01:16.369> that<00:01:16.490> actually

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
would it suggest a drive that actually

plays really well you don't have to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.240 
plays really well you don't have to
press<00:01:19.250> down<00:01:19.280> too<00:01:19.700> hard<00:01:20.890> you<00:01:21.890> can<00:01:22.040> have

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
press down too hard you can have

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.969 
press down too hard you can have
reasonably<00:01:22.880> low<00:01:23.060> action<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.780> fact<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.740> way<00:01:24.860> it

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
reasonably low action in fact the way it

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.550 
reasonably low action in fact the way it
comes<00:01:25.159> set<00:01:25.460> it's<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.990> don't<00:01:27.170> even<00:01:27.320> really

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
it in split it in two so you've got the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.240 
it in split it in two so you've got the
same<00:02:41.090> pattern<00:02:42.020> on<00:02:42.230> each<00:02:42.290> side<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:42.980> line

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
same pattern on each side of this line

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.660 
same pattern on each side of this line
which<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:44.060> really<00:02:44.330> cool

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.920 
then the tuners they're closed gear
tuners<00:02:48.860> they're<00:02:49.580> actually<00:02:50.060> they<00:02:50.480> look<00:02:50.690> really

peel up a little bit so and the paint

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.949 
peel up a little bit so and the paint
was<00:03:19.519> still<00:03:19.670> on<00:03:19.940> underneath<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.600> could

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
was still on underneath so you could

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.410 
was still on underneath so you could
have<00:03:21.080> probably<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:21.709> peeled<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.100> off<00:03:22.330> but<00:03:23.330> I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
have probably just peeled it off but I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.030 
have probably just peeled it off but I
stuck<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.810> now<00:03:24.230> just<00:03:24.380> pressed<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.709> back<00:03:24.830> down

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
stuck it now just pressed it back down

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.300 
stuck it now just pressed it back down
it<00:03:25.220> stuck<00:03:25.430> down<00:03:25.640> like<00:03:25.880> permanently<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.130> if<00:03:28.130> you

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
it stuck down like permanently so if you

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.039 
it stuck down like permanently so if you
want<00:03:28.519> it<00:03:28.640> off<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.390> comes<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.840> peeled

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
want it off and it comes to you peeled

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.390 
want it off and it comes to you peeled
up<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.320> little<00:03:30.470> bit<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.769> could<00:03:30.920> probably<00:03:31.130> just

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
up a little bit you could probably just

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.289 
up a little bit you could probably just
take<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.730> off<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.850> think<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.940> looks<00:03:35.090> pretty

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
take it off but I think it looks pretty

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.210 
take it off but I think it looks pretty
good<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.810> left<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.200> on<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:37.150> then<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
good so I left it on and then the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.210 
good so I left it on and then the
strings<00:03:41.290> there<00:03:42.290> pretty<00:03:42.500> good<00:03:42.590> I<00:03:42.950> mean

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
strings there pretty good I mean

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.069 
strings there pretty good I mean
obviously<00:03:43.430> at<00:03:44.390> some<00:03:44.420> point<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:44.959> probably

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
obviously at some point you probably

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.430 
obviously at some point you probably
want<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.500> get<00:03:45.650> better<00:03:45.799> strings<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:48.320> know

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
want to get better strings but you know

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.410 
want to get better strings but you know
the<00:03:49.070> originals<00:03:49.579> are<00:03:49.760> pretty<00:03:49.940> good<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:51.799> has<00:03:52.420> has

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
the originals are pretty good it has has

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.580 
the originals are pretty good it has has
a<00:03:53.450> mount<00:03:53.959> here<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.180> on<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.299> tail<00:03:56.570> for<00:03:57.170> for<00:03:57.560> a

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
a mount here and on the tail for for a

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.870 
a mount here and on the tail for for a
strap<00:03:59.350> which<00:04:00.350> is<00:04:00.530> nice<00:04:00.769> I'm<00:04:01.280> just<00:04:01.489> using<00:04:01.730> this

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
strap which is nice I'm just using this

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.690 
strap which is nice I'm just using this
little<00:04:01.940> strap<00:04:02.329> that<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.540> had<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.100> then<00:04:04.100> it's

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
little strap that I had and then it's

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.449 
little strap that I had and then it's
got<00:04:05.180> its<00:04:05.780> got<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.049> dots<00:04:06.260> on<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.620> front

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
got its got the dots on the front

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.440 
got its got the dots on the front
for<00:04:07.609> the<00:04:07.760> different<00:04:08.060> frets<00:04:08.359> and<00:04:08.629> then<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:09.890> also

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
for the different frets and then it also

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.240 
for the different frets and then it also
also<00:04:11.450> guitars<00:04:11.870> have<00:04:12.140> this<00:04:12.319> but<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.650> has<00:04:12.680> dots

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
also guitars have this but it has dots

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.789 
also guitars have this but it has dots
on<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.700> side<00:04:13.969> for<00:04:14.930> frets<00:04:15.260> which<00:04:15.469> are<00:04:15.620> probably

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
on the side for frets which are probably

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.439 
on the side for frets which are probably
more<00:04:16.100> important<00:04:16.699> than<00:04:16.759> the<00:04:16.970> ones<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.419> top

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
more important than the ones on the top

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.479 
more important than the ones on the top
so<00:04:18.350> when<00:04:18.440> you're<00:04:18.560> looking<00:04:18.829> at<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.039> guitar<00:04:19.310> you

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
so when you're looking at the guitar you

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.890 
so when you're looking at the guitar you
really<00:04:19.729> don't<00:04:19.910> see<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.209> front<00:04:20.449> and<00:04:20.539> you<00:04:20.690> see

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
really don't see the front and you see

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.020 
really don't see the front and you see
the<00:04:21.109> side<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:23.750> then<00:04:24.560> overall<00:04:25.130> it<00:04:25.550> looks<00:04:25.789> nice

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
the side and then overall it looks nice

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
the side and then overall it looks nice
it<00:04:26.300> sounds<00:04:26.630> good

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
it sounds good

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.350 
it sounds good
and<00:04:27.169> this<00:04:27.919> is<00:04:28.070> kind<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.729> amazing<00:04:29.150> part

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
and this is kind of the amazing part

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.140 
and this is kind of the amazing part
it's<00:04:29.570> only<00:04:29.720> $100<00:04:30.560> if<00:04:30.830> you<00:04:31.100> get<00:04:31.340> off<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.699> Amazon

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
it's only $100 if you get off of Amazon

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.520 
it's only $100 if you get off of Amazon
and<00:04:32.830> for<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:33.979> price<00:04:34.300> there's<00:04:35.300> in<00:04:35.630> my<00:04:36.050> opinion

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
and for that price there's in my opinion

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.080 
and for that price there's in my opinion
there's<00:04:36.770> really<00:04:37.009> nothing<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.520> can<00:04:37.789> beat<00:04:37.940> it

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
there's really nothing that can beat it

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.189 
there's really nothing that can beat it
I<00:04:39.490> mean<00:04:40.490> it's<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:41.060> way<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.330> sounds<00:04:41.840> it's<00:04:42.020> just

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
I mean it's the way it sounds it's just

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.219 
I mean it's the way it sounds it's just
amazing<00:04:42.680> I<00:04:43.520> mean<00:04:44.240> like<00:04:44.449> even<00:04:44.780> compared<00:04:45.169> to

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
amazing I mean like even compared to

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.290 
amazing I mean like even compared to
some<00:04:47.110> $500<00:04:48.110> $400<00:04:48.949> guitars<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:50.120> I've

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
there it could be really difficult I

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.379 
there it could be really difficult I
mean<00:05:35.900> you<00:05:36.020> still<00:05:36.289> can<00:05:36.590> play<00:05:36.830> them<00:05:37.159> but<00:05:37.389> not

mean you still can play them but not
really<00:05:38.630> very<00:05:39.020> well<00:05:39.259> so<00:05:39.590> about<00:05:40.340> two<00:05:40.820> here<00:05:41.210> is

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
really very well so about two here is

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.930 
really very well so about two here is
really<00:05:42.229> really<00:05:43.220> where<00:05:43.460> you're<00:05:43.639> going<00:05:43.789> to<00:05:43.849> be

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
really really where you're going to be

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.600 
really really where you're going to be
playing<00:05:44.180> on<00:05:44.960> it<00:05:45.229> but<00:05:45.650> doesn't<00:05:46.310> really<00:05:46.460> bother

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
playing on it but doesn't really bother

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.399 
playing on it but doesn't really bother
me<00:05:46.940> because<00:05:47.150> for<00:05:47.570> the<00:05:47.630> most<00:05:47.780> part<00:05:48.020> I'm<00:05:48.139> playing

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
me because for the most part I'm playing

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.749 
me because for the most part I'm playing
up<00:05:48.620> here<00:05:48.889> anyway<00:05:49.490> so<00:05:49.960> that's<00:05:50.960> fine<00:05:51.259> and<00:05:51.949> the

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
up here anyway so that's fine and the

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.339 
up here anyway so that's fine and the
cutaway<00:05:53.090> actually<00:05:53.479> alters<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.960> sound<00:05:54.199> a

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
cutaway actually alters the sound a

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.980 
cutaway actually alters the sound a
little<00:05:54.470> bit<00:05:54.740> so<00:05:55.009> I<00:05:55.220> think<00:05:56.210> I'm<00:05:56.389> kind<00:05:56.659> of<00:05:56.750> glad<00:05:56.870> I

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
little bit so I think I'm kind of glad I

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.430 
little bit so I think I'm kind of glad I
don't<00:05:57.169> have<00:05:57.349> it<00:05:58.419> so<00:05:59.419> yeah<00:05:59.599> I<00:05:59.630> think<00:05:59.900> that's

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
for like a hundred bucks and you get

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.440 
for like a hundred bucks and you get
case<00:07:11.310> and<00:07:11.580> stuff<00:07:11.790> those<00:07:12.060> are<00:07:12.240> probably
