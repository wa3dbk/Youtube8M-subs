 hi how about friends how are you 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.830
 welcome to a new video 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.070
 more tutorial here at ivÃ¡n graphic 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.630
 tutorials today we will be 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.050
 learning to create this effect 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.269
 photographic of rain so that they can 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.140
 Apply to all your photographs to all 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.420
 your images and can give you an appearance 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.910
 different a very dynamic aspect to each 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.880
 one of them this tutorial we will be 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.190
 doing in photoshop in the cc version 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.430
 6 I will be using it in that version 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.300
 but versions like cs5 and cc 6 and the most 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.629
 recent is that they will serve 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.899
 perfectly good let's start I'll 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.180
 here to close and my group where I have 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.160
 all my layers of this effect we can 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.440
 hide it so you can see the change 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.949
 the before and the after to see how 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.140
 It changes a lot and it looks different it looks 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.430
 very well the good truth I'm going to here to 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.290
 remove it to delete it to start from 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.080
 zero it is recommended that they apply it in 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.800
 a photograph like these of a landscape 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.950
 in the air 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.170
 where they appreciate, the sky is appreciated 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.260
 the clouds this somewhere where 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.770
 so be outdoors on the street in 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:29.450
 somewhere is open so that if 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.010
 see more realistic this good effect a 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.990
 Once we have our picture 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.370
 open likewise this photograph 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.470
 I'll leave them there in the description 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.930
 so you can download it and 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.690
 can follow the tutorial with me with 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.940
 this photograph good the first thing that 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.970
 we will do is go here to 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.030
 add a fill layer we're going to 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.940
 select curves to darken a 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.890
 little this image 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.430
 which are a little bit this image 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.430
 more or less 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.430
 more or less there I'll leave it there 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.590
 if in your case you have a photograph that 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.330
 it's already night there's not that much 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.920
 need to do this but with we have 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.410
 a 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.230
 a photograph with this degree of 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.080
 luminosity you have to go down there you have to 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.170
 get off the and darken the a bit to 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.599
 make our rain look more realistic 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.239
 The next thing we will do is go back to 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.790
 apply a layer of filler 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:33.480
 let's apply intensity and let's 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.019
 put all the intensity to 100 very 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.849
 all right 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.189
 once we did this we created a 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.959
 new layer we have here the little bottle of 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.150
 paint having the black as front 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.819
 we are going to give a click so that we are 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.430
 fill in this color we will go to 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.239
 filter 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.950
 Noise add noise and amount 400% 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.750
 Gaussian monochromatic distribution 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.480
 we select for check this box 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.170
 let's give ok the next thing we want is 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.840
 go to defocus blur filter 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.799
 movement here I'm going to apply a 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.590
 55 degree angle a distance of 40 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.799
 pixels let's give ok this layer I'm going 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.040
 to put in raster mode let's give 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:23.210
 control l for us to leave our 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.760
 levels window we are going to move 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.960
 here we are going to move our 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.590
 levels 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.370
 towards here 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.810
 it's the same to see everything is the center and 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.810
 I'm going to add more here 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.549
 so that we stay more or less like this 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.549
 we have to go vary going 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.069
 Seeing when we like our 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.010
 rain if very very thin or very heavy 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.260
 marked that is already to your liking according to the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.140
 project they are doing I will go 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.129
 to leave well like that I liked it so I'll leave 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.400
 the rain this and practically that is 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.980
 all friends that these simple steps with 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.739
 these simple steps we can achieve this 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.620
 rain effect and we can apply it to 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.199
 our photographs and they look very good 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.989
 let's save all these layers in a 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:23.400
 group pressing control to each of 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.190
 they control g and we can observe the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.130
 before and after our photography 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.080
 so well, here we come with 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.680
