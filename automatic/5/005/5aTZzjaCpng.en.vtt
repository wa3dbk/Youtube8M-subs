massively<00:02:38.849> pigmented<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.569> think<00:02:40.019> it's

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
massively pigmented I think it's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.209 
massively pigmented I think it's
supposed<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.379> be<00:02:40.439> like<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> finishing<00:02:40.950> powder

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
supposed to be like a finishing powder

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.159 
supposed to be like a finishing powder
but<00:02:41.549> obviously<00:02:41.849> it's<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.239> dark<00:02:42.389> well<00:02:42.900> I

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
but obviously it's really dark well I

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.929 
but obviously it's really dark well I
say<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:43.919> dark<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> use<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:44.639> to<00:02:44.760> bronze

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
say really dark so I use this to bronze

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.009 
say really dark so I use this to bronze
my<00:02:45.120> face<00:02:45.150> because<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:46.200> actually<00:02:46.950> lost<00:02:47.400> my<00:02:48.019> ball

love little dots here and because I've

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.360 
love little dots here and because I've
been<00:04:30.460> growing<00:04:30.669> my<00:04:30.819> lashes<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:32.069> my<00:04:33.069> Alice
