IG CSE biology syllabus statement 3:18 B
and<00:00:06.589> here<00:00:07.589> we're<00:00:07.770> introducing<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.550> term

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
and here we're introducing the term

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.900 
and here we're introducing the term
homozygous<00:00:09.950> heterozygous<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.780> genotype

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
homozygous heterozygous and genotype

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.769 
homozygous heterozygous and genotype
previously<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.299> discussed<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:17.369> word

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
previously we discussed the word

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.929 
previously we discussed the word
phenotype<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.980> knew<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.699> how

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
phenotype and we knew that this was how

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.630 
phenotype and we knew that this was how
an<00:00:21.210> organism<00:00:21.810> appears<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> particular

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
an organism appears for a particular

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.870 
an organism appears for a particular
characteristic<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> phenotypes<00:00:28.880> before

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
characteristic so the phenotypes before

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.770 
characteristic so the phenotypes before
petal<00:00:30.359> color<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:31.199> red<00:00:31.830> red<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.149> phenotype

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
petal color are red red is one phenotype

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.810 
petal color are red red is one phenotype
and<00:00:34.309> white<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.790> another<00:00:36.180> phenotype<00:00:37.610> we<00:00:38.610> know

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and white is another phenotype we know

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.840 
and white is another phenotype we know
that<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.660> phenotype<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.070> appearance<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that the phenotype the appearance is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.049 
that the phenotype the appearance is
controlled<00:00:42.719> by<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:44.129> genotype<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:47.059> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
controlled by the genotype and the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.170 
controlled by the genotype and the
genotype<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.079> combination<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> two<00:00:50.789> alleles

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
genotype is a combination of two alleles

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.600

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.340 

we<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.740> big<00:01:11.400> R<00:01:11.780> represents<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> allele

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
we have big R represents the allele

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.880 
we have big R represents the allele
which<00:01:13.950> generates<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> red<00:01:15.030> color<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.890> little

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
which generates the red color and little

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.300 
which generates the red color and little
R<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.180> allele<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:19.140> generates<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
R is the allele which generates the

R is the allele which generates the
white<00:01:20.580> color<00:01:22.670> let's<00:01:23.670> look<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.060> combinations

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.200 

if<00:01:28.480> our<00:01:30.450> individual<00:01:31.450> plan<00:01:32.110> is<00:01:32.380> described<00:01:32.860> as

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
if our individual plan is described as

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.110 
if our individual plan is described as
homozygous<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> gene<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.580> means<00:01:36.880> that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
homozygous for a gene that means that

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.160 
homozygous for a gene that means that
the<00:01:37.240> alleles<00:01:37.780> are<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.380> same

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.100 

now<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.920> means<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.700> could<00:01:44.940> be<00:01:45.180> big<00:01:45.870> R

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
now this means that we could be big R

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.540 
now this means that we could be big R
big<00:01:46.760> R<00:01:47.990> remember<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.350> must<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.770> two<00:01:50.340> alleles

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
big R remember we must have two alleles

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.010 
big R remember we must have two alleles
and<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:52.229> would<00:01:52.440> generate<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.460> red<00:01:54.020> petal

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and this would generate the red petal

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.570 
and this would generate the red petal
phenotype<00:01:57.080> we<00:01:58.080> could<00:01:58.260> also<00:01:58.440> have<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:59.310> same

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
phenotype we could also have the same

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.109 
phenotype we could also have the same
alleles<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:01.500> R<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.979> R<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
alleles but have little R little R and

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.840 
alleles but have little R little R and
these<00:02:03.660> two<00:02:04.050> forms<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> gene<00:02:05.280> these<00:02:05.580> two

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
these two forms of the gene these two

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.840 
these two forms of the gene these two
alleles<00:02:06.300> would<00:02:06.930> generate<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.770> phenotype<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
alleles would generate a phenotype of

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.979 
alleles would generate a phenotype of
white<00:02:11.690> white<00:02:12.690> petals<00:02:14.239> both<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.510> these

white white petals both of these

white white petals both of these

the color of the phenotype is red you
may<00:02:54.520> recall<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.300> this<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.540> described<00:02:56.290> as<00:02:56.760> the

may recall that this is described as the
dominance<00:02:58.450> of<00:03:00.330> our<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:03.600> little<00:03:04.600> R<00:03:04.840> is
