00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.549
 Good day, dear friends with 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.179
 you mihas and today we have a review of mods and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.080
 Today we consider the New Year's mod 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:18.330
 which will add Christmas mobs so 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.470
 same 1 he experiences we have santa claus by the way you 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.300
 surely you recognized him one hundred 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.970
 percent learned from the very 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.099
 interactive cartoon where he fell on 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.329
 the Snow Maiden is added to the chimney 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.120
 here it looks like this 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.149
 it didn't sound weird but we need 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.000
 kill the Snow Maiden to do 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.579
 the staff of Santa Claus, so we kill her and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.420
 here is a snowflake that falls out 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.090
 just needed to create a staff 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.879
 next we need to go and get you 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 eaves 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.140
 we start to craft put the rod 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.170
 efrita midpoint and put up 1 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.799
 the snowflake is such 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 a staff that does n't kill like that 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:18.020
 for example, he kills sheep from one 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:25.500
 or two hits with 1 s1 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:27.170
 that is, the staff is so nehily and further 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 is added 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.040
 santa and so now we look at santa 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.930
 he looks like a little santa 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.740
 the model is used differently here 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.640
 normal player in the case of Santa Claus 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.329
 resident model is used and of course 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.930
 what is Santa without elves and so 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.850
 that looks like elves 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:02.850
 By the way, elves can kill you because 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.009
 what if you behaved badly elf 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.930
 maybe you just simply 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.570
 beat to death 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.520
 that is, if we kill for example 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.080
 any animals the elf will 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.970
 cause you damage if you behaved 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.850
 well and dug in somewhere down there then 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.700
 elf will just be passive or again 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.680
 pay no attention to the Well 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.880
 this all subscribe put likes 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 Happy New Year everyone 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.980
