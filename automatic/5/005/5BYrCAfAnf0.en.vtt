palace<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.210> good<00:00:24.330> form<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.439> think

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
palace on in good form but I think

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.689 
palace on in good form but I think
they're<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> good<00:00:25.980> team<00:00:26.010> palette<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.580> think

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
they're a good team palette so I think

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.279 
they're a good team palette so I think
an<00:00:26.849> apology's<00:00:27.269> done<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> wonderful<00:00:27.750> job<00:00:27.990> there

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
an apology's done a wonderful job there

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.500 
an apology's done a wonderful job there
so<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.500> really<00:00:28.710> do<00:00:28.949> need<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.250> careful<00:00:29.510> but

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
so we really do need to be careful but

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.460 
so we really do need to be careful but
they<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:30.929> anything<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> play<00:00:31.410> for

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
they don't have anything to play for

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770 
they don't have anything to play for
they've<00:00:31.740> lost<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> last<00:00:32.040> two<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.780> they're

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
they've lost the last two and they're

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
they've lost the last two and they're
definitely<00:00:33.989> safe<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.100> shouldn't<00:00:35.399> really

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
definitely safe so it shouldn't really

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.569 
definitely safe so it shouldn't really
be<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.969> problem<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.010> exciting<00:00:38.309> the

it's just just he's so fluid on the ball

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.530 
it's just just he's so fluid on the ball
we<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.530> either<00:01:25.680> way<00:01:25.770> both<00:01:26.159> feet<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:27.180> very

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
we can go either way both feet very very

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
we can go either way both feet very very
very<00:01:27.720> good<00:01:28.320> player<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.130> should<00:01:29.189> watch

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
very good player I think we should watch

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.530 
very good player I think we should watch
him<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:29.759> he's<00:01:29.909> got<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> big<00:01:30.180> future<00:01:30.360> ahead

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
him I think he's got a big future ahead

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.569 
him I think he's got a big future ahead
of<00:01:30.689> him<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.049> where<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.680> wary<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.070> him

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
of him I was where I was wary of him

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.460 
of him I was where I was wary of him
when<00:01:33.060> he<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.329> Bristol<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.290> not

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
when he was at Bristol and it's not

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.660 
when he was at Bristol and it's not
surprised<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.280> him<00:01:35.369> doing<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
surprised at all to see him doing so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
surprised at all to see him doing so
well<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:36.000> moment<00:01:36.360> very<00:01:36.930> good<00:01:37.110> player<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.439> keep

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
well at moment very good player so keep

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.850 
well at moment very good player so keep
him<00:01:38.159> quiet<00:01:38.430> will<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> key<00:01:39.409> key<00:01:40.409> battle<00:01:40.770> on

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
him quiet will be a key key battle on

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.740 
him quiet will be a key key battle on
the<00:01:40.950> day<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.540> other

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the day but I think we can the other

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
the day but I think we can the other
issue<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
issue I think we have and I think that

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
issue I think we have and I think that
it's<00:01:44.880> probably<00:01:45.119> worth<00:01:45.270> noting<00:01:45.600> Alan<00:01:46.170> Pardew

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's probably worth noting Alan Pardew

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's probably worth noting Alan Pardew
is<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> very<00:01:47.430> good<00:01:47.490> manager<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.479> he<00:01:48.659> has<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
is a very good manager in and he has a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
is a very good manager in and he has a
phenomenal<00:01:49.350> record<00:01:49.680> against<00:01:50.130> Chelsea<00:01:50.399> I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
phenomenal record against Chelsea I

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.700 
phenomenal record against Chelsea I
think<00:01:50.610> he's<00:01:50.700> won<00:01:50.850> four<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> his<00:01:51.360> last<00:01:51.420> 6

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
think he's won four of his last 6

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.080 
think he's won four of his last 6
against<00:01:52.710> us<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.729> need<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> watch

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
against us so we really do need to watch

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
against us so we really do need to watch
out<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.299> him<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.630> he's<00:01:54.930> got<00:01:55.530> something<00:01:55.829> over

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
out for him and he's got something over

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.770 
out for him and he's got something over
us<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.310> mean<00:01:56.399> all<00:01:56.549> those<00:01:56.759> times<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.659> remember

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
us I mean all those times I can remember

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.300 
us I mean all those times I can remember
chugging<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.560> Newcastle<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.130> such<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
chugging up to Newcastle with such a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.420 
chugging up to Newcastle with such a
good<00:01:59.520> day<00:01:59.640> out<00:01:59.670> newcastle-based<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.689> far<00:02:00.930> and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
good day out newcastle-based so far and

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.920 
good day out newcastle-based so far and
we<00:02:02.430> always<00:02:02.579> probably<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:03.299> had<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> really

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
we always probably they had a really

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.179 
we always probably they had a really
good<00:02:04.079> record<00:02:04.350> against<00:02:04.619> us<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
good record against us and I think it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.920 
good record against us and I think it
was<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.790> last<00:02:06.000> season<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.360> was<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.509> particularly

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
was it last season it was a particularly

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.410 
was it last season it was a particularly
bad<00:02:07.079> one<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.500> remember<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> run<00:02:08.429> when<00:02:09.090> actually

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
bad one I remember a run when actually

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.639 
bad one I remember a run when actually
called<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.869> distinct

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
called the distinct

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.740 
called the distinct
go<00:02:10.829> from<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.189> day<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.599> poetry's<00:02:12.599> got

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
go from that day so poetry's got

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.819 
go from that day so poetry's got
something<00:02:13.019> over<00:02:13.110> Chelsea<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.590> something

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
something over Chelsea and something

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.710 
something over Chelsea and something
over<00:02:13.920> Mourinho<00:02:14.310> arguably<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.239> really<00:02:15.480> do

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
over Mourinho arguably so we really do

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.910 
over Mourinho arguably so we really do
need<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.900> watch<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.200> he<00:02:16.349> hasn't<00:02:16.560> got<00:02:16.650> something

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
need to watch it he hasn't got something

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.910 
need to watch it he hasn't got something
special<00:02:16.980> up<00:02:17.310> his<00:02:17.430> sleeve<00:02:18.079> but<00:02:19.079> it's<00:02:19.680> not<00:02:19.739> gonna

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
special up his sleeve but it's not gonna

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.199 
special up his sleeve but it's not gonna
happen<00:02:20.040> we're<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.879> we<00:02:21.060> are

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
happen we're going to do it we are

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.300 
happen we're going to do it we are
absolutely<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.439> and<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.709> cannot

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
absolutely going to do it and I cannot

absolutely going to do it and I cannot
wait<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.790> think<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.329> big<00:02:24.569> issue<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:24.959> need

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
wait I think the big issue that we need

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.110 
wait I think the big issue that we need
to<00:02:25.140> discuss<00:02:25.379> is<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:26.159> center<00:02:26.519> forward<00:02:26.849> guys

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
it's worth bringing across the back on

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.050 
it's worth bringing across the back on
the<00:02:32.010> team<00:02:32.189> that<00:02:32.280> I've<00:02:32.430> picked<00:02:32.670> which<00:02:32.909> you'll

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the team that I've picked which you'll

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.210 
the team that I've picked which you'll
be<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:33.329> in<00:02:33.540> one<00:02:34.019> second<00:02:34.439> I've<00:02:34.620> gone<00:02:34.859> for<00:02:35.010> Didier

Drogba<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.700> think<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.209> his<00:02:36.390> goal<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.810> other

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
Drogba I think that his goal the other

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.589 
Drogba I think that his goal the other
night<00:02:37.230> against<00:02:37.890> Lester<00:02:38.370> he<00:02:39.060> deserves<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.510> i

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
night against Lester he deserves it i

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.630 
night against Lester he deserves it i
think<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.900> should<00:02:40.409> be<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.590> meritocracy<00:02:41.099> i<00:02:41.370> say

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
think that should be a meritocracy i say

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.640 
think that should be a meritocracy i say
a<00:02:41.670> lot<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.150> i<00:02:42.540> truly<00:02:42.930> believe<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.409> i<00:02:43.500> think

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
a lot and i truly believe it i think

a lot and i truly believe it i think
that<00:02:43.769> he<00:02:43.859> should<00:02:43.889> play<00:02:44.129> because<00:02:44.489> he<00:02:44.579> scored<00:02:44.819> a

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
that he should play because he scored a

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.509 
that he should play because he scored a
goal<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.359> he<00:02:45.450> led<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> line<00:02:45.930> pretty<00:02:46.560> well<00:02:46.799> and

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
goal and he led the line pretty well and

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.970 
goal and he led the line pretty well and
also<00:02:47.700> Giga<00:02:48.690> coaster<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:49.109> on<00:02:49.230> man<00:02:49.409> for<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.739> next

edge over there's no no point in taking

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.149 
edge over there's no no point in taking
the<00:03:00.359> risk<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.659> there<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.989> dropper<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.530> more<00:03:02.010> than
