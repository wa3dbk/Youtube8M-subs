decides to attack to a buck 95 so this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.400 
decides to attack to a buck 95 so this
and<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.329> opinion<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.809> gonna<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and in my opinion is gonna be like the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350 
and in my opinion is gonna be like the
most<00:00:40.680> important<00:00:41.100> part<00:00:41.340> cuz<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.640> sets<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
most important part cuz this sets up the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.880 
most important part cuz this sets up the
entire<00:00:42.390> hand<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> situation

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
entire hand and this is a situation

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
entire hand and this is a situation
where<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> think<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.730> prime<00:00:45.210> prime

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
where I think it's a prime prime

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.470 
where I think it's a prime prime
situation<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> limp<00:00:47.579> behind<00:00:47.820> call<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
situation just to limp behind call the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.319 
situation just to limp behind call the
50<00:00:48.840> try<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> set<00:00:49.770> mine<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.219> super<00:00:50.520> cheap<00:00:50.789> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
50 try to set mine for super cheap you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.790 
50 try to set mine for super cheap you
only<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.570> three<00:00:51.870> people<00:00:52.050> behind<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.649> that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
only have three people behind you that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.139 
only have three people behind you that
could<00:00:52.980> possibly<00:00:53.399> raise<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> pot<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> think

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
could possibly raise the pot I think

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
could possibly raise the pot I think
it's<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:54.719> unlikely<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.260> someone<00:00:55.739> does<00:00:55.949> at

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's very unlikely that someone does at

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
it's very unlikely that someone does at
least<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> weak<00:00:56.760> hand<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:58.199> that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
least with a weak hand and because that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
least with a weak hand and because that
I<00:00:58.410> think<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> great<00:00:59.280> situation<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I think this is a great situation to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
I think this is a great situation to
limp<00:01:00.210> back<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:01.199> about<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.559> happens<00:01:01.980> if

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
limp back think about what happens if

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189 
limp back think about what happens if
you<00:01:02.250> raise<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.359> raise<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you raise here if you raise are you

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
you raise here if you raise are you
going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> pick<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.739> pot<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.100> preflop<00:01:05.489> well

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
going to pick this pot up preflop well

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
going to pick this pot up preflop well
it's<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> early<00:01:06.840> stages<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.229> tournament

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it's the early stages of a tournament

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
it's the early stages of a tournament
which<00:01:07.979> means<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> don't<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> lot<00:01:09.030> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
which means you don't have a lot of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.820 
which means you don't have a lot of
hands<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.600> information<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.229> your<00:01:10.409> opponent's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
hands or information on your opponent's

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.070 
hands or information on your opponent's
which<00:01:10.920> means<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> can't<00:01:11.549> know<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.150> raising<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
which means you can't know if raising to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.750 
which means you can't know if raising to
195<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.830> gonna<00:01:13.979> pick<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> pot<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> lot

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
195 is gonna pick up the pot a lot

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.820 
195 is gonna pick up the pot a lot
preflop<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.570> pure<00:01:15.900> default<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.470> would<00:01:16.680> not

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
preflop as a pure default I would not

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
preflop as a pure default I would not
expect<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.659> means<00:01:18.900> you're<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200

expect it so that means you're in a
situation<00:01:19.680> where<00:01:19.799> you're<00:01:19.890> most<00:01:20.070> likely<00:01:20.250> gonna

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
situation where you're most likely gonna

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.760

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
by the time to get multiple callers the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
by the time to get multiple callers the
pots<00:01:36.299> gonna<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.960> six<00:01:37.619> seven<00:01:37.740> hundred

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670

maneuverability to try to move people

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.660 
maneuverability to try to move people
off<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.140> you're<00:01:43.829> gonna<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.220> situation

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
off so you're gonna be in a situation

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.069 
off so you're gonna be in a situation
where<00:01:44.759> you're<00:01:44.880> risking<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> lot<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.570> money<00:01:45.750> with

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
where you're risking a lot of money with

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.440 
where you're risking a lot of money with
a<00:01:46.110> lot<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> uncertainty<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.460> probably<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
a lot of uncertainty and probably not a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
a lot of uncertainty and probably not a
lot<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> folds<00:01:49.140> happening<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> especially

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
lot of folds happening and especially

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.710 
lot of folds happening and especially
when<00:01:50.700> you're<00:01:50.790> looking<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> first

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
when you're looking like the first

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.929 
when you're looking like the first
limber<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.320> ep-1<00:01:52.950> who<00:01:53.189> open<00:01:53.549> limbs<00:01:53.729> under

limber right ep-1 who open limbs under
the<00:01:54.030> gun<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:55.140> someone<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.649> I'm<00:01:55.860> probably

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the gun that's someone that I'm probably

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.590 
the gun that's someone that I'm probably
not<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> assume<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> good<00:01:57.180> player

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
not going to assume is a good player

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.270 
not going to assume is a good player
Alton<00:01:57.960> let<00:01:58.079> me<00:01:58.170> know<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> gun<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.710> not<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> good

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
Alton let me know the gun is not a good

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.160 
Alton let me know the gun is not a good
thing<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.689> Toby

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
thing to do and because that is Toby

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.139 
thing to do and because that is Toby
he's<00:02:01.350> probably<00:02:01.860> gonna<00:02:02.219> call<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.820> once<00:02:03.000> he

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
he's probably gonna call and once he

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.550 
he's probably gonna call and once he
calls<00:02:03.420> everyone<00:02:03.780> else<00:02:04.020> wants<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> call<00:02:04.469> as

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
calls everyone else wants to call as

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.410 
calls everyone else wants to call as
well<00:02:04.740> cuz<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:05.369> everyone<00:02:05.820> gets<00:02:05.969> multiple

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
well cuz there everyone gets multiple

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.819 
well cuz there everyone gets multiple
sources<00:02:06.659> employed<00:02:07.049> odds<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> whatever

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
sources employed odds and whatever

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.960 
sources employed odds and whatever
excuse<00:02:08.340> they<00:02:08.489> want<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
excuse they want to you

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.910 
excuse they want to you
so<00:02:09.750> because<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.229> you're<00:02:10.350> kind<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.590> creating

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
so because that you're kind of creating

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.710 
so because that you're kind of creating
a<00:02:11.160> situation<00:02:11.730> where<00:02:11.970> you're<00:02:12.240> not<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.630> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
a situation where you're not going to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.150 
a situation where you're not going to
perform<00:02:12.870> well<00:02:13.110> there's<00:02:13.530> really<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.740> nothing

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
perform well there's really just nothing

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.640 
perform well there's really just nothing
you<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.460> do<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.820> situation<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.750> so

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
you can do in a situation like this so

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.190 
you can do in a situation like this so
if<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.100> have<00:02:17.280> information<00:02:17.550> sure<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.050> without

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
if you have information sure but without

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.160 
if you have information sure but without
it<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.890> would<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.520> much<00:02:20.940> rather<00:02:21.300> limp<00:02:21.840> behind

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
it I would just much rather limp behind

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.350 
it I would just much rather limp behind
to<00:02:22.380> your<00:02:22.530> call<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.950> 50<00:02:23.280> try<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> set<00:02:23.940> mine<00:02:24.120> for

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
to your call the 50 try to set mine for

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.450 
to your call the 50 try to set mine for
super<00:02:24.660> cheap<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:25.170> opposed<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.830> raise<00:02:26.040> here

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
super cheap as opposed to raise here

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.280 
super cheap as opposed to raise here
then<00:02:26.940> put<00:02:27.120> yourself<00:02:27.210> in<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.600> situation<00:02:28.140> where

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
then put yourself in a situation where

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.900 
then put yourself in a situation where
something<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.160> where<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.610> get<00:02:29.760> this

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
something like this where you get this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.420 
something like this where you get this
massive<00:02:30.450> string<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.110> callers<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.740> most<00:02:32.100> likely

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
massive string of callers is most likely

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.400 
massive string of callers is most likely
going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.850> happen<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.020> just<00:02:34.170> not<00:02:34.380> a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
going to happen and this is just not a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.920 
going to happen and this is just not a
good<00:02:34.650> situation<00:02:34.860> for<00:02:35.670> us<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.420> at<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.660> point

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
good situation for us so at this point

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.390 
good situation for us so at this point
we<00:02:37.080> ended<00:02:37.140> up<00:02:37.260> going<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> flop<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.920> Queen

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
we ended up going to the flop of Queen

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.250 
we ended up going to the flop of Queen
Jack<00:02:38.640> deuce<00:02:38.880> with<00:02:39.150> two<00:02:39.300> hearts<00:02:39.630> there's<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
Jack deuce with two hearts there's a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.190 
Jack deuce with two hearts there's a
check<00:02:40.500> check<00:02:40.950> check<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.820> at<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.660> point<00:02:42.870> Hiro

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
check check check and at this point Hiro

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.990 
check check check and at this point Hiro
says<00:02:43.440> obviously<00:02:43.770> I'm<00:02:44.220> worried<00:02:44.490> about<00:02:44.580> drawers

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
says obviously I'm worried about drawers

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.510 
says obviously I'm worried about drawers
and<00:02:45.180> pairs<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> see<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.260> strong<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:47.010> 300

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
and pairs so I see that strong for 300

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.000 
and pairs so I see that strong for 300
so<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.210> couple<00:02:48.600> quick<00:02:48.810> notes<00:02:49.080> here<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.860> is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
so a couple quick notes here one this is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.740 
so a couple quick notes here one this is
not<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> strong<00:02:50.460> see<00:02:50.730> bet<00:02:50.910> simply<00:02:51.390> because<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
not a strong see bet simply because it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.090 
not a strong see bet simply because it
is<00:02:51.780> very<00:02:52.140> very<00:02:52.350> small<00:02:52.650> you're<00:02:52.860> giving

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
is very very small you're giving

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.640 
is very very small you're giving
everyone<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.490> great<00:02:53.970> price<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.140> also

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
everyone a great price on you and also

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.470 
everyone a great price on you and also
you're<00:02:55.950> probably<00:02:56.190> really<00:02:56.670> not<00:02:56.940> generating

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
you're probably really not generating

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.450 
you're probably really not generating
many<00:02:57.660> folds<00:02:58.050> at<00:02:58.200> least<00:02:58.380> not<00:02:58.560> from<00:02:58.770> four<00:02:59.070> people

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
many folds at least not from four people

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.060 
many folds at least not from four people
on<00:02:59.730> this<00:03:00.330> texture<00:03:00.690> there<00:03:01.170> are<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> ton<00:03:02.040> of

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
on this texture there are a ton of

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.500 
on this texture there are a ton of
different<00:03:02.280> ways<00:03:02.640> for<00:03:02.910> people<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.360> hit

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
different ways for people to have hit

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.960 
different ways for people to have hit
this<00:03:03.630> board<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.050> one<00:03:04.200> way<00:03:04.380> or<00:03:04.530> another<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.130> I

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
this board in one way or another and I

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.270 
this board in one way or another and I
would<00:03:06.150> not<00:03:06.420> expect<00:03:06.750> for<00:03:07.290> players<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.860> fold<00:03:08.100> on

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
would not expect for players to fold on

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.040 
would not expect for players to fold on
this<00:03:08.400> texture<00:03:08.730> particularly<00:03:09.570> when<00:03:09.930> you're

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
this texture particularly when you're

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.840 
this texture particularly when you're
giving<00:03:10.350> them<00:03:10.440> like<00:03:10.650> four<00:03:11.040> point<00:03:11.280> seven<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.700> one

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
giving them like four point seven to one

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.970 
giving them like four point seven to one
I<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.390> don't<00:03:12.630> ever<00:03:12.780> expect<00:03:13.050> this<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.530> work<00:03:13.560> so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
I just don't ever expect this to work so

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.280 
I just don't ever expect this to work so
this<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:14.970> one<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.209> those<00:03:15.300> where<00:03:15.540> preflop<00:03:16.080> was

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
this is one of those where preflop was

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.710 
this is one of those where preflop was
miss<00:03:16.470> played<00:03:16.709> yes<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.700> because<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.090> my<00:03:18.450> main

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
miss played yes so because that my main

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.240 
miss played yes so because that my main
goal<00:03:18.930> here<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.320> how<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.590> heck<00:03:19.830> can<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.070> get<00:03:20.220> out

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
goal here is how the heck can I get out

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.520 
goal here is how the heck can I get out
of<00:03:20.520> this<00:03:20.640> pot<00:03:20.940> without<00:03:21.660> messing<00:03:22.110> up<00:03:22.350> any

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
of this pot without messing up any

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.560 
of this pot without messing up any
further<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.580> would<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.090> point<00:03:24.330> where

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
further so this would be the point where

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.790 
further so this would be the point where
I<00:03:24.600> would<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:24.870> say<00:03:24.959> okay<00:03:25.200> well<00:03:25.380> my<00:03:25.500> preflop

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
I would just say okay well my preflop

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.070 
I would just say okay well my preflop
play<00:03:26.040> was<00:03:26.220> not<00:03:26.250> great<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.450> definitely<00:03:27.930> did<00:03:28.050> not

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
play was not great it definitely did not

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.350 
play was not great it definitely did not
work<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.530> way<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.830> wanted<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.880> because

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
work the way I wanted it to and because

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.640 
work the way I wanted it to and because
that<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.930> need<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.140> get<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.320> heck<00:03:31.470> out<00:03:31.620> of

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
that I just need to get the heck out of

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.710 
that I just need to get the heck out of
here<00:03:31.830> cheaply<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:33.060> especially<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.660> a

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
here cheaply and especially in a

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.610 
here cheaply and especially in a
tournament<00:03:34.020> where<00:03:34.230> you're<00:03:34.350> trying<00:03:34.560> to

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
tournament where you're trying to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.620 
tournament where you're trying to
selvage<00:03:35.100> chips<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:36.060> make<00:03:36.239> sure<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.510> you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
selvage chips and make sure that you

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.479 
selvage chips and make sure that you
don't<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:36.870> set<00:03:37.200> any<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:37.560> fire<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.250> would

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
don't just set any on fire I would

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.860 
don't just set any on fire I would
definitely<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.790> check<00:03:39.150> here<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.450> be<00:03:39.630> done

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
definitely just check here and be done

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.530 
definitely just check here and be done
with<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.260> but<00:03:41.100> as<00:03:41.280> played<00:03:41.670> there's<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.120> shovel

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
with it but as played there's a shovel

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.800 
with it but as played there's a shovel
by<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.780> button<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.350> call<00:03:43.830> from<00:03:44.010> ep-1<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.060> Josh

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
by the button a call from ep-1 and Josh

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.800 
by the button a call from ep-1 and Josh
says<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.440> obviously<00:03:46.920> am<00:03:47.100> beat<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.760> fold<00:03:48.120> but

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
says I obviously am beat so I fold but

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.660 
says I obviously am beat so I fold but
what<00:03:48.989> should<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.230> have<00:03:49.350> done<00:03:49.530> differently<00:03:50.010> so

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
what should I have done differently so

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.620 
what should I have done differently so
the<00:03:50.790> big<00:03:50.940> things<00:03:51.150> we<00:03:51.300> could<00:03:51.450> have<00:03:51.540> done

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
the big things we could have done

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.900 
the big things we could have done
differently<00:03:52.080> one<00:03:52.560> live<00:03:52.950> behind<00:03:53.130> preflop<00:03:53.700> when

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
differently one live behind preflop when

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.150 
differently one live behind preflop when
we<00:03:54.030> had<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.300> opportunity<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:55.019> much<00:03:55.680> much<00:03:55.920> much

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
we had the opportunity to much much much

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.949 
we had the opportunity to much much much
better<00:03:56.340> spot<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.760> limp<00:03:57.090> behind<00:03:57.390> as<00:03:57.540> opposed<00:03:57.870> to

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
better spot to limp behind as opposed to

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.990 
better spot to limp behind as opposed to
raised<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.500> know<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.010> talk<00:03:59.310> all<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.760> time<00:03:59.940> about

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
raised I know I talk all the time about

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.670 
raised I know I talk all the time about
preflop<00:04:00.660> aggression<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.410> just<00:04:01.530> being

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
preflop aggression and just being

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.530 
preflop aggression and just being
aggressive<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.310> general<00:04:02.730> but<00:04:03.180> there<00:04:03.330> are

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
aggressive in general but there are

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.420 
aggressive in general but there are
times<00:04:03.930> when<00:04:04.200> lifting<00:04:04.530> behind<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:05.070> certainly

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
times when lifting behind is certainly

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.920 
times when lifting behind is certainly
going<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.610> be<00:04:05.670> best<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.269> with<00:04:06.420> things<00:04:06.720> like

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
going to be best and with things like

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.479 
going to be best and with things like
small<00:04:07.200> pairs<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.830> small<00:04:08.070> suited<00:04:08.400> connectors

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
small pairs and small suited connectors

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.699 
small pairs and small suited connectors
when<00:04:09.450> there<00:04:09.570> are<00:04:09.660> multiple<00:04:09.810> numbers<00:04:10.350> in<00:04:10.470> front

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
when there are multiple numbers in front

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.410 
when there are multiple numbers in front
of<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.890> those<00:04:11.100> are<00:04:11.250> prime<00:04:11.640> candidates<00:04:12.180> to

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
of you those are prime candidates to

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.150 
of you those are prime candidates to
consider<00:04:12.570> limping<00:04:13.140> behind<00:04:13.530> as<00:04:13.709> opposed<00:04:14.040> to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
consider limping behind as opposed to

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.460 
consider limping behind as opposed to
attacking<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:15.030> then<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.720> other<00:04:15.900> mistake<00:04:16.290> in

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
attacking and then the other mistake in

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.320 
attacking and then the other mistake in
my<00:04:16.560> opinion<00:04:16.919> was<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.280> flop<00:04:17.520> seabed<00:04:17.970> just<00:04:18.239> a

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
my opinion was the flop seabed just a

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.660 
my opinion was the flop seabed just a
situation<00:04:18.510> where<00:04:18.930> you're<00:04:19.020> not<00:04:19.049> going<00:04:19.470> to

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
situation where you're not going to

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.910 
situation where you're not going to
enough<00:04:20.180> folds<00:04:20.540> in<00:04:20.630> my<00:04:20.750> opinion<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.740> just

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
enough folds in my opinion you just

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.500 
enough folds in my opinion you just
don't<00:04:22.250> have<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.520> information<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:23.240> it's<00:04:23.450> a

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
don't have the information to it's a

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.660 
don't have the information to it's a
really<00:04:23.750> bad<00:04:23.930> texture<00:04:24.320> for<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.250> my<00:04:25.460> major

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
really bad texture for you so my major

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.790 
really bad texture for you so my major
focus<00:04:26.030> would<00:04:26.330> just<00:04:26.510> be<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.960> get<00:04:27.110> out<00:04:27.170> of<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.650> as

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
focus would just be to get out of it as

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.980 
focus would just be to get out of it as
cheaply<00:04:28.160> as<00:04:28.340> possible<00:04:28.510> again<00:04:29.510> we're<00:04:29.870> gonna

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
cheaply as possible again we're gonna

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.390 
cheaply as possible again we're gonna
make<00:04:30.200> mistakes<00:04:30.380> that's<00:04:31.010> a<00:04:31.100> foregone

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
make mistakes that's a foregone
