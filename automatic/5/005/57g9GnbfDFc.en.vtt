today what we are doing is looking at

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.769 
today what we are doing is looking at
the<00:00:03.240> GoPro<00:00:03.689> hero3<00:00:04.100> attached<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> surfboard

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
the GoPro hero3 attached to a surfboard

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.830 
the GoPro hero3 attached to a surfboard
using<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.020> suction<00:00:07.200> cup<00:00:07.529> mount<00:00:07.770> now<00:00:08.840> GoPro

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
using the suction cup mount now GoPro

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.169 
using the suction cup mount now GoPro
recommends<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.280> not<00:00:11.460> use<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
suction cup mount on a surfboard because

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.770 
suction cup mount on a surfboard because
the<00:00:14.460> suction<00:00:14.759> cup<00:00:14.910> mount<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.360> designed<00:00:15.660> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
the suction cup mount is not designed to

the suction cup mount is not designed to
withstand<00:00:15.990> water<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.270> I've<00:00:18.390> done<00:00:18.660> here

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
withstand water so what I've done here

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.769 
withstand water so what I've done here
is<00:00:19.080> taken<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.439> dry<00:00:19.740> surfboard<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.359> attached

gonna<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.670> hit<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> lot<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> water

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
gonna do is hit it with a lot of water

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.000 
gonna do is hit it with a lot of water
from<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.949> hose<00:00:32.160> from<00:00:32.940> buckets<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:34.620> how<00:00:34.950> the

suction cup mount actually performs

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
suction cup mount actually performs
against<00:00:37.410> these<00:00:37.559> water<00:00:37.800> tests<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.790> what

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
against these water tests and what what

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.209 
against these water tests and what what
this<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.780> experiment<00:00:40.500> will<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
this is what this experiment will do is

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.779 
this is what this experiment will do is
give<00:00:41.730> me<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:41.969> idea<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.920> use<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> suction

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
give me an idea if I can use the suction

used it on my car in several other
locations<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.540> now<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.600> want<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:06.990> how<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
locations and now I want to see how it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
locations and now I want to see how it
performs<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> surfboard<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> will

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
performs on a surfboard and if it will

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.740 
performs on a surfboard and if it will
hold<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.630> water<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:11.150> without<00:01:12.150> further<00:01:12.390> ado

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
hold up to water so without further ado

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.960 
hold up to water so without further ado
let's<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.530> started<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> hook<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
let's get started with the hook the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.789 
let's get started with the hook the
hoses<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.450> its<00:01:15.600> most<00:01:15.810> powerful<00:01:16.080> setting<00:01:16.680> right

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
hoses on its most powerful setting right

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.950 
hoses on its most powerful setting right
now<00:01:17.009> which<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.250> power<00:01:17.580> wash<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:18.840> now

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
now which is power wash and right now

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.359 
now which is power wash and right now
what<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.860> specifically

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
what I'm going to do is not specifically

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.980 
what I'm going to do is not specifically
hit<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> camera<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> face<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.840> would

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
hit the camera in the face that would

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.600 
hit the camera in the face that would
really<00:01:22.140> accomplish<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
really accomplish much what I'm going to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.999 
really accomplish much what I'm going to
try<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.360> hit<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.960> base<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> suction

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
try to do is hit the base of the suction

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.399 
try to do is hit the base of the suction
cup<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.780> force<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> water

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
cup to see if the force of the water

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.140 
cup to see if the force of the water
will<00:01:28.710> push<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> suction<00:01:29.490> cup<00:01:29.610> off<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> board

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
will push the suction cup off the board

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.010 
will push the suction cup off the board
so<00:01:30.329> let's<00:01:30.600> give<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.020> shot

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:02:13.370 

I'll<00:01:37.020> try<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.350> multiple<00:01:37.920> sides<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.399> well

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.510 

so<00:02:14.380> as<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.530> can<00:02:14.620> tell<00:02:14.800> from<00:02:14.830> practically<00:02:15.310> all

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
so as you can tell from practically all

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.430 
so as you can tell from practically all
angles<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.420> suction<00:02:16.780> cup<00:02:16.930> mountain<00:02:17.170> didn't

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
angles the suction cup mountain didn't

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.470 
angles the suction cup mountain didn't
budge<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:17.860> inch<00:02:17.890> which<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.790> impressive<00:02:19.390> I

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
budge an inch which is impressive I

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.450 
budge an inch which is impressive I
thought<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.080> force<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.500> water<00:02:20.710> moving

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
thought the force of the water moving

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.920 
thought the force of the water moving
under<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.700> suction<00:02:22.090> cup<00:02:22.210> would<00:02:22.360> surely<00:02:22.600> break

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
under the suction cup would surely break

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.260 
under the suction cup would surely break
the<00:02:23.110> seal<00:02:23.350> however<00:02:24.010> if<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:24.670> feel<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.060> now

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
the seal however if we feel it now

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.440 
the seal however if we feel it now
without<00:02:26.140> releasing<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.770> it's<00:02:27.400> still<00:02:27.760> very

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
without releasing it it's still very

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.000 
without releasing it it's still very
much<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:28.960> strongly<00:02:29.290> attached<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.860> board

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
much so strongly attached to the board

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.250 
much so strongly attached to the board
in<00:02:30.190> fact<00:02:30.400> what<00:02:30.640> I'll<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.450> I'll<00:02:31.660> lift<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
in fact what I'll do is I'll lift the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.410 
in fact what I'll do is I'll lift the
board<00:02:32.440> over<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.950> shake<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.970> around<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.360> you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
board over and shake it around so you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.350 
board over and shake it around so you
can<00:02:34.510> get<00:02:34.630> an<00:02:34.720> idea<00:02:35.580> I'm<00:02:36.580> shaking<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.120> up<00:02:37.180> and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
can get an idea I'm shaking it up and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.490 
can get an idea I'm shaking it up and
down<00:02:37.450> right<00:02:38.110> now

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
down right now

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.860 
down right now
sideways<00:02:39.190> trying<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.120> knock<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.420> camera<00:02:40.720> off

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
sideways trying to knock the camera off

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.560 
sideways trying to knock the camera off
and<00:02:41.110> nothing<00:02:41.800> seems<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.100> be<00:02:42.220> working<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.700> my

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
and nothing seems to be working and my

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.150 
and nothing seems to be working and my
opinion<00:02:43.990> this<00:02:44.200> camera<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.620> definitely<00:02:44.950> still

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
opinion this camera is definitely still

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.480 
opinion this camera is definitely still
stuck<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.580> there<00:02:45.790> but<00:02:46.240> now<00:02:47.070> let's<00:02:48.070> try<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.280> hit

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
stuck on there but now let's try to hit

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.400 
stuck on there but now let's try to hit
it<00:02:48.580> with<00:02:48.670> full<00:02:48.940> two<00:02:49.360> full<00:02:49.720> buckets<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.200> water

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
it with full two full buckets of water

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.610 
it with full two full buckets of water
just<00:02:50.980> big<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.480> would<00:02:52.660> simulate<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.080> big<00:02:53.350> wave

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
just big this would simulate a big wave

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.740 
just big this would simulate a big wave
coming<00:02:54.010> over<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> board<00:02:54.550> or<00:02:54.730> something<00:02:55.630> like

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
coming over the board or something like

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.230 
coming over the board or something like
that<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.290> test<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:57.670> not<00:02:57.880> designed<00:02:58.180> to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
that and this test is not designed to

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.640 
that and this test is not designed to
simulate<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.660> full<00:02:58.900> immersion<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.620> water

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
simulate a full immersion in water

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.850 
simulate a full immersion in water
because<00:03:00.570> what<00:03:01.570> I'm<00:03:01.660> concerned<00:03:02.110> with<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.500> waves

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
because what I'm concerned with is waves

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.710 
because what I'm concerned with is waves
knocking<00:03:03.610> against<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.060> mount<00:03:04.210> and<00:03:04.330> trying<00:03:04.600> to

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
knocking against the mount and trying to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.780 
knocking against the mount and trying to
push<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.280> goal<00:03:06.580> for<00:03:06.610> this

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
push it so that is the goal for this

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.920 
push it so that is the goal for this
experiment<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.240> now<00:03:07.420> let's<00:03:07.600> get<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> two

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
experiment so now let's get the two

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:53.259 
experiment so now let's get the two
buckets<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.470> we<00:03:09.040> will<00:03:09.190> see<00:03:09.490> how<00:03:09.910> this<00:03:10.180> goes

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.699 

so<00:03:54.269> what<00:03:54.689> just<00:03:54.720> happened<00:03:55.170> was<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.439> hit<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
so what just happened was that I hit the

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.380 
so what just happened was that I hit the
girl<00:03:55.890> pro<00:03:56.099> hard<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.519> two<00:03:56.730> buckets<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.180> water

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
girl pro hard with two buckets of water

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.149 
girl pro hard with two buckets of water
in<00:03:57.540> quick<00:03:57.720> succession<00:03:58.079> from<00:03:58.379> two<00:03:58.650> different

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
in quick succession from two different

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.640 
in quick succession from two different
angles<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.720> still<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.930> camera<00:04:01.079> did<00:04:01.319> not<00:04:01.470> move

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
angles and still the camera did not move

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.580 
angles and still the camera did not move
if<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:02.159> can<00:04:02.310> actually<00:04:02.459> see<00:04:03.230> it<00:04:04.230> may<00:04:04.379> not<00:04:04.470> be

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
if you can actually see it may not be

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.100 
if you can actually see it may not be
terribly<00:04:04.769> obvious<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:06.090> GoPro<00:04:06.510> itself

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
terribly obvious but the GoPro itself

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.869 
terribly obvious but the GoPro itself
actually<00:04:07.349> bent<00:04:07.860> forward<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.430> little<00:04:08.549> bit<00:04:08.640> from

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
actually bent forward a little bit from

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.300 
actually bent forward a little bit from
the<00:04:09.000> water<00:04:09.180> hitting<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.569> from<00:04:09.659> the<00:04:09.750> back<00:04:10.310> but

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the water hitting it from the back but

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.890 
the water hitting it from the back but
the<00:04:11.459> suction<00:04:11.819> cup<00:04:11.970> mount<00:04:12.180> still<00:04:12.480> has<00:04:12.690> not

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
the suction cup mount still has not

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.909 
the suction cup mount still has not
moved<00:04:16.039> once<00:04:17.039> again<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:18.090> camera<00:04:18.449> is<00:04:18.769> stuck<00:04:19.769> on

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
moved once again this camera is stuck on

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.009 
moved once again this camera is stuck on
hard<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.579> could<00:04:20.789> even<00:04:20.910> pick<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.419> whole<00:04:21.600> board

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
hard I could even pick the whole board

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.529 
hard I could even pick the whole board
up<00:04:22.199> by<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.500> base<00:04:22.820> yeah<00:04:23.820> I'm<00:04:24.000> holding<00:04:24.210> just

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
up by the base yeah I'm holding just

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.969 
up by the base yeah I'm holding just
them<00:04:24.750> out<00:04:24.840> right<00:04:24.990> now<00:04:25.199> lifting<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.650> board<00:04:25.860> off

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
them out right now lifting the board off

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.540 
them out right now lifting the board off
the<00:04:26.130> ground

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
the ground

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.670 
the ground
I<00:04:26.669> think<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.840> point<00:04:28.110> here<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.289> that<00:04:28.380> this

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
I think the point here is that this

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.350 
I think the point here is that this
suction<00:04:29.400> cup<00:04:29.669> mount<00:04:29.880> is<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> little<00:04:30.240> bit

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
suction cup mount is a little bit

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.620 
suction cup mount is a little bit
stronger<00:04:31.289> than<00:04:31.320> GoPro<00:04:32.280> claims<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.150> which

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
stronger than GoPro claims it is which

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.080 
stronger than GoPro claims it is which
is<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:34.020> know<00:04:34.139> good<00:04:34.350> thing<00:04:34.620> it's<00:04:35.580> stuck<00:04:35.940> on

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
is you know good thing it's stuck on

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.879 
is you know good thing it's stuck on
there<00:04:36.240> pretty<00:04:36.419> well<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.110> think<00:04:37.169> as<00:04:37.530> long<00:04:37.830> as

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
there pretty well and I think as long as

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.760 
there pretty well and I think as long as
you<00:04:38.370> attach<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.180> suction<00:04:39.360> cup<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.500> board

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
you attach the suction cup to the board

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.800 
you attach the suction cup to the board
when<00:04:40.919> it's<00:04:41.070> dry<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.669> cleaned<00:04:42.000> off<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.660> should

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
when it's dry and cleaned off you should

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.050 
when it's dry and cleaned off you should
have<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.960> really<00:04:43.320> good<00:04:43.590> strong<00:04:44.100> attachment

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
have a really good strong attachment

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.600 
have a really good strong attachment
that<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.180> could<00:04:45.389> use<00:04:45.630> for<00:04:45.960> surfing<00:04:46.919> scenarios

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
that you could use for surfing scenarios

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.080 
that you could use for surfing scenarios
or<00:04:48.080> in<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.440> lake<00:04:49.650> or<00:04:49.979> whatever<00:04:50.789> so<00:04:50.970> that's

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
or in the lake or whatever so that's

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.540 
or in the lake or whatever so that's
good<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.419> know<00:04:51.600> for<00:04:51.900> what<00:04:52.620> I<00:04:52.650> plan<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:52.949> use<00:04:53.099> it<00:04:53.400> I

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
good to know for what I plan to use it I
