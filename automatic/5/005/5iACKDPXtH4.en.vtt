the older ones that you be able to look

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
the older ones that you be able to look
and<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.360> people<00:01:09.509> have<00:01:09.750> said<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.990> some<00:01:10.619> of

finished so let's talk about this poll
question<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.690> twins<00:01:15.990> paradox<00:01:16.620> as<00:01:16.860> this

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
question now the twins paradox as this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
question now the twins paradox as this
is<00:01:17.520> often<00:01:17.729> called<00:01:18.120> comes<00:01:18.870> from<00:01:19.140> Einstein's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
is often called comes from Einstein's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
is often called comes from Einstein's
special<00:01:19.860> theory<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.549> relativity<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.390> remember

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
special theory of relativity I remember

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
special theory of relativity I remember
as<00:01:22.260> a<00:01:22.290> child<00:01:22.409> watching<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.280> wonderful<00:01:23.729> world<00:01:23.940> of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
as a child watching a wonderful world of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
as a child watching a wonderful world of
Disney<00:01:24.150> episode<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.560> included<00:01:26.010> an

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
Disney episode which included an

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.859 
Disney episode which included an
animation<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> concept<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
animation about this concept and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.859 
animation about this concept and
thinking<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.159> impossible<00:01:29.790> how<00:01:30.390> could<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
thinking it was impossible how could it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.080 
thinking it was impossible how could it
be<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.140> one<00:01:31.650> twin<00:01:32.040> gets<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.670> rocket<00:01:33.060> ship

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
be that one twin gets in a rocket ship

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.930 
be that one twin gets in a rocket ship
the<00:01:33.869> other<00:01:34.020> stays<00:01:34.380> home<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.070> yet<00:01:35.610> when<00:01:35.760> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
the other stays home and yet when the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.359 
the other stays home and yet when the
rocket<00:01:36.360> twin<00:01:36.689> returns<00:01:37.229> he<00:01:37.830> still<00:01:38.100> looks<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
rocket twin returns he still looks the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.640 
rocket twin returns he still looks the
same<00:01:38.490> age<00:01:38.939> while<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> twin<00:01:39.960> who<00:01:40.110> stayed<00:01:40.350> home

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
same age while the twin who stayed home

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
same age while the twin who stayed home
now<00:01:41.340> looks<00:01:41.610> old<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.479> had<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> hard<00:01:42.840> time

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
now looks old I really had a hard time

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.320 
now looks old I really had a hard time
without<00:01:43.320> strains<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.159> whole<00:01:44.340> idea<00:01:44.610> seemed<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
without strains the whole idea seemed to

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.840 
without strains the whole idea seemed to
be<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.750> yet<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> logic<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.700> this

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
be and yet if you take the logic of this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
be and yet if you take the logic of this
paradox<00:01:48.390> even<00:01:48.720> further<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.619> arrive<00:01:50.010> at<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
paradox even further you arrive at the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.640 
paradox even further you arrive at the
amazing<00:01:50.880> conclusion<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.659> first<00:01:51.960> looked<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.409> in

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
amazing conclusion we first looked at in

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.780 
amazing conclusion we first looked at in
light<00:01:53.159> has<00:01:53.400> no<00:01:53.640> speed<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.570> faster<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.080> go<00:01:55.470> the

light has no speed the faster you go the

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.950 
light has no speed the faster you go the

larger the disparity between your

larger the disparity between your
