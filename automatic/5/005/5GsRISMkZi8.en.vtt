00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.200
 elite artplay production represent 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.410
 hello my favorite viewers I already have a lot 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.640
 shot a video about the mineral in this video 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.939
 I want to show you an interesting solution but 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:23.599
 maybe it's hard to implement it I wanted 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.179
 would this decision be seen on the pro scene on 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.960
 pro-scene peaking of techis and not so 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:32.199
 rarely she is what the whole point we know yes what 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.489
 if we check the box 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.400
 nameplate we put the nameplate correct 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.519
 plate azimuth I plate and under it 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.010
 we throw mines or for example barrels 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.030
 impossible with water no wards not 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.909
 heme 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.900
 but for some reason nobody thought out 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:54.140
 put the barrels on the fountain of the enemy 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:59.510
 I think you understand that we are now 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.430
 we will do what am plotting and how are you 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.830
 get to the fountain this is yours 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.020
 the problem is yes there I do not know what will be 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.010
 minute of the game you should have aganim 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.130
 anyways 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.700
 and maybe there will play and not + 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.090
 wisp 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.609
 your team yes and there once you have visas 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.579
 somewhere will throw but in any case a 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.579
 the point is that at this time the enemies should 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.789
 be far from your base and we know 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.619
 that minera who is this owl player this 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.920
 the team is fighting a miner is busy with his 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.920
 I have already shot a video and showed 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.460
 that when using smok we can 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 climb under the fountain and I will not 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.290
 set the example plate repeated 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.869
 nameplate and that we will be barrels 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.790
 we stamp shampoo and we stamp you see 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.790
 spontaneously attacks the barrels 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.920
 put a certain amount with 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.600
 Aganim there incredible damage understand 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.560
 he can kill five anyway 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.399
 and let's say we went back home yet 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.640
 one plus tom till what remains see no 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.959
 need to put wards why not no 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.430
 vision remains and we see that 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.910
 happens and what next yes let's say 10 a 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.610
 or went to the base of the enemies there are three four 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.390
 five enemies go to base or just 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:35.690
 dawn spawned 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:43.069
 runs in this area and -5 put 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:45.580
