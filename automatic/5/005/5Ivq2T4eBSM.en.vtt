00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.210
 the mood in the small Italians even before the first fight 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.979
 which already belongs in Weingarten easier to do 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.859
 the show the Germans in the red jerseys but then in the first duels 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.449
 delivered was less spectacular 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.060
 Christoph Ewald, for example, defeated his opponent quite well 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.029
 strong Krassimir Cross then on 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.589
 preferably to three clearly the failings 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.179
 also the Finnish newcomer Jan Hofer Maggie lost he was in the third 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.100
 Round here in the stand fight angry surprised the Teutons lay 3 to 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.380
 new back 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.839
 The turn came with the performance of Johannes Kessel 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.429
 against his national team competitor and Rita Bogner he proved 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.320
 who is the German number one in the 96 kilos class 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.890
 shortly before the end of the round Weingartener made the decisive attacks 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.120
 after half of the decathletes the Weingartener were still nine to twelve 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.820
 back 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.260
 After the break, there were but there are funds on the assembly line 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.359
 currently a goal for the hosts for the first time in the lead 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.340
 The Romanian is currently in absolute top form 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.790
 he still knew 04 Footsie's lead 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.550
 and with a sovereign 13 laps draw but should last for the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.600
 finale 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.020
 23 to 12 defeat the Germans the league leaders 15 40 themselves 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.040
 Herbstmeister 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.420
 the team has proved again the performance 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.570
 after the slump in the course of, above all, I am very happy 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.360
 had been denied entry 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.970
 But do not leave it to the autumn championship title 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.510
 the best of the best in the first session otherwise so strong and made poems 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.960
 So everyone up to 17 years old 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.170
 it is close and as I said 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.200
 unfortunately it knows because there are only four places in the finals of the group 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.040
 second, in the grass 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.880
 and of course we want to become more access branches 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 At the moment it looks good in the scenes of the forest 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.710
 The next test stone is already waiting for the start of the season on Saturday 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.240
 then comes the HSV Mainz to Weingarten
