00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.080 
it works I guess so this is my name
emulator<00:00:17.009> list<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.429> it<00:00:17.519> has<00:00:17.609> all<00:00:17.759> my<00:00:17.880> main

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
emulator list so it has all my main

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.880 
emulator list so it has all my main
games<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:19.349> let's<00:00:19.500> go<00:00:19.560> ahead<00:00:19.589> and<00:00:19.769> load<00:00:19.830> up

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
games but let's go ahead and load up

another<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.519> if<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.699> hit<00:00:20.820> two-player<00:00:21.470> it

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
another one so if I hit two-player it

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.400 
another one so if I hit two-player it
pulls<00:00:22.740> up<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> menu<00:00:23.099> and<00:00:24.109> we<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.259> pick

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
pulls up a menu and we can pick

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.099 
pulls up a menu and we can pick
different<00:00:25.679> rom<00:00:26.099> lists<00:00:26.720> different<00:00:27.720> image

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
different rom lists different image

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.380 
different rom lists different image
different<00:00:28.439> emulators<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.339> you<00:00:30.179> know<00:00:30.269> all

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
different emulators and you know all

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.130 
different emulators and you know all
this<00:00:30.509> stuff<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.439> how<00:00:31.949> many<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.220> to<00:00:32.280> emulators

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
this stuff so how many go to emulators

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.350 
this stuff so how many go to emulators
and<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> hit<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.500> player<00:00:34.740> to<00:00:34.890> select<00:00:35.210> which<00:00:36.210> is

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:09.230 

that's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.980> good<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:05.450> all<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.690> are<00:01:06.870> good<00:01:08.240> but

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that's a good one all these are good but

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
that's a good one all these are good but
just<00:01:09.480> you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.660> Mario<00:01:10.020> Kart<00:01:10.230> so<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.160> then<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
just you know Mario Kart so and then I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.970 
just you know Mario Kart so and then I
just<00:01:11.520> hit<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.060> player<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.390> start<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.980> it

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
just hit the one player to start it it

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.760 
just hit the one player to start it it
loads<00:01:14.810> my<00:01:15.950> n64<00:01:16.950> emulator<00:01:18.140> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.160 

and<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.510> fully<00:01:27.690> functional

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and so you know it's fully functional

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.300 
and so you know it's fully functional
totally<00:01:28.470> works<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:29.610> Sam<00:01:29.850> playing<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> game

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
totally works like Sam playing a game

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
totally works like Sam playing a game
and<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.580> bored<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.390> exit<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and I get bored to exit out of it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.670 
and I get bored to exit out of it
you<00:01:34.950> hold<00:01:35.580> this<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.600> push<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.050> this<00:01:37.560> is

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you hold this and then push this this is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.170 
you hold this and then push this this is
the<00:01:37.799> standard<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> eye<00:01:38.400> pack<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the standard with the eye pack just to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
the standard with the eye pack just to
hit<00:01:39.300> escape<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> basically<00:01:40.710> got<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> hacked

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
hit escape but I basically got a hacked

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.859 
hit escape but I basically got a hacked
version<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:43.430> my<00:01:44.430> n64<00:01:44.759> emulator<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
version of my n64 emulator so that it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.330 
version of my n64 emulator so that it
doesn't<00:01:46.200> because<00:01:46.710> usually<00:01:46.950> when<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.250> hit

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
doesn't because usually when you hit

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.690 
doesn't because usually when you hit
escape

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
escape

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
escape
it<00:01:47.940> just<00:01:48.149> exits<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> full<00:01:48.840> screen<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it just exits out a full screen but I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
it just exits out a full screen but I
have<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.190> that<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.399> actually<00:01:50.550> closes<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
have it so that it actually closes the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
have it so that it actually closes the
program<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.350> takes<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.710> back

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
program and then it takes you right back

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.889 
program and then it takes you right back
here<00:01:53.100> which<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.330> what<00:01:54.690> most

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
here which is what this is what most

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.820 
here which is what this is what most
what<00:01:55.830> you'd<00:01:55.950> expect<00:01:56.070> from<00:01:56.369> any<00:01:56.550> front-end<00:01:56.940> but

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
what you'd expect from any front-end but

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.080 
what you'd expect from any front-end but
when<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:58.979> using<00:01:59.130> Mac's<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.700> arcade

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
when I was using Mac's from this arcade

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.469 
when I was using Mac's from this arcade
specifically<00:02:01.729> one<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.880> biggest<00:02:03.179> issues

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
specifically one of the biggest issues

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.630 
specifically one of the biggest issues
is<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.660> half<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.830> time<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.160> wasn't<00:02:05.310> taking

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
