flow<00:01:22.849> body<00:01:23.090> durango<00:01:23.869> also<00:01:24.170> did<00:01:24.319> a<00:01:24.349> great<00:01:24.649> job

flow body durango also did a great job
with<00:01:25.099> the<00:01:25.250> electronics<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.810> biggest<00:01:27.289> clue

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
with the electronics the biggest clue

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.010 
with the electronics the biggest clue
that<00:01:28.069> they<00:01:28.220> are<00:01:28.310> still<00:01:28.670> serious<00:01:29.300> about<00:01:29.420> racing

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
that they are still serious about racing

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.969 
that they are still serious about racing
is<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.560> motor<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.849> 13<00:01:32.420> 541<00:01:33.200> but<00:01:33.740> more

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
is that the motor is a 13 541 but more

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.980 
is that the motor is a 13 541 but more
importantly<00:01:34.459> it's<00:01:34.490> censored<00:01:35.360> that<00:01:35.750> means

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
importantly it's censored that means

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.870 
importantly it's censored that means
they<00:01:36.140> are<00:01:36.380> indeed<00:01:36.679> series<00:01:37.160> of<00:01:37.280> all<00:01:37.399> racing

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
they are indeed series of all racing

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.510 
they are indeed series of all racing
race<00:01:38.539> motors<00:01:38.959> must<00:01:39.349> be<00:01:39.530> censored<00:01:39.950> motor<00:01:40.220> they

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
race motors must be censored motor they

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.839 
race motors must be censored motor they
offer<00:01:40.640> much<00:01:41.179> better<00:01:41.630> throttle<00:01:42.410> feel<00:01:42.860> in<00:01:43.160> far
