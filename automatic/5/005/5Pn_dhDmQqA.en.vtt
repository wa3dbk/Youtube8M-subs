apply our setting powder so let's get to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.679 
apply our setting powder so let's get to
the<00:00:23.820> first<00:00:24.029> step<00:00:25.760> we<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.939> our<00:00:27.090> primer<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the first step we have our primer and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.040 
the first step we have our primer and
the<00:00:28.500> main<00:00:28.710> goal<00:00:29.060> that<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> primer<00:00:30.390> does<00:00:30.630> it's

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the main goal that the primer does it's

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.490 
the main goal that the primer does it's
is<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.920> sets<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.940> soaks<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.230> sweat

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
is that it sets and soaks up the sweat

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
is that it sets and soaks up the sweat
and<00:00:34.620> oil<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.399> normally<00:00:35.489> accumulate

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and oil that you normally accumulate

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.869 
and oil that you normally accumulate
throughout<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> day<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:38.070> also<00:00:38.219> creates<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
throughout the day and it also creates a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.540 
throughout the day and it also creates a
barrier<00:00:39.559> between<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.890> foundation<00:00:41.399> that

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
barrier between the foundation that

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.400 
barrier between the foundation that
you're<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> put<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.120> next<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.780> your<00:00:43.050> skin

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
you're going to put on next in your skin

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.760 
you're going to put on next in your skin
so<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> main<00:00:48.539> goal<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> primer<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so the main goal of the primer is that

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
so the main goal of the primer is that
it's<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.219> stop<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.210> bleeding<00:00:52.140> through

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it's going to stop the bleeding through

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
it's going to stop the bleeding through
of<00:00:52.680> any<00:00:52.800> sweat<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.219> oil<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.550> would<00:00:53.670> normally

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
of any sweat and oil that would normally

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
of any sweat and oil that would normally
occur<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.660> everyday<00:00:54.930> makeup<00:00:57.379> it's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.720 

step<00:01:02.350> two<00:01:02.560> is<00:01:02.590> to<00:01:02.800> keep<00:01:02.950> on<00:01:03.130> going<00:01:03.430> with<00:01:03.550> your
