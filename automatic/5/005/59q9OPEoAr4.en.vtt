I'm<00:01:32.209> pretty<00:01:32.360> sure<00:01:32.479> it's<00:01:32.720> supposed<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:33.050> be

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.550 
I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be
Louis's<00:01:33.619> body<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:35.360> I'm<00:01:35.929> not<00:01:36.140> sure<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:36.440> this

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
Louis's body and I I'm not sure if this

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.919 
Louis's body and I I'm not sure if this
is<00:01:36.619> actually<00:01:37.130> part<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.459> it<00:01:37.700> but<00:01:38.030> in<00:01:38.209> left4dead

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
is actually part of it but in left4dead

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.469 
is actually part of it but in left4dead
they<00:01:39.229> had<00:01:39.380> writing<00:01:39.830> on<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.099> walls<00:01:40.369> for<00:01:41.270> safe

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.940 
they had writing on the walls for safe
rooms<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.349> I<00:01:43.130> think<00:01:43.429> this<00:01:44.080> may<00:01:45.080> actually<00:01:45.380> be

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
rooms and I think this may actually be

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.870 
rooms and I think this may actually be
part<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.209> I<00:01:47.240> could<00:01:47.630> be<00:01:47.660> wrong<00:01:47.959> though<00:01:48.640> but<00:01:49.640> I
