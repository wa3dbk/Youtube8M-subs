00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello how about youtube friends good 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.640
 Today I'm going to teach you how to download and 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.990
 install this which is lucky to expand 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.929
 it is an income for the new minecraft 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.070
 1.6 point 2 or earlier versions as 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.180
 says good from 1.6 onwards 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.060
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.410
 is to go to my website we are going to 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.410
 downloads and files 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.439
 we wait for him to change 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.820
 ready we go down and download this which is 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.970
 the swart ex pfannberger show so you 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.950
 we give to download good because I do not 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.190
 I'm going to do it, I'm not going to download it because 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.170
 I already have it, you give it to you 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.020
 they give here in download and then we're going to 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.950
 give a mediafire page and then it 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.770
 they download it 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.640
 well once they have it they pass it to 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.309
 desk or where you want me to 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.230
 I'm going to leave here good we open our 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.380
 minecraft for 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.840
 well we open it you know here 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.189
 how it is used because they are 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.460
 I taught in the previous tutorial and good 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.970
 also for this text pack is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.710
 recommended the fine hockey although 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.670
 I do not recommend them much anymore or cygni 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.670
 neither the ms for cher 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.740
 Well, it's going faster for me without sheen 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.290
 without anything 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.760
 well we spent a moment the video 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.600
 well once here we give you options 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.060
 and we give you to solve and open three packs 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.200
 folder as you see I already have another here 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.170
 texture that I did not like so much 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.670
 good since they are already open this is 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.060
 another way to 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.759
 to do this but why not 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.830
 have problems because we do it like that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.739
 we pass the file for who stops here 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.390
 excuse me and then we can close this and 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.989
 As you see here, this will appear 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.520
 of stuart expander we click and go 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.590
 to charge a little bit will take a little 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.390
 because it will load everything 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.230
 and as you see here, it is already changing 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.230
 the textures 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.550
 in what ends loading we are going to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.550
 process the video 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.160
 ready as you see then they changed the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.300
 structure we give you here to ready ready 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.440
 well let's upload the video a little bit 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.580
 and sound problem 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.390
 and we give a player let's go to them 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.620
 to teach more or less the texture 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.040
 while on the map of the series that 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.079
 I'm doing 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.079
 there is loaded charge 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.110
 As I mentioned, it is recommended that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.110
 ifai to improve a little bit the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:06.170
 textures although I like it much more 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.170
 without the desire or the mc to cher 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.340
 I do not know why but I liked it better 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.890
 and that's it 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:22.989
 although without it the optimum will not be 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:26.590
 appear these clouds those and it is the only thing 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:31.140
 that changes and it seems to me that water and 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.140
 wash also a little bit change 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.180
 but we will 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.260
 I will go down a little 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.260
 video settings 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.950
 does not follow a little the guided 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.590
 Well, I 'm going this way with the because 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.140
 I'm recording with the cam you're already 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.140
 right now my computer is very slow 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:05.020
 and well maybe this one turns out that what 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.760
 use for the series 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.879
 Y 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.549
 because I liked it so much and good 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.690
 but I'm going to remove the ifai and I'm going to 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:19.769
 put motors is good nothing else the d 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.740
 as it is called to be able to capture 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.510
 horse armor and 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.280
 the saddles 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.740
 good friends, that's all 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.690
 already as they saw there also the water is 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.190
 as transparent for those who do not 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.590
 know this text 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.960
 Well, more or less they saw how it is 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.440
 still in the series I will follow 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.750
 showing also this text so that it is 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.860
 the one I 'm using for for 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.160
 house that good maybe when they see this 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.650

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.230
 but he informed them once and for all that 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.290
