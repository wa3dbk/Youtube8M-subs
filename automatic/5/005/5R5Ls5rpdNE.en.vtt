00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.750
 using my fingers and after this I'm going 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.620

 using a pointed brush this is 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.540
 the 45 sigma that is one of my 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.190
 favorite brushes I will apply it in the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.680
 apply a little more of the violet shade 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.470
