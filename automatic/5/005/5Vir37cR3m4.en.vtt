00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and I bend up with my second finger and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
and I bend up with my second finger and
what<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.329> is<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.690> grab<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.500> next<00:00:49.770> string<00:00:51.320> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.900 

it's<00:00:59.100> tough<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.520> do<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.010> bend<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.730> with

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it's tough to do so you bend up with

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.219 
it's tough to do so you bend up with
your<00:01:03.030> second<00:01:03.359> finger<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.930> jump

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
your second finger and then you jump

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:16.480 
your second finger and then you jump
strings<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> third<00:01:05.909> string<00:01:06.240> come<00:01:06.630> down

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.760 

and<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:17.579> I<00:01:17.670> land<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.530> ninth

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and then I land here in the ninth

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.859 
and then I land here in the ninth
position<00:01:20.039> so<00:01:20.520> again<00:01:20.729> I'm<00:01:20.850> getting<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
position so again I'm getting out of the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.959 
position so again I'm getting out of the
12th<00:01:22.259> fret<00:01:22.439> because<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.520> lines<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
12th fret because a lot of the lines and

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.090 
12th fret because a lot of the lines and
things<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.329> like<00:01:24.539> to<00:01:24.689> play<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:25.289> not<00:01:25.710> just

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
things that I like to play are not just

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.709 
things that I like to play are not just
you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:27.649> position<00:01:28.649> based<00:01:29.039> licks<00:01:29.789> like<00:01:30.539> I'm

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
you know position based licks like I'm

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.870 
you know position based licks like I'm
playing<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> scale<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.920> don't<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.429> that

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
playing from a scale I don't think that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:43.999 
playing from a scale I don't think that
way<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:37.429> there<00:01:38.429> it<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.819> triplets<00:01:43.009> there's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
way so there it is in triplets there's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.089 
way so there it is in triplets there's
Hendrix<00:01:44.549> solos<00:01:45.119> where<00:01:45.630> you'll<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.899> hear

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099
