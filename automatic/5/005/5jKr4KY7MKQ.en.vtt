right<00:01:07.760> now<00:01:07.909> I<00:01:08.380> work<00:01:09.380> at<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.650> factory<00:01:10.570> under

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
right now I work at the factory under

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.330 
right now I work at the factory under
design<00:01:11.900> floor<00:01:12.110> but<00:01:12.680> we're<00:01:12.860> really<00:01:13.100> close<00:01:13.280> to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
design floor but we're really close to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.460 
design floor but we're really close to
manufacturing<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:14.390> anytime<00:01:15.049> there's<00:01:15.380> a

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
manufacturing so anytime there's a

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.550 
manufacturing so anytime there's a
problem<00:01:15.860> on<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.340> line<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:18.080> know<00:01:18.110> they<00:01:18.380> call

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
problem on the line you know they call

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.700 
problem on the line you know they call
us<00:01:18.770> we<00:01:19.570> go<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.720> see<00:01:20.869> what's<00:01:21.049> going<00:01:21.290> on<00:01:21.380> and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
us we go and see what's going on and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.669 
us we go and see what's going on and
then<00:01:21.859> we<00:01:22.130> propose<00:01:22.490> an<00:01:22.640> engineering

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
then we propose an engineering

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.649 
then we propose an engineering
modification<00:01:24.679> in<00:01:24.740> their<00:01:24.890> design<00:01:25.429> solution<00:01:26.390> to

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
modification in their design solution to

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.239 
modification in their design solution to
build<00:01:27.499> problems<00:01:28.689> I'm<00:01:29.689> especially<00:01:30.679> learning

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
build problems I'm especially learning

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.789 
build problems I'm especially learning
how<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.340> deal<00:01:31.759> with<00:01:31.969> multiple<00:01:32.679> projects<00:01:33.679> at

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
how to deal with multiple projects at

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.239 
how to deal with multiple projects at
the<00:01:33.859> same<00:01:34.159> time<00:01:34.429> or<00:01:34.670> multiple<00:01:34.909> tasks<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:37.130> know

the same time or multiple tasks you know

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.209 
the same time or multiple tasks you know
when<00:01:37.759> you're<00:01:37.969> an<00:01:38.869> engineer<00:01:39.409> your<00:01:39.770> problem

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
when you're an engineer your problem

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:41.380 
when you're an engineer your problem
solver

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
solver

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.660

when<00:01:42.230> you<00:01:42.350> design<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.710> new<00:01:42.860> product<00:01:43.100> there<00:01:43.520> are

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
when you design a new product there are

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.610 
when you design a new product there are
a<00:01:43.730> lot<00:01:43.910> of<00:01:43.940> little<00:01:44.450> problems<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:45.050> be<00:01:45.140> fixed<00:01:45.170> so

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
a lot of little problems to be fixed so

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.440 
a lot of little problems to be fixed so
that's<00:01:45.830> what<00:01:45.980> we<00:01:46.100> do<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.490> daily<00:01:46.730> basis<00:01:47.270> you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
that's what we do on a daily basis you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.230 
that's what we do on a daily basis you
know<00:01:47.540> Tesla<00:01:48.380> has<00:01:48.560> an<00:01:48.800> office<00:01:49.310> in<00:01:49.550> Palo<00:01:50.090> Alto

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
know Tesla has an office in Palo Alto

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.050 
know Tesla has an office in Palo Alto
and<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:51.440> manufacturing<00:01:52.070> pen<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:52.640> Fremont

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
and the manufacturing pen is in Fremont

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.670 
and the manufacturing pen is in Fremont
so<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.330> know<00:01:53.570> San<00:01:53.780> Jose<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.140> right<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.500> between

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
so you know San Jose is right in between

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.310 
so you know San Jose is right in between
the<00:01:54.950> two<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:56.450> made<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.720> lot<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:56.960> sense<00:01:57.230> to

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
the two and it made a lot of sense to

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.170 
the two and it made a lot of sense to
come<00:01:57.650> at<00:01:57.800> San<00:01:57.950> Jose<00:01:58.100> State<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.729> was<00:01:58.820> the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
come at San Jose State and it was the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.270 
come at San Jose State and it was the
right<00:01:59.360> choice<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.960> was<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> great

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
right choice and it was a great

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.910 
right choice and it was a great
experience<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:02.060> think<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:03.110> part<00:02:03.470> of<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.830> know

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
experience I think it's part of you know

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.590 
experience I think it's part of you know

very motivated about meeting here and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.440 
very motivated about meeting here and
they<00:02:12.590> didn't<00:02:13.190> want<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.340> work<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:14.180> make<00:02:14.300> it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
they didn't want to work to make it

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.420 
they didn't want to work to make it
happen<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.830> great<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.370> know

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
happen and it's just a great you know

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.520 
happen and it's just a great you know
