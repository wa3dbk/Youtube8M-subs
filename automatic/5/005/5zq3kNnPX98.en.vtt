00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.610
 Hi, I'm Camilo Ernesto Andrade 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.309
 and in the afternoon of today and today 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.620
 I come to teach you how to make a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.870
 Christmas waterfall for this the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.440
 materials are 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.560
 to the base of a plastic bottle or 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.880
 let's divide it by half and the base 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.060
 We leave that bottle 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.539
 but we also keep the funnel 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.230
 the and the following the following 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.190
 material is two forks 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.079
 and finally a glass 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 Now the next thing we're going to do is 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.989
 to be going to be doing a few holes on the 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.250
 top of the base of our 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.420
 bottle which will allow us 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.910
 let's look good 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.129
 that we put two forks 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.739
 exchanged and I explain it as they do 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.079
 an opening the size of the forks 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.199
 and then cut the mountain range with a 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.350
 hot knife with a scalpel or with 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.789
 what you want to do it ready 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.399
 Well I've done the openings like 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:12.380
 can you see now what I'm going to 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.630
 proceed to do is going to be getting the two 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.850
 forks or plastic spoons in 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.820
 effect if they do not have forks spoons 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.220
 of plastic I recommend forks and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.200
 total plastic spoons we're not going 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.030
 to use precisely me because I have 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.000
 I will use plastic forks 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.080
 you use what you have 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.720
 on the vine in the house 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.030
 then through the openings begins to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.680
 place the two forks as they can 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.320
 I see and have placed or 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.620
 spoonfuls of silver you put them in that 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.980
 shape 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.830
 or be a part of the top of the 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.070
 fork on one side the top 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.500
 from the other fork to the other side and the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.500
 bottom parts for different sides 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.259
 then we open the glass 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.649
 for part of that for the part 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.950
 lower an opening and so on this 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.720
 size in the house is not like that anymore 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.130
 enteas an opening 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.890
 then we put 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.580
 the glass about here over the two 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.490
 forks we place the steps 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.560
 supported you are and will be the support 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:34.580
 and then I will bring a glass with 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:38.360
 water to teach them the procedure 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.660
 ready so more or less is going to stay like this is going 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.660
 to stay 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.210
 I recommend it to be the back 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.080
 that form with the blows the paper 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.900
 manger and towards the part and paint it or 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.510
 something and towards the front is that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.420
 leave it this space if you 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.450
 they want this a little water is spent 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.120
 so you can get it out of the base 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.790
 of water can be reused again 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.600
 the water using a second glass the 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.390
 what will be a support not 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.990
 if you want to use it 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.510
 the funnel the funnel of the bottle what 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.840
 can use and there in the glass always 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.500
 and when you have a 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.430
 a hole a hole in the lid of the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.530
 bottle to originate that the water 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.980
 to cause the water to pass 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.569
 well this was my video I hope you 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.620

 it was not the topic of today but good 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.219
