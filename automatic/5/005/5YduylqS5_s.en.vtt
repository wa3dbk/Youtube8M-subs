some case fans well I know that a lot of
people<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.539> looking<00:00:24.689> at<00:00:24.990> these<00:00:25.490> these

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
people have been looking at these these

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.089 
people have been looking at these these
particular<00:00:26.730> fans<00:00:27.420> are<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> four<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.619> one<00:00:28.800> pack

particular fans are a four and one pack
for<00:00:29.460> around<00:00:29.840> $15<00:00:31.099> and<00:00:32.099> those<00:00:32.340> are<00:00:32.520> that's

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
for around $15 and those are that's

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.729 
for around $15 and those are that's
really<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.680> crackhead<00:00:34.680> prices<00:00:35.160> pretty<00:00:35.579> much

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
really like crackhead prices pretty much

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
really like crackhead prices pretty much
you're<00:00:37.739> pretty<00:00:37.950> much<00:00:38.040> getting<00:00:38.250> four<00:00:38.579> fans<00:00:38.910> for

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you're pretty much getting four fans for

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.830 
you're pretty much getting four fans for
the<00:00:40.170> price<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:40.950> two<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.540> it's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the price of one or two so I know it's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600 
the price of one or two so I know it's
something<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> lot<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.070> people<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.460> come

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
something that a lot of people have come

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.950 
something that a lot of people have come
across<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.270> thought<00:00:45.450> it'd<00:00:45.570> probably<00:00:45.690> be

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
across so I thought it'd probably be

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.369 
across so I thought it'd probably be
beneficial<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.820> show<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.020> get

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
beneficial to just show you what you get

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.340 
beneficial to just show you what you get
with<00:00:49.590> these<00:00:49.770> fans<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.940> expect

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
with these fans and what you can expect

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
with these fans and what you can expect
if<00:00:52.350> you're<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> market<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:53.670> fans

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
if you're in the market for some fans

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.189

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you get a set of four fans they're all

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.219

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.160 
black there's no LEDs or fancy lighting
with<00:01:04.979> these<00:01:05.189> fans<00:01:05.549> which<00:01:06.210> personally<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.720> like

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
with these fans which personally I like

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.649 
with these fans which personally I like
I<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.400> my<00:01:08.580> computer<00:01:08.909> looking<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
I don't like my computer looking like a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.500 
I don't like my computer looking like a
Fast<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> Furious<00:01:10.500> car<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:12.210> long<00:01:12.450> as

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
Fast and the Furious car so as long as

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.149 
Fast and the Furious car so as long as
they<00:01:12.689> perform<00:01:13.110> well<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> they're<00:01:13.680> low-key

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
they perform well and they're low-key

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.760 
they perform well and they're low-key
that<00:01:14.909> definitely<00:01:15.240> matches<00:01:16.110> what<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:16.409> looking

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that definitely matches what I'm looking

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.660 
that definitely matches what I'm looking
for<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.689> again<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.900> black<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.430> come

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
for so again all black they all come

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.270 
for so again all black they all come
with<00:01:20.700> three<00:01:21.210> pin<00:01:21.450> connectors<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:23.040> lose

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
with three pin connectors so you do lose

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.570 
with three pin connectors so you do lose
the<00:01:23.549> PWM<00:01:24.450> functionality<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.280> spin

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the PWM functionality but these do spin

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390 
the PWM functionality but these do spin
at<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> fairly<00:01:27.780> low<00:01:27.930> rpm<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
at a fairly low rpm so it's really not a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.660 
at a fairly low rpm so it's really not a
big<00:01:29.579> deal<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.170> each<00:01:31.170> fan<00:01:31.770> comes<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.490> its

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
big deal there each fan comes with its

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.319 
big deal there each fan comes with its
own<00:01:32.820> set<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.570> hardware<00:01:33.930> mounting<00:01:34.560> screws<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
own set of hardware mounting screws and

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.490 
own set of hardware mounting screws and
then<00:01:36.329> Coolermaster<00:01:36.990> throws<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.470> some

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
then Coolermaster throws in some

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.090 
then Coolermaster throws in some
pamphlet<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.700> information<00:01:39.119> which<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.140> didn't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
pamphlet but information which I didn't

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.520 
pamphlet but information which I didn't
really<00:01:41.280> read<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.759> who<00:01:42.390> cares<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.380> that's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
really read but who cares so that's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
really read but who cares so that's
pretty<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> within<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.729> box<00:01:44.970> it's

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
pretty much it within the box it's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.460 
pretty much it within the box it's

rated at around 30,000 hours of life I
don't<00:02:06.659> know<00:02:06.990> how<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.259> came<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:07.979> with<00:02:08.310> that

don't know how they came up with that

the<00:02:24.190> construction<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.940> fans<00:02:25.209> themselves

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
the construction of the fans themselves

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.650 
the construction of the fans themselves
I<00:02:26.319> did<00:02:27.310> notice<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.610> they<00:02:27.819> are<00:02:27.849> fairly<00:02:28.450> well

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
I did notice that they are fairly well

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.190 
I did notice that they are fairly well
made

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
made

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.500 
made
they're<00:02:29.860> definitely<00:02:30.220> made<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> lot<00:02:31.120> better

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
they're definitely made a lot better

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.920 
they're definitely made a lot better
than<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.340> plastic<00:02:33.340> exhaust<00:02:34.209> fan<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.720> came

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
than the plastic exhaust fan that came

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.740 
than the plastic exhaust fan that came
with<00:02:35.110> my<00:02:35.260> cougar<00:02:35.650> spike<00:02:35.980> case<00:02:36.360> they<00:02:37.360> kind<00:02:37.630> of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
with my cougar spike case they kind of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.660 
with my cougar spike case they kind of
the<00:02:38.050> fan<00:02:38.590> blades<00:02:38.830> themselves<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.550> have

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
the fan blades themselves kind of have

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.270 
the fan blades themselves kind of have
like<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.150> tin<00:02:40.900> filling<00:02:41.470> like<00:02:41.709> they<00:02:42.010> kind<00:02:42.190> of

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
like a a tin filling like they kind of

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.520 
like a a tin filling like they kind of
feel<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.959> I'm<00:02:47.019> confident<00:02:47.410> that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
feel like this so I'm confident that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.430 
feel like this so I'm confident that
they<00:02:47.830> will<00:02:48.069> move<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.580> lot<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.790> air<00:02:49.030> nicely<00:02:49.750> just

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
they will move a lot of air nicely just

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.320 
they will move a lot of air nicely just
based<00:02:50.680> on<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.980> construction<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.060> fans

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
based on the construction of the fans

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.360 
based on the construction of the fans
themselves<00:02:53.019> now<00:02:53.530> as<00:02:53.590> far<00:02:53.739> as<00:02:53.860> sound<00:02:54.100> goes

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
themselves now as far as sound goes

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.550 
themselves now as far as sound goes
these<00:02:54.819> fans<00:02:55.180> do<00:02:55.690> kind<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.019> emit<00:02:56.350> like<00:02:56.530> a

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
these fans do kind of emit like a

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.280 
these fans do kind of emit like a
high-pitched<00:02:57.310> sound<00:02:58.150> I'm<00:02:58.569> not<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.019> sure

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
high-pitched sound I'm not really sure

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.199 
high-pitched sound I'm not really sure
where<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.620> put<00:02:59.709> my<00:02:59.890> finger<00:03:00.280> on<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.459> but<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:01.000> kind

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
where to put my finger on it but it kind

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.809 
where to put my finger on it but it kind
of<00:03:01.330> sounds<00:03:01.540> like<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:02.140> hairdryer<00:03:02.799> had<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> smaller

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
of sounds like a hairdryer had a smaller

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.580 
of sounds like a hairdryer had a smaller
level<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.599> that<00:03:04.630> may<00:03:05.080> be<00:03:05.140> something<00:03:05.380> that

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
level so that may be something that

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.990 
level so that may be something that
you'd<00:03:05.709> want<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:05.950> be<00:03:06.069> aware<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.370> if<00:03:06.790> you're

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
you'd want to be aware of if you're

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.600 
you'd want to be aware of if you're
looking<00:03:07.239> for<00:03:07.390> truly<00:03:07.720> silent<00:03:08.260> case<00:03:08.470> fans<00:03:08.799> these

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
looking for truly silent case fans these

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.910 
looking for truly silent case fans these
are<00:03:09.849> not<00:03:10.090> truly<00:03:10.540> silent<00:03:11.170> but<00:03:11.349> they<00:03:11.470> are<00:03:11.620> well

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
are not truly silent but they are well

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920 
are not truly silent but they are well
built<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.610> I'm<00:03:12.970> pretty<00:03:13.180> sure<00:03:13.420> they'll<00:03:13.660> last

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
built and I'm pretty sure they'll last

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.809 
built and I'm pretty sure they'll last
the<00:03:14.230> life<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.620> your<00:03:14.799> computer<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:15.580> don't

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
the life of your computer so you don't

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.800 
the life of your computer so you don't
really<00:03:15.910> have<00:03:16.060> anything<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.510> worry<00:03:16.690> about

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
really have anything to worry about

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.110 
really have anything to worry about
there<00:03:17.170> as<00:03:17.260> far<00:03:17.440> as<00:03:17.500> build<00:03:17.859> quality<00:03:18.160> but<00:03:18.730> sound

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
there as far as build quality but sound

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.340 
there as far as build quality but sound
wise<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.780> something<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.109> you<00:03:20.200> may<00:03:20.320> want

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
wise that is something that you may want

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.170 
wise that is something that you may want
to<00:03:20.560> be<00:03:20.680> aware<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:20.950> now<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.400> may<00:03:21.640> be<00:03:21.670> able<00:03:21.910> to

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
to be aware of now you may be able to

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.530 
to be aware of now you may be able to
also<00:03:22.600> help<00:03:23.440> combat<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.370> lot<00:03:24.640> of<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.000> noise<00:03:25.209> that

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
also help combat a lot of the noise that

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.720 
also help combat a lot of the noise that
you<00:03:25.660> get<00:03:25.930> just<00:03:26.290> by<00:03:26.380> maybe<00:03:26.590> throwing<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.340> rubber

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
you get just by maybe throwing a rubber

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.569 
you get just by maybe throwing a rubber
grommet<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.450> between<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.500> case<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.340> the

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
grommet in between the case and the

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.330 
grommet in between the case and the
screw<00:03:31.000> just<00:03:31.239> kind<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:31.930> dampen<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> vibrations

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
screw just kind of dampen the vibrations

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.640 
screw just kind of dampen the vibrations
I<00:03:33.700> haven't<00:03:34.359> done<00:03:34.450> that<00:03:34.510> myself<00:03:35.079> yet<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.560> I

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
I haven't done that myself yet and I

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.520 
I haven't done that myself yet and I
kind<00:03:35.859> of<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.069> like<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.250> cheap<00:03:36.910> budget<00:03:37.209> case<00:03:37.690> so

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
kind of have like a cheap budget case so

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.140 
kind of have like a cheap budget case so
it's<00:03:38.680> not<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.950> quietest<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.640> world<00:03:39.850> and

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
it's not the quietest in the world and

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.699 
it's not the quietest in the world and
you<00:03:40.269> do<00:03:40.420> kind<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.930> hear<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.109> little<00:03:41.319> bit<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
you do kind of hear a little bit of the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.770 
you do kind of hear a little bit of the
vibrations<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:43.239> may<00:03:43.329> be<00:03:43.389> something<00:03:43.660> that

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
vibrations so that may be something that

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.360 
vibrations so that may be something that
you'd<00:03:43.959> want<00:03:44.139> to<00:03:44.200> do<00:03:44.319> just<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.650> help<00:03:44.799> out<00:03:45.010> on<00:03:45.220> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
you'd want to do just to help out on the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.949 
you'd want to do just to help out on the
noise<00:03:45.549> level<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.600> if<00:03:46.690> you're<00:03:46.810> really

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
noise level so if you're really

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.780 
noise level so if you're really
sensitive<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.590> noise<00:03:48.040> these<00:03:48.250> fans<00:03:48.549> probably

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
sensitive to noise these fans probably

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.340 
sensitive to noise these fans probably
aren't<00:03:49.150> for<00:03:49.329> you<00:03:49.480> but<00:03:50.019> if<00:03:50.109> you're<00:03:50.230> just

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
aren't for you but if you're just

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.680
