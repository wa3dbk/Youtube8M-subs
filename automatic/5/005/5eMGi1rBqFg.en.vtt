00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.630

 this sword can be created thanks 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.510
 at a command the command can be 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.440
 written or uncertain here that command is not 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.870
 this 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 or with the long locker logic command is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.739
 this with this one for those who do n't 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 knew because I already know some of it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.979
 they know aquino and how blocks are received 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.840
 writing kid api who understands for the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.750
 character or the person closest 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:21.200
 you can also put your name on 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:26.520
 137 and to revive this this block cone 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 and therefore I recommend it and this this 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.070
 command that I now copy and I will 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.210
 I write here I don't know if it's all wrong 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.920
 there is everything it is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.659
 and anyway command is this then me 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.710
 I am not going to tell you what is everything 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.829
 as much as you 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.180
 obviously yes this command here I hope 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.890
 to remind me to leave it in 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 description but I think so of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.909
 remember me then I only tell you 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.740
 then purchase here 276 stands for shores of the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 object then boys 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.689
 you may have already figured out some that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.399
 you can enchant and damage to 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.860
 attack such as 10,000 any 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.180
 object after I will show you 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.149
 oh well then you have to write all this 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.570
 they gave it to you to change the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.030
 dharma 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.580
 the attack is this here then in this 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.680
 10 this 100 million seems to me and you can 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.110
 make 100 million as you can do 10 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.270
 now I'll show you to you by pressing 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.790
 button to give to a sword with 10 thousand 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.100
 attack damage is good there millions 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.340
 why song and you can put 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:35.400
 even one and give me a shoulder with a 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.640
 bit of attack damage as you can 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.980
 then see this one in my hand 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.110
 to the sword of 10,000 from anything 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.680
 I also showed him at the beginning that 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.420
 it will even help the land dragon 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.020
 oh and of course the boss weiter 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.420
 this gives attack of 1 we see 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.019
 what does a dick just see you don't 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.019
 anything 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.230
 and anyway this will be the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.200
 command look at you gives a fuck 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.880
 and then now we can all see if 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.690
 if we could enchant other things 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.320
 like if now I have little chance at random 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.330
 just in case I put that I know 5 that 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.070
 it should be one of the first blocks 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.870
 that the feeling is indeed waiting for him 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.870
 but because one committed 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:40.930
 and of course if you expect it 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.670
 wanted to talk about placed bags and then it 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.140
 takes you back I want to see if he loses 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.900
 its attack damage or I still have it no 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.050
 no you don't have it ok anymore ok so you are 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.550
 be careful they place it and how you have it 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.620
 not seen when I thief pato did not 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.750
 abyss together because one to the attack e 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.390
 one no and as you can see if you beat 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.280
 with this object it will destroy any 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:08.410
 what did you guys immediately want to tell you 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.090
 one thing and you want to have rights is missing 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.890
 then I can trick a bow do it 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:18.310
 become power 10 thousand attention e 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:24.280
 lippi of the arch that seems to me maybe 2 61 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:26.560
 should be this ok and attention 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.410
 he gives you the sentence of peer attack 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.030
 at 10 thousand but obviously now some 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.780
 there will be other arrivals named others 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.290
 less 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.760
 I will specify it however it is not that the 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.650
 damage of attack refers to 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.950
 power in the bow so if I do 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.220
 like that it is not that obvious that it is not that 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.630
 he disintegrated it from the attack yes 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.420
 refer when you hit then if 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.930
 Polish google as you can see it 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:56.440
 then disintegrate so if you want 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.520
 have another pack a bow I have 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.290
 a power equal to the very high number 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.690
 now I'll show you how those 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.240
 guys if you want to have one as I said 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.889
 you need this command 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.349
 exclude because of attack damage 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.650
 concerning when you hit and you can 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.389
 ok, any object then 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.849
 but this can also go away 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.610
 this one you will command then the 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.550
 command gere 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.699
 I recommend the bow you can't 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.229
 write another id only the co 261 that 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.629
 this will be what of school at home 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.210
 unipi and you have to write all this here 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.969
 that I will put you in the inscription e 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.080
 it means enchanting the object 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.810
 obviously that is here from quantity 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.150
 regards quantity then theme from one 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.789
 white so they are t 10,000 10 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.490
 therefore it enchants the enchanting places 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.889
 or 48 that is there of the enchantment lies 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.900
 for power and the level it stands for 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.569
 10,000 which means that it gives you to a 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.969
 but a very powerful arc of 10,000 is too much 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.339
 high so let's do a thousand is right me 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.569
 I was forgotten you have to put this 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:07.139
 then sorry they forgot me a 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.699
 piece and in any case then there of 48 10,000 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.259
 okay it wasn't too sorry sorry i have 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.259
 wrong then you have to close the 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:16.560
 parenthesis and graf to close that concerns 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.729
 this part here then close the square 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.000
 which concerns this here and close 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:24.319
 the other rests that begins from here made 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.319
 then we wait a moment that I put 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.990
 they are 600 and this had cheated wide 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.439
 that now we go immediately to see 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:37.500
 as for the power in chatman level 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:40.889
 point 10 thousand obviously there is a limit 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.020
 of power and then 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:46.020
 so you can accept any 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.759
 what with the bow of course you can 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.409
 put even infinite water 1 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.419
 destructibility everything you want 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.520
 so be point if we do now and 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.949
 I'm kind of a little far away 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:03.169
 that I don't want to destroy everything 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:07:09.169
 we do sun and dragons will excuse and have 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:11.780
 destroyed as a blow and then then in 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:16.520
 this bow here you can disintegrate 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:18.560
 anything and therefore I already know that 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.720
 some will know they didn't already know 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.590
 this thing but others not because also 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.300
 because I decided to do this 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.840
 this tutorial called that because 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.740
 I saw that there were few on youtube 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:36.259
 so I decided to do it 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.970
 and later it means that I had in 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:40.180
 mind to do another tutorial also on 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.490
 how to do 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:47.220
 so many spoiler names however nothing will be 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:49.900
 therefore such a thing acquires the 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.810
 tutorial ends here we call it 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:57.520
 tutorial and I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:59.169
 I hope that was short of help 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.910
 you can do this whenever you want 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:03.699
 obviously you need to have more versions 

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.320
 recent and I hope I have been helpful 

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:09.570
 however video ends here from here 

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.570
 people focus is everything and the next hello
