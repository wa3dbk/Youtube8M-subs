your foot in and this tongue is smashed
down<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.930> inevitably<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.920> want<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.190> reach

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
down you inevitably you want to reach

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.720 
down you inevitably you want to reach
down<00:01:50.580> with<00:01:50.700> both<00:01:50.850> hands

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
down with both hands

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.150 
down with both hands
saves<00:01:52.060> thing<00:01:52.330> deals<00:01:52.570> keep<00:01:53.260> that<00:01:53.470> kite<00:01:53.710> stable

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
saves thing deals keep that kite stable

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.710 
saves thing deals keep that kite stable
at<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.250> one<00:01:54.430> hand<00:01:54.670> now<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:54.910> have<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.150> one-hand

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
at the one hand now you have a one-hand

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.930 
at the one hand now you have a one-hand
system<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.830> can<00:01:57.010> actually<00:01:57.160> adjust<00:01:57.430> your

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
system that you can actually adjust your

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.590 
system that you can actually adjust your
tongue<00:01:58.270> get<00:01:58.960> your<00:01:59.140> boot<00:01:59.320> on<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.920> then<00:02:00.700> tighten

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
tongue get your boot on and then tighten

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.720 
tongue get your boot on and then tighten
it<00:02:01.690> on<00:02:01.780> up<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.350> it's<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.860> lot<00:02:02.950> easier<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.430> get<00:02:03.550> in

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
it on up so it's a lot easier to get in

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.970 
it on up so it's a lot easier to get in
into<00:02:04.000> same<00:02:04.780> thing<00:02:04.990> for<00:02:05.170> getting<00:02:05.410> out<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:05.770> come

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
into same thing for getting out you come

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.800 
into same thing for getting out you come
up<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.820> undo<00:02:07.150> these<00:02:07.300> things<00:02:07.570> as<00:02:07.690> you're

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
up you can undo these things as you're

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.780 
up you can undo these things as you're
riding<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.260> and<00:02:08.500> pre<00:02:08.740> pull<00:02:09.040> your<00:02:09.250> tongue<00:02:09.490> nice

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
riding in and pre pull your tongue nice

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.340 
riding in and pre pull your tongue nice
and<00:02:09.970> open<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.780> get<00:02:10.900> to<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.080> beach<00:02:11.200> you

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
and open so you get to the beach you

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.930 
and open so you get to the beach you
just<00:02:11.560> jump<00:02:11.770> right<00:02:11.860> out<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.130> your<00:02:12.280> body<00:02:12.520> so

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
just jump right out of your body so

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.420 
just jump right out of your body so
really<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.410> convenience<00:02:14.920> factor<00:02:15.100> in

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
really it's a convenience factor in

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.310 
really it's a convenience factor in
terms<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.760> performance<00:02:15.940> all<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.110> same

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
terms of performance all the same

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.080 
terms of performance all the same
performance<00:02:17.770> as<00:02:18.160> what's<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.700> Vantage

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
performance as what's in the Vantage

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.180 
performance as what's in the Vantage
binding<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.020> wakeboarding<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.770> it's<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.040> nice

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
binding for wakeboarding so it's a nice

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.130 
binding for wakeboarding so it's a nice
stiff<00:02:21.490> binding<00:02:22.030> provides<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.480> lot<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.750> support

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
stiff binding provides a lot of support

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.460 
stiff binding provides a lot of support
and<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:24.010> forth<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.690> that's<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> main<00:02:26.050> thing<00:02:26.080> so

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
and so forth so that's the main thing so

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.900 
and so forth so that's the main thing so
when<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.650> look<00:02:26.800> at<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.010> velcro<00:02:27.190> ones<00:02:27.670> it's

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
when you look at the velcro ones it's

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.700 
when you look at the velcro ones it's
really<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.210> tongue<00:02:28.510> pull<00:02:28.810> he'll<00:02:29.200> pull<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.590> there

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
really a tongue pull he'll pull in there

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.160 
really a tongue pull he'll pull in there
for<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:29.980> convenience<00:02:30.250> factor<00:02:30.810> once<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:31.990> get

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
for the convenience factor once we get

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.370 
for the convenience factor once we get
on<00:02:33.060> once<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.180> get<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.450> into<00:02:34.720> our<00:02:34.810> laced<00:02:35.080> boots

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
on once we get on into our laced boots

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.250 
on once we get on into our laced boots
so<00:02:35.770> it's<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.040> open<00:02:36.430> toe<00:02:36.640> ultra<00:02:37.180> kite<00:02:37.420> what<00:02:38.170> we

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
so it's the open toe ultra kite what we

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.110 
so it's the open toe ultra kite what we
do<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.370> wakeboard<00:02:39.760> binding

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
do on that is in a wakeboard binding

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.870 
do on that is in a wakeboard binding
that<00:02:40.240> will<00:02:40.330> have<00:02:40.450> two<00:02:40.890> separate<00:02:41.890> laces<00:02:42.370> for

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
that will have two separate laces for

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.340 
that will have two separate laces for
the<00:02:43.000> bottom<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.600> foot<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.930> then<00:02:44.050> up<00:02:44.170> in

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
the bottom of the foot and then up in

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.860 
the bottom of the foot and then up in
the<00:02:44.380> ankle<00:02:45.220> what<00:02:45.730> we<00:02:45.850> do<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.090> we<00:02:46.210> create<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.570> one

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the ankle what we do is we create a one

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.620 
the ankle what we do is we create a one
lace<00:02:47.110> pole<00:02:47.410> system<00:02:47.680> with<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> stop<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.360> just

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
lace pole system with a stop so you just

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.860 
lace pole system with a stop so you just
have<00:02:49.810> one<00:02:50.050> lace<00:02:50.320> here<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.400> easy<00:02:51.640> to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
have one lace here so it's easy to

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.690 
have one lace here so it's easy to
tighten<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:52.990> with<00:02:53.140> one<00:02:53.290> hand<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.740> go<00:02:53.920> along

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
tighten it up with one hand and go along

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.030 
tighten it up with one hand and go along
with<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.060> tongue<00:02:55.270> pole<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:56.620> other<00:02:56.770> thing

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
with the tongue pole the other thing

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.830 
with the tongue pole the other thing
you're<00:02:57.670> out<00:02:57.790> there<00:02:57.970> riding<00:02:58.150> if<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.510> have<00:02:58.630> two

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
you're out there riding if you have two

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.260 
you're out there riding if you have two
laces<00:02:59.050> things<00:03:00.010> are<00:03:00.160> flip<00:03:00.370> flopping<00:03:00.880> around<00:03:00.970> in

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
laces things are flip flopping around in

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.730 
laces things are flip flopping around in
