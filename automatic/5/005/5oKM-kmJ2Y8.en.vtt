I<00:01:48.390> mean<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.560> guess<00:01:49.619> it'll<00:01:50.070> be

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I mean this go so I guess it'll be

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.649 
I mean this go so I guess it'll be
common<00:01:50.460> sense<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> carry<00:01:51.090> will<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.509> us

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
common sense for it to carry will of us

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.090 
common sense for it to carry will of us
but<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.350> actually<00:01:52.470> my<00:01:52.770> first<00:01:52.799> time

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
from the brave bird while i can just

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
like reus off the damage periodically so

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.180 
like reus off the damage periodically so
doesn't<00:03:05.049> make<00:03:05.140> sense<00:03:05.290> anyway<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:05.769> he<00:03:05.980> switches

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
doesn't make sense anyway so he switches

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.520 
doesn't make sense anyway so he switches
out<00:03:06.400> into<00:03:06.670> his<00:03:06.970> dinner<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.660> copy<00:03:07.959> my<00:03:08.200> Gliscor

out into his dinner to copy my Gliscor

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.470 
out into his dinner to copy my Gliscor
so<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.280> he<00:03:09.370> could<00:03:09.489> set<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.700> trust<00:03:10.060> which<00:03:10.329> is

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
so that he could set a trust which is

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.270 
so that he could set a trust which is
what<00:03:10.660> his<00:03:10.810> thought<00:03:11.019> process<00:03:11.410> was<00:03:11.440> but<00:03:12.100> like<00:03:12.190> i

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
what his thought process was but like i

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.400 
what his thought process was but like i
said<00:03:12.310> earlier<00:03:12.640> i<00:03:12.850> do<00:03:13.000> not<00:03:13.390> have<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.959> Pokemon

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410

switching<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.049> skarmory<00:03:17.500> hence<00:03:17.829> me<00:03:18.040> using

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
switching to the skarmory hence me using

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.160 
switching to the skarmory hence me using
close<00:03:18.579> combat<00:03:18.880> which<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.329> potential<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:20.049> get

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
close combat which is a potential to get

i switched right out until my Gliscor
just<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.230> see<00:03:26.350> what<00:03:26.500> he<00:03:26.590> would<00:03:26.650> switch<00:03:26.859> out<00:03:27.010> too

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
just to see what he would switch out too

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.009 
just to see what he would switch out too
not<00:03:27.639> that<00:03:27.819> i<00:03:27.910> was<00:03:28.000> predicting<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.569> tentacle

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
not that i was predicting the tentacle

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.870 
not that i was predicting the tentacle
switch<00:03:29.260> him<00:03:29.410> but<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.859> just<00:03:30.160> didn't<00:03:30.430> want<00:03:30.639> to<00:03:30.730> see

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
you know things that can get taunted and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.530 
you know things that can get taunted and
crippled<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.639> an<00:03:39.700> extent<00:03:40.060> where<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.420> will<00:03:40.510> be

crippled to an extent where it will be

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.379 
crippled to an extent where it will be
considered<00:03:40.989> almost<00:03:41.139> useless<00:03:41.639> so<00:03:42.639> he<00:03:43.120> switches

guys<00:03:45.459> did<00:03:45.700> see<00:03:45.970> me<00:03:46.480> thinking<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:46.900> who's<00:03:47.049> gonna

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139

guys did see me thinking and who's gonna
go<00:03:47.350> for<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.560> rapids<00:03:47.829> me<00:03:47.950> not<00:03:48.069> staying<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.459> go

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
go for the rapids me not staying and go

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.590 
go for the rapids me not staying and go
for<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.700> earthquake<00:03:49.030> but<00:03:49.150> he<00:03:49.269> goes<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.569> the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
for the earthquake but he goes to the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.599 
for the earthquake but he goes to the
skull<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.319> I'm<00:03:50.380> like<00:03:50.530> okay<00:03:50.709> he<00:03:51.069> might<00:03:51.280> predict

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
skull so I'm like okay he might predict

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.610 
skull so I'm like okay he might predict
me<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.880> switch<00:03:52.120> out<00:03:52.329> which<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:53.019> do<00:03:53.079> switch<00:03:53.470> out

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
me to switch out which I do switch out

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.379 
me to switch out which I do switch out
because<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:53.920> know<00:03:53.980> Gliscor<00:03:54.459> is<00:03:54.609> how<00:03:54.850> important

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
because I know Gliscor is how important

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.430 
because I know Gliscor is how important
right<00:03:55.510> now<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.720> know<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.930> don't<00:03:56.079> want<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.410> waste

right now you know I don't want to waste

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.379 
right now you know I don't want to waste
it<00:03:56.859> you<00:03:57.040> know<00:03:57.130> just<00:03:57.340> on<00:03:57.519> her<00:03:57.609> over<00:03:57.880> prediction

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
it you know just on her over prediction

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.420 
it you know just on her over prediction
so<00:03:59.049> I<00:03:59.079> switched<00:03:59.410> up<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.709> my<00:03:59.799> ferrothorn<00:04:00.250> he

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
so I switched up to my ferrothorn he

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.250 
so I switched up to my ferrothorn he
switches<00:04:00.639> out<00:04:00.910> into<00:04:01.150> ditto<00:04:01.450> me<00:04:01.959> thinking<00:04:02.230> that

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
switches out into ditto me thinking that

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.990 
switches out into ditto me thinking that
he<00:04:02.440> was<00:04:02.470> gonna<00:04:02.590> lock<00:04:02.889> himself<00:04:03.069> onto<00:04:03.400> torn<00:04:03.819> and

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
he was gonna lock himself onto torn and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.910 
he was gonna lock himself onto torn and
or<00:04:04.269> earthquake<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.840> switch<00:04:05.079> right<00:04:05.380> on<00:04:05.530> sister

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
or earthquake I switch right on sister

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.580 
or earthquake I switch right on sister
after<00:04:06.099> but<00:04:06.609> he<00:04:06.700> makes<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:06.970> great<00:04:07.599> play<00:04:07.959> goes<00:04:08.349> for

the toxic but unfortunately it's gonna
miss<00:04:10.599> because<00:04:10.959> throughout<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.440> holds<00:04:11.829> his

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
miss because throughout the holds his

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.400 
miss because throughout the holds his
breath<00:04:12.160> baby<00:04:12.609> avoided

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
breath baby avoided

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.440 
breath baby avoided
taipa<00:04:13.800> holding<00:04:14.220> his<00:04:14.340> breath<00:04:14.520> man<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.360> I'm

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
taipa holding his breath man so I'm

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.270 
taipa holding his breath man so I'm
gonna<00:04:15.570> go<00:04:15.780> out<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.080> use<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.739> turn<00:04:17.010> because

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
gonna go out and use you turn because

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.110 
gonna go out and use you turn because
I'm<00:04:17.340> thinking<00:04:17.610> that<00:04:17.670> he's<00:04:17.790> gonna<00:04:17.910> win

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
I'm thinking that he's gonna win

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.910 
I'm thinking that he's gonna win
switching<00:04:18.480> since<00:04:18.690> he's<00:04:18.810> locked<00:04:19.080> onto<00:04:19.290> toxic

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
switching since he's locked onto toxic

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.430 
switching since he's locked onto toxic
so<00:04:20.610> I<00:04:20.910> he<00:04:21.209> searches<00:04:21.570> out<00:04:21.660> into<00:04:21.930> tentacle

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
so I he searches out into tentacle

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.560 
so I he searches out into tentacle
tentacle<00:04:22.650> doesn't<00:04:23.430> quite<00:04:23.730> die<00:04:24.150> from<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
tentacle doesn't quite die from the

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.600 
tentacle doesn't quite die from the
u-turn<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.230> resistant<00:04:25.860> hit<00:04:26.010> but<00:04:26.550> I'm

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
u-turn it is a resistant hit but I'm

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.040 
u-turn it is a resistant hit but I'm
gonna<00:04:26.790> switch<00:04:26.940> into<00:04:27.120> my<00:04:27.210> agent<00:04:27.570> /<00:04:27.660> which<00:04:27.870> I

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
gonna switch into my agent / which I

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.510 
gonna switch into my agent / which I
don't<00:04:28.170> even<00:04:28.230> think<00:04:28.530> about<00:04:28.680> before<00:04:29.010> when

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
don't even think about before when

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.400 
don't even think about before when
tentacle<00:04:29.880> came<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.300> initially<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.960> guess

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
tentacle came in initially I guess

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.750 
tentacle came in initially I guess
that's<00:04:31.740> why<00:04:31.950> he<00:04:31.980> went<00:04:32.160> for<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.430> skull<00:04:32.640> because

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
that's why he went for the skull because

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.520 
that's why he went for the skull because
he's<00:04:33.030> predicting<00:04:33.450> me<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:34.080> go<00:04:34.200> into<00:04:34.350> my

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
he's predicting me to go into my

he's predicting me to go into my

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
spamblocker being this thing the egg is

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.210 
spamblocker being this thing the egg is

hazard<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.610> guess<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:38.850> makes<00:04:39.090> sense<00:04:39.180> now<00:04:39.390> I

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
hazard so I guess that makes sense now I

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.060 
hazard so I guess that makes sense now I
didn't<00:04:40.140> even<00:04:40.200> think<00:04:40.380> about<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.650> not<00:04:41.010> even
