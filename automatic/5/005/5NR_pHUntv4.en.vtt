and<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.809> pretty<00:00:34.050> laughable<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.309> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and it's pretty laughable but this

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.410 

so<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.920> handheld<00:00:50.430> version<00:00:50.879> came<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:51.270> in

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so this handheld version came out in

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.500 
so this handheld version came out in
1995<00:00:52.320> two<00:00:52.949> years<00:00:53.219> after<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.760> released<00:00:54.239> for

d-pad if he's moving slow enough you can

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.740 
d-pad if he's moving slow enough you can
get<00:01:33.890> him<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.009> drift<00:01:34.460> slightly<00:01:34.969> to<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.210> left<00:01:35.479> or

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the right and if he's stopped entirely

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.940 
the right and if he's stopped entirely
on<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.119> flat<00:01:38.420> surface<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:39.409> can<00:01:39.590> walk<00:01:39.770> around

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
on a flat surface you can walk around

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.779 
on a flat surface you can walk around
jump<00:01:40.819> and<00:01:41.119> even<00:01:41.509> spin<00:01:41.840> -<00:01:42.109> but<00:01:43.009> if<00:01:43.159> he's<00:01:43.310> blazing

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
jump and even spin - but if he's blazing

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.669 
jump and even spin - but if he's blazing
along<00:01:44.060> at<00:01:44.240> full<00:01:44.450> speed<00:01:44.780> you'll<00:01:45.110> just<00:01:45.350> have<00:01:45.530> to

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
along at full speed you'll just have to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.260 
along at full speed you'll just have to
let<00:01:45.799> him<00:01:45.950> do<00:01:46.100> his<00:01:46.250> thing<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.819> see<00:01:47.000> where<00:01:47.179> he

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
let him do his thing and see where he

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.859 
let him do his thing and see where he
ends<00:01:47.420> up

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.449 

so<00:01:56.869> this<00:01:57.049> port<00:01:57.409> for<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.740> game<00:01:57.950> gear<00:01:58.250> is

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
so this port for the game gear is

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.160 
so this port for the game gear is
definitely<00:01:59.000> slimmed<00:01:59.299> down<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.509> bit<00:01:59.810> from<00:02:00.020> its

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
definitely slimmed down a bit from its

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.350 
definitely slimmed down a bit from its
16-bit<00:02:00.799> counterpart<00:02:01.399> mostly<00:02:02.179> due<00:02:02.329> to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
16-bit counterpart mostly due to

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.870 
16-bit counterpart mostly due to
technical<00:02:02.840> limitations<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:04.310> animation

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
technical limitations the animation

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.940 
technical limitations the animation
definitely<00:02:05.509> isn't<00:02:05.810> as<00:02:05.899> smooth<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.500> there's

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
definitely isn't as smooth and there's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.350 
definitely isn't as smooth and there's
not<00:02:07.099> as<00:02:07.280> many<00:02:07.429> things<00:02:07.759> happening<00:02:08.179> on-screen

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
not as many things happening on-screen

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.809 
not as many things happening on-screen
at<00:02:08.780> once<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.289> then<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.220> certainly<00:02:10.489> not

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
at once and then it's certainly not

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.479 
at once and then it's certainly not
quite<00:02:11.120> as<00:02:11.269> colorful<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.410> maybe<00:02:12.650> most<00:02:12.950> notably

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
quite as colorful but maybe most notably

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.640 
quite as colorful but maybe most notably
the<00:02:13.849> collision<00:02:14.360> detection<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:15.019> definitely

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the collision detection is definitely

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.890 
the collision detection is definitely
not<00:02:15.829> as<00:02:16.010> precise<00:02:16.459> which<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.569> kind<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
not as precise which is kind of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.020 
not as precise which is kind of
important<00:02:18.349> for<00:02:18.380> this<00:02:18.590> game<00:02:18.890> Sonic<00:02:19.790> Spinball

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
important for this game Sonic Spinball

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.910 
important for this game Sonic Spinball
is<00:02:20.269> all<00:02:20.510> about<00:02:20.750> exploring<00:02:21.349> the<00:02:21.440> level<00:02:21.769> by

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
is all about exploring the level by

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.770 
is all about exploring the level by
launching<00:02:22.400> yourself<00:02:22.819> into<00:02:23.060> various<00:02:23.390> tunnels

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
launching yourself into various tunnels

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.869 
launching yourself into various tunnels
and<00:02:23.930> ramps<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.860> timing<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.340> your<00:02:25.489> flipper

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
and ramps and the timing of your flipper

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.940 
and ramps and the timing of your flipper
shots<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.420> much<00:02:26.720> more<00:02:26.959> forgiving<00:02:27.500> on<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.739> game

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
shots is much more forgiving on the game

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.860 
shots is much more forgiving on the game
gear<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.610> instead<00:02:29.000> it's<00:02:29.299> just<00:02:29.540> more<00:02:29.750> about

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
gear so instead it's just more about

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.420 
gear so instead it's just more about
knowing<00:02:30.379> where<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> Chaos<00:02:30.950> Emeralds

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.309 
knowing where the Chaos Emeralds
actually<00:02:31.850> are<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.239> then<00:02:32.720> from<00:02:32.900> there<00:02:33.109> it

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
actually are and then from there it

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.379 
actually are and then from there it
seems<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.739> bit<00:02:33.769> too<00:02:33.920> easy<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.519> navigate<00:02:34.700> once

collection<00:03:35.060> but<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:35.930> gotta<00:03:36.139> say<00:03:36.410> if<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.769> have<00:03:36.889> a

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
collection but I gotta say if you have a

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.570 
collection but I gotta say if you have a
choice<00:03:37.220> between<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.669> two<00:03:37.820> spin<00:03:38.449> balls

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
choice between the two spin balls

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.730 
choice between the two spin balls
the<00:03:39.970> genesis<00:03:40.420> version<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:41.020> probably<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.620> way

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
the genesis version is probably the way

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.920 
the genesis version is probably the way
to<00:03:41.770> go
