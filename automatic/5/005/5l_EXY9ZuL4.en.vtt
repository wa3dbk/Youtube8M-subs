for me I will just go ahead and sell
them<00:03:15.800> on<00:03:15.890> eBay<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.430> believe

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
them on eBay so this is the I believe

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.750 
them on eBay so this is the I believe
the<00:03:19.610> medium<00:03:20.120> length<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.050> frosted<00:03:21.760> so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
the medium length and the frosted so

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.940 
the medium length and the frosted so
this<00:03:22.940> is<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.239> frosted<00:03:23.840> shade<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.180> a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
this is the frosted shade so it's a a

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.300 
this is the frosted shade so it's a a
brown<00:03:27.950> with<00:03:28.780> highlights<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:30.890> one<00:03:31.070> does

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
brown with highlights and this one does

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.010 
brown with highlights and this one does
have<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:32.110> development<00:03:33.110> headband<00:03:33.650> attached<00:03:34.130> I

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
have the development headband attached I

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.650 
have the development headband attached I
don't<00:03:36.020> know<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.170> think<00:03:40.090> maybe<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.330> needs<00:03:41.510> to

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
don't know I think maybe it needs to

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.240 
don't know I think maybe it needs to
come<00:03:41.810> forward<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.200> little<00:03:42.230> bit<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:42.950> kind<00:03:43.160> of

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
come forward a little bit it's kind of

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.620 
come forward a little bit it's kind of
tricky<00:03:43.489> because<00:03:43.760> as<00:03:44.030> soon<00:03:44.209> as<00:03:44.330> you<00:03:44.420> start

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
tricky because as soon as you start

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.150 
tricky because as soon as you start
playing<00:03:44.870> with<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.200> velcro<00:03:45.410> across<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.980> hair

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
playing with the velcro across the hair

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.910 
playing with the velcro across the hair
gets<00:03:46.400> caught<00:03:46.610> underneath<00:03:47.180> but<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.019> this<00:03:48.680> also

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
gets caught underneath but and this also

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.759 
gets caught underneath but and this also
has<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.519> comb<00:03:49.970> inside<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:52.060> velcro<00:03:53.060> tabs

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
has the comb inside and the velcro tabs

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.850 
has the comb inside and the velcro tabs
so<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:55.420> thought<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:56.570> was<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:57.080> nice<00:03:57.680> color<00:03:58.780> I

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
so I thought this was a nice color I

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.960 
so I thought this was a nice color I
don't<00:04:00.860> think<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.160> could<00:04:01.370> tolerate<00:04:01.550> this

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
don't think I could tolerate this

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.360 
don't think I could tolerate this
headband<00:04:02.480> for<00:04:02.690> any<00:04:02.870> length<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.380> time<00:04:03.440> just

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
headband for any length of time just

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.509 
headband for any length of time just
because<00:04:04.580> any<00:04:05.209> hard<00:04:05.630> headband<00:04:06.200> tends<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.370> give

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
because any hard headband tends to give

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.020 
because any hard headband tends to give
me<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.700> headache<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.560> would<00:04:10.160> on<00:04:10.370> any<00:04:10.700> of<00:04:10.910> these

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
me a headache so I would on any of these

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.810 
me a headache so I would on any of these
I<00:04:11.269> would<00:04:11.390> remove<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.260> hard<00:04:12.980> headband<00:04:13.580> and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
I would remove this hard headband and

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.470 
I would remove this hard headband and
then<00:04:13.970> put

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
then put

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.449 
then put
clips<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.200> comb<00:04:15.409> and<00:04:15.890> put<00:04:16.070> wig<00:04:16.250> clips

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
clips in and the comb and put wig clips

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.710 
clips in and the comb and put wig clips
in<00:04:16.760> so<00:04:18.519> with<00:04:19.519> my<00:04:19.699> roots<00:04:19.970> growing<00:04:20.239> out<00:04:20.510> this

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
in so with my roots growing out this

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.140 
in so with my roots growing out this
wouldn't<00:04:21.019> be<00:04:21.109> a<00:04:21.139> bad<00:04:21.520> color<00:04:22.520> it's<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:23.120> little

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
wouldn't be a bad color it's a little

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.800 
wouldn't be a bad color it's a little
dark<00:04:23.630> for<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.260> hair<00:04:24.740> color<00:04:24.949> now<00:04:25.250> but<00:04:25.550> who<00:04:25.669> knows

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
dark for a hair color now but who knows

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.330 
dark for a hair color now but who knows
what<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.840> will<00:04:27.139> do<00:04:27.320> with<00:04:27.440> my<00:04:27.620> hair<00:04:27.800> color<00:04:27.830> in<00:04:28.220> the

what I will do with my hair color in the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.600 
what I will do with my hair color in the

have<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.520> long<00:04:46.880> narrow<00:04:47.300> head<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:47.990> lot<00:04:48.350> of

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
have a long narrow head so a lot of

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.090 
have a long narrow head so a lot of
times<00:04:49.570> we'd<00:04:50.570> look<00:04:50.900> longer<00:04:51.380> on<00:04:51.500> me<00:04:51.770> than<00:04:51.979> they

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
times we'd look longer on me than they

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.290 
times we'd look longer on me than they
do<00:04:52.160> on<00:04:52.400> other<00:04:52.520> people<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.880> front<00:04:56.150> again

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
do on other people and the front again

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.100 
do on other people and the front again
so<00:04:56.780> that<00:04:56.960> is<00:04:57.139> the<00:04:57.320> medium<00:04:57.710> in<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.100> frosted<00:04:59.110> and

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
so that is the medium in the frosted and

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.529 
so that is the medium in the frosted and
there<00:05:00.260> are<00:05:00.350> no<00:05:00.470> labels<00:05:00.650> on<00:05:01.039> these<00:05:04.060> let's<00:05:05.060> see

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
there are no labels on these let's see

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.350 
there are no labels on these let's see
which<00:05:05.840> one<00:05:06.080> is<00:05:06.229> this<00:05:06.410> this<00:05:07.370> is<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.760> real<00:05:08.000> pale

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
which one is this this is the real pale

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.830 
which one is this this is the real pale
blonde<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.870> think<00:05:09.110> this<00:05:10.300> would<00:05:11.300> be<00:05:11.449> considered

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
blonde I think this would be considered

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.469 
blonde I think this would be considered
the<00:05:12.070> Paris<00:05:13.070> blonde<00:05:13.430> perhaps<00:05:14.000> it's<00:05:14.210> very

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
the Paris blonde perhaps it's very

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.879 
the Paris blonde perhaps it's very
platinum<00:05:15.370> very<00:05:16.370> pale<00:05:16.729> and<00:05:16.970> again<00:05:17.270> this<00:05:17.449> is<00:05:17.630> the

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
platinum very pale and again this is the

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:24.310 
platinum very pale and again this is the
medium<00:05:18.889> length<00:05:22.599> and<00:05:23.599> I<00:05:23.690> saw<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:24.080> there<00:05:24.260> were

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
medium length and I saw that there were

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.909 
medium length and I saw that there were
some<00:05:24.500> other<00:05:24.590> ones<00:05:24.860> on<00:05:25.220> eBay<00:05:26.740> some<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:27.830> the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
some other ones on eBay some of the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.210 
some other ones on eBay some of the
Paris<00:05:28.220> Hilton<00:05:28.430> bandits<00:05:29.770> I'm<00:05:30.770> not<00:05:30.919> sure<00:05:31.070> what

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
Paris Hilton bandits I'm not sure what

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.550 
Paris Hilton bandits I'm not sure what
they<00:05:31.340> retailed<00:05:31.789> for<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.090> Sally<00:05:32.330> Beauty<00:05:32.900> back

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
they retailed for it Sally Beauty back

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.490 
they retailed for it Sally Beauty back
in<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.770> day<00:05:33.950> when<00:05:34.250> they<00:05:34.539> came<00:05:35.539> out<00:05:35.750> so<00:05:36.169> I<00:05:36.349> have

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
in the day when they came out so I have

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.080 
in the day when they came out so I have
no<00:05:36.650> idea<00:05:38.710> but<00:05:39.710> I<00:05:39.770> figured<00:05:40.220> for<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.490> price<00:05:40.760> that

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
no idea but I figured for the price that

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.719 
no idea but I figured for the price that
this<00:05:41.720> person<00:05:42.139> was<00:05:42.260> selling<00:05:42.650> them<00:05:42.770> for<00:05:43.010> even<00:05:43.400> if

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
this person was selling them for even if

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.150 
this person was selling them for even if
it<00:05:44.330> didn't<00:05:44.780> work<00:05:44.900> for<00:05:44.960> me<00:05:45.289> I<00:05:45.530> would<00:05:45.740> just<00:05:45.889> turn

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
it didn't work for me I would just turn

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.750 
it didn't work for me I would just turn
around<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:46.729> step<00:05:47.660> on<00:05:47.780> ebay<00:05:48.940> so<00:05:51.460> like<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.580> say<00:05:52.729> I

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
around and step on ebay so like I say I

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.670 
around and step on ebay so like I say I
think<00:05:52.910> this<00:05:53.150> is<00:05:53.210> probably<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.960> Paris<00:05:54.349> blonde

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
think this is probably the Paris blonde

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.029 
think this is probably the Paris blonde
because<00:05:54.919> it<00:05:55.190> looks<00:05:55.419> like<00:05:56.419> her<00:05:56.900> color

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
because it looks like her color

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.490 
because it looks like her color
how<00:05:58.700> many<00:05:58.910> doing<00:05:59.180> in<00:05:59.300> time<00:05:59.539> hang<00:05:59.840> on<00:05:59.990> at<00:06:00.289> the

how many doing in time hang on at the

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.150 
how many doing in time hang on at the

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
look posed okay six minutes and then it

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.040 
look posed okay six minutes and then it
came<00:06:07.340> with<00:06:07.520> these<00:06:07.669> extra<00:06:08.330> velvet<00:06:09.320> headbands

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050

they're a little it looks like you're a

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.730 
they're a little it looks like you're a
little<00:06:16.130> wider<00:06:16.550> perhaps<00:06:17.120> and<00:06:17.480> the<00:06:17.570> one<00:06:17.740> that

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
little wider perhaps and the one that

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.300 
little wider perhaps and the one that
comes<00:06:18.950> on<00:06:19.280> the<00:06:19.850> hairpiece<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.140> then<00:06:21.950> this<00:06:22.160> is

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
comes on the hairpiece and then this is

very natural looking color especially in
this<00:06:48.440> length<00:06:48.760> but<00:06:50.980> it's<00:06:51.980> nice<00:06:52.220> it's<00:06:52.460> pretty

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
the long hair isn't the best for me

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.520 
the long hair isn't the best for me
sometimes<00:07:01.070> you<00:07:01.160> just<00:07:01.250> have<00:07:01.460> to<00:07:01.610> rock<00:07:02.300> it<00:07:05.530> so

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
sometimes you just have to rock it so

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.170 
sometimes you just have to rock it so
this<00:07:06.800> is<00:07:06.980> the<00:07:07.130> long<00:07:07.340> when<00:07:07.610> the<00:07:07.670> hair<00:07:07.850> is<00:07:07.880> very

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
this is the long when the hair is very

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.390 
this is the long when the hair is very
silky<00:07:11.140> and<00:07:12.140> I<00:07:12.530> don't<00:07:12.740> know<00:07:12.950> how<00:07:13.070> it<00:07:13.160> looks<00:07:13.280> on

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400

camera<00:07:13.610> but<00:07:13.940> in<00:07:14.030> person<00:07:14.090> it<00:07:14.720> doesn't<00:07:15.020> look

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
camera but in person it doesn't look

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.030 
camera but in person it doesn't look
overly<00:07:15.500> shiny<00:07:16.420> so<00:07:17.420> it<00:07:17.690> seems<00:07:18.620> to<00:07:18.800> be<00:07:18.920> a<00:07:18.950> very

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040 
overly shiny so it seems to be a very

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:27.640 
overly shiny so it seems to be a very
good<00:07:20.030> quality<00:07:21.070> synthetic<00:07:22.070> fiber<00:07:23.350> so<00:07:26.320> that<00:07:27.320> is

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
good quality synthetic fiber so that is

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.940 
good quality synthetic fiber so that is
that<00:07:28.000> so<00:07:29.000> those<00:07:29.180> are<00:07:29.450> my<00:07:29.860> Paris<00:07:30.860> Hilton<00:07:31.340> bandit

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950
