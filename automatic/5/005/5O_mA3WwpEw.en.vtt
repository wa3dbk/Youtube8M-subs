rothstein<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.910> it's<00:00:08.910> actually<00:00:09.210> going<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> be

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
rothstein and it's actually going to be

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.180 
rothstein and it's actually going to be
broken<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.900> into<00:00:10.019> several<00:00:10.500> parts<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.010> not

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
broken up into several parts and not

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.560 
broken up into several parts and not
kind<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> teach<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.700> all<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:13.200> go<00:00:13.549> and

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
kind of teach it all in one one go and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.120 
kind of teach it all in one one go and
so<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:15.929> part<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.500> actually<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
so the first part is actually not the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.769 
so the first part is actually not the
beginning<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> song<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.210> it's

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
beginning of the song but it's it's

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.590 
beginning of the song but it's it's
leading<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.619> very<00:00:19.770> emphatic<00:00:20.310> part<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
leading up to the very emphatic part the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.170 
leading up to the very emphatic part the
main<00:00:21.869> melody<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.350> everyone<00:00:22.619> knows<00:00:23.180> this

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
main melody that everyone knows this

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.320 
main melody that everyone knows this
part<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.689> based<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.920> D<00:00:26.220> minor<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.849> naturally

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
part is based on D minor so naturally

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.029 
part is based on D minor so naturally
our<00:00:27.359> first<00:00:27.660> chords<00:00:27.960> are<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.619> D<00:00:28.800> minor

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
our first chords are going to be D minor

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.120 
our first chords are going to be D minor
and<00:00:29.420> it's<00:00:30.420> your<00:00:31.140> left<00:00:31.380> hand<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.769> actually

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and it's your left hand it's actually

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.069 
and it's your left hand it's actually
very<00:00:32.279> simple<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.210> doing<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.690> hitting

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
very simple all it's doing is hitting

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.220 
very simple all it's doing is hitting
two<00:00:34.469> octaves<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.190> D<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.700> our<00:00:35.820> D<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.110> do

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
two octaves of D that our D you can do

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.630 
two octaves of D that our D you can do
this<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.610> choose<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
this or this I choose this one and

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.760 
this or this I choose this one and
you're<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.910> hitting<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.420> basic<00:00:42.719> timing

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.740 

there's<00:00:46.370> only<00:00:46.520> one<00:00:46.790> time<00:00:47.030> that'll<00:00:47.330> change<00:00:47.540> an

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
there's only one time that'll change an

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.480 
there's only one time that'll change an
escalator<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:49.750> you<00:00:50.750> have<00:00:51.010> your<00:00:52.010> first<00:00:52.250> right

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
escalator and you have your first right

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.470 
escalator and you have your first right
handed<00:00:52.820> chord<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.390> D<00:00:53.900> minor<00:00:54.440> naturally<00:00:55.310> so<00:00:55.970> the

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
handed chord is D minor naturally so the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.430 
handed chord is D minor naturally so the
beginning<00:00:56.600> is

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:12.359 

Oh

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.530 

all<00:01:13.369> right<00:01:13.520> now<00:01:13.729> let<00:01:13.909> me<00:01:14.030> break<00:01:14.240> down<00:01:14.420> the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
all right now let me break down the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.880 
all right now let me break down the
right-handed<00:01:15.020> part<00:01:15.290> that's<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.710> most

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
right-handed part that's the most

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.520 
right-handed part that's the most
complex<00:01:16.190> obviously<00:01:16.930> you're<00:01:17.930> hitting<00:01:18.200> an

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
complex obviously you're hitting an

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.249 
complex obviously you're hitting an
octave<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.190> D<00:01:19.580> minor<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.630> then<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:20.930> higher

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
octave of D minor and then a higher

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.120 
octave of D minor and then a higher
octave<00:01:21.619> above<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:23.570> second<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.710> lower

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
octave above the second is a lower

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.859 
octave above the second is a lower
octave<00:01:25.369> of<00:01:25.880> C<00:01:26.780> minor<00:01:27.670> high<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.570> that's<00:01:29.720> how

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
octave of C minor high and that's how

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:30.910 
octave of C minor high and that's how
it'll<00:01:30.050> work<00:01:30.110> play<00:01:30.380> out<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.590> whole<00:01:30.710> thing

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
it'll work play out the whole thing

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.950 
it'll work play out the whole thing
so<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:35.890> next<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.789> different<00:01:38.300> version<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.750> a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
so the next is a different version of a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.070 
so the next is a different version of a
major<00:01:39.259> which<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.950> start<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.490> C<00:01:40.759> sharp<00:01:40.789> so<00:01:41.750> if

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
major which you start on C sharp so if

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.389 
major which you start on C sharp so if
you<00:01:42.170> don't<00:01:42.320> know<00:01:42.410> these<00:01:42.590> chords<00:01:42.950> by<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.220> way

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
you don't know these chords by the way

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.139 
you don't know these chords by the way
if<00:01:43.580> you<00:01:43.700> don't<00:01:43.910> know<00:01:44.509> what<00:01:44.660> I'm<00:01:44.720> talking<00:01:45.110> about

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
if you don't know what I'm talking about

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.850 
if you don't know what I'm talking about

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
just look them up online you probably

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.710 
just look them up online you probably
should<00:01:49.070> know<00:01:49.280> those<00:01:49.640> if<00:01:50.330> you're<00:01:50.509> going<00:01:50.630> to

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
learn anything than piano and so C sharp

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.279 
learn anything than piano and so C sharp
E<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.429> mix<00:01:56.149> up<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.420> score<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.640> next<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.600> G

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
E and a mix up the score the next is a G

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.559 
E and a mix up the score the next is a G
sharp<00:02:00.320> major<00:02:02.470> which<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.500> d<00:02:03.979> sharp<00:02:04.030> G<00:02:05.030> sharp<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
sharp major which is d sharp G sharp and

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.100 
sharp major which is d sharp G sharp and
then<00:02:05.780> C<00:02:07.299> so<00:02:08.299> those<00:02:08.570> are<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> first<00:02:08.959> four

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
then C so those are the first four

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.610 
then C so those are the first four
chords<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.799> this<00:02:10.700> section<00:02:11.180> starts<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.410> B

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
chords of this section starts out B

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.440 
chords of this section starts out B
minor

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.360 

you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.620 

and<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.610> goes<00:02:21.760> into<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.150> second<00:02:22.480> part

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
and then it goes into the second part

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.460 
and then it goes into the second part
which<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.430> another<00:02:24.430> chord<00:02:25.000> variation<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.959> D

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
which is another chord variation of D

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.430 
which is another chord variation of D
minor<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.910> start<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.270> F<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.020> go<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.230> a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
minor you start on F and then go to a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.800 
minor you start on F and then go to a
and<00:02:29.830> then<00:02:29.980> D<00:02:31.770> just<00:02:32.770> sounds<00:02:33.130> higher<00:02:33.459> up<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:33.910> it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
and then D just sounds higher up and it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.350 
and then D just sounds higher up and it
enables<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.500> second<00:02:35.800> part<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.370> then

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
enables the second part of this and then

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.020 
enables the second part of this and then
your<00:02:37.930> next<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> D<00:02:39.520> sharp<00:02:39.820> minor<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:42.700> three

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030

Black Keys right here and then your next
is<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:47.050> variation<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:48.280> F<00:02:48.940> major<00:02:49.270> which<00:02:49.810> you

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
is a variation of F major which you

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.300 
is a variation of F major which you
start<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.319> C<00:02:50.560> F<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.370> then<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:53.500> then<00:02:54.070> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
start on C F and then a and then the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.520 
start on C F and then a and then the
next<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> really<00:02:55.510> strange<00:02:55.840> looking<00:02:56.140> chord

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
next is a really strange looking chord

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.770 
next is a really strange looking chord
but<00:02:56.739> it's<00:02:56.860> just<00:02:57.720> B<00:02:58.720> may<00:02:58.870> be<00:02:59.410> major<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:01.300> then

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
but it's just B may be major and then

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.300 
but it's just B may be major and then
your<00:03:01.959> left<00:03:02.140> hands<00:03:02.440> actually<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.070> is<00:03:03.220> the
