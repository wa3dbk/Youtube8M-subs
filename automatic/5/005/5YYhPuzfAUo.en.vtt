and<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.600> has<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> keep<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.289> safe<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.489> have

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and it has to keep it safe so as to have

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.399 
and it has to keep it safe so as to have
1<00:00:57.360> liter<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:58.340> water<00:00:59.340> a<00:01:00.059> boiling<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:03.110> it's<00:01:04.110> not

1 liter of water a boiling and it's not

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.490 
1 liter of water a boiling and it's not
really<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> most<00:01:05.070> efficient<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.090> know

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
really the most efficient thing you know

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.810 
really the most efficient thing you know
of<00:01:07.500> course<00:01:07.770> you're<00:01:07.920> much<00:01:08.130> better<00:01:08.340> off<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.700> an

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
of course you're much better off with an

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.990 
of course you're much better off with an
actual<00:01:09.180> stove<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.439> again<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> idea<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
actual stove but again the idea here is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
actual stove but again the idea here is
the<00:01:13.280> multiple<00:01:14.280> use<00:01:14.720> application<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.320> single

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650

for example a perfection heater would be

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.149 
for example a perfection heater would be
maybe<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.329> bit<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:03.750> rugged<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
maybe a little bit more rugged and and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.109 
maybe a little bit more rugged and and
more<00:02:05.340> adequate<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.360> hard<00:02:07.229> use<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
more adequate for a hard use but you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.020 
more adequate for a hard use but you
know<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.899> goes<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.709> each<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.879> know<00:02:12.000> I

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
know that goes with each one you know I

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.890 
know that goes with each one you know I
like

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
like

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.080 
like
then<00:02:13.640> they<00:02:14.750> know<00:02:15.750> those<00:02:16.650> imperfections<00:02:17.129> about

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
then they know those imperfections about

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.550 
then they know those imperfections about
the<00:02:18.560> allowing<00:02:19.560> itself<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.019> yeah<00:02:22.019> once<00:02:22.470> you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the allowing itself so yeah once you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.680 
the allowing itself so yeah once you
learn<00:02:22.709> how<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.890> use<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.849> learn<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.599> adjust

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
learn how to use it and learn to adjust

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.630 
learn how to use it and learn to adjust
the<00:02:25.170> blue<00:02:25.349> flame<00:02:25.680> as<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.010> sits<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.489> not

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
the blue flame as it sits it's not

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.830 
the blue flame as it sits it's not
always<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.239> easy<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:28.319> adjust<00:02:28.379> perfectly<00:02:29.250> to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
always that easy to adjust perfectly to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.170 
always that easy to adjust perfectly to
too<00:02:30.840> little<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.440> goes<00:02:31.709> Orange<00:02:32.310> which<00:02:32.579> it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
too little and it goes Orange which it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.500 
too little and it goes Orange which it
should<00:02:33.480> not<00:02:33.599> be<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.810> way<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.500> that's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
should not be that way and that's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.319 
should not be that way and that's
somewhat<00:02:36.510> correct<00:02:37.079> and<00:02:37.590> too<00:02:38.579> much<00:02:38.760> gets

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
somewhat correct and too much gets

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.589 
somewhat correct and too much gets
orange<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.260> yellow<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.650> well<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.129> then<00:02:41.730> wick

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
orange and yellow as well and then wick

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.780 
orange and yellow as well and then wick
cleaner<00:02:43.049> goes<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.440> long<00:02:43.680> way<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.040> helping<00:02:44.069> that

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
cleaner goes a long way in helping that

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.330 
cleaner goes a long way in helping that
but<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.720> kind<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.230> hard<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.560> find<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:46.980> exact

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
but it's kind of hard to find the exact

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.360 
but it's kind of hard to find the exact
point<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.660> them<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.319> pots<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:51.840> top<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:53.280> know

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
point with them a pots on top you know

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.640 
point with them a pots on top you know
you<00:02:53.430> still<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:53.970> ventilation<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.780> such<00:02:54.989> but

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
you still have ventilation and such but

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.920 
you still have ventilation and such but
you<00:02:55.829> have<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.160> make<00:02:56.310> sure<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.629> flame

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
you have to make sure that the the flame

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.180 
you have to make sure that the the flame
is<00:02:58.379> burning<00:02:58.409> properly<00:02:59.359> and<00:03:00.359> in<00:03:00.870> terms<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.349> fuel

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
is burning properly and in terms of fuel

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.170 
is burning properly and in terms of fuel
I'm<00:03:02.519> burning<00:03:03.090> actually<00:03:04.400> white<00:03:05.400> spirits<00:03:05.970> or

I'm burning actually white spirits or
mineral<00:03:06.840> spirit<00:03:07.290> these<00:03:08.129> would<00:03:08.519> be<00:03:09.560> possible

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
mineral spirit these would be possible

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.009 
mineral spirit these would be possible
alternatives<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:12.890> kerosene<00:03:13.890> or<00:03:14.420> k1<00:03:15.420> kerosene

a blackout
you<00:04:34.660> need<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:35.500> carbon<00:04:36.040> monoxide<00:04:36.160> detector<00:04:36.610> just

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
you need a carbon monoxide detector just

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.080 
you need a carbon monoxide detector just
in<00:04:37.480> case<00:04:37.720> if<00:04:37.960> it's<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.560> large<00:04:39.250> enough<00:04:39.370> room<00:04:39.790> with

Oh<00:05:23.830> 32<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:24.730> some<00:05:25.150> of<00:05:25.270> its<00:05:25.390> variants<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.410> I

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
Oh 32 and some of its variants and I

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.550 
Oh 32 and some of its variants and I
haven't<00:05:27.160> tried<00:05:27.340> out<00:05:27.550> with<00:05:27.760> some<00:05:28.000> of<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.240> other

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
haven't tried out with some of the other

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.860 
haven't tried out with some of the other
kerosene<00:05:29.560> heaters<00:05:30.000> I'm<00:05:31.000> not<00:05:31.300> expecting<00:05:31.840> that

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
kerosene heaters I'm not expecting that

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.930 
kerosene heaters I'm not expecting that
much<00:05:32.050> better<00:05:32.590> results<00:05:33.160> with<00:05:33.280> other<00:05:33.520> heaters

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
much better results with other heaters

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.360 
much better results with other heaters
because<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.230> kerosene<00:05:35.560> heater<00:05:35.830> is<00:05:36.100> first

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
because the the kerosene heater is first

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.090 
because the the kerosene heater is first
of<00:05:36.490> all<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.670> heater<00:05:36.970> and<00:05:37.330> only<00:05:38.110> secondary<00:05:38.800> in

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
of all a heater and only secondary in

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.530 
of all a heater and only secondary in
some<00:05:39.370> cases<00:05:39.640> a<00:05:40.620> function<00:05:41.620> of<00:05:42.100> cooking<00:05:42.610> again

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
some cases a function of cooking again

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.510 
some cases a function of cooking again
better<00:05:43.900> than<00:05:44.020> not<00:05:44.440> having<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:45.070> at<00:05:45.190> all<00:05:45.310> you

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
better than not having it at all you

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.850 
better than not having it at all you
know<00:05:45.640> what<00:05:45.760> I<00:05:45.820> mean<00:05:46.060> if<00:05:46.330> this<00:05:46.900> is<00:05:47.050> all<00:05:47.440> you<00:05:47.650> have

at least you will have a way of of

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.410 
at least you will have a way of of
cooking<00:05:50.860> up<00:05:51.010> at<00:05:51.340> least<00:05:51.550> you<00:05:51.730> know<00:05:51.820> heating<00:05:52.150> up

cooking yes it would be taking a little
bit<00:05:56.590> longer<00:05:56.860> until<00:05:57.250> it<00:05:58.210> has<00:05:58.450> a<00:05:58.590> good<00:05:59.590> amount<00:05:59.800> of

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
bit longer until it has a good amount of

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.880 
bit longer until it has a good amount of
boiling<00:06:00.490> water<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:01.120> lid<00:06:01.450> is<00:06:01.930> gonna<00:06:02.710> be

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
boiling water the lid is gonna be

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.180
