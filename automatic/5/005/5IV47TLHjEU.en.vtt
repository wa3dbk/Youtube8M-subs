00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.279
 hey, I have just had breakfast 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.380
 and then I just took a shower 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 made me ready and now I stand 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.890
 just before marius house and we will 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 now a little bit outside with ours 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.960
 penny boards driving around I'm just waiting 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.790
 that she will come out right away and then 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.620
 Let's take a little bit of space 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.250
 I finally got a new camera 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 to get 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.730
 how do you like the quality so me 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.860
 do not know 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 I think that's autofocus I watch 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.590
 now yours all the time 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.800
 screen where you see yourself in it 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.750
 but so far I really like the camera 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 Good and I am glad that I am only now 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.989
 I'm away from my camcorder 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.989
 These can be there 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.590
 [Music] 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:16.200
 community 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.470
 so of this, the gateway to the large parking 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 business and there helps now 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 never have it that way today 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.689
 agile so against the wind you even get 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.509
 Do not mediate in the middle word if it is 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.619
 real mega fast looks better that they 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.299
 maybe another day maybe 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:45.600
 practice a little but still did 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:47.670
 have fun and then have lunch here 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.700
 I have eaten and now I have one 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.549
 show true club bach and that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.920
 Yesterday I ordered the camera 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.840
 I just user so he got 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:06.750
 the canon gmx and have a look 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.580
 arrived man is still a canon g7 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.860
 In any case, that was me 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.140
 The camera has already ordered with Amazon 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.220
 prime from my hostess and 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.959
 actually it is always in 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.760
 two days there and it should be sunday 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.920
 arrive and then came the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.989
 Notify that something with our 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.400
 address is wrong and the package is yes 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.790
 can not be delivered and that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.459
 Now I go back and then yes 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.530
 was a bit panic and directly 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.350
 amazon wrote there are so 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.180
 a live chat feature for those and 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.920
 then they did not mean a problem 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.900
 we just set up an approach 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.560
 order a kenzingen the first 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.299
 Order 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.489
 you do not need again for that 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.170
 pay because he is already for the first 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.900
 but you did not pay for the package 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.010
 was delivered and now have 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.840
 i have two camera and i thought okay then 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.400
 Schick I hold now a package back 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.290
 but now it is seriously on the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.970
 amazon side that I pay for it 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.400
 Must go for the package where we have nothing for 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.370
 have paid and that is deducted yes 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.690
 from the money we get back 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.879
 but how is that supposed to work if we do 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.440
 have not paid anything for it and 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.450
 so I have right now again 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.530
 Write amazon and hope that I am there 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.690
 somehow get an answer 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.970
 maybe I'll have two new ones at the end 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.970
 I will tell you 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:40.330
 [Music] 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.909
 now we have 22 o'clock 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.159
 I'm in bed right now and I'm after 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.379

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.290

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.620
 totally visited i am now at the 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.480

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.860
 Volker if anyone is interested in 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.079
 every case has that with the camera 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.049
 clarified I will not have an extra camera 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.209
 to have over or so, but to become 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.440
 which pick up the next days and now 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.480
 I do not have to do anything for it anyway 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.470
 the shipping or something to pay is completely 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.180
 great and we had just seen 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.829
 we queuing up in the house today 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.989
 believe this was the second year 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.489
 Last year the cats were really many 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.470
 snakes in and even 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.870
 quite a few other animals came the snake 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.190
 Stop the cats from us 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.500
 and I would like to see some animals here 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.240
 in and it has definitely 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.590
 lived but my guests again has the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.690
 then rausgebracht and otherwise I have 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.430
 today still on the video project 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.680
 worked by my host 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.889
 I just care about that whole 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.340
 many of their videos are families 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.380
 videos are burned on dvds and yes 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.210
 so that's all a bit more 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.289
 is ordered and then at that point 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.389
 can access 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.729
 because otherwise I do not have that much 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.010
 Otherwise I would say I quit 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.770
 Today's blog, I think 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.020
