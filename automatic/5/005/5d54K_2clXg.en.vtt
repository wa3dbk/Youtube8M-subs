to it and basically these are the new

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.330 
to it and basically these are the new
blocks<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.349> different

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
blocks that you have you have different

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.669 
blocks that you have you have different
types<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.730> them<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.810> too<00:00:31.260> many<00:00:31.380> items

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
types of them if I have too many items

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.440 
types of them if I have too many items
on<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.910> haven't<00:00:33.149> noticed<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
on right now if you haven't noticed and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.440 
on right now if you haven't noticed and
basically<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.989> wood<00:00:37.530> cobblestone

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
basically you can have wood cobblestone

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.430 
basically you can have wood cobblestone
one<00:00:39.450> sit<00:00:39.690> glass<00:00:41.120> sandstone<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.050> else<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
one sit glass sandstone and what else I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.510 
one sit glass sandstone and what else I
guess<00:00:43.739> snow<00:00:44.550> blocks<00:00:44.910> bricks<00:00:46.190> let's<00:00:47.190> call<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
guess snow blocks bricks let's call it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.479 
guess snow blocks bricks let's call it
up<00:00:47.760> gravel<00:00:48.600> gold<00:00:49.020> block<00:00:49.289> silver<00:00:49.800> box<00:00:50.010> diamond

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
up gravel gold block silver box diamond

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.450 
up gravel gold block silver box diamond
blocks<00:00:50.670> obsidian<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.160> actually

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
blocks obsidian and so on and I actually

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
blocks obsidian and so on and I actually
I<00:00:53.640> think<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
I think that's all of it and then you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.779 
I think that's all of it and then you
have<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.680> these<00:00:55.920> different<00:00:56.129> corners<00:00:56.699> that

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
have all these different corners that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.880 
have all these different corners that
you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
you can do you can have the like you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.119 
you can do you can have the like you
know<00:00:59.090> what<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> full<00:01:00.719> two<00:01:01.020> half<00:01:01.320> slopes

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
know what is it full two half slopes

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.969 
know what is it full two half slopes
that<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.730> call<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:04.530> basically

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that I call them and to basically

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.920 
that I call them and to basically
anything<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.700> corner<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.420> missing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
anything the only corner that's missing

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.410 
anything the only corner that's missing
is<00:01:07.970> where<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.290> where<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> has<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
is where is it where it has the the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.270 
is where is it where it has the the
slant<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.260> goes<00:01:13.470> from<00:01:13.680> basically<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
slant that goes from basically a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
slant that goes from basically a
triangle<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> point<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.530> they<00:01:16.530> don't

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
triangle up to a point and they don't

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.429 
triangle up to a point and they don't
have<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.490> upside<00:01:18.330> down<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:19.200> that's

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
have one that is upside down but that's

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.719 
have one that is upside down but that's
not<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> big<00:01:19.830> deal<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.490> live<00:01:20.580> with

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
not a big deal because we can live with

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.499 
not a big deal because we can live with
that<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.770> these<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.280> pieces<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.390> we

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
that but these are the pieces here we

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.630 
that but these are the pieces here we
got<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> upside<00:01:25.110> down<00:01:25.290> stairs<00:01:25.590> got<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
got the upside down stairs got the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
got the upside down stairs got the
downward<00:01:27.030> slope<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.290> upward<00:01:28.560> slope

these<00:01:50.100> are<00:01:50.369> very<00:01:50.759> useful<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.390> making<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
these are very useful for making a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
these are very useful for making a
unique<00:01:53.009> building<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.299> I'd<00:01:54.810> say<00:01:55.079> if<00:01:55.520> you're<00:01:56.520> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
just a minute is a basically like a demo

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.530 
just a minute is a basically like a demo
demonstration<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.270> done<00:02:12.420> with

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
demonstration of what can be done with

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.390 
demonstration of what can be done with
it<00:02:12.720> so

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
it so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.490

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
turn around and look at it right here I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500 
turn around and look at it right here I
got<00:02:15.830> an<00:02:15.950> archway<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.640> think<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.209> looks<00:02:17.360> pretty

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
got an archway I think it looks pretty

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.759 
got an archway I think it looks pretty
sweet<00:02:17.780> everything<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.700> very<00:02:20.769> smooth

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
sweet everything on it is very smooth

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.130 
sweet everything on it is very smooth
that's<00:02:22.640> what<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.120> always<00:02:23.390> wanted<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:23.989> right

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
that's what I always wanted to see right

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.350 
that's what I always wanted to see right
here<00:02:24.290> I'll<00:02:24.470> show<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:25.790> was<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.090> piece

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
here I'll show you this was the piece

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.130 
here I'll show you this was the piece
that<00:02:26.390> was<00:02:26.569> missing<00:02:27.069> we<00:02:28.069> have<00:02:28.430> where<00:02:28.909> is<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.180> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
that was missing we have where is it the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.530 
that was missing we have where is it the
piece<00:02:30.680> right<00:02:31.010> here<00:02:31.090> where<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.209> goes<00:02:32.329> to<00:02:32.480> the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
piece right here where it goes to the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.270 
piece right here where it goes to the
half<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.989> point<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.980> just<00:02:34.040> a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
half to the point and it's just a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.960 
half to the point and it's just a
triangle

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
triangle

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.180 
triangle
they<00:02:35.360> don't<00:02:35.510> have<00:02:35.629> an<00:02:35.769> upside<00:02:36.769> down<00:02:36.829> version

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
they don't have an upside down version

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.369 
they don't have an upside down version
of<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.329> I<00:02:38.659> just<00:02:38.840> had<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.079> leave<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.319> open

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
of it so I just had to leave that open

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.069 
of it so I just had to leave that open
but<00:02:39.769> it's<00:02:39.890> not<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.190> noticeable<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:41.090> yeah<00:02:41.599> and

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
but it's not that noticeable so yeah and

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.780 
but it's not that noticeable so yeah and
then<00:02:42.349> we<00:02:42.500> have<00:02:42.650> all<00:02:42.829> of<00:02:43.040> our<00:02:43.159> upside<00:02:43.670> down

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
then we have all of our upside down

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.509 
then we have all of our upside down
slopes<00:02:44.090> top<00:02:44.959> slopes<00:02:45.319> all<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.220> different

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
slopes top slopes all the different

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.490 
slopes top slopes all the different
types<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.970> rounded<00:02:48.670> slope<00:02:49.670> pieces<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.750> I

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
types of rounded slope pieces and I

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.580 
types of rounded slope pieces and I
think<00:02:51.769> it's<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.069> very<00:02:52.370> very<00:02:52.670> good<00:02:52.790> one<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.840> mean

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
think it's a very very good one I mean

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.069 
think it's a very very good one I mean
it<00:02:54.769> seemed<00:02:55.370> very<00:02:55.400> stable<00:02:56.090> even<00:02:56.780> though<00:02:56.870> they

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
it seemed very stable even though they

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.720 
it seemed very stable even though they
just<00:02:57.109> added<00:02:57.560> two<00:02:57.859> blocks<00:02:58.159> it's<00:02:58.400> not<00:02:58.579> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
just added two blocks it's not the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.000 
just added two blocks it's not the
biggest<00:02:59.000> thing<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.329> world<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.829> can

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
biggest thing in the world and you can

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.569 
biggest thing in the world and you can
do<00:03:01.159> all<00:03:01.310> sorts<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.700> different<00:03:01.760> things<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.329> it

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
do all sorts of different things with it

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.289 
do all sorts of different things with it
just<00:03:06.040> do<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.069> little<00:03:07.220> bit<00:03:07.519> more<00:03:07.549> entertaining

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
just do a little bit more entertaining

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.009 
just do a little bit more entertaining
but<00:03:09.170> let's<00:03:09.709> get<00:03:09.890> rid<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.129> these<00:03:10.310> real<00:03:10.609> quick

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
but let's get rid of these real quick

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.099 
but let's get rid of these real quick
and<00:03:12.019> see<00:03:12.349> what<00:03:12.530> we<00:03:12.650> come<00:03:12.769> up<00:03:12.950> with<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:14.450> there

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
and see what we come up with and there

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.150 
and see what we come up with and there
and<00:03:15.290> let's<00:03:16.190> use<00:03:16.549> some<00:03:17.419> brick<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.109> time<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:18.919> we

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
and let's use some brick this time so we

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.729 
and let's use some brick this time so we
got<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.269> upside<00:03:20.630> down<00:03:20.810> slope<00:03:21.230> we<00:03:21.470> need<00:03:21.620> the

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
got the upside down slope we need the

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.849 
got the upside down slope we need the
side<00:03:21.950> slope<00:03:22.840> don't<00:03:23.840> need<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.200> stairs<00:03:24.590> right

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
side slope don't need the stairs right

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.539 
side slope don't need the stairs right
now<00:03:25.510> let's<00:03:26.510> use<00:03:26.810> these<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:28.040> don't<00:03:28.099> need<00:03:28.370> two<00:03:28.519> of

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
now let's use these I don't need two of

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.970 
now let's use these I don't need two of
those<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:30.019> those<00:03:30.379> and<00:03:32.049> possibly<00:03:33.049> these<00:03:33.230> and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
those and those and possibly these and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.089 
those and those and possibly these and
what<00:03:34.190> else<00:03:36.340> okay<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:38.299> we're<00:03:39.109> going<00:03:39.379> to<00:03:39.530> put<00:03:39.829> the

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
what else okay so we're going to put the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:59.500 
what else okay so we're going to put the
upside<00:03:40.579> down<00:03:41.139> slope<00:03:42.139> first<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:58.120> we<00:03:59.120> will<00:03:59.269> put

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
upside down slope first and we will put

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.659 
upside down slope first and we will put
this<00:04:00.079> version<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.859> did<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.280> have<00:04:01.519> an

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
this version of it did you have an

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:10.660 
this version of it did you have an
upside<00:04:01.940> down<00:04:02.180> piece<00:04:02.449> of<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:03.230> plain<00:04:03.620> corner

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.610 

and<00:04:11.670> see<00:04:11.880> right<00:04:12.030> there<00:04:12.240> I<00:04:12.270> mean<00:04:12.330> this<00:04:13.170> month's

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
and see right there I mean this month's

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.920 
and see right there I mean this month's
is<00:04:13.800> really<00:04:14.070> cool<00:04:14.280> because<00:04:14.460> most<00:04:15.150> people<00:04:15.630> been

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
is really cool because most people been

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.160 
is really cool because most people been
wanting<00:04:16.519> slopes<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.820> some<00:04:18.150> sort<00:04:18.359> in<00:04:18.570> Minecraft

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
wanting slopes of some sort in Minecraft

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.160 
wanting slopes of some sort in Minecraft
since<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.769> came<00:04:19.950> out<00:04:20.100> but<00:04:21.000> not<00:04:21.840> will<00:04:22.079> not

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
since it came out but not will not

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.250 
since it came out but not will not
implemented<00:04:22.920> himself<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.960> know<00:04:25.080> what

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
implemented himself and so you know what

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.840 
implemented himself and so you know what
that's<00:04:25.680> what<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.010> Mater<00:04:26.190> Steve<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:26.580> they<00:04:26.670> go

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
that's what the Mater Steve if they go

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.940 
that's what the Mater Steve if they go
in<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:27.470> take<00:04:28.470> over<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.770> world

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
in and just take over the world

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.700 
in and just take over the world
basically<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:30.540> let's<00:04:31.020> see<00:04:31.170> what<00:04:31.380> we<00:04:31.470> can<00:04:31.500> do

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
basically and let's see what we can do

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.230 
basically and let's see what we can do
here<00:04:31.920> we<00:04:32.450> have<00:04:33.450> more<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.930> sideways<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:35.640> we

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
here we have more of the sideways and we

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:47.050 
here we have more of the sideways and we
got<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.930> upside<00:04:37.260> down<00:04:40.130> let's<00:04:41.130> try<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.430> out

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.780 

and<00:04:49.160> I'll<00:04:50.160> fill<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.820> I<00:04:51.090> can't<00:04:51.810> know<00:04:52.380> much

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
and I'll fill this in I can't know much

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.600 
and I'll fill this in I can't know much
and<00:04:53.840> I'll<00:04:54.840> bring<00:04:55.050> this<00:04:55.260> out<00:04:55.500> some<00:04:55.830> more<00:04:57.980> and<00:04:58.980> we

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
and I'll bring this out some more and we

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.130 
and I'll bring this out some more and we
need<00:04:59.850> these<00:05:00.150> slopes<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:03.060> see<00:05:03.330> it<00:05:03.660> just

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
need these slopes and see it just

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.960 
need these slopes and see it just
creates<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.800> super<00:05:05.280> smooth<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.669> can<00:05:05.730> have

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
creates a super smooth you can have

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.880 
creates a super smooth you can have
diagonal<00:05:06.300> pieces<00:05:06.690> now<00:05:07.020> instead<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.410> just<00:05:07.680> up

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
diagonal pieces now instead of just up

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.580 
diagonal pieces now instead of just up
and<00:05:08.010> down<00:05:08.900> this<00:05:09.900> piece<00:05:10.140> right<00:05:10.260> here<00:05:10.320> probably

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
and down this piece right here probably

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.570 
and down this piece right here probably
should<00:05:11.040> just<00:05:11.220> be<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.400> solid<00:05:11.760> brick<00:05:12.060> just<00:05:16.580> like

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
should just be a solid brick just like

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
should just be a solid brick just like
that<00:05:18.200> and<00:05:19.200> then<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.530> can<00:05:19.710> put<00:05:20.300> more<00:05:21.300> over<00:05:21.600> here

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
that and then you can put more over here

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.530 
that and then you can put more over here
just<00:05:24.600> like<00:05:24.900> this<00:05:25.140> and<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.880> can<00:05:30.060> like<00:05:30.210> create

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
just like this and you can like create

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.380 
just like this and you can like create
bowls<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.169> different<00:05:31.680> things<00:05:31.890> like<00:05:32.280> that<00:05:33.150> and

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
bowls and different things like that and

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.120 
bowls and different things like that and
see<00:05:33.750> if<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:34.169> put<00:05:34.380> something<00:05:34.680> on<00:05:34.800> top<00:05:34.830> of<00:05:35.010> it

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
see if you put something on top of it

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.010 
see if you put something on top of it
actually<00:05:35.550> look<00:05:35.729> like<00:05:35.760> it's<00:05:36.060> holding<00:05:36.540> it<00:05:36.660> up<00:05:36.810> is

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
actually look like it's holding it up is

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.850 
actually look like it's holding it up is
you<00:05:37.229> know<00:05:38.419> weird<00:05:39.419> looking<00:05:39.960> TV<00:05:40.320> thing<00:05:40.560> I<00:05:40.800> don't
