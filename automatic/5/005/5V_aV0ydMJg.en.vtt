bigger bigger bigger there are course
that<00:00:48.059> I've<00:00:48.239> driven<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.930> country<00:00:49.260> roads

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
that I've driven on some country roads

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
that I've driven on some country roads
and<00:00:49.649> they're<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.129> they're<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.850> nice<00:00:50.969> drive

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and they're there they're not nice drive

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.569 
and they're there they're not nice drive
because<00:00:51.719> they<00:00:51.899> don't<00:00:52.079> fit<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.590> looks

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
because they don't fit that looks

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
because they don't fit that looks
compact<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.840> looks<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.829> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
compact it looks as you can see out of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.310 
compact it looks as you can see out of
it<00:00:56.039> basically<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.149> Titanic<00:00:57.960> leave<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it basically it's it's Titanic leave a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
it basically it's it's Titanic leave a
stand<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.770> performance<00:00:59.280> will<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.579> off<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
stand this performance will be off the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
stand this performance will be off the
scale<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.140> needs<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.530> usable<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.070> well

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
scale but it needs to be usable as well

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.380 
scale but it needs to be usable as well
I<00:01:02.280> mean<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> course<00:01:02.609> pickle<00:01:02.969> will<00:01:03.059> drive<00:01:03.239> them

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
I mean of course pickle will drive them

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
I mean of course pickle will drive them
on<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.629> grace<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.989> circuits<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
on with grace and circuits but it's a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.770 
on with grace and circuits but it's a
room<00:01:04.920> car<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.280> well<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.180> needs<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> fit<00:01:06.630> in

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
room car as well and it needs to fit in

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.920 
room car as well and it needs to fit in
the<00:01:06.810> road

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930

the<00:01:08.350> Baron<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.830> company<00:01:09.160> that<00:01:09.250> is<00:01:09.570> very<00:01:10.570> much

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
the Baron is a company that is very much

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.410 
the Baron is a company that is very much
driven<00:01:10.870> by<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:12.070> function<00:01:13.030> there<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
driven by the function there the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.410 
driven by the function there the
importance<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.200> function<00:01:14.710> over<00:01:15.130> just<00:01:15.790> doing

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
importance of function over just doing

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.670 
importance of function over just doing
something<00:01:16.600> because<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:16.900> looks<00:01:17.080> killed<00:01:17.320> later

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
something because it looks killed later

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
something because it looks killed later
they<00:01:17.830> don't<00:01:18.010> do<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.160> that's<00:01:18.550> not<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
they don't do that that's not the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.940 
they don't do that that's not the
McLaren<00:01:19.120> way<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:20.080> looks<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.620> way<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:20.800> is

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
McLaren way it looks the way it is

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.410 
McLaren way it looks the way it is
because<00:01:21.280> it's<00:01:21.430> designed<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.880> do<00:01:22.000> something

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
because it's designed to do something

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.420 
because it's designed to do something
and<00:01:22.660> I<00:01:22.930> think<00:01:23.110> that's<00:01:23.229> designed<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.680> feel<00:01:24.280> very

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
and I think that's designed to feel very

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.880 
and I think that's designed to feel very
fast<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.940> be<00:01:25.750> sucked<00:01:26.110> down<00:01:26.200> with<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.620> grinds

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
fast and be sucked down with it grinds

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.130 
fast and be sucked down with it grinds
in<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.729> way<00:01:27.850> that<00:01:28.030> probably<00:01:28.360> will<00:01:28.930> blow

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
in a way that probably will blow

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.430 
in a way that probably will blow
everyone's<00:01:29.500> mind<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:31.060> an<00:01:31.810> answer<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.260> their

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
think it's probably not too shabby when

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.920 
think it's probably not too shabby when
it<00:01:36.640> comes<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:36.970> top<00:01:37.150> speed<00:01:37.420> acceleration
