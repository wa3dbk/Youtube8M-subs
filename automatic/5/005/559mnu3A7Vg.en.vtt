cut<00:05:14.270> them<00:05:14.510> but<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.410> problem<00:05:15.800> is<00:05:15.919> it<00:05:16.070> makes<00:05:16.100> it

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
cut them but the problem is it makes it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.189 
cut them but the problem is it makes it
harder<00:05:16.610> things<00:05:16.789> cast<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:17.389> if<00:05:17.570> i'm<00:05:17.750> not<00:05:17.870> playing

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199

relic I didn't get a call at all of it
so<00:06:24.770> I<00:06:25.039> like<00:06:25.220> splitting<00:06:25.490> it<00:06:25.639> like<00:06:25.760> that<00:06:25.909> but<00:06:26.300> I'm

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
so I like splitting it like that but I'm

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.260 
so I like splitting it like that but I'm
changing<00:06:27.139> the<00:06:27.169> sideboard<00:06:27.740> because<00:06:28.159> just<00:06:29.090> all

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
changing the sideboard because just all

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.120 
changing the sideboard because just all
these<00:06:29.389> one-ups<00:06:29.810> didn't<00:06:30.020> feel<00:06:30.199> right<00:06:30.680> I<00:06:30.949> just

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130
