00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.310 

today<00:00:21.859> we<00:00:22.130> are<00:00:22.279> going<00:00:22.550> to<00:00:22.909> be<00:00:23.210> using<00:00:23.779> this

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
today we are going to be using this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.509 
today we are going to be using this
liquitex<00:00:25.779> iridescent<00:00:26.779> medium<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:27.949> what<00:00:28.369> this

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
liquitex iridescent medium so what this

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.440 
liquitex iridescent medium so what this
is<00:00:28.730> is<00:00:28.970> it's<00:00:29.239> like<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.810> gel<00:00:30.109> medium<00:00:30.289> that<00:00:30.769> has

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
is is it's like a gel medium that has

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.470 
is is it's like a gel medium that has
pearl<00:00:32.450> mica<00:00:33.170> probably<00:00:33.800> in<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.330> can

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
pearl mica probably in it and you can

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.780 
pearl mica probably in it and you can
mix<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.870> with<00:00:35.990> your<00:00:36.020> acrylic<00:00:36.560> paint<00:00:36.890> in<00:00:37.460> order

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
mix it with your acrylic paint in order

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.450 
mix it with your acrylic paint in order
to<00:00:37.970> make<00:00:38.150> a<00:00:38.180> paint<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:38.750> is<00:00:38.900> not<00:00:39.460> pearlescent

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
to make a paint that is not pearlescent

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.690 
to make a paint that is not pearlescent
into<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.660> pearlescent<00:00:42.110> paint<00:00:42.560> but<00:00:43.280> we<00:00:43.640> are

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
into a pearlescent paint but we are

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.060 
into a pearlescent paint but we are
going<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.240> of<00:00:44.870> course<00:00:45.110> because<00:00:45.470> we<00:00:45.590> always<00:00:45.740> do

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
going to of course because we always do

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.220 
going to of course because we always do
with<00:00:46.220> our<00:00:46.400> polymer<00:00:46.700> clay<00:00:46.940> use<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.050> in<00:00:48.140> a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
with our polymer clay use it in a

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.130 
with our polymer clay use it in a
totally<00:00:48.590> different<00:00:48.890> way<00:00:49.360> so<00:00:50.360> here<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:50.900> have<00:00:51.110> a

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
totally different way so here we have a

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.660 
totally different way so here we have a
piece<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:52.600> translucent<00:00:53.600> red<00:00:54.110> clay<00:00:54.740> that<00:00:55.340> is

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
piece of translucent red clay that is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.440 
piece of translucent red clay that is
not<00:00:56.120> baked<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:57.650> painted<00:00:58.130> a<00:00:58.430> thick<00:00:58.970> coating

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
not baked and we painted a thick coating

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.950 
not baked and we painted a thick coating
onto<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:01.220> clay<00:01:01.490> of<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.850> iridescent<00:01:02.420> medium

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
onto the clay of the iridescent medium

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.290 
onto the clay of the iridescent medium
and<00:01:03.260> what<00:01:03.829> I'm<00:01:03.950> going<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:04.489> is<00:01:04.909> run<00:01:05.150> it

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
and what I'm going to do is run it

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.020 
and what I'm going to do is run it
through<00:01:05.540> my<00:01:06.290> pasta<00:01:06.830> machine<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.220> see<00:01:07.790> if<00:01:07.909> I

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
through my pasta machine and see if I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.180 
through my pasta machine and see if I
can<00:01:08.240> get<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.480> to<00:01:08.600> crackle<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:09.470> first<00:01:09.770> let<00:01:10.070> it

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
can get it to crackle we first let it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.580 
can get it to crackle we first let it
dry<00:01:10.520> really<00:01:11.060> good<00:01:11.360> yes<00:01:11.720> it's<00:01:11.990> totally<00:01:12.200> dry

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
dry really good yes it's totally dry

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.230 
dry really good yes it's totally dry
paint<00:01:13.150> so<00:01:15.370> acrylic<00:01:16.370> paint<00:01:16.670> if<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:16.909> didn't

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
paint so acrylic paint if you didn't

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
paint so acrylic paint if you didn't
know<00:01:17.420> is<00:01:17.800> basically<00:01:19.270> pigment<00:01:20.270> in<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.810> polymer

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
know is basically pigment in a polymer

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.090 
know is basically pigment in a polymer
medium<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:22.100> many<00:01:23.170> acrylic<00:01:24.170> paints<00:01:24.650> are<00:01:24.800> very

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
medium and many acrylic paints are very

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.580 
medium and many acrylic paints are very
compatible<00:01:25.610> with<00:01:26.150> polymer<00:01:26.780> clay<00:01:26.990> for<00:01:27.350> that

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
compatible with polymer clay for that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.690 
compatible with polymer clay for that
reason<00:01:28.010> some<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.700> them<00:01:28.970> aren't<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:30.700> this

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
reason some of them aren't but this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.990 
reason some of them aren't but this
liquitex<00:01:32.210> brand<00:01:32.570> tends<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.200> be<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.010> now<00:01:34.940> that

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
liquitex brand tends to be so now that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.880 
liquitex brand tends to be so now that
it's<00:01:35.270> dry<00:01:35.479> I'm<00:01:35.930> going<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.380> put<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.680> through<00:01:36.710> my

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
it's dry I'm going to put it through my

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.110 
it's dry I'm going to put it through my
pasta<00:01:37.370> machine<00:01:37.700> at<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.780> thickest<00:01:39.170> setting

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
pasta machine at the thickest setting

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.740 
pasta machine at the thickest setting
once<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:42.670> then<00:01:43.670> I'm<00:01:44.030> going<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.330> progressively

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
once and then I'm going to progressively

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
once and then I'm going to progressively
make<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.740> setting<00:01:46.070> on<00:01:46.190> my<00:01:46.369> machine<00:01:46.549> lower<00:01:47.060> and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
make the setting on my machine lower and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.440 
make the setting on my machine lower and
what<00:01:48.770> I'm<00:01:48.860> doing<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.340> pressing<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.210> paint

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
what I'm doing is pressing the paint

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.060 
what I'm doing is pressing the paint
into<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.990> clay<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.210> causing<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:54.070> crackle

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
into the clay and causing it to crackle

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.709 
into the clay and causing it to crackle
on<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.640> surface

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.319 

okay<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.289> it<00:02:01.409> starting<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.890> go<00:02:02.329> right

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
okay you can see it starting to go right

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.539 
okay you can see it starting to go right
there<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.840> starting<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.320> crackle<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.430> let's

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
there it's starting to crackle so let's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:15.760 
there it's starting to crackle so let's
take<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.969> down<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.390> more

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.670 

okay<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.520> there<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:18.110> beginnings<00:02:18.530> of

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
okay and there we have the beginnings of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.010 
okay and there we have the beginnings of
a<00:02:18.800> nice<00:02:18.950> crackle<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.850> now<00:02:20.240> what<00:02:20.510> I'm<00:02:20.600> gonna<00:02:20.750> do

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
a nice crackle and now what I'm gonna do

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.960 
a nice crackle and now what I'm gonna do
I<00:02:21.050> I've<00:02:21.860> put<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.340> through<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.610> pasta<00:02:22.940> machine

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
I I've put it through the pasta machine

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.320 
I I've put it through the pasta machine
three<00:02:23.660> times<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.590> same<00:02:25.220> direction<00:02:25.820> and

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
three times in this same direction and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.020 
three times in this same direction and
now<00:02:26.870> I'm<00:02:27.080> gonna<00:02:27.230> go<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:28.040> way<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.640> see<00:02:28.820> if<00:02:28.910> I

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
now I'm gonna go this way to see if I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:38.170 
now I'm gonna go this way to see if I
can<00:02:29.210> get<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.420> crackle<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.870> spread<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:37.520> there

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
can get the crackle to spread and there

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.360 
can get the crackle to spread and there
it<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:40.090> I'll<00:02:41.090> zoom<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.840> can<00:02:42.050> see<00:02:42.370> how

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
it is I'll zoom in so you can see how

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.860 
it is I'll zoom in so you can see how
that<00:02:43.550> looks<00:02:45.400> okay<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.460> now<00:02:46.790> what<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> have<00:02:47.150> is

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
that looks okay so now what you have is

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.450 
that looks okay so now what you have is
a<00:02:48.440> piece<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:49.810> clay<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.840> has<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.890> iridescent

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
a piece of clay that has the iridescent

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.270 
a piece of clay that has the iridescent
coating<00:02:53.270> on<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.450> that's<00:02:54.170> all<00:02:54.320> crackled<00:02:54.950> and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
coating on it that's all crackled and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
another sheet of clay and make a design

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.670 
another sheet of clay and make a design
the<00:03:04.430> possibilities<00:03:05.390> are<00:03:05.570> endless<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:06.290> it's

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
the possibilities are endless but it's

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.530

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
definitely take this and add it to a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.570 
definitely take this and add it to a
different<00:03:11.810> color<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.080> paint<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.160> can<00:03:13.370> mix

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
different color of paint so you can mix

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
it with paint and you can get an

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.290 
it with paint and you can get an
iridescent<00:03:15.500> paint<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.580> do<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.120> same

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
iridescent paint and do the same

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.990 
iridescent paint and do the same
technique<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.050> get<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.320> crackle<00:03:18.800> yes<00:03:19.130> so

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
technique and get it to crackle yes so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.790 
technique and get it to crackle yes so
you<00:03:20.600> don't<00:03:20.750> have<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.959> leave<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.230> as<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.650> can

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
you don't have to leave it as is you can

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.650 
you don't have to leave it as is you can
mix<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.280> with<00:03:22.430> paint<00:03:22.730> mm-hmm<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.570> it

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
mix it in with paint mm-hmm so it

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.940 
mix it in with paint mm-hmm so it
doesn't<00:03:23.930> have<00:03:24.020> to<00:03:24.080> be<00:03:24.230> white<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.650> what<00:03:24.800> we're

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
doesn't have to be white is what we're

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.830 
doesn't have to be white is what we're
saying<00:03:25.130> where<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.430> can<00:03:25.700> have<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.030> be<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.690> you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
saying where I can have it be and you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.680 
saying where I can have it be and you
covered<00:03:27.110> any<00:03:27.290> color<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.890> want<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:29.209> have

covered any color you want and just have

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.540 
covered any color you want and just have
it<00:03:29.840> be<00:03:29.959> contrasting<00:03:30.709> with<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.890> color<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.370> clay

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
it be contrasting with the color of clay

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.250 
it be contrasting with the color of clay
that<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.790> use<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.540> can<00:03:32.720> really<00:03:32.959> see

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
that you use so that you can really see

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.650 
that you use so that you can really see
the<00:03:33.380> crackle<00:03:33.740> when<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:33.980> happens<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:35.270> we<00:03:35.510> hope

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
the crackle when it happens so we hope

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.050 
the crackle when it happens so we hope
you<00:03:35.840> enjoy<00:03:36.110> this<00:03:36.380> technique<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.070> again<00:03:37.790> that

you enjoy this technique and again that
was<00:03:38.240> the<00:03:38.660> liquitex<00:03:39.350> basics<00:03:40.150> iridescent

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
was the liquitex basics iridescent

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.950 
was the liquitex basics iridescent
medium

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960
