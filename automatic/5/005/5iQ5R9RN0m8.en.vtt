00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
over here and tell me that I am looking

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.340 
over here and tell me that I am looking
for<00:01:24.790> four<00:01:25.790> different<00:01:26.330> ways<00:01:26.480> to<00:01:26.540> group<00:01:27.110> these

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
for four different ways to group these

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.760 
for four different ways to group these
lilies<00:01:27.740> into<00:01:28.460> 8<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.360> looking<00:01:29.840> over<00:01:30.110> here<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.560> can

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
lilies into 8 so looking over here I can

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.410 
lilies into 8 so looking over here I can
see<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.100> this<00:01:31.250> group<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.640> five<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.270> this

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
see that this group of five and this

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.990 
see that this group of five and this
group<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.780> three<00:01:33.050> would<00:01:33.350> negate<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.610> group<00:01:34.820> of

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
group of three would negate the group of

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.550 
group of three would negate the group of
five<00:01:35.240> two<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.380> one<00:01:36.770> would<00:01:37.670> make<00:01:37.880> eight<00:01:38.560> six

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
five two and one would make eight six

five two and one would make eight six
and<00:01:39.860> two<00:01:40.550> equals<00:01:41.150> eight<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:42.320> course<00:01:42.530> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
and two equals eight and of course the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.630 
and two equals eight and of course the
last<00:01:42.920> one<00:01:43.040> is<00:01:43.370> four<00:01:43.880> three<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:44.810> one<00:01:45.530> at<00:01:46.460> the

every<00:04:53.560> age<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.979> problems<00:04:54.370> offer<00:04:54.580> an

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
every age the problems offer an

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.240 
every age the problems offer an
introduction<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.539> art<00:04:55.719> history<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:56.440> have

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
introduction to art history I have

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.010 
introduction to art history I have
combined<00:04:57.669> math<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.210> art<00:04:58.389> with<00:04:58.629> several

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
combined math and art with several

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.320 
combined math and art with several
objectives<00:04:59.349> in<00:04:59.680> mind<00:04:59.759> the<00:05:00.759> first<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.180> to

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
objectives in mind the first is to

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.059 
objectives in mind the first is to
create<00:05:01.449> visually<00:05:02.020> interesting<00:05:02.289> problems

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
create visually interesting problems

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.010 
create visually interesting problems
when<00:05:03.789> teaching<00:05:04.030> children<00:05:04.539> we<00:05:04.750> need<00:05:04.870> to

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
when teaching children we need to

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.659 
when teaching children we need to
communicate<00:05:05.199> in<00:05:05.770> ways<00:05:05.949> that<00:05:06.250> are<00:05:06.340> engaging

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
communicate in ways that are engaging

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.200 
communicate in ways that are engaging
and<00:05:07.060> clear<00:05:07.710> here<00:05:08.710> I<00:05:08.979> use<00:05:09.190> famous<00:05:09.610> paintings<00:05:10.030> to

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
and clear here I use famous paintings to

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.260 
and clear here I use famous paintings to
add<00:05:10.360> graphical<00:05:11.050> interest<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.219> appeal<00:05:12.520> the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
add graphical interest and appeal the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.029 
add graphical interest and appeal the
second<00:05:13.629> objective<00:05:13.930> is<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.289> create<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.740> learning

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
second objective is to create a learning

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.950 
second objective is to create a learning
environment<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.849> stimulates<00:05:16.330> both

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
environment that stimulates both

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.040 
environment that stimulates both
analytical<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:17.889> creative<00:05:18.789> thinking<00:05:19.120> being

analytical and creative thinking being

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.200 
analytical and creative thinking being
good<00:05:20.289> in<00:05:20.379> math<00:05:20.590> requires<00:05:21.129> not<00:05:21.430> only<00:05:21.580> to<00:05:22.000> good

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
good in math requires not only to good

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.659 
good in math requires not only to good
technical<00:05:22.750> skills<00:05:23.080> but<00:05:23.620> also<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.069> ability<00:05:24.279> to

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
technical skills but also the ability to

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.890 
technical skills but also the ability to
apply<00:05:25.270> them<00:05:25.509> in<00:05:25.539> innovative<00:05:26.259> ways<00:05:27.870> finally<00:05:28.870> I

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
apply them in innovative ways finally I

trying to think

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.480 
trying to think
independently<00:05:43.110> incredibly<00:05:43.949> about<00:05:44.219> teaching

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
independently incredibly about teaching

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.119 
independently incredibly about teaching
that<00:05:44.849> I<00:05:45.150> hope<00:05:46.020> kids<00:05:46.229> will<00:05:46.409> be<00:05:46.530> challenged<00:05:47.009> by

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
that I hope kids will be challenged by

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:49.399 
that I hope kids will be challenged by
the<00:05:47.189> problems<00:05:47.669> enlightened<00:05:48.629> by<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:48.900> poems

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
the problems enlightened by the poems

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.320 
the problems enlightened by the poems
and<00:05:49.680> inspired<00:05:50.219> by<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.580> beauty<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:51.210> diversity

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
and inspired by the beauty and diversity

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.959 
and inspired by the beauty and diversity
of<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.050> art<00:05:52.199> who<00:05:52.800> says<00:05:53.099> Mac<00:05:53.430> has<00:05:53.669> to<00:05:53.879> be

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
of the art who says Mac has to be

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.950 
of the art who says Mac has to be
doubled<00:05:54.360> in<00:05:54.509> joy<00:05:55.080> Greg<00:05:55.800> tang

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
doubled in joy Greg tang

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.110 
doubled in joy Greg tang
so<00:05:57.960> this<00:05:58.110> book<00:05:58.289> has<00:05:58.430> great<00:05:59.430> potential<00:05:59.759> to<00:06:00.060> be

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
so this book has great potential to be

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.909 
so this book has great potential to be
used<00:06:00.330> in<00:06:00.479> multiple<00:06:00.629> content<00:06:01.139> areas<00:06:01.469> there<00:06:01.740> is

used in multiple content areas there is

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.100 
used in multiple content areas there is
of<00:06:02.159> course<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.669> obvious<00:06:02.879> connection<00:06:03.810> for

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
of course the obvious connection for

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.830 
of course the obvious connection for
elementary<00:06:04.650> math<00:06:04.909> also<00:06:05.909> the<00:06:06.030> writing<00:06:06.240> couples

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
elementary math also the writing couples

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.659 
elementary math also the writing couples
can<00:06:07.050> be<00:06:07.139> used<00:06:07.319> in<00:06:07.439> a<00:06:07.530> study<00:06:07.740> of<00:06:07.830> poetry<00:06:08.310> but

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
can be used in a study of poetry but

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.339 
can be used in a study of poetry but
here<00:06:08.879> are<00:06:08.969> four<00:06:09.210> specific<00:06:09.780> ways<00:06:09.990> that<00:06:10.020> you

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
here are four specific ways that you
