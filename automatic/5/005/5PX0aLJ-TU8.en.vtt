this<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.920> lot<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.120> headphones<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.570> we've

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
this a lot of the headphones that we've

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.900 
this a lot of the headphones that we've
reviewed<00:02:45.080> here<00:02:45.410> on<00:02:45.530> gear<00:02:45.709> diary<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.820> you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
reviewed here on gear diary is that you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.740 
reviewed here on gear diary is that you
actually<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:47.420> two<00:02:49.209> inputs<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.600> use

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
actually have two inputs you have to use

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.300 
actually have two inputs you have to use
so<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:52.270> cable<00:02:53.270> both<00:02:53.510> cables<00:02:53.930> split<00:02:54.350> they<00:02:54.950> come

so the cable both cables split they come

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.010 
so the cable both cables split they come
in<00:02:55.459> they<00:02:55.670> become<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.030> why<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:57.970> if<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.750> like

in they become a why and if you like

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.630 
in they become a why and if you like
your<00:03:00.260> cable<00:03:00.470> coming<00:03:00.770> off<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.070> only<00:03:01.310> one<00:03:01.520> ear
