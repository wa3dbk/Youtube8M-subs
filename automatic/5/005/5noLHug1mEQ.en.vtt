00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello here is beck frames 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.940
 It's been a while since I can not 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.509
 No video then I'll take advantage of this 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.320
 The final art I'm doing in the team 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.050
 online game series of thrones for 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 talk a little bit to you about the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.320
 Last 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.470
 You can see I'm using a 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.080
 material called a feather tip I already 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.640
 I said in the previous video will appear the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.969
 a comic for you to check out 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.969
 previous video 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.270
 and there is the part that interests me the most in this 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.989
 material is the stroke weight 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.559
 people can work with fine lines and 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.780
 and thick and one is a feather tip of the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.879
 color and tac that I bought on the site get 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.879
 band.com is imported 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.560
 interesting here depending on how much 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.040
 you press the say so what is the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.930
 pressure you do on the dash you 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.570
 achieve a different result brings 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.820
 more son a new trait more and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.700
 logically the practice is what will 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.910
 You have this 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.070
 this control of your material because 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.140
 this with any material not only with 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.700
 foot nozzles because it is not easy you 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.399
 control something that you do not have 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.399
 practice is not so important is to do 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.530
 enough to work with this 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.100
 material until you can have 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.100
 control 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:58.149
 logically as the paint will 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:00.950
 finishing need not reload the 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:05.360
 always being careful not to get 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.360
 with too much ink on the pen because 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.590
 otherwise you will end up making a line 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.170
 too thick so I usually do 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.720
 this cleaning on some piece of paper 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.730
 paper towel on napkin something 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.290
 so it's not to be with that 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:28.430
 Excess ends up making a mess 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:31.220
 during the final depending on the situation 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.980
 if the line was really thicker 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.340
 I 'd rather not even do the cleaning leave 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 enough ink even on the menu in the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.610
 Too bad I'm going to get a result 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.630
 coolest line result 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.130
 thick right 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:54.069
 a greater thickness as in the case of 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.990
 outline of his clothes that I go 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.540
 use a larger thickness because I 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.060
 I want to give a certain volume then to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.980
 each part I'm going to make a person 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.400
 different and I'll show you here 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.870
 and begin to make the outline 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.200
 his shoulder will notice that I'm going 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.200
 need 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.230
 work with a volume 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.970
 I'll use some techniques on this side that 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.440
 I was commenting, you'll understand. 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.459
 that to give this volume 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.020
 I'll start with a smoother line 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.080
 and I'm going to press the pen tip more 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.910
 stay with the thickest line 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.440
 do this work of alternating 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.959
 of thickness 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.780
 making a sense of volume in each 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:57.620
 one of these small works of the plant is a 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.620
 very cool result 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.730
 the final result after 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.200
 and add a few tones of 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.580
 gray by the computer just to give a 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.680
 differential effect 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.900
 I hope you enjoyed this video if 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.640
 Did you like it helps? 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.040
