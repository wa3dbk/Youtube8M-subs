mode<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.549> regular<00:01:35.909> mode<00:01:36.210> same<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
mode and regular mode same with the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
mode and regular mode same with the
octos<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:38.040> different<00:01:38.400> ways<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.790> fly<00:01:39.030> the

octos there's different ways to fly the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.569 
octos there's different ways to fly the
octos<00:01:39.720> i'm<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.590> learn<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.280> mode<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
octos i'm so learn about which mode you

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.609 
octos i'm so learn about which mode you
want<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.689> same<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> heck<00:01:43.409> so

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
want in the same with the heck so

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
want in the same with the heck so
there's<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.890> hexa<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.549> which<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> six<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.689> they

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
there's a hexa to which is six but they

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.289 
there's a hexa to which is six but they
aren't<00:01:46.020> circular<00:01:46.700> but<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.060> we're<00:01:48.270> just

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
aren't circular but right now we're just

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.730 
aren't circular but right now we're just
going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> use<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> regular<00:01:48.990> Hexham<00:01:49.560> we're

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
going to use a regular Hexham we're

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.780 
going to use a regular Hexham we're
going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> say<00:01:50.009> open<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.310> adds

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
going to say open and as you see it adds

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.520 
going to say open and as you see it adds
this<00:01:54.030> picture<00:01:54.540> here<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.960> shows<00:01:55.110> all<00:01:55.350> my

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
this picture here that shows all my

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.130 
this picture here that shows all my
propellers<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.610> circle<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.869> means

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
propellers in a circle so that means

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
propellers in a circle so that means
we've<00:01:58.380> got<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.770> configured<00:01:59.250> properly<00:01:59.549> this<00:02:00.000> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
we've got it configured properly this is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270 
we've got it configured properly this is
the<00:02:00.299> configuration<00:02:00.479> we're<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> use<00:02:01.710> so

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the configuration we're going to use so

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.620 
the configuration we're going to use so
then<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.520> need<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> drop<00:02:02.939> down<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.509> need

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
then we need to drop down here we need

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.959 
then we need to drop down here we need
to<00:02:03.689> write<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.320> then<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> micro<00:02:05.189> copters<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to write it then to the micro copters to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.580 
to write it then to the micro copters to
the<00:02:06.090> flight<00:02:06.299> controller<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.380> write<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.970> and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
the flight controller so we write it and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.410 
the flight controller so we write it and
the<00:02:10.590> beeps<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:11.099> good<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.670> means<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.060> took<00:02:12.270> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the beeps are good that means it took it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.000 
the beeps are good that means it took it
so<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:13.260> you're<00:02:13.470> all<00:02:13.650> set

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
so now you're all set

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.060 
so now you're all set
up<00:02:14.069> as<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.340> hexa
