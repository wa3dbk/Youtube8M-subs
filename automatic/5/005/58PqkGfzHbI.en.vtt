00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
is trying to figure out like what do you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.370 
is trying to figure out like what do you
do<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.090> Pokemon<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> has<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.050> stats

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
do with this Pokemon it has the stats

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.370 
do with this Pokemon it has the stats
but<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.219> do<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> really<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.540> crazy

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
but how do you really get it going crazy

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
but how do you really get it going crazy
and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> was<00:00:37.680> thinking<00:00:37.770> charge<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and I was thinking charge of you that

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.630 
and I was thinking charge of you that
this<00:00:39.329> Pokemon<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.020> four<00:00:40.260> hit<00:00:40.440> ko<00:00:40.649> by<00:00:41.010> even<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
this Pokemon is a four hit ko by even a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.670 
this Pokemon is a four hit ko by even a
like<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> three<00:00:42.780> hit<00:00:42.930> ko<00:00:43.110> from<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.469> mega

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
like it's a three hit ko from a mega

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.010 
like it's a three hit ko from a mega
kangaskhan<00:00:44.190> four<00:00:44.430> hit<00:00:44.579> ko<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.629> really

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
kangaskhan four hit ko from just really

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.529 
kangaskhan four hit ko from just really
strong<00:00:46.680> overpowered<00:00:47.340> Pokemon<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> mean<00:00:48.450> if

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
strong overpowered Pokemon so I mean if

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.150 
strong overpowered Pokemon so I mean if
you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.840> bring<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.559> set<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.860> against

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you can bring it in to set up against

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.920 
you can bring it in to set up against
another<00:00:50.370> Pokemon<00:00:50.850> setting<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.690> start

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
another Pokemon setting up it can start

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.439 
another Pokemon setting up it can start
doing<00:00:52.050> some<00:00:52.199> crazy<00:00:52.739> things<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.460> charge<00:00:54.239> beam

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
doing some crazy things like charge beam

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
doing some crazy things like charge beam
so<00:00:54.989> charge<00:00:55.379> beam<00:00:55.620> makes<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> where<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.280> is

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
so charge beam makes it to where this is

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
so charge beam makes it to where this is
a<00:00:56.430> chance<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> boost<00:00:57.210> go<00:00:57.960> charge<00:00:58.260> beam<00:00:58.469> boom

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
a chance to boost go charge beam boom

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.289 
so now that tyrantrum has been out for a
while<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.549> there's<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.820> lot<00:01:30.240> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
while I think that there's a lot of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.350 
while I think that there's a lot of
scariness<00:01:31.170> behind<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.180> do

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
scariness behind it that what it can do

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
scariness behind it that what it can do
with<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> dragon<00:01:34.140> dance<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.670> ferocious

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
with the dragon dance is just ferocious

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.270 
with the dragon dance is just ferocious
so<00:01:36.390> my<00:01:36.750> thought<00:01:36.990> item<00:01:37.380> throw<00:01:37.680> down<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> focus

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so my thought item throw down a focus

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.010 
so my thought item throw down a focus
sash<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.600> dragon

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
sash on it that way you get that dragon

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.380 
sash on it that way you get that dragon

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
kind of thinking of some kind of really

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.040 
kind of thinking of some kind of really
gimmick<00:03:10.130> strat<00:03:10.430> but<00:03:10.940> there's<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.180> lot<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.720> gujo

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
gimmick strat but there's a lot to gujo

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
that makes it very strong and there's a

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.400 
that makes it very strong and there's a
lot<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.239> things<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:15.140> can<00:03:15.320> do
