00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
of experienced myself for a long time

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.139 
of experienced myself for a long time
but<00:00:51.290> it's<00:00:51.469> only<00:00:51.589> just<00:00:52.510> something<00:00:53.510> can<00:00:53.719> be<00:00:55.149> made

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
but it's only just something can be made

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.360

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
background is kind of a technical

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.090 
background is kind of a technical
background<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.869> audio<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.140> video<00:01:57.469> recording

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
of the highest technical quality so I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.220 
of the highest technical quality so I
guess<00:02:10.190> I'm<00:02:10.369> sort<00:02:10.640> on<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.150> side<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.780> it's<00:02:11.959> more

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
guess I'm sort on that side of it's more

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.890 
guess I'm sort on that side of it's more
the<00:02:12.970> content<00:02:13.970> side<00:02:14.420> I'm<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> little<00:02:15.200> less<00:02:15.379> sure

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the content side I'm a little less sure

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.580 
the content side I'm a little less sure
I<00:02:19.030> think

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.369 

also<00:02:23.590> as<00:02:23.709> well<00:02:23.920> lots<00:02:24.579> of<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.030> azzam<00:02:25.689> videos

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
also as well lots of the azzam videos

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:35.940 
also as well lots of the azzam videos
that<00:02:26.680> are<00:02:27.420> online<00:02:28.420> currently<00:02:34.739> I've<00:02:35.739> been

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that are online currently I've been

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.990 
that are online currently I've been
uploaded<00:02:36.519> by<00:02:37.680> females<00:02:38.680> there's<00:02:39.609> a<00:02:39.700> lot<00:02:39.849> more

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
uploaded by females there's a lot more

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.910 
uploaded by females there's a lot more
female<00:02:40.480> content<00:02:41.049> on<00:02:41.230> there<00:02:41.469> rather<00:02:41.709> than

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
female content on there rather than

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.349 
female content on there rather than
males<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:44.310> can<00:02:45.310> understand<00:02:45.819> that<00:02:45.909> a<00:02:46.180> lot

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
males and I can understand that a lot

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.780 
males and I can understand that a lot
because<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.750> think<00:02:47.219> there's<00:02:48.219> more<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.489> a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
because I think there's more of a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.009 
because I think there's more of a
soothing<00:02:49.719> quality<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.469> female<00:02:50.889> voice

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
soothing quality to the female voice

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.460 
soothing quality to the female voice
certainly<00:02:53.019> says<00:02:53.290> at<00:02:53.469> least<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> know<00:02:56.109> from

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
certainly says at least but I know from

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.869 
certainly says at least but I know from
my<00:02:57.189> experience<00:02:57.419> that<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:01.150> are<00:03:01.299> some<00:03:02.879> male

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
my experience that there are some male

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.149 
my experience that there are some male
speakers<00:03:04.419> that<00:03:04.629> do<00:03:04.840> have<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.379> soothing

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
speakers that do have that soothing

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.220 
speakers that do have that soothing
quality<00:03:06.669> advice<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.329> that's<00:03:07.419> something<00:03:07.719> I'd

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
quality advice and that's something I'd

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:17.740 
quality advice and that's something I'd
like<00:03:08.439> to<00:03:09.359> explore<00:03:10.359> myself<00:03:10.629> for<00:03:11.169> anything

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.460 

so<00:03:18.700> going<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.790> end<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.240> introduction<00:03:20.990> I

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
so going to end this introduction I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.060 
so going to end this introduction I
think<00:03:23.380> again<00:03:24.380> this<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:24.830> just<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.310> test<00:03:26.560> what<00:03:27.560> I

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
think again this is just a test what I

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.800 
think again this is just a test what I
would<00:03:28.220> be<00:03:28.510> interested<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:30.400> any<00:03:31.400> feedback<00:03:32.090> good

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
would be interested in any feedback good

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.040 
would be interested in any feedback good
or<00:03:33.230> bad

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
or bad

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.560 
or bad
I'm<00:03:36.050> not<00:03:36.290> sure<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:39.610> have<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.640> voice<00:03:41.060> for<00:03:41.480> this

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
I'm not sure I have the voice for this

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.730 
I'm not sure I have the voice for this
kind<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:42.050> thing<00:03:42.290> booked<00:03:42.710> if<00:03:43.340> enough<00:03:44.180> people

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
kind of thing booked if enough people

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.450 
kind of thing booked if enough people
think<00:03:45.740> that<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.630> did

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
think that I did

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.720 
think that I did
that<00:03:49.090> is<00:03:49.990> something<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.650> will<00:03:50.890> definitely<00:03:51.550> be

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
that is something I will definitely be

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.700 
that is something I will definitely be
looking<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:55.030> explore<00:03:55.390> future<00:03:56.080> in<00:03:56.140> terms<00:03:56.410> of

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
looking to explore future in terms of

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.530 
looking to explore future in terms of
creating<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.930> hopefully<00:03:59.440> new<00:03:59.740> and<00:04:00.190> original

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
creating and hopefully new and original

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.730 
creating and hopefully new and original
videos<00:04:04.170> for<00:04:05.170> people<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:06.420> enjoy
