better<00:01:28.530> staking<00:01:29.530> because<00:01:30.119> gives<00:01:31.119> you<00:01:31.240> more

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
better staking because gives you more

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.859 
better staking because gives you more
options<00:01:31.600> wiring<00:01:32.439> them<00:01:32.619> stakin<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.399> think<00:01:34.000> my

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
options wiring them stakin I think my

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.740 
options wiring them stakin I think my
personal<00:01:35.380> reference<00:01:35.829> so<00:01:36.789> then<00:01:37.060> I'll<00:01:37.210> set<00:01:37.509> my

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
personal reference so then I'll set my

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:47.219 
personal reference so then I'll set my
trap<00:01:39.810> right<00:01:40.810> up<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.140> here<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:46.229> I'll

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
trap right up in here like this and I'll

00:01:47.229 --> 00:02:18.840 
trap right up in here like this and I'll
take<00:01:47.470> some<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.710> my<00:01:47.860> grass<00:01:56.610> set<00:01:57.610> up<00:01:57.759> around<00:01:58.030> it

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.420 

and<00:02:19.850> then<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:21.350> my<00:02:21.470> bait<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.950> like<00:02:22.190> using

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and then for my bait I like using

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.750 
and then for my bait I like using
marshmallows<00:02:23.150> oh<00:02:24.100> they<00:02:25.100> work<00:02:25.280> pretty<00:02:25.550> good

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.850 

especially<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.880> big<00:02:29.090> ones

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
especially the big ones

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.420 
especially the big ones
so<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.810> usually<00:02:32.810> set<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.710> down<00:02:33.740> there<00:02:34.160> in

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
so I just I usually set it down there in

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.950 
so I just I usually set it down there in
the<00:02:34.550> hole<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:37.070> then<00:02:37.910> sometimes<00:02:38.600> what<00:02:38.720> I'll<00:02:38.840> do

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
the hole and then sometimes what I'll do

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.780 
the hole and then sometimes what I'll do
I'll<00:02:39.080> take<00:02:39.320> moisture<00:02:39.650> juice<00:02:40.130> out<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.550> can

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790
