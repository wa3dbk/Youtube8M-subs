always<00:01:32.759> recommend<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.900> people<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.530> use<00:01:34.799> PPC

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
always recommend that people not use PPC

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
always recommend that people not use PPC
because<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> lose<00:01:36.000> money<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.540> but

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
because you can lose money with this but

you<00:03:54.640> were<00:03:54.760> 12<00:03:55.030> oz<00:03:55.210> and<00:03:55.570> that's<00:03:55.810> by<00:03:56.110> putting<00:03:56.500> in

you were 12 oz and that's by putting in

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.420 
you were 12 oz and that's by putting in
I<00:03:57.820> think<00:03:58.420> we<00:03:58.510> have<00:03:58.540> 11<00:03:59.500> or<00:03:59.770> 12<00:03:59.950> campaigns

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
I think we have 11 or 12 campaigns

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.180 
I think we have 11 or 12 campaigns
running<00:04:00.580> right<00:04:00.880> now<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:03.730> obviously<00:04:03.970> is

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190

losing a bunch of money this is not

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.350 
losing a bunch of money this is not
close<00:04:56.530> at<00:04:56.770> all<00:04:56.860> these<00:04:57.070> are<00:04:57.220> actually<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:58.240> is

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
close at all these are actually this is

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.540 
close at all these are actually this is
a<00:04:58.450> very<00:04:58.600> good<00:04:58.750> healthy<00:04:59.230> profit<00:04:59.590> margin<00:04:59.950> so

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
a very good healthy profit margin so

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.750 
a very good healthy profit margin so
that's<00:05:00.820> basically<00:05:01.060> my<00:05:01.980> results<00:05:02.980> from<00:05:03.430> using

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
that's basically my results from using

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.630 
that's basically my results from using
next<00:05:04.120> system<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:05.740> have<00:05:06.250> absolutely<00:05:06.580> no

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
next system and I have absolutely no

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.430 
next system and I have absolutely no
doubt<00:05:07.030> that<00:05:07.060> anyone<00:05:07.510> could<00:05:07.750> follow<00:05:08.020> this<00:05:08.200> into

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
doubt that anyone could follow this into

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.930 
doubt that anyone could follow this into
this<00:05:08.590> because<00:05:08.740> there<00:05:09.010> is<00:05:09.070> nothing<00:05:09.490> that<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.670> did

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
this because there is nothing that I did

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.930 
this because there is nothing that I did
that<00:05:10.660> was<00:05:11.220> focused<00:05:12.220> around<00:05:12.400> something

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
that was focused around something

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.360 
that was focused around something
