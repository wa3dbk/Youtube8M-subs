 hairdresser tv fundamental knowledge for 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.130
 Barber shares his experience 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.130
 substances in dna to give 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.380
 in this lesson we will discuss today how 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.490
 correctly cut when there are many 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.849
 myths and legends 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.220
 relatively razor but negative myths 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.130
 I usually dismiss the masters 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.109
 who are not able to cut with a razor 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.559
 human history the razor was 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.489
 invented much earlier than 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.220
 scissors and therefore blades cut 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.430
 earlier there are more horror stories 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.140
 razor flowing hair well what is sharper 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.379
 scissors cutting edge or blade 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.210
 of course the blade some masters 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.769
 I categorically say never 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.949
 I will meet with a razor and at the same time perform 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:05.689
 slaysing and what is also slaysing 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 shaver only v-shaped and main 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.689
 many decades the chiming clock prize was 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.630
 understand her model haircut is a haircut 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.750
 included its technology application 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 or thinning scissors or bride 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 Today there are various modifications 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.049
 razor for cutting hair is best 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.759
 do not use razors with a dangerous sting 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.520
 so-called thinning razors 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.369
 closed blade in this lesson i 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 I use the simplest tinting 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.899
 drew let's say a client came to you with 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 commonplace punishment 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.560
 I'll show you how to use a razor 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.780
 You can make her a fashionista and not 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.719
 lose length to start at the bottom 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.060
 the occipital zone will make the gradation of the glen 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.060
 after that, let's go straight to the razor 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.100
 after graduation we got slim 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.650
 neck bow and length left for revenge 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.570
 drop the lower tier 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.930
 The main advantage of the razor is that 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.140
 it cuts them or cuts at the same time 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.930
 we do not do sharp cutting 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.990
 strands in order to level it with 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.580
 previous graduation to start if 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.360
 I want my hair tucked 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.560
 inside 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.960
 I had a haircut with a razor inside do 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.080
 direction inward and directly 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.210
 now remove the length you need to do 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.490
 smooth motion at a very sharp angle 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.240
 after a razor cut, hide and seek can be 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.030
 longer than the upper limit of the gradation is 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:54.209
 ok next tier exactly the same 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.720
 first from the inside and then outside cut off 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.720
 already length 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.330
 Verke nape and macroeca hide and seek 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.500
 I digress more from the root and 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.910
 fillet ruyu hair closer to the ends of the cut 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.470
 just a little longer 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.910
 after fully razor 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.630
 shave the whole head 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.700
 You can limit the combination of volumes slightly 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.700
 about textured like this 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.870
 further shedding the back of the hair with 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.600
 those not from the side zones and cut them on 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.080
 shortening to the center of the head with lengthening 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.080
 on the face 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.739
 the length we are actually on the sides does not lose 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.160
 only bangs would leave the maximum 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.230
 density 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:09.040
 and the rest of the hair to the killer 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.290
 pull back him 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.530
 and 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.639
 like this with a razor you can 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.449
 to make from the usual humble teacher 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.449
 successful socialite 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.500
 and you to me 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.160
