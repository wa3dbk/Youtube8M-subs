wait for it that it will behave
different<00:00:53.660> in<00:00:53.890> dirt<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:54.920> sand<00:00:56.200> but<00:00:57.200> for<00:00:57.380> now

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
different in dirt and sand but for now

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.569 
different in dirt and sand but for now
we're<00:00:57.710> just<00:00:57.739> worried<00:00:58.070> about<00:00:58.480> stone<00:00:59.739> so<00:01:00.739> three

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
we're just worried about stone so three

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.179 
we're just worried about stone so three
wide<00:01:01.809> well<00:01:02.809> one<00:01:03.770> either<00:01:03.920> side<00:01:04.280> really

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
wide well one either side really

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.920 
wide well one either side really
essentially<00:01:07.189> 3<00:01:08.000> x<00:01:08.119> 3<00:01:08.149> x<00:01:08.360> 2<00:01:10.630> same<00:01:11.630> thing<00:01:11.810> again

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
essentially 3 x 3 x 2 same thing again

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.770 
essentially 3 x 3 x 2 same thing again
single<00:01:12.590> depth<00:01:12.740> hole<00:01:13.030> but<00:01:14.469> we've<00:01:15.469> dug<00:01:15.799> out<00:01:16.780> one

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
single depth hole but we've dug out one

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:31.889 
single depth hole but we've dug out one
square<00:01:18.170> on<00:01:18.380> each<00:01:18.499> side<00:01:21.909> runaway<00:01:28.990> big<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.079> hole

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
square on each side runaway big a hole

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.730 
square on each side runaway big a hole
we<00:01:32.899> still<00:01:33.079> got<00:01:33.200> 3<00:01:33.380> x<00:01:33.499> 3<00:01:33.529> x<00:01:33.709> 2<00:01:35.439> we've<00:01:36.439> got<00:01:36.619> these

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
we still got 3 x 3 x 2 we've got these

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.510 
we still got 3 x 3 x 2 we've got these
little<00:01:37.029> tetris<00:01:38.029> t<00:01:38.179> shapes<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.719> side<00:01:39.520> some

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
little tetris t shapes on the side some

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.919 
little tetris t shapes on the side some
sites<00:01:40.729> whole<00:01:41.479> lots<00:01:41.689> gone<00:01:43.179> so<00:01:44.179> it's<00:01:44.389> generally

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
sites whole lots gone so it's generally

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.959 
sites whole lots gone so it's generally
a<00:01:44.959> bigger<00:01:45.319> hole<00:01:47.770> send<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.189> actress<00:01:49.639> to<00:01:49.909> the

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
a bigger hole send the actress to the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.099 
a bigger hole send the actress to the
bishop<00:01:50.409> right<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.249> now<00:01:52.340> we've<00:01:52.520> got<00:01:52.669> to<00:01:53.109> removed

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
bishop right so now we've got to removed

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.699 
bishop right so now we've got to removed
either<00:01:54.439> side<00:01:54.740> but<00:01:55.249> none<00:01:55.700> removed<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:56.329> side

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
either side but none removed this side

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:02.109 
either side but none removed this side
let's<00:01:57.709> just<00:01:59.319> pop<00:02:00.319> that<00:02:00.349> down<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:01.729> line<00:02:02.090> with

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
let's just pop that down in line with

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.510 
let's just pop that down in line with
this<00:02:02.419> so<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.929> can<00:02:02.959> see<00:02:03.319> how<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:03.979> explosion

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
this so we can see how the explosion

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.090 
this so we can see how the explosion
goes

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:17.020 

and<00:02:07.700> we<00:02:07.790> can<00:02:07.909> hide<00:02:08.119> behind<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:13.720> now<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.910> can

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
and we can hide behind it now you can

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.350 
and we can hide behind it now you can
see<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:17.450> blown<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.140> back<00:02:18.319> out<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:20.000> one

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
see it's blown the back out just one

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.750 
see it's blown the back out just one
like<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.780> original<00:02:21.200> shot<00:02:21.489> but<00:02:22.489> it's<00:02:22.610> blown

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
like the original shot but it's blown

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.050 
like the original shot but it's blown
the<00:02:22.910> front<00:02:23.180> out<00:02:24.010> three<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.880> be<00:02:28.940> very

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
the front out three so it can be very

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.240 
the front out three so it can be very
directional<00:02:31.090> let's<00:02:32.090> just<00:02:32.720> extend<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.920> one

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
directional let's just extend that one

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.110 
directional let's just extend that one
more<00:02:37.450> there<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.569> go<00:02:39.069> that's<00:02:41.319> one<00:02:42.319> block<00:02:43.120> three

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
more there you go that's one block three

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:57.990 
more there you go that's one block three
off<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.390> one<00:02:44.540> side<00:02:44.569> oops<00:02:45.489> didn't<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.640> that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000

that three by five by two out here it's

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.520 
that three by five by two out here it's
proven<00:03:11.810> point<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:14.660> same<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.170> one<00:03:15.350> but

proven point the same as this one but

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.289 
proven point the same as this one but
will<00:03:18.530> fall<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.769> two<00:03:19.010> holes<00:03:19.250> below<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.970> sand

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
will fall the two holes below with sand

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:30.500 
will fall the two holes below with sand
and<00:03:22.900> will<00:03:23.900> run<00:03:23.989> away<00:03:24.140> again

don't<00:05:14.150> tempt<00:05:16.580> tint<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.789> then<00:05:18.350> fire<00:05:44.060> well

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
don't tempt tint and then fire well

00:05:45.060 --> 00:06:00.050 
don't tempt tint and then fire well
found<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:45.539> cave<00:05:50.210> let's<00:05:51.210> use<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.570> rooms<00:05:59.060> of

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
found that cave let's use the rooms of

found that cave let's use the rooms of
course<00:06:00.419> you<00:06:00.599> could<00:06:08.780> one<00:06:09.780> two<00:06:10.080> three<00:06:12.860> that's

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
course you could one two three that's

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:38.600 
course you could one two three that's
the<00:06:14.099> annoying<00:06:22.940> one<00:06:23.940> two<00:06:24.360> three<00:06:37.430> that's<00:06:38.430> going

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
the annoying one two three that's going

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.830 
the annoying one two three that's going
to<00:06:38.669> be<00:06:38.729> lava

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:07:10.519 

I<00:06:56.320> should<00:07:00.820> do<00:07:01.820> the<00:07:01.940> lot

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:10.529 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:38.730 

eventually<00:07:12.979> bugger<00:07:13.979> it<00:07:14.159> didn't

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:38.740 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:45.250 

but<00:07:42.310> a<00:07:43.310> little<00:07:43.730> less<00:07:44.120> efficient<00:07:44.720> in<00:07:44.840> terms<00:07:44.870> of

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.260 
but a little less efficient in terms of

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.610 
but a little less efficient in terms of
TNT<00:07:45.710> use<00:07:46.360> but<00:07:47.360> a<00:07:47.690> lot<00:07:47.840> more<00:07:47.870> efficient<00:07:48.440> in

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620 
TNT use but a lot more efficient in

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:56.380 
TNT use but a lot more efficient in
terms<00:07:48.650> of<00:07:49.100> amount<00:07:49.400> you<00:07:49.610> have<00:07:49.670> big<00:07:55.180> so<00:07:56.180> I<00:07:56.240> hope

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:56.390 
terms of amount you have big so I hope

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.460 
terms of amount you have big so I hope
that's<00:07:56.570> helped<00:07:56.960> a<00:07:57.050> little<00:07:57.170> bit<00:07:57.380> and<00:07:59.470> I'll

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.470 
that's helped a little bit and I'll

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.840 
that's helped a little bit and I'll
catch<00:08:00.680> you<00:08:00.740> later<00:08:00.920> with<00:08:01.340> a<00:08:01.600> normal<00:08:02.600> episode
