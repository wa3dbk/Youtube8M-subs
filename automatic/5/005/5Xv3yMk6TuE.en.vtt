and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.119> happens<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.509> about<00:01:45.600> within<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and then what happens in about within a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.709 
and then what happens in about within a
couple<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> weeks<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.610> roots<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.270> really

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
couple of weeks it roots really really

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.889 
couple of weeks it roots really really
readily<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.820> then<00:01:50.820> they'll<00:01:51.149> stand<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.720> lot

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
readily and then they'll stand up a lot

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
readily and then they'll stand up a lot
of<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.229> lot<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.590> leaves<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.189> want<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> keep

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
of a lot of leaves when you want to keep

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
of a lot of leaves when you want to keep
these<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.880> frost<00:01:54.210> free<00:01:54.479> environment<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
these in a frost free environment so I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.919 
these in a frost free environment so I
actually<00:01:55.740> put<00:01:56.039> them<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.390> just<00:01:57.390> corrode<00:01:57.750> mommy

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
actually put them in just corrode mommy

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.480 
actually put them in just corrode mommy
window<00:01:58.229> ledge<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.530> home<00:01:58.710> until<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.280> too

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
window ledge at home until they get too

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.740 
window ledge at home until they get too
big<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.000> put<00:02:00.179> off<00:02:00.299> put<00:02:00.509> them<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.720> a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
big and then put off put them in a

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.080 
big and then put off put them in a
frost-free<00:02:01.170> greenhouse<00:02:01.829> make<00:02:02.759> sure<00:02:02.970> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
frost-free greenhouse make sure the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.370 
frost-free greenhouse make sure the
leaves<00:02:03.270> keep<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> leaves<00:02:03.960> will<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.229> keep

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
leaves keep the leaves will just keep

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.249 
leaves keep the leaves will just keep
growing<00:02:04.679> and<00:02:04.799> growing

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.830 

flatten<00:02:08.709> your<00:02:08.770> onion<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.129> is<00:02:09.190> obviously<00:02:09.610> now

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
flatten your onion this is obviously now

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.360 
flatten your onion this is obviously now
as<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.050> see<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.709> lot<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.920> leaves<00:02:12.160> out

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
as you can see it's a lot of leaves out

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.619 
as you can see it's a lot of leaves out
which<00:02:12.519> have<00:02:12.610> now<00:02:12.730> died<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.360> then<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.540> will

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
which have now died and then it will

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.729 
which have now died and then it will
send<00:02:14.099> anything<00:02:15.099> from<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.459> two<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.940> four

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
send anything from like two to four

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.199 
send anything from like two to four
giant<00:02:17.739> seed<00:02:17.980> heads<00:02:18.220> up<00:02:18.430> absolutely<00:02:19.000> massive

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
giant seed heads up absolutely massive

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.399 
giant seed heads up absolutely massive
six<00:02:19.690> seven<00:02:19.959> feet<00:02:20.110> tall

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.339 

like<00:02:23.409> so<00:02:23.680> which<00:02:24.099> need<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.579> be<00:02:25.390> pollinated<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
like so which need to be pollinated and

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.050 
like so which need to be pollinated and
bumblebees<00:02:27.040> are<00:02:27.189> absolutely<00:02:27.489> ideal<00:02:27.969> for<00:02:28.269> this

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
bumblebees are absolutely ideal for this

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.910 
bumblebees are absolutely ideal for this
and<00:02:31.060> there<00:02:31.870> what<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.110> do<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:32.530> let<00:02:32.769> them

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
and there what you do is just let them

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.319 
and there what you do is just let them
pull<00:02:33.069> on<00:02:33.189> it<00:02:33.340> you'll<00:02:33.549> see<00:02:33.610> when<00:02:33.939> they've<00:02:34.060> set

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
pull on it you'll see when they've set

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.319 
pull on it you'll see when they've set
because<00:02:34.629> they<00:02:34.750> sort<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.290> go<00:02:35.500> green<00:02:35.829> and

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
because they sort of go green and

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.150 
because they sort of go green and
spherical

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
spherical

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.440 
spherical
and<00:02:39.370> then<00:02:39.460> like<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.670> said<00:02:39.850> just<00:02:39.880> leave<00:02:40.180> them<00:02:40.330> to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
and then like I said just leave them to

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.180 
and then like I said just leave them to
write<00:02:40.630> good<00:02:40.900> as<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.380> rests<00:02:41.740> that's<00:02:41.890> too<00:02:42.010> rare

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
write good as it rests that's too rare

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.660 
write good as it rests that's too rare
now<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.510> sunshine<00:02:44.340> until<00:02:45.340> they<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:45.490> to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
now in the sunshine until they get to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.100 
now in the sunshine until they get to
about<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.090> stage<00:02:46.360> like<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.780> showed<00:02:46.990> you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
about this stage like I showed you

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.310 
about this stage like I showed you
before<00:02:47.910> where<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> seeds<00:02:49.300> are<00:02:49.480> now<00:02:49.600> ripe<00:02:49.960> and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
before where the seeds are now ripe and

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.360 
before where the seeds are now ripe and
ready<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:51.270> be<00:02:52.270> harvested<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:53.320> which<00:02:53.620> time<00:02:53.950> you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
ready to be harvested in which time you

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.150 
ready to be harvested in which time you
just<00:02:54.550> chop<00:02:55.210> your<00:02:55.420> seed<00:02:56.140> stock<00:02:56.440> off<00:02:56.650> there<00:02:56.860> take

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
just chop your seed stock off there take

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.610 
just chop your seed stock off there take
it<00:02:57.280> all<00:02:57.400> dry<00:02:57.640> out<00:02:57.820> for<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.030> little<00:02:58.180> bit<00:02:58.300> longer

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it all dry out for a little bit longer

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.170 
it all dry out for a little bit longer
and<00:02:59.620> then<00:02:59.920> you<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.130> remove<00:03:00.340> your<00:03:00.490> seeds<00:03:00.790> these

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
and then you can remove your seeds these

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.580 
and then you can remove your seeds these
are<00:03:01.360> some<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.630> heads<00:03:01.840> are<00:03:01.990> cut<00:03:02.140> off<00:03:02.290> about

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
are some of the heads are cut off about

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.200 
are some of the heads are cut off about
two<00:03:02.860> weeks<00:03:03.100> ago<00:03:03.370> because<00:03:03.550> they'd<00:03:03.850> started<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
two weeks ago because they'd started to

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.080 
two weeks ago because they'd started to
dry<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.020> seeds<00:03:05.290> had<00:03:05.500> started<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.100> ripen

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
dry and the seeds had started to ripen

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.340 
dry and the seeds had started to ripen
in<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.510> heads<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.870> I'm<00:03:07.990> sure<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.170> don't<00:03:08.230> want

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
in the heads and I'm sure you don't want

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.390 
in the heads and I'm sure you don't want
to<00:03:08.440> leave<00:03:08.560> them<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.800> greenhouse<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.310> your

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
to leave them in the greenhouse to your

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.620 
to leave them in the greenhouse to your
lung<00:03:09.490> because<00:03:09.610> we'll<00:03:09.880> just<00:03:10.030> all<00:03:10.120> drop<00:03:10.330> off<00:03:10.510> on

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
lung because we'll just all drop off on

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.670 
lung because we'll just all drop off on
the<00:03:10.720> floor<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.070> look<00:03:12.280> each<00:03:12.490> little<00:03:12.940> tiny

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the floor if you look each little tiny

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.840 
the floor if you look each little tiny
florets<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.800> flowers<00:03:15.190> produce<00:03:15.340> actually

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
florets of flowers produce actually

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.900 
florets of flowers produce actually
produces<00:03:16.240> four<00:03:16.600> seeds<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:18.190> like<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.340> set<00:03:18.760> these

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
produces four seeds so like I set these

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.100 
produces four seeds so like I set these
on<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.240> dry<00:03:19.420> now<00:03:19.630> they're<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:19.930> about

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
on to dry now they're just about

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.530 
on to dry now they're just about
perfectly<00:03:20.620> dried<00:03:20.920> out<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:22.150> as<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:22.330> can<00:03:22.450> see

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
perfectly dried out and as you can see

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.770 
perfectly dried out and as you can see
some<00:03:22.990> of<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.140> seeds<00:03:23.410> falling<00:03:23.740> off<00:03:24.570> falls<00:03:25.570> out

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
some of the seeds falling off falls out

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.500 
some of the seeds falling off falls out
like<00:03:25.990> so<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.910> then<00:03:27.910> what<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.090> do<00:03:28.240> is<00:03:28.390> you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
like so and then what you do is you

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.630 
like so and then what you do is you
scrunch<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.110> up<00:03:29.170> between<00:03:29.500> your<00:03:29.650> fingers<00:03:32.640> and

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
scrunch it up between your fingers and

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.400 
scrunch it up between your fingers and
you<00:03:33.730> end<00:03:33.880> up<00:03:34.090> with<00:03:34.450> absolutely<00:03:36.270> hundreds<00:03:37.410> but

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
you end up with absolutely hundreds but

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.470 
you end up with absolutely hundreds but
you're<00:03:38.560> on<00:03:38.680> see<00:03:38.980> big<00:03:39.670> seed<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.180> then<00:03:40.240> you<00:03:40.330> want

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
you're on see big seed and then you want

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.800 
you're on see big seed and then you want
to<00:03:40.510> do

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
to do

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.900 
to do
just<00:03:41.500> select<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.920> biggest<00:03:42.370> seed<00:03:42.640> because<00:03:42.880> I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
just select the biggest seed because I

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.340 
just select the biggest seed because I
always<00:03:43.060> German<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:43.630> better<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.260> will

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
always German it's better and it will

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.340 
always German it's better and it will
generally<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:45.420> better<00:03:46.420> plant<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:46.990> that's<00:03:47.170> it

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
generally be a better plant so that's it

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
generally be a better plant so that's it
really<00:03:47.730> how<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.790> produce<00:03:49.830> absolutely<00:03:50.830> tons<00:03:51.160> of

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
really how to produce absolutely tons of

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.500 
really how to produce absolutely tons of
your<00:03:51.460> own<00:03:51.580> on<00:03:51.730> Ian's<00:03:51.910> seed<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:52.360> get<00:03:52.480> a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
your own on Ian's seed if you get a

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.870 
your own on Ian's seed if you get a
really<00:03:52.780> nice<00:03:52.900> on<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.260> want<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.760> continue<00:03:54.760> the
