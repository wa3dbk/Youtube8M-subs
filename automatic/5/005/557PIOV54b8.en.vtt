you<00:01:52.860> turret<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.400> see<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:55.140> there's

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
you turret like you see here but there's

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.929 
you turret like you see here but there's
not<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.770> whole<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.159> contrast<00:01:56.579> there<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
not a whole lot of contrast there so it

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.130 
not a whole lot of contrast there so it
might<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.150> tough<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:57.720> it's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
might be tough to see but it's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.749 
might be tough to see but it's
worthwhile<00:01:58.350> doing<00:01:58.740> especially<00:01:59.460> later<00:01:59.640> when

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
worthwhile doing especially later when

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.130

that will once the paint dries it a
little<00:04:27.930> dull<00:04:28.169> down<00:04:28.410> slightly<00:04:28.800> but<00:04:29.130> it's<00:04:29.400> still

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
to be for the most part I guess the

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.520 
to be for the most part I guess the
dried<00:04:38.910> mud<00:04:39.180> if<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:39.720> will<00:04:39.930> I'm<00:04:40.229> sure<00:04:40.260> you've

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
noticed that when mud dries out it tends

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.800 
noticed that when mud dries out it tends
to<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.400> know<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.940> gets<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.240> lighter<00:04:45.479> colour

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810

millimeter<00:05:37.960> scale<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.620> personally<00:05:39.630> I'm<00:05:40.630> not<00:05:40.690> a

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
millimeter scale I personally I'm not a

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.560 
millimeter scale I personally I'm not a
big<00:05:41.410> fan<00:05:41.620> of<00:05:41.680> use<00:05:42.310> of<00:05:42.580> actually<00:05:42.970> texturing<00:05:43.449> it

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
big fan of use of actually texturing it

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.790 
big fan of use of actually texturing it
with<00:05:43.660> like<00:05:43.810> sand<00:05:44.139> or<00:05:44.349> something<00:05:44.650> like<00:05:44.740> that

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
with like sand or something like that

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.770 
with like sand or something like that
because<00:05:45.099> I<00:05:45.250> think<00:05:45.460> at<00:05:45.520> this<00:05:45.639> scale<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.509> paint

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
because I think at this scale the paint

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.050 
because I think at this scale the paint
is<00:05:46.960> enough<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.560> communicate<00:05:48.070> that<00:05:48.220> mud<00:05:48.460> but<00:05:48.729> if

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
is enough to communicate that mud but if

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.640 
is enough to communicate that mud but if
you<00:05:49.180> want<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.419> try<00:05:49.570> having<00:05:49.810> some<00:05:49.960> texture<00:05:50.500> or

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
you want to try having some texture or

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.260 
you want to try having some texture or
something<00:05:50.889> like<00:05:50.949> that<00:05:51.009> you<00:05:51.699> can<00:05:51.849> certainly<00:05:52.000> do

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
something like that you can certainly do

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.629 
something like that you can certainly do
that<00:05:52.300> okay<00:05:52.990> so<00:05:53.830> right<00:05:54.009> here<00:05:54.039> I'm<00:05:54.370> gonna<00:05:54.460> crack

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639

areas like you know hatches and and
things<00:07:19.690> like<00:07:19.840> that

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
things like that

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010 
okay let's you know edge of the storage

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.670 
okay let's you know edge of the storage
box<00:07:24.250> back<00:07:24.490> there<00:07:24.670> all<00:07:24.820> that<00:07:24.940> stuff<00:07:25.440> and<00:07:26.440> once

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 
box back there all that stuff and once

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.960 
box back there all that stuff and once
that's<00:07:26.800> done<00:07:26.920> if<00:07:27.190> you<00:07:27.280> want<00:07:27.520> do<00:07:27.670> a<00:07:27.700> light

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
that's done if you want do a light

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.200 
that's done if you want do a light
spritz<00:07:28.690> a<00:07:28.780> matte<00:07:28.930> varnish<00:07:29.700> and<00:07:30.700> here<00:07:30.910> you<00:07:31.060> go

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
spritz a matte varnish and here you go

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.590 
spritz a matte varnish and here you go
all<00:07:32.020> done<00:07:32.550> not<00:07:33.550> how<00:07:33.700> to<00:07:33.760> do<00:07:33.910> that<00:07:34.060> camouflage

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:34.600 
all done not how to do that camouflage

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.570 
all done not how to do that camouflage
if<00:07:35.380> you<00:07:35.500> have<00:07:35.620> a<00:07:35.680> simple<00:07:35.860> paint<00:07:36.130> job<00:07:36.340> and<00:07:36.490> I

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.580 
if you have a simple paint job and I

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.280 
if you have a simple paint job and I
think<00:07:36.640> this<00:07:36.910> mud<00:07:37.090> effect<00:07:37.390> definitely<00:07:37.870> gets<00:07:38.170> it

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
think this mud effect definitely gets it

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.040 
think this mud effect definitely gets it
across<00:07:38.380> but<00:07:39.310> again<00:07:39.550> if<00:07:40.360> you<00:07:40.510> don't<00:07:40.660> care<00:07:40.810> for

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.050 
across but again if you don't care for

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.270 
across but again if you don't care for
it<00:07:41.230> you<00:07:41.260> like<00:07:41.380> to<00:07:41.410> keep<00:07:41.590> them<00:07:41.740> clean<00:07:41.950> you<00:07:42.160> can

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 
it you like to keep them clean you can

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.740 
it you like to keep them clean you can
just<00:07:42.400> completely<00:07:42.640> skip<00:07:42.910> those<00:07:43.090> steps<00:07:43.390> and<00:07:43.690> in

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:43.750 
just completely skip those steps and in

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.270 
just completely skip those steps and in
that<00:07:43.900> case<00:07:44.080> it's<00:07:44.350> gonna<00:07:44.470> be<00:07:44.620> even<00:07:44.710> easier<00:07:44.920> for

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 
that case it's gonna be even easier for

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.310
