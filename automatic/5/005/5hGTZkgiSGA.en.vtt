00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
my tiller and made these two roads I'd

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.510 
my tiller and made these two roads I'd
say<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.330> next<00:04:43.800> maybe<00:04:44.800> 3<00:04:45.789> to<00:04:46.090> 4<00:04:46.300> weeks<00:04:47.520> they'll

be<00:04:48.789> blooming<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.860> putting<00:04:50.860> on<00:04:50.979> pods<00:04:51.340> I<00:04:54.479> think

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
be blooming and putting on pods I think

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.360

I<00:04:55.600> learned<00:04:55.840> my<00:04:56.080> lesson<00:04:56.530> about<00:04:56.740> planting<00:04:57.160> too

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
I learned my lesson about planting too

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.190 
I learned my lesson about planting too
much<00:04:58.500> probably<00:04:59.500> not

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
much probably not
