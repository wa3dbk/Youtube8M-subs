00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
be for a bit more of a challenge you can

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.380 
be for a bit more of a challenge you can
obviously<00:01:05.549> bring<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.000> feet<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.270> bit

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
closer together and that I'll increase

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.660 
closer together and that I'll increase
the<00:01:08.850> instability<00:01:09.979> come<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> mistake<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.490> you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the instability come a mistake that you
