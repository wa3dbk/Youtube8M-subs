think it'll release maybe sometime
during<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.620> summer<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.010> since<00:03:39.220> it's<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.400> PC<00:03:39.790> it

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
during the summer and since it's a PC it

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.360 
during the summer and since it's a PC it
senses<00:03:40.359> a<00:03:40.389> smartphone<00:03:41.349> game<00:03:41.590> which<00:03:42.099> shouldn't

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
senses a smartphone game which shouldn't

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.099 
senses a smartphone game which shouldn't
be<00:03:42.430> too<00:03:42.519> hard<00:03:42.849> from<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.329> make<00:03:43.599> hopefully

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
be too hard from the make hopefully

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.569 
be too hard from the make hopefully
maybe<00:03:44.709> it'll<00:03:44.889> come<00:03:45.010> out<00:03:45.159> during<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.370> summer

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
maybe it'll come out during the summer

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.610 
maybe it'll come out during the summer
maybe<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.879> couple<00:03:46.090> months<00:03:46.150> later<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:47.169> they've

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
maybe a couple months later and they've

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.990 
maybe a couple months later and they've
probably<00:03:47.829> been<00:03:48.099> developing<00:03:48.609> it<00:03:48.699> for<00:03:48.819> a<00:03:48.879> little

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
probably been developing it for a little

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.030 
probably been developing it for a little
bit<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.329> think<00:03:50.049> this<00:03:50.169> is<00:03:50.319> very<00:03:50.379> smart<00:03:50.829> on

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
bit I think this is very smart on

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.729 
bit I think this is very smart on
squares<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.409> even<00:03:53.409> though<00:03:53.470> they're<00:03:53.590> not

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
squares and even though they're not

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.629 
squares and even though they're not
releasing<00:03:53.889> console<00:03:54.370> game<00:03:54.489> they<00:03:54.609> are

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
releasing console game they are

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.189 
releasing console game they are
