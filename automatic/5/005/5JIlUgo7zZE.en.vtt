00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
Freddie Roach and Pacquiao are going for

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.840 
Freddie Roach and Pacquiao are going for
the<00:00:31.230> knockout<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:32.130> seems<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.489> that's<00:00:32.730> what

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the knockout it seems like that's what

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.610 
the knockout it seems like that's what
they're<00:00:33.210> talking<00:00:33.510> about<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.989> lot<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.559> for

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
they're talking about a lot going for

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.830 
they're talking about a lot going for
the<00:00:34.800> naco<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.309> maybe<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.760> early<00:00:36.059> knockout<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the naco and maybe an early knockout and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
the naco and maybe an early knockout and
I<00:00:37.500> think<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> smart<00:00:38.460> because

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
I think that's kind of smart because

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.450 
I think that's kind of smart because
Pacquiao<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.329> fast<00:00:39.629> starter<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.460> Timothy

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
Pacquiao is a fast starter and Timothy

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.510 
Pacquiao is a fast starter and Timothy
Bradley<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> kind<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.480> slow<00:00:43.110> starter<00:00:43.710> we

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
Bradley is a kind of slow starter we

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.450 
Bradley is a kind of slow starter we
seen<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.760> against<00:00:45.090> Ruslan<00:00:45.480> provodnikov

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
seen that against Ruslan provodnikov

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.400 
seen that against Ruslan provodnikov
provodnikov<00:00:47.460> heard<00:00:48.239> him<00:00:48.420> early<00:00:48.780> first<00:00:49.170> round

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
provodnikov heard him early first round

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.889 
provodnikov heard him early first round
her<00:00:49.500> second-round<00:00:50.090> broadly<00:00:51.090> didn't<00:00:51.420> start<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
her second-round broadly didn't start to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.110 
her second-round broadly didn't start to
get<00:00:52.110> his<00:00:52.230> groove<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:52.860> until<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.760> middle<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
get his groove back until the middle of

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.630 
get his groove back until the middle of
the<00:00:54.239> fight<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.620> controlling<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the fight or is there controlling it so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180 
the fight or is there controlling it so
I<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.109> would<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.410> smart<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> go<00:00:59.039> after

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
I think that would be smart to go after

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.700 
I think that would be smart to go after
bribing<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> very<00:01:00.809> first<00:01:00.899> round<00:01:01.379> trying

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
bribing from the very first round trying

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.050 
bribing from the very first round trying
to<00:01:01.800> knock<00:01:01.949> him<00:01:02.129> out<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:04.729> yes<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.909> they're

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to knock him out and yes so they're

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.870 
to knock him out and yes so they're
going<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> knockout<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.200> know<00:01:07.610> they<00:01:08.610> said

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
going for the knockout I know they said

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120 
going for the knockout I know they said
that<00:01:08.970> against<00:01:09.270> Rios<00:01:10.049> ops<00:01:10.290> 2<00:01:10.680> Freddie<00:01:10.950> Roach

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310

said<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.630> seems<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.170> they're

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
said that but it seems like they're

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.730 
said that but it seems like they're
really<00:01:13.850> really<00:01:14.960> intent<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
really really intent on going for the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
really really intent on going for the
knockout<00:01:16.920> against<00:01:17.369> bravi<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
knockout against bravi and so is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.230 
knockout against bravi and so is
Pacquiao<00:01:19.200> sounds<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.770> too<00:01:20.240> apparently

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
Pacquiao sounds like that too apparently

Pacquiao sounds like that too apparently
Pacquiao<00:01:22.460> god<00:01:23.460> he<00:01:23.790> got<00:01:24.000> kind<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> pissed<00:01:24.570> off

how how Bradley said you lost your

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.649 
how how Bradley said you lost your
killer<00:01:28.650> instinct<00:01:29.130> apparently<00:01:29.850> he<00:01:30.030> kept<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.479> he

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
killer instinct apparently he kept on he

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
killer instinct apparently he kept on he
said<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.079> he<00:01:31.200> repeated<00:01:31.650> at<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.890> Freddie

Roach<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.400> can't<00:01:32.579> believe<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> said<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
Roach I can't believe you said that to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.050 
Roach I can't believe you said that to
me<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:35.780> Pacquiao<00:01:36.780> my<00:01:37.650> prediction<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.490> think

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
me so Pacquiao my prediction I think

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
me so Pacquiao my prediction I think
patio<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.869> go<00:01:40.020> timothy<00:01:40.439> bradley<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
patio will not go timothy bradley and it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.050 
patio will not go timothy bradley and it
will<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.899> under<00:01:42.899> six<00:01:43.140> rounds<00:01:43.640> evil<00:01:44.640> TKO

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
will be under six rounds evil TKO

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
will be under six rounds evil TKO
timothy<00:01:45.840> bradley<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.820> patio<00:01:50.820> uh<00:01:51.710> doesn't

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
timothy bradley so patio uh doesn't

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.010 
timothy bradley so patio uh doesn't
think<00:01:53.060> Bradley<00:01:54.060> will<00:01:54.240> fight<00:01:54.420> toe-to-toe<00:01:54.659> with

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
think Bradley will fight toe-to-toe with

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.530 
think Bradley will fight toe-to-toe with
him<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.619> don't<00:01:56.369> think<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.700> either<00:01:56.729> Bradley's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
him I don't think so either Bradley's

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.080 
him I don't think so either Bradley's
best<00:01:57.840> bet<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> box<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:59.579> he<00:01:59.700> did<00:01:59.850> against

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
best bet is the box like he did against

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.240 
best bet is the box like he did against
Marquez<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:01.079> he<00:02:01.350> went<00:02:01.799> toe-to-toe<00:02:02.009> with

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
Marquez if he went toe-to-toe with

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.639 
Marquez if he went toe-to-toe with
Marquez<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.790> would<00:02:02.909> gone<00:02:03.090> knocked<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.869> I

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
Marquez you would gone knocked out and I

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.429 
Marquez you would gone knocked out and I
think<00:02:04.939> ever<00:02:05.939> since<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.329> ruse<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.689> fight<00:02:07.020> well

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
think ever since the ruse on fight well

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.930 
think ever since the ruse on fight well
the<00:02:07.530> marquez<00:02:07.860> fight<00:02:07.890> was<00:02:08.250> after<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> recent

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the marquez fight was after the recent

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
the marquez fight was after the recent
fight<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.810> he<00:02:09.929> realized<00:02:10.140> he<00:02:10.530> doesn't

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
fight I think he realized he doesn't

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
fight I think he realized he doesn't
want<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> go<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.190> talk<00:02:11.700> too<00:02:11.910> much

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
want to go to talk too much

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
think against the shane mosley fight he

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.140 
think against the shane mosley fight he
had<00:04:33.210> them<00:04:33.630> last<00:04:34.350> time<00:04:34.620> he<00:04:35.009> mentioned<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.639> after

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
had them last time he mentioned it after

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.600 
had them last time he mentioned it after
the<00:04:36.479> fight<00:04:36.690> he<00:04:36.960> had<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.169> cramp<00:04:37.520> with<00:04:38.520> the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.080 
the fight he had the cramp with the
broadly<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.090> think<00:04:39.449> he<00:04:40.110> came<00:04:40.320> in<00:04:40.530> late<00:04:40.910> cuz<00:04:41.910> he

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
broadly I think he came in late cuz he

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.670 
broadly I think he came in late cuz he
had<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.449> stretch<00:04:42.690> his<00:04:42.900> calves<00:04:43.289> on<00:04:43.530> the

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
had to stretch his calves on the

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.700 
had to stretch his calves on the
treadmill<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.270> he's<00:04:45.930> got<00:04:46.080> issues<00:04:46.229> with<00:04:46.560> his

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
treadmill so he's got issues with his

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.210 
treadmill so he's got issues with his
legs<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.430> his<00:04:47.550> cap<00:04:47.820> stretching<00:04:48.389> them<00:04:48.539> but<00:04:49.440> it

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220

good<00:05:52.590> against<00:05:52.860> margarita<00:05:53.400> that<00:05:53.639> could<00:05:53.820> have

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
good against margarita that could have

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.779 
good against margarita that could have
been<00:05:54.000> ruled<00:05:54.300> stoppage<00:05:54.870> but<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.169> wasn't<00:05:55.789> so

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
been ruled stoppage but it wasn't so

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.290 
been ruled stoppage but it wasn't so
hasn't<00:05:57.510> come<00:05:57.659> close<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:58.169> knocking<00:05:58.970> anyone<00:05:59.970> out

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
hasn't come close to knocking anyone out

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.129 
hasn't come close to knocking anyone out
since<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.840> margarito<00:06:01.349> fight<00:06:02.270> but<00:06:03.270> I<00:06:03.300> think<00:06:03.599> I

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
since the margarito fight but I think I

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.370 
since the margarito fight but I think I
think<00:06:05.070> he<00:06:05.159> couldn't<00:06:05.490> TKO<00:06:05.940> Brandon<00:06:06.419> Rios<00:06:06.780> in

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
think he couldn't TKO Brandon Rios in

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.589 
think he couldn't TKO Brandon Rios in
the<00:06:08.220> later<00:06:08.430> rounds<00:06:08.639> he<00:06:08.909> looked<00:06:09.120> like<00:06:09.180> Brandon

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
the later rounds he looked like Brandon

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.600 
the later rounds he looked like Brandon
Rios<00:06:09.870> was<00:06:09.900> getting<00:06:10.380> hurt<00:06:10.620> I<00:06:10.830> think<00:06:11.340> he<00:06:11.430> could

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
Rios was getting hurt I think he could

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.250 
Rios was getting hurt I think he could
have<00:06:11.699> but<00:06:11.909> he<00:06:12.240> was<00:06:12.389> more<00:06:12.539> cautious<00:06:12.990> so<00:06:13.110> I<00:06:13.199> think

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
have but he was more cautious so I think

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.219 
have but he was more cautious so I think
this<00:06:13.560> fight<00:06:13.830> he<00:06:14.699> will<00:06:14.940> finish<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.690> job<00:06:15.960> and

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
this fight he will finish the job and

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:23.710 
this fight he will finish the job and
get<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.530> TKO<00:06:17.039> win<00:06:18.680> so<00:06:19.680> uh<00:06:21.500> yeah<00:06:22.500> I<00:06:22.560> think<00:06:22.650> I

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
get the TKO win so uh yeah I think I

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.580 
get the TKO win so uh yeah I think I
think<00:06:24.720> Bradley<00:06:25.289> I<00:06:25.620> think<00:06:25.830> Bradley<00:06:27.320> is<00:06:28.320> gonna

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
think Bradley I think Bradley is gonna
