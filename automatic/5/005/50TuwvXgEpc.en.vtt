00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.970 
career I felt for me to to win trophies
and<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.810> best<00:03:43.989> opportunity<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:44.560> me<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.739> do

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
and the best opportunity for me to do

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.379 
and the best opportunity for me to do
that<00:03:45.010> was<00:03:45.370> supposed<00:03:45.669> to<00:03:45.760> move<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:46.030> sit<00:03:46.239> here

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
and since then it's been justified so I

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.319 
and since then it's been justified so I
like<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.290> think<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.400> fans<00:03:51.669> now<00:03:51.879> realize
