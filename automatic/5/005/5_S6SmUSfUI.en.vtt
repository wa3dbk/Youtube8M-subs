some<00:03:43.140> form<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.860> barrier<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.640> protecting

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
some form of barrier and protecting

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.340 
some form of barrier and protecting
against<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> heat<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.500> I'll<00:03:46.620> be<00:03:46.800> using<00:03:47.000> so

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
against the heat that I'll be using so

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.150 
against the heat that I'll be using so
this<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:52.230> it's<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.500> very<00:03:52.709> watery

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
you're using that heat and this suction

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.100 
you're using that heat and this suction
as<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.010> said<00:04:39.250> before<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.880> just<00:04:40.090> been<00:04:40.360> washed

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:51.420 

and<00:05:37.660> that's<00:05:37.900> basically

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.030 

so<00:05:52.300> that's<00:05:52.479> how<00:05:52.630> he<00:05:52.660> said<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.440> I'll<00:05:53.800> be

so that's how he said and I'll be

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.860 
so that's how he said and I'll be
blow-drying<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.699> suction<00:05:55.150> and<00:05:55.360> repeating

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
blow-drying the suction and repeating

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.129 
blow-drying the suction and repeating
the<00:05:56.020> same<00:05:56.229> steps<00:05:56.560> on<00:05:56.800> this<00:05:56.979> side<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:58.080> let<00:05:59.080> me

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
the same steps on this side and let me

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.879 
the same steps on this side and let me
try<00:05:59.259> to<00:05:59.320> think<00:05:59.590> this<00:05:59.800> there's<00:06:00.039> anything<00:06:00.400> else

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
try to think this there's anything else

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.090 
try to think this there's anything else

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
obviously just this flat iron which is a

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.340 
obviously just this flat iron which is a
sheet<00:06:06.639> 2<00:06:07.090> inch<00:06:09.539> turbo<00:06:10.539> flat<00:06:10.960> iron<00:06:11.320> with

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
sheet 2 inch turbo flat iron with

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.600 
sheet 2 inch turbo flat iron with
ceramic<00:06:12.070> plates

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
ceramic plates

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.060 
ceramic plates
I<00:06:12.639> had<00:06:13.150> this<00:06:13.300> flat<00:06:13.570> iron<00:06:13.720> for<00:06:13.870> six<00:06:14.560> years<00:06:14.860> now

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
I had this flat iron for six years now

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.760 
I had this flat iron for six years now
so<00:06:15.370> it's<00:06:15.400> not<00:06:15.820> gonna<00:06:16.030> be<00:06:16.150> wrong<00:06:16.419> and<00:06:17.139> it<00:06:17.500> still

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
so it's not gonna be wrong and it still

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.950 
so it's not gonna be wrong and it still

just one piece that grabbed some of the

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.689 
just one piece that grabbed some of the
air<00:06:22.060> so<00:06:22.389> I<00:06:22.690> use<00:06:23.289> less<00:06:23.650> hair<00:06:23.979> in<00:06:24.010> the<00:06:24.250> flat<00:06:24.490> iron

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
air so I use less hair in the flat iron

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.029 
air so I use less hair in the flat iron
does<00:06:24.940> not<00:06:24.970> to<00:06:25.330> get<00:06:25.479> it<00:06:25.630> snagged<00:06:26.500> into<00:06:26.919> this

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
does not to get it snagged into this

little section here but besides that it

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.480 
little section here but besides that it
works<00:06:30.610> perfectly<00:06:31.090> fine<00:06:31.330> and<00:06:31.770> I<00:06:32.770> use<00:06:33.039> the<00:06:33.340> blow
