is it compressed has it been flattened

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
is it compressed has it been flattened
about<00:01:26.580> every<00:01:26.820> two<00:01:27.000> years<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.600> should<00:01:27.630> replace

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
about every two years you should replace

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.680

becomes distorted the o-ring will become

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.880 
becomes distorted the o-ring will become
a<00:01:33.180> less<00:01:33.420> efficient<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.080> eventually<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.799> will

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
a less efficient and eventually you will

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
a less efficient and eventually you will
flood<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.190> camera<00:01:35.670> also<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.840> many

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
integrity test on the camera now I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.140 
integrity test on the camera now I
recommend<00:04:08.040> doing<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.280> initially<00:04:08.910> with<00:04:09.060> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
recommend doing this initially with the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.600 
recommend doing this initially with the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
camera not in the housing so remove the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.420 
camera not in the housing so remove the
camera<00:04:12.260> do<00:04:13.260> your<00:04:13.440> visual<00:04:13.799> inspection<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.310> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
