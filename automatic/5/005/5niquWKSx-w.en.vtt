00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
to wire that keeps in copper I've tried

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.379 
to wire that keeps in copper I've tried
this<00:00:33.710> multiple<00:00:34.339> times<00:00:34.550> I<00:00:34.699> see<00:00:34.879> keeps<00:00:35.239> in

this multiple times I see keeps in

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:38.169 
this multiple times I see keeps in
copper<00:00:35.780> wire<00:00:36.019> I<00:00:36.639> proclaim<00:00:37.639> you<00:00:37.670> not<00:00:37.909> again

copper wire I proclaim you not again

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.759 
copper wire I proclaim you not again
waiting<00:00:38.420> watching<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:38.960> perfect<00:00:39.530> piece

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
waiting watching this perfect piece

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.389 
waiting watching this perfect piece
anyway<00:00:40.729> so<00:00:40.789> you<00:00:40.999> see<00:00:41.269> colored<00:00:41.780> wires<00:00:42.159> right<00:00:43.159> to

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
anyway so you see colored wires right to

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.340 
anyway so you see colored wires right to
bed<00:00:43.579> that<00:00:43.789> was<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.059> picture<00:00:44.269> this<00:00:44.719> picture<00:00:45.019> of

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
bed that was the picture this picture of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.229 
bed that was the picture this picture of
that<00:00:45.559> it's<00:00:46.010> just<00:00:46.249> about<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.639> culprit<00:00:47.149> of

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
that it's just about the culprit of

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.660 
that it's just about the culprit of
color<00:00:47.510> wires<00:00:47.839> and<00:00:48.649> also<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.129> should<00:00:49.339> see<00:00:49.489> here

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
color wires and also I should see here

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.209 
color wires and also I should see here
the<00:00:49.850> blue<00:00:50.089> wire<00:00:50.359> goes<00:00:51.139> into<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.559> floor<00:00:51.920> and

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
the blue wire goes into the floor and

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.129 
the blue wire goes into the floor and
you<00:00:52.699> see<00:00:52.879> a<00:00:52.909> little<00:00:53.119> bit<00:00:53.299> different<00:00:53.809> blocks

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
you see a little bit different blocks

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:57.609 
you see a little bit different blocks
there<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.479> the<00:00:56.479> other<00:00:56.719> picture<00:00:57.019> on<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.589> other

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.619 
there and the other picture on the other

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.029 
there and the other picture on the other
side<00:00:58.249> you<00:00:58.670> see<00:00:58.699> that<00:00:59.029> there's<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.389> hole<00:00:59.659> here

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
side you see that there's a hole here

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.509 
side you see that there's a hole here
and<00:01:01.600> light<00:01:02.600> turns<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.109> so<00:01:04.070> that's<00:01:04.280> probably

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
and light turns on so that's probably

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.179 
and light turns on so that's probably
wanted<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.939> new<00:01:05.089> truck<00:01:05.420> blocks

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
wanted to new truck blocks

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.160 
wanted to new truck blocks
so<00:01:07.820> yeah<00:01:08.000> there's<00:01:08.630> probably<00:01:08.689> gonna<00:01:08.960> be<00:01:09.049> more

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
so yeah there's probably gonna be more

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.010 
so yeah there's probably gonna be more
call-out<00:01:09.829> wires<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:11.299> a<00:01:11.509> birth<00:01:11.719> with<00:01:11.869> your

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
call-out wires and a birth with your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.370 
call-out wires and a birth with your
point<00:01:12.380> he<00:01:13.310> said<00:01:13.610> he<00:01:13.880> was<00:01:13.969> gonna<00:01:14.119> have<00:01:14.360> died<00:01:14.780> so

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
point he said he was gonna have died so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.560 
point he said he was gonna have died so
maybe<00:01:15.710> who<00:01:16.490> knows<00:01:16.520> maybe<00:01:16.939> you<00:01:17.060> make<00:01:17.240> them<00:01:17.420> with

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
maybe who knows maybe you make them with

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.380 
maybe who knows maybe you make them with
dye<00:01:17.810> or<00:01:18.140> maybe<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:18.439> can<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:18.799> buy<00:01:18.979> them<00:01:19.390> but

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
dye or maybe you can just buy them but

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.480 
dye or maybe you can just buy them but
that's<00:01:20.990> for<00:01:21.170> another<00:01:21.200> video<00:01:21.560> -<00:01:21.890> dyes<00:01:22.130> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
that's for another video - dyes and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.539 
that's for another video - dyes and
stuff<00:01:22.899> also<00:01:23.899> something<00:01:24.799> I<00:01:24.890> found<00:01:25.189> out<00:01:25.369> if<00:01:25.520> you

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
stuff also something I found out if you

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.410 
stuff also something I found out if you
look<00:01:25.880> behind<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:27.470> character<00:01:28.159> you<00:01:28.880> see<00:01:29.119> some

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
look behind the character you see some

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.770 
look behind the character you see some
clothes<00:01:29.780> hanging<00:01:30.259> off<00:01:30.560> on<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.069> wall<00:01:31.600> so<00:01:32.600> this

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
clothes hanging off on the wall so this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.200 
clothes hanging off on the wall so this
maybe<00:01:33.020> means<00:01:33.409> you<00:01:33.560> can<00:01:33.740> buy<00:01:34.340> clothes<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.030> hang

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
maybe means you can buy clothes and hang

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.210 
maybe means you can buy clothes and hang
them<00:01:35.299> on<00:01:35.450> walls<00:01:35.750> now<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.740> actually<00:01:36.890> looked

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
them on walls now it actually looked

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.490 
them on walls now it actually looked
pretty<00:01:37.549> interesting<00:01:38.110> saying<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:39.170> should<00:01:39.349> see

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
pretty interesting saying we should see

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.169 
pretty interesting saying we should see
the<00:01:39.679> table<00:01:40.069> and<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.310> chair<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.700> difference

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
the table and the chair of difference

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.109 
the table and the chair of difference
and<00:01:42.049> also<00:01:42.950> if<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.549> look<00:01:43.700> on<00:01:43.819> the<00:01:43.880> other<00:01:43.939> side

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
and also if you look on the other side

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.809 
and also if you look on the other side
of<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.630> picture<00:01:44.840> again<00:01:45.080> with<00:01:45.349> the<00:01:45.470> hole<00:01:45.819> you

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
of the picture again with the hole you

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.639 
of the picture again with the hole you
see<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.299> golden<00:01:47.929> chests<00:01:48.319> are<00:01:48.439> a<00:01:48.470> little

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
see that the golden chests are a little

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.270 
see that the golden chests are a little
different<00:01:49.069> so<00:01:49.459> I<00:01:49.610> assume<00:01:50.860> they're<00:01:51.860> different

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
different so I assume they're different

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.499 
different so I assume they're different
and<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.810> see<00:01:53.959> also<00:01:54.229> purple<00:01:54.649> blocks<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:56.390> you

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
and you see also purple blocks and you

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.109 
and you see also purple blocks and you
just<00:01:56.750> see<00:01:56.990> different<00:01:57.649> backgrounds<00:01:58.429> so<00:01:59.090> I

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
just see different backgrounds so I

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.850 
just see different backgrounds so I
think<00:01:59.360> they're<00:01:59.539> gonna<00:01:59.720> add<00:01:59.959> new<00:02:00.200> blocks<00:02:00.560> like

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
think they're gonna add new blocks like

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.929 
think they're gonna add new blocks like
that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.959 
that
also<00:02:03.719> really<00:02:04.079> big<00:02:04.259> notice<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
also really big notice is you see the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.330 
also really big notice is you see the
hallo<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.289> see<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.619> there's<00:02:07.860> purple

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
hallo and you see that there's purple

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.300 
hallo and you see that there's purple
water<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.360> waterfalls

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
water here and with waterfalls

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.180 
water here and with waterfalls
waterfalls<00:02:11.310> are<00:02:11.489> new<00:02:11.640> things<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.450> she<00:02:12.630> see
