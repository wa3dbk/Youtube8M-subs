00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.720
 had been superior river-mouth if there was 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.820
 prevented rule age judging by everything 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.240
 the August game this is how it was played 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.309
 what he wanted above this prevented that 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.279
 mouth will play better played in the monumental 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.650
 that the game of the other day was a thing 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.869
 sad football in the point of view 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.689
 football player frei said football 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.849
 soccer fan with very sad very sad 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.710
 because there were no net scoring situations 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.000
 one and one matches more grace than 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.070
 good up on all of that was what 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.930
 defensive clear was the one of the two 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.630
 matches that mouth will play in the ring 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.360
 first there was not much time there in what 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.830
 of the three quarters of the mouth field 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.120
 then he lacked lucidity to get there 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.000
 to the arch 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.820
 we had said this week that rather 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.800
 the arrival on the advances generated 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.719
 balls stops it was never said by 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.399
 example that river did not want and mouth no 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.800
 could new new thing 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:04.729
 good but this one to grab that phrase 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.390
 search could not by river there would be the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.270
 235 minute definition brief made a 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.649
 little in attack I would say enough and not 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.070
 I know why he but the goal over 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.530
 arrived really does not have computable 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.700
 but if that's okay that first half of 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.840
 work because in fact the in the turn 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.179
 It was 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.890
 is generating the gag boredom that 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.539
 when he can not play his way he is 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.920
 like he's running away and he could not 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.460
 play that way I know it was not 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.829
 surprise that river do what he did and 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:44.869
 I thought that mouth was going to get a plan 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:47.060
 to counteract the second match and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.490
 Well I booked this house I am 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.539
 clear that all the others that delfino not 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.039
 he got normal 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.840
 because many talked about why they do not know 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.789
 skillful because he can not do the game there 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.530
 what did pete and martín do? 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.759
 that's why they played in to prevent that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.200
 they went up on Tuesday afternoon 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.329
 martínez pure the problems that also 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.239
 they are coca-cola their earthquake away to see 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.769
 really strikes me 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.390
 because it seems that this form of 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.370
 save free everything opposite to what 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.860
 trumpeted gallardo in all since 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.530
 I have a coach if he always trumpeted 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.060
 other kind of things domination in return 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.269
 of the circumstances forced him to 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.280
 change and that's not a merit for me 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.690
 because I am a supporter of what 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.030
 proposed 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.190
 in the first half when it was the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.680
 first half of last year that the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.170
 team played phenomenally we can not 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.240
 to say that it was nice and this was 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.080
 what is convenient for up understanding 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.580
 as if he had for some time 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.620
 passed on to the other because still trying 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.620
 and here he won a goal 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.020
 because look like the sides do not 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.480
 they took off never peacock was good 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.690
 always marked to neutralize a team 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.560
 that he had much more than the difference 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.630
 that there was attention that mouth 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.030
 practically does not explode being that 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.040
 but pushing gave a party in the two 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:29.080
 middle area parties and in both 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.080
 matches and if it was more or less 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:59.060
 in the first hour of the second time 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:04:01.820
 a horror 0022 in the exact minutes 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.490
 with some play there is an error of the 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.290
 another side with this type of party leads 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.600
 also to the disenchantment that the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.610
 people are happy for the shirts 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.380
 they represent when 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.150
 they won those from above when when 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.920
 they won another game and a change of 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.140
 which they never give where they will never speak in 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.420
 the video please clearly that was the 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:27.370
 paid out was talked about the hard 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.370
 where it never happened 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:41.320
 it's the change you're never going to talk about 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:43.480
 but when training and this and this 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.760
 it is not grace peacock and 10 more I said no 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.550
 that peacock was in doubt with his fingers and 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.010
 this does not give rise to see something what 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.690
 he wanted that he had naturally had those 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.310
 first ten good minutes this was the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.200
 monumental turning point go to 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.320
 kicks I wanted to start from there stuck 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.730
 start playing differently 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.230
 for herrera of the root remains to remember 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:09.910
 that empanada of the monumental boy of 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:11.980
 starting and not weighed and then enters is 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.350
 be of a midfield absorbed by the 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.640
 river midfield that's where it is 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.870
 can talk about something of superiority to 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.600
 one team to another, not the midfield 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.120
 then superior the air and had been 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.680
 superior in the deep turn of a 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.690
 another top team is a team that 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.430
 it produces more we are saying heart attack 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.380
 our decision to repeat prayer 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.520
 the merits of rivals had 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.520
 more defensive 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.230
 223 things you have to do one was 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.820
 put in each long bow throw put 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.750
 love to peru 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.640
 bruce and on top of each other 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.200
 was to throw the game very very 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.330
 markedly right the doctor her 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.330
 each one had a mission and the as well 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.030
 these I am going to solve and sometimes 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.620
 Monaco now close to delegates 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:09.120
 I am pariah once the water to follow is neutral 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.120
 vision area 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:27.890
 above this was the only one who knew 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:30.660
 direct six-fifteen in the afternoon 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:37.580
 applauded as a vigilante that he was going to 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:41.100
 charge what happens then arises 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.560
 what did I get when I first osvaldo in 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.500
 that first super classic in the bonbon 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:53.910
 I was in how the friction still had 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:56.100
 the occasional clear movement as of 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.530
 fine fiction everything we will future 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.230
 second gago is the one that gives him the way 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.480
 mouth now is that when 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.650
 definitely sinks the structure 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.140
 totally but it's like that but you have to 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.960
 assume that it is good to read the newspaper 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.120
 and the kid will be the cute one of the party 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.460
 now when it 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.530
 it is intended that you be the cute one of the 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.280
 party and it goes wrong 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.870
 that criticism that seems for the 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.190
 football that you try to play to have the 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.050
 ball to play many teams in the 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.280
 world not only Barcelona that you 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.570
 you have to have for the decision is more 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.220
 of a player and not that there are two 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.380
 players who do things the rest play 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.160
 nothing part apart for me I guess that 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.160
 it's more our and salt
