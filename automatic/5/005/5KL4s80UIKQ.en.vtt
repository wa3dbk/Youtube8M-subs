00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.899
 the first couple standing of the same sex 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.550
 requested the date for your link 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.860
 marriage in the second officer 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.120
 of the civil registry in reynosa so 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.809
 informed the head of the dependency 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.600
 sweet chestnut navad that effectively 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.090
 here is already official and second 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.260
 the civil registry that we title this one 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.320
 yes the first couple came where this 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.550
 you're already looking at scheduling the date 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.980
 to be able to carry out this ceremony 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.629
 and the civil registry will no longer be 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.129
 present and will be in conditions like 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.730
 I repeat to give the legality and certainty 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.739
 legal 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.620
 He expressed that it is a couple 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.540
 male since one of the contracting parties 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.790
 accredited with his protection and identification 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.920
 which is in the list of 68 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.150
 people who got the failure of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.390
 judge in favor within this number of 68 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.550
 in some cases it is the true couple that 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.190
 account the both who have their 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.080
 amparo in some other cases is enough 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.009
 that one of them is protected and can 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.750
 go with your partner not yet 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.270
 being inside that group 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.610
 of people osa is enough for one to count 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.700
 this with his with his shelter for 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.590
 introduce yourself and be able to follow up 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.649
 this to the request that they have been 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.930
 demanding the civil servant clear that no 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.820
 it is a general opening since 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.710
 only the people listed in the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.929
 Amparo can request your link 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.530
 marriage between them or with their 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.539
 couples to give legality and certainty 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.080
 legal to the union of couples of the same 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.540
 sex 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.290
 only and exclusively it is like this if 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.620
 I would like to be very repetitive at 68 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.820
 people who interposed Juan Pablo and 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.280
 what was favorable this and if I say that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.710
 I want to be very reiterative because to 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.390
 that this does not lend itself to bad 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.020
 interpretations as to what one 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.820
 is externancing that is not an opening 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.060
 general 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.310
 it's exclusively the 68 couples that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.530
 they have an amparo and they can 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.360
 go even to any official 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.940
 of the civil registry of the entire state of 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.830
 Tamaulipas apparently it's about the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.780
 first couple in same sex stop 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.030
 in Tamaulipas that requests the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.590
 registration of your marriage with 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.690
 images of francisco hernÃ¡ndez gea 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.440
 informed for the voice 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.440
