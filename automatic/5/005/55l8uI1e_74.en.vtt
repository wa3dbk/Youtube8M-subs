00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.340
 the story of the giorgetti cube 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.620
 once there was a little some la 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.870
 elf named giorgio he loved 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.450
 paint but unfortunately did not know 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.080
 draw and limited himself to spreading of the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.260
 color on the canvas 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.850
 he was very, very fussy and not 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.660
 never being convinced of the result 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.970
 the final 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.480
 he continued to mix color with colors 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.700
 with amazing effects and nuances a 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.489
 day he managed to create a square 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.900
 perfect and then another square e 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.790
 just another 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.550
 until he realized that together 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.250
 formed a three-dimensional figure from 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.560
 fairy tale a cube 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.080
 the little elf had the morale at 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.170
 stars and decided to give a name to 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.590
 that work of art fused the two names 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.640
 square and dark and keeps its name at that 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.530
 his masterpiece is the cube 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.199
 the small and humble elf named george 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.080
 had created a new planet that 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.560
 it shone with its own light 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.680
 the cube had six square faces 8 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.610
 vertices and 12 edges and the sum of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.899
 those figures formed the 26 that looks 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.330
 case was his date of birth 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.940
 this coincidence that persuaded him still 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.050
 more than that work had to be 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.930
 perfect 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.110
 then he started painting other squares 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.550
 and others, and others 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 he painted for hours days months every day 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.049
 a new square for 365 days 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.420
 but no work reached that much 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.650
 coveted perfection 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.600
 and no work convinced him 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.920
 the small and humble elf named Giorgio 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.649
 he was exhausted disappointed and so decided to 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.320
 put an end to that delirium took a 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.270
 awl ran down the stairs and yes 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.729
 rushed to the cellar to destroy e 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.200
 permanently delete that 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.789
 damn cube but as soon as i enter 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.269
 she remained born born of a blinding light 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.569
 never seen a light full of colors that 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:21.680
 it came from his work 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.200
 a vertex of the cube was foreshortened and da 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.799
 that slit came out all over 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.349
 energy vitality love and inspiration 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.709
 that he had donated a year before 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.870
 that tormented work was indeed in 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.599
 that moment that the little giorgio 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.680
 I knew he had for a whole year 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.980
 searched elsewhere 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.030
 what instead was there beside him and 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.770
 that is 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:53.430
 perfection that life perfection 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.560
 due to inspiration and instinct 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.650
 so 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.269
 sitting in front of some 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.060
 I begin to admire all the 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.700
 facets details and nuances 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.840
 and you must have found it difficult to recognize 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.840
 as its creation 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.310
 it was a unique journey full of landscapes and 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.069
 wonders 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.400
 that did not emerge in a new magic 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.130
 world a world but she explored before 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.560
 after that episode the small and humble 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.670
 elf named giorgio transformed 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.670
 radically his way of conceiving 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.670
 the art
