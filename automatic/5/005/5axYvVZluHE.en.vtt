00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.019
 Well, I had these utensils 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:13.070
 I have a tripod of the hama brand 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.810
 range I do not know how to say and good 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.990
 I found this 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.600
 which is to put the mobile here because 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.170
 I wanted a tripod for me 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.750
 samsung galaxy s3 but the measurement 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.380
 standard of those who sell the maximum that 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.020
 usually enter is an iphone and did not have 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.290
 another way to put it and good seeing 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.510
 this here we see that it has this nut 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.530
 appointment 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.710
 and when I broke my support for the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 car to carry the mobile in the car 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.730
 here it would be missing 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.180
 the spring the head that goes with a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 windy that I do not have it here I 've already 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.870
 thrown away then it occurred to me to put a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.739
 nut here to be able to screw the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:11.100
 tripod that I already had to buy and make 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:12.840
 a a tripod with a stand for 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.070
 minimize your class 3 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.680
 I have a video of supports that I will leave 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.940
 down in the description or here in the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.830
 video is good is very simple 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.880
 in the video that I will leave you detest 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.610
 because I had thought about putting a 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.299
 one of my stand to support the mobile 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.799
 but of course it ends up falling there is no 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.619
 security so that you have it at home but 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.630
 to get him out on the street does not work for us and 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.159
 you must have found this but this as 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.130
 she had that she did not know what to do with him 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.229
 before throwing it I remembered seeing this 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.530
 indicated I'll see if it works and 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.610
 it actually works is a nut me 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.990
 I advise you to bear 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.440
 hardware store where you go to buy the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.750
 nut 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.360
 now I do not know that you have her at home 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.720
 tripod to find a hook 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.229
 Well, these nuts 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.420
 that hook with the tripods are usually 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.880
 few but but you can 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.610
 find consists of hitting the nut 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.500
 with a glue like tite can be 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.600
 we press a bit with the d during 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.020
 a few seconds and let dry with 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.040
 an hour would suffice and then simply 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.040
 we screw 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.550
 and as you can see 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.550
 we have 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.830
 what is a tripod mounted tiny 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:53.760
 but a tripod this one has the sideburns 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.760
 that come out and it gets that high 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.940
 and good and what we are going to try now goes 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.940
 to be to put the mobile 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.490
 Well now it has come down and closed 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.590
 the openings the temples to tripod 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.220
 to be able to focus better with the camera and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.950
 Now I am going to show you the good phone 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.030
 the samsung galaxy s3 i'm going to put it 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.030
 in this 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.799
 in this other that I have 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.300
 which is the one that I use the most 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.750
 and well this would be like this here and at 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.300
 tripod and this I found the truth is 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.790
 that by chance and you're just going to 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.170
 find if you buy a zoom for the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.560
 camera that good there are enough pages 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.130
 that websites that sell what we will 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.130
 remove this 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.390
 It is just the truth that from 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:06.310
 the star when you have a nodule or the 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:10.239
 es4 with a htc if it's a little more more 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.140
 great, you need something like this 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.140
 This is very easy 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.370
 we put the mobile here 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:27.710
 we put together as we would with the gps or the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.000
 mobile if we take it in the car 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.300
 we close well 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.300
 Y 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.360
 and we have it and good 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.360
 this would only be 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.849
 to record 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.770
 and I would be focusing on this well 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.080
 is the way to make a tripod more 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.199
 cheap and that it's useful for mobile and 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.970
 good until I butt that from the opening 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:07.620
 of the support that we have in 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.970
 lots of stores and very cheap already 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.610
 we know that the back of the 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.070
 suction is removed or not even the 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.090
 we put because they come separated and 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.710
 we put a nut with dyes the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.169
 We stick on one end and 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.199
 advised to be in this position to 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.479
 that the area of ​​the chamber remains free 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.370
 here and we have no problem of 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.610
 have to walk better adjusting the mobile 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:36.060
 and we'll leave for an hour 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.770
 approximately and we would have this already 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.380
