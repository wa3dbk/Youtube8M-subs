course our level 40 heroes let's go find
a<00:00:33.120> base<00:00:33.329> hopefully<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.410> something<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:35.070> can

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
a base hopefully it's something we can

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
a base hopefully it's something we can
three<00:00:35.550> star<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.180> need<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> base<00:00:36.630> where<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.110> can

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
three star we need a base where we can

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.660 
three star we need a base where we can
kill<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> archer<00:00:38.070> queen<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.690> take<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
clan castle troops as well now we also

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
clan castle troops as well now we also
would<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.300> single<00:00:45.960> infernos<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
would like to see single infernos on the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.920 
would like to see single infernos on the
base<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.309> take<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.300> necessary

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
base that we take but it's not necessary

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.889 
base that we take but it's not necessary
because<00:00:49.170> well<00:00:49.980> it'd<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.760> best<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.690> not

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
because well it'd be best but it's not

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.389 
because well it'd be best but it's not
always<00:00:52.079> possible<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.590> find<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.890> base<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.250> two

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
always possible to find a base with two

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.880 
always possible to find a base with two
single<00:00:53.789> infernos<00:00:54.329> maybe<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.500> find<00:00:55.710> one

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
single infernos maybe we can find one

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
single infernos maybe we can find one
with<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.370> single<00:00:56.610> infernal<00:00:57.090> well<00:00:57.270> here's<00:00:57.510> one

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
with one single infernal well here's one

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.049 
with one single infernal well here's one
with<00:00:57.840> two<00:00:57.989> single<00:00:58.320> infernos<00:00:58.850> slightly<00:00:59.850> easier

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
with two single infernos slightly easier

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.950 
with two single infernos slightly easier
base<00:01:02.359> we<00:01:03.359> probably<00:01:03.690> could<00:01:04.080> take<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.619> he<00:01:05.430> has

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
base we probably could take it he has

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.480 
base we probably could take it he has
giant<00:01:06.960> bombs<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.590> each<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.890> these<00:01:07.979> corners

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
giant bombs in each of these corners

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
giant bombs in each of these corners
probably<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.270> base<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.260> we

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
probably that's how this base is and we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.440 
probably that's how this base is and we
can<00:01:10.710> freeze<00:01:10.950> both<00:01:11.189> infernos<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> middle

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
can freeze both infernos in the middle

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.080 
can freeze both infernos in the middle
so<00:01:12.840> let's<00:01:13.080> try<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.530> let's<00:01:14.400> go<00:01:14.549> clashers

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
so let's try it out let's go clashers

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.370 
so let's try it out let's go clashers
alright<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:18.390> ability<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> kill<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
alright we have the ability to kill the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.410 
alright we have the ability to kill the
barbed<00:01:19.740> King<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.430> first<00:01:20.790> let's<00:01:21.180> get

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
barbed King here but first let's get
