00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.930
 hello we are the project team 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.430
 tyson street 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.430
 welcome behind the scenes of fis 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.420
 in a suite tells the story of a 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.530
 policeman on patrol his lunch break 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.580
 is suddenly interrupted by a 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.580
 event that he will have to face 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.280
 the ambitions of this project that would have 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.110
 been making a dark and futuristic movie 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.820
 in tribute to the science fiction film 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.810
 80s 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.170
 while bringing a touch of 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.170
 modernity 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.000
 we started by developing 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.470
 concepts and in two years of light 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.460
 situation 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.600
 we came out of the universe 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.640
 this pedalo paul in which the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.640
 verticality and hostility is exercisable 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.490
 the filming took place entirely 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.110
 in the studio 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.520
 on the one hand for the flexibility that 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.630
 could we bring the city by 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.939
 report 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.409
 existing and on the other hand to avoid 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.409
 the constraints of a night shoot 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.550
 we got in touch with 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.460
 mathieu man based 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.260
 student in comedy school on paris 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.700
 coming from the middle of the mathieu theater has 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.380
 very well adapted to the constraints 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.670
 a shoot through 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.229
 we had a day on the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.219
 planning to prepare him for his role 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.170
 the action taking place on a dock 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.539
 suspended we needed an equivalent 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.189
 physical shooting a way to 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.380
 raise the plateau and have in a 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.929
 first time the ground contact fittings 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.520
 and in a second time a flexibility 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.429
 execution on any frame to 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.509
 day we also needed 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.979
 set up lighting 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.660
 dynamic to have the good 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.130
 light influences on the actor in 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.989
 the car we had lights 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.819
 remotely controlled with filters 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.739
 colorful couple is a metronome 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.450
 it allowed us to manage the timing 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.400
 activations extinction of lights 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.209
 as well as colorimetry related to 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.920
 systems dalet the end sequence itself 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.180
 passing completely in the rain he 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.150
 we had to find a solution to 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.769
 filming at that we had the idea of 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.569
 faking the plans directly a camera 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.410
 old-fashioned using the technique 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.410
 trans lighting 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.320
 we shot outdoors which 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.250
 was extremely restrictive for 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.290
 the team considering the conditions 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.190
 weather the time between each take 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.190
 has been optimized to the maximum 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.400
 having various framing we will 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.420
 create the entire neighborhood 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.090
 we are divided the tasks of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.160
 modeling the creation of the doc has 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.290
 called for a full implementation 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.290
 the base they were modeled soumaya 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.060
 we then carve and avinée de 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.140
 many parts are close after 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.030
 have placed the cameras in 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.350
 the environment 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.270
 the textures were painted her husband 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.130
 including ergonomics and some 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.480
 interesting features like the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.280
 possibility of parrot on 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.670
 very detailed modeling we got 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.670
 convinced 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.670
 about the police car we 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.720
 are inspired by the robustness and 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.670
 color codes of police cars 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.700
 American as well as some 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.660
 vehicles of science fiction 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.120
 we made several proposals 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.519
 of d1 really pick one and establish 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.110
 the proportions submitted the mobilization 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.160
 immediately have members 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.660
 do not take the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.640
 we did comparative tests 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.640
 between different rendering engines so 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.630
 to define the most suitable for our daughter 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.910
 then the work of chézine start 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.950
 the car was embarrassed by mixing 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.540
 several students 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.060
 we had good total control over the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.620
 look earth directly in backers the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.819
 bigger challenge regarding rendering the 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.439
 decor is simply 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.600
 it's when ascetic of materials and 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.460
 light in the Seine 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.160
 sold optimize to the maximum while having 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.180
 physically correct materials 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.989
 the use of proxy was necessary 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.300
 to go north 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.220
 the holograms required a job 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.990
 looking for tests to see claude 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.240
 in order to achieve an aesthetic result 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.770
 which of assets we had to display a 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.560
 many elements respecting and 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.009
 content 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.629
 the challenge was to stay lee 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.879
 since the camera was still facing 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.889
 to the other hologram actor have been 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.710
 made directly from nuke and his 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.970
 3d particle system 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.600
 the collaboration of alexander carrier 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.100
 freelance students for this we 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.900
 used two techniques according to the 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.860
 degree of animation of the holograms and 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.880
 their rendering 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.830
 some were made in maya 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.320
 others directly in the 3D space of 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.520
 nuke 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.240
 simplifying also by using 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.100
 of rendering on card the explosion of the 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.120
 glass was for its part simulated with 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.220
 the plugin mm 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.750
 after getting the animation from 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.690
 character is a student free 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.550
 lance Olivier Dessibourg the work of 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.650
 compositing started quite early in the 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.480
 production at the shoot we were doing some 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.160
 king and matchmaking tests of a 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.780
 syntai to prechac 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.610
 compositing is essential for us 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.490
 the challenge was an inch of a 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.680
 real character in the civic devions 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.129
 be vigilant ground contact to the shadows 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.389
 and to the lines 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.580
 we have enhanced the lighting 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.379
 magnify the lighting and create 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.209
 luminous interactions thanks to 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.619
 normal to pass 

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:39.719
 the fog was generated in maya 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:41.669
 this one can be easy to calculate 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.989
 we created a place gizmodo that me 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.789
 allowed to generate effects 

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.210
 atmospheric using phase 2 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.100
 Oct 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.569
 we have also developed a 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.729
 finishing and post disguise 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.400
 processing which among other things improve the 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.599
 rendering areas 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.740
 this project was an opportunity for us to 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.750
 go through all the stages of 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.199
 production ranging from pre-production to 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.199
 finishes 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.349
 we hope you will appreciate 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.349
 the movie as much as we alain remy
