00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
but we obviously knew it was going to be

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.279 
Alan said that was a crucial change but
at<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.009> time<00:02:07.280> he's<00:02:07.550> just<00:02:07.729> in<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.300> for<00:02:09.110> me<00:02:09.259> I

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
at the time he's just in it and for me I

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.250 
at the time he's just in it and for me I
focused<00:02:09.860> on<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.039> performance<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:12.110> was

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
focused on the performance and it was

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.780 
focused on the performance and it was
just<00:02:12.470> studying<00:02:12.770> my<00:02:12.890> celebration<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.550> think

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
that I can't even remember what went

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.930 
that I can't even remember what went
through<00:02:15.620> my<00:02:15.770> mind<00:02:15.860> at<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.250> moment<00:02:16.280> just<00:02:16.700> that

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940
