00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Now I have to be prepared in advance and was 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.400
 sample 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.410
 this is a feathered french i want to show 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.260
 how to make very beautiful dunes you 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.280
 sand a smooth transition from one color to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.060
 another one for that i will take not quite 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.859
 thin enough thick brush and 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:25.890
 I'll start drawing 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:33.710
 yourself dark material so dark 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:38.430
 turquoise color clear draw 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.840
 big enough items for that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:50.570
 so that when lay down velvet sand 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:52.890
 it was more beautiful this is one part 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 now we have to move smoothly over 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.960
 light for this, I start a little bit 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 on the dark element that lies itself 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.170
 on top 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.070
 that is, we will smoothly move to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.840
 dark to light 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.840
 now the light element has gone 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.620
 further goes even brighter that is, we 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.729
 drew half dark and on 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.600
 Drew more light one 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.600
 enters another 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.540
 we must go as far as possible 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.620
 smoother because borat on sand 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.340
 absolutely transparent if you have 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.019
 clear lines between flowers through velvet 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.019
 and bitch you too will be noticeable 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.860
 so now we discover rich in sand 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.780
 and very very thick sprinkle completely 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:17.220
 the whole picture falls asleep completely 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:21.299
 the whole picture so that no coverage 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.370
 left without sand throw off the remnants 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.330
 not the right jar like this we see 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.199
 I will dry 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.820
 2 minutes when the thought of dried out we take 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:36.210
 brush and brush off the remnants of sand 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.699
 carefully nail surface here 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.250
 it turned out like this 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:44.880
 colorful pattern as if covered 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:50.430
 hoarfrost look at this option can 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:57.240
 be this option can be here 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:59.340
 this option may also be all I want 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.979
 I'll show you how beautiful it turns out 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.080
 draw you this very petal mess 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:10.470
 very thin now i will try to find 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.330
 sample and so here you can very subtly 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.000
 draw too with the help of velvet 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.090
 sand that is the answer is very first 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.260
 thin apply gel paint either 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:27.229
 color gel and fall asleep velvety 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.440
 by sand 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.070
 such here 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.070
 option
