00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
of a curve at the end of the glass here

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.510

and<00:00:42.719> normal<00:00:43.620> screen<00:00:43.739> protectors<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.340> just

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and normal screen protectors are just

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.709 
and normal screen protectors are just
not<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> go<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> edge

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
not going to go all the way to the edge

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.459 
not going to go all the way to the edge
because<00:00:45.989> you're<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.379> an

interesting<00:00:46.710> bubbling<00:00:47.250> effect<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.850> dirt

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
interesting bubbling effect and dirt

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.479 
interesting bubbling effect and dirt
gets<00:00:48.180> underneath<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.410> causes<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.829> disaster

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
gets underneath and it causes a disaster

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
you can absorb the water as it comes out

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.970 
you can absorb the water as it comes out
the<00:03:22.080> sides<00:03:22.290> because<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.590> don't<00:03:22.770> want<00:03:22.890> it

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the sides because you don't want it

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.710 
the sides because you don't want it
seeping<00:03:23.280> down<00:03:23.340> into<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.850> cracks<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.480> having

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
on that type of circumstance i recommend

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.640

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
along the bottom there that's a rainbow

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.250

you go up the screen you can see that as

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.270 
you go up the screen you can see that as
well<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.419> little<00:04:47.290> bit<00:04:47.440> when<00:04:47.620> there's<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.070> light

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
well a little bit when there's a light

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.100 
well a little bit when there's a light
that's<00:04:48.490> reflecting<00:04:48.940> off<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.360> but<00:04:49.990> if

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
that's reflecting off of that but if

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.990 
that's reflecting off of that but if
you're<00:04:50.230> watching<00:04:50.919> a<00:04:51.010> movie<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:51.550> can<00:04:51.730> see

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
you're watching a movie you can see

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.580 
you're watching a movie you can see
sometimes<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.720> light<00:04:52.870> coming<00:04:53.200> through<00:04:53.230> that

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
sometimes the light coming through that

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.710 
sometimes the light coming through that
and<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:53.800> refracts<00:04:54.280> strangely<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.419> creates

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
and it refracts strangely and it creates

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.629 
and it refracts strangely and it creates
kind<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:55.960> pixel<00:04:56.290> art<00:04:56.380> effects<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.340> really

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
kind of pixel art effects so I really

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.560 
kind of pixel art effects so I really
hope<00:04:57.669> thats<00:04:58.150> vegan<00:04:58.540> is<00:04:58.780> able<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.229> have<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.729> more

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
hope thats vegan is able to have a more

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.300 
hope thats vegan is able to have a more
constant<00:05:01.930> quality<00:05:02.229> control<00:05:02.770> with<00:05:03.010> this<00:05:03.130> type

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
constant quality control with this type

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.469 
constant quality control with this type
of<00:05:03.340> screen<00:05:03.610> protector<00:05:04.000> because<00:05:04.120> it's<00:05:04.419> a

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
of screen protector because it's a

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.980 
of screen protector because it's a
little<00:05:04.690> bit<00:05:04.810> unfortunate<00:05:05.550> for<00:05:06.550> that<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:07.270> be

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
little bit unfortunate for that to be

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.270 
little bit unfortunate for that to be
occurring<00:05:08.470> with<00:05:08.650> these<00:05:08.800> guys<00:05:08.950> especially

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
occurring with these guys especially

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.310 
occurring with these guys especially
because<00:05:09.760> these<00:05:09.880> are<00:05:10.060> so<00:05:10.360> clear<00:05:10.840> I've<00:05:11.080> had

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
because these are so clear I've had

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.000 
because these are so clear I've had
several<00:05:12.100> different<00:05:12.520> types<00:05:12.729> of<00:05:13.060> these<00:05:14.010> wet

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
several different types of these wet

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.640 
several different types of these wet
screen<00:05:15.310> protectors<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:16.050> I've<00:05:17.050> seen<00:05:17.350> a<00:05:17.410> lot<00:05:17.500> of

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
screen protectors and I've seen a lot of

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.070 
screen protectors and I've seen a lot of
them<00:05:17.889> not<00:05:18.340> be<00:05:18.610> very<00:05:19.030> clear<00:05:19.419> some<00:05:19.780> of<00:05:19.810> our

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
cloudy but this one is really really

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.469 
cloudy but this one is really really
clear<00:05:23.830> that's<00:05:24.100> what<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.280> read<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:25.270> I'm<00:05:25.360> a<00:05:25.389> little

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
clear that's what I read so I'm a little

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.530 
clear that's what I read so I'm a little
bit<00:05:25.720> sad<00:05:26.229> that<00:05:26.260> it<00:05:26.620> has<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.250> defects<00:05:28.210> in<00:05:28.419> it

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
bit sad that it has the defects in it

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.480 
bit sad that it has the defects in it

these also is that the urethane has a

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.420 
these also is that the urethane has a
type<00:06:24.130> of<00:06:24.160> resiliency<00:06:25.030> but<00:06:25.889> if<00:06:26.889> you<00:06:27.100> guys<00:06:27.280> are

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430
