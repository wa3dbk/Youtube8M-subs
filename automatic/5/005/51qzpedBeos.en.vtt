00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.910
 what a dreadful noise I believe 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.469
 my car is broken 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.309
 What can it be? I think I have to 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.309
 you drive the workshop 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.340
 the noise we just heard 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.189
 comes from a joke with the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.820
 Designation exhaust ice or exhaust 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.449
 heuler 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.130
 this one costs a slim 1 eur 39 plus 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.240
 Shipping costs and you can put it on 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.220
 Order Amazon 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.869
 the link to the product break in 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.060
 text box under the video and now 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.550
 I introduce you to the article and 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:42.820
 we have this exhaust euler for 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.820
 packaging out of the 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:55.129
 simply looked so looked 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.670
 times on the sharp edges are there me 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.980
 nothing sharp turn as well, not only 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.460
 the processing is actually quite 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.320
 okay now we have without him just stop 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.780
 still try 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.009
 Unfortunately, with a Fiat 500, too 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.780
 no chance to attach the howler 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.450
 at the b-class of my neighbor's 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.439
 house goes his skin because of the exclamation 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.270
 just way too big 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.060
 this is my exhaust so i have it here 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.100
 such a blind and down there is the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.360
 Exhaust 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.520
 it can not get stuck though 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.640
 do not put it over it means it flies 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.439
 sometime away or 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.700
 christoph out now I can 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.430
 Of course, I'll try that one 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.979
 So a little bit of them can be here 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.920
 can continue and then back there 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:54.469
 so about it somehow yes because of the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.119
 scooter does not fit over the exhaust 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.119
 I'll put it in now 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.660
 a little further apart 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.220
 it just did not seem to be that clean here 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.380
 far from war, no more out there 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.090
 that still fits because the chamber can do it 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.090
 reach out a bit 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.340
 now that's exactly what it's doing in that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.340
 car times 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.380
 So I put it in here now 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.690
 these are now so we then also 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.120
 cars of the sun dazzle smoke is her 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:58.750
 with me now a bit gas 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.750
 so that you hear the sound then 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:32.470
 so awesome recently and if you are 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.730
 know where the noise r is then 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.730
 You first choose in the car 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.729
 So who his friends were small 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.160
 horse wants to play 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.620
 he should stand her fancier calm 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.919
 Let's see, it does not cost much money 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.750
 a nice joke the link to 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.949
 Product position text video view 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.229
 it comes right out 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.270
 he is still a tip of the festival always 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.340
 Pay attention when he has used it 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.440
 the ride on the statements then it can 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.479
 happen that loses with him and that 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.349
 following cars will be confirmed and it 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.820
 comes to the accident 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:57.449
 so keep a set 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.340
 the other one wonders what is my car 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.320
 bus or you can not stay on while he is 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.590
 with his car agrees with then searched 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.030
 he 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.830
 and then you can say just for a moment 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.780
 maybe an exhaust therefore 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.160
 the best idea actually instead of with 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.110
 the piers great through the area 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.460
 to drive and he loses now yes 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.000
 I 'm out again and then until the 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.000
 next video
