00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
we also have a high in the low gain on

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.740 
we also have a high in the low gain on
the<00:02:28.569> Mesa<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.660> low<00:02:31.840> gain

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:55.040 

of<00:02:37.320> amid<00:02:37.740> control<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:41.550> cut<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.970> mids

let's<00:02:56.050> go<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.350> Mesa<00:02:56.590> yeah<00:02:57.160> actually<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
let's go to the Mesa yeah actually the

all<00:03:25.510> right<00:03:25.690> let's<00:03:26.230> go<00:03:26.440> back<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.920> Mesa<00:03:31.170> it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
all right let's go back to the Mesa it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.890 
all right let's go back to the Mesa it
gets<00:03:32.380> kind<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.740> dark<00:03:33.070> because<00:03:33.580> of<00:03:33.610> the
