00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.765
 Hi! My name is Kevin! 

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.943
 I'm special like a snowflake. 

00:00:08.944 --> 00:00:12.229
 I work at Blizzard Entertainment, a great place for snowflakes. 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.647
 We create games in Blizzard. 

00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:16.580
 Otherwise: We are hoping on this point. 

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:21.900
 Creating games is great, but it's hard work. 

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.841
 You probably think, "Hard? Seriously?". 

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:27.503
 Very heavy! 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.600
 So you want to create games? 

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.298
 We want to help you! 

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.498
 So, 

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:36.051
 that we are ready to give you something from yourself, 

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:37.284
 absolutely free. 

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:40.399
 We've been doing it for a long time ... 

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:44.000
 from Warcraft 1, 2 and 3 after StarCraft 1 and 2. 

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.258
 For some it's modding tools. 

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.161
 For us, this is the Definitory Genre: Potential Wizards. 

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:52.999
 In a nutshell: Tools Changing the Face of the Game Industry. 

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:54.999
 Let us be clear: 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.462
 these are not some minor tools. 

00:00:57.463 --> 00:01:01.300
 We use these tools to create our games. 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.708
 All you need is a beautiful snowflake that will handle them. 

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.000
 You are beautiful, be confident too! 

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:09.143
 (Meanwhile...) 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:11.542
 Here's our editor. 

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:19.484
 Did you know that it contains a total of 14 513 models and 22,758 textures, 

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:22.229
 which are waiting to be used in your masterpieces? 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.543
 You know that thanks to him 

00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:27.843
 many people will start their careers 

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:29.380
 in game companies? 

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:33.155
 You know that his and your potential 

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:35.585
 has not been fathomed yet? 

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:38.243
 Someone once invented a pixel thanks to it. 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.181
 Now the editor is yours. 

00:01:40.182 --> 00:01:43.143
 Blizzard has just shared the Games Room for free. 

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:45.802
 Now your works can consume 

00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:49.690
 not only millions of players who bought our games and are their fans, 

00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:52.118
 but literally everyone you can convince 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.497
 to get interested in your work ... 

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:56.498
 And it's completely free! 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:59.643
 Not only I am unique like a snowflake. 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.180
 You too. 

00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:03.821
 You deserve to appreciate you, 

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:06.843
 and your games deserve to be played. 

00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:08.265
 Create games. 

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.181
 It's hard work. But you can do it. 

00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:11.942
 You have everything necessary!
