00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.620
 and Tabasco's talent not only stands out 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.090
 in music and singing the students 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.130
 they look for new forms of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.139
 expression in art one of them in the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.700
 present are the short films that go 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.700
 monopolizing the attention of young people 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 d 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.840
 we start as well I repeat you playing 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.850
 but little by little we started to take it in 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.170
 serious then we started inviting 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.720
 people who were interested in the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.850
 cinema we saw that a lot of people also 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.339
 was adding and then it was done 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.260
 what was a casting of that casting was 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.180
 the template that we have 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.010
 right now during the second festival 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.020
 short film short films 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.730
 the attendees admired the creativity 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.860
 that young communication students 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.640
 hands in a script and materialized with 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.640
 your video cameras 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.630
 this is not 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.570
 good last 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.140
 from petare after a classic so 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.140
 like all of you 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.600
 one 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.600
 We have made around 45 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.479
 short films but until now 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.820
 it's like that transition between starting 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.469
 playing and already take it seriously because 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 we obviously start the expectation of 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.030
 what could happen but now and the event 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.399
 It is well established and therefore expect 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.350
 that the short film in the short film 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.670
 is reflected all this this festival 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.960
 it emerged as part of a subject 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.119
 university that took them to a 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.590
 second version of the short film of 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.329
 karma productions consequences 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.830
 creatives exposed problems 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.369
 social issues such as sex, drugs and 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.369
 alcohol in young people 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.840
 he also has the intent 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.840
 because I have a little 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.659
 and come with the doctor 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 this group of talented actors 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.380
 producers and technical staff did with 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.119
 six members are now two of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.520
 heads that think best to perform 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.860
 quality short films read a lot the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.250
 pay attention to that in fact cinema 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.530
 I have future plans to study cinema but 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.720
 right now it is an opportunity that 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.510
 I have to be able to unwrap in what 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.310
 are the principles of cinema in which 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.170
 are the short films to follow 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.340
 exploiting creativity they already prepare 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.050
 a series that will be transmitted by 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.860
 Internet and to get up and running in the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.860
 next months 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.459
 proof that students can 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.549
