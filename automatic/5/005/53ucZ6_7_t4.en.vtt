00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.870 

we<00:00:04.290> have<00:00:04.470> lines<00:00:04.740> drawing<00:00:05.069> on<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.370> screen<00:00:05.670> now

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:05.880 
we have lines drawing on the screen now

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.040 
we have lines drawing on the screen now
the<00:00:06.330> next<00:00:06.660> step

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.050 
the next step

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.350 
the next step
learn<00:00:07.350> how<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.560> draw<00:00:07.830> rectangles<00:00:08.730> where<00:00:09.210> will

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
learn how to draw rectangles where will

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.150 
learn how to draw rectangles where will
the<00:00:09.450> code<00:00:09.660> go<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.930> draw<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.230> rectangles<00:00:10.889> let's

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
the code go to draw the rectangles let's

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.310 
the code go to draw the rectangles let's
take<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> look<00:00:11.520> what<00:00:11.700> we've<00:00:11.910> got<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.330> far<00:00:12.360> right

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
take a look what we've got so far right

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.919 
take a look what we've got so far right
here<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:14.370> fill<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> screen<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:15.000> white<00:00:15.389> we

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
here we fill the screen with white we

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.690 
here we fill the screen with white we
don't<00:00:16.170> want<00:00:16.290> to<00:00:16.349> draw<00:00:16.529> our<00:00:16.680> rectangles<00:00:17.220> before

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
don't want to draw our rectangles before

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.760 
don't want to draw our rectangles before
this<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.810> if<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.050> drop<00:00:19.259> before<00:00:19.649> it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
this because if we drop before it

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.749 
this because if we drop before it
they'll<00:00:20.009> just<00:00:20.040> overwrite<00:00:20.700> it<00:00:20.849> with<00:00:20.880> white

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
they'll just overwrite it with white

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.519 
they'll just overwrite it with white
here<00:00:23.759> we<00:00:24.060> draw<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.329> lines<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.020> we've<00:00:25.169> got<00:00:25.349> on

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
here we draw the lines that we've got on

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.290 
here we draw the lines that we've got on
the<00:00:25.649> screen<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.820> draw<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> rectangle

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the screen if I draw the rectangle

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.190 
the screen if I draw the rectangle
between<00:00:28.200> right<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.509> rectangle<00:00:31.050> will

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
between right here the rectangle will

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.900 
between right here the rectangle will
appear<00:00:31.439> underneath<00:00:31.860> the<00:00:32.220> lines<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:32.759> they

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
appear underneath the lines if they

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.580 
appear underneath the lines if they
happen<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> draw<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.600> top<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.050> each<00:00:34.170> other

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
happen to draw on top of each other

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.690 
happen to draw on top of each other
or<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.360> draw<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> rectangle<00:00:37.040> here<00:00:38.040> then<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
or if I draw the rectangle here then the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.910 
or if I draw the rectangle here then the
rectangle<00:00:38.850> would<00:00:39.330> appear<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.750> top<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
rectangle would appear on top of the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.970 
rectangle would appear on top of the
lines<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> order<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.900> things<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.380> drawn<00:00:43.680> as

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
lines the order that things are drawn as

appear<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.400> top<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.180> common<00:00:48.930> mistake<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.530> put

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
appear on top a common mistake is to put

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
appear on top a common mistake is to put
the<00:00:49.800> drawing<00:00:50.100> right<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.490> after<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.390> flip<00:00:51.750> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the drawing right here after the flip I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
the drawing right here after the flip I
don't<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.950> that<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.520> draw

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
don't want to do that because if I draw

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
don't want to do that because if I draw
anything<00:00:53.970> after<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.600> flip<00:00:54.810> I'm<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.350> gonna

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
anything after the flip I'm not gonna

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.430 
anything after the flip I'm not gonna
see<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.950> I<00:00:56.250> want<00:00:56.880> to<00:00:57.000> make<00:00:57.090> sure<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.960> put

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
see it I want to make sure that I put

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.150 
see it I want to make sure that I put
the<00:00:58.500> drawing<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.820> rectangle<00:01:00.739> right<00:01:01.739> here

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the drawing for the rectangle right here

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.770 
the drawing for the rectangle right here
I<00:01:02.280> want<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> appear<00:01:02.700> on<00:01:03.060> top<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.540> lines

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I want it to appear on top of the lines

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.690 
I want it to appear on top of the lines
although<00:01:04.439> I'll<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.979> try<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
although I'll really try to get a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.390 
although I'll really try to get a
different<00:01:06.180> place<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> rectangles<00:01:07.400> but

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
different place for the rectangles but

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
different place for the rectangles but
before<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> flip<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.330> definitely<00:01:09.780> after<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
before the flip and definitely after the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.240 
before the flip and definitely after the
screen<00:01:10.560> clears<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.740> command<00:01:17.010> to<00:01:17.100> draw<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
screen clears the command to draw a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.750 
screen clears the command to draw a
rectangle<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:18.090> pygame<00:01:18.930> dot<00:01:19.470> draw<00:01:19.830> very

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
rectangle is pygame dot draw very

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.340 
rectangle is pygame dot draw very
similar<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.299> what<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.870> with<00:01:22.080> line

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
similar to what we just had with line

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.930 
similar to what we just had with line
but<00:01:22.650> instead<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.979> line<00:01:23.220> we're<00:01:23.549> gonna<00:01:23.670> have

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
but instead of line we're gonna have

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.520 
but instead of line we're gonna have
rekt<00:01:25.280> short<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.490> rectangle<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.290> then<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.380> need

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
rekt short for rectangle and then I need

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830 
rekt short for rectangle and then I need
to<00:01:28.560> tell<00:01:28.830> it<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.100> screen<00:01:29.610> I'm<00:01:29.880> drawing<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.600> I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to tell it what screen I'm drawing on I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660 
to tell it what screen I'm drawing on I
need<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> tell<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.770> color<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.490> case

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
need to tell it the color in this case

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.830 
need to tell it the color in this case
I'm<00:01:32.850> gonna<00:01:32.940> pick<00:01:33.150> black<00:01:35.180> then<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.390> need<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> list

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
I'm gonna pick black then I need a list

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.859 
I'm gonna pick black then I need a list
of<00:01:37.080> four<00:01:37.590> numbers<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:39.150> first<00:01:39.450> two<00:01:39.690> numbers

of four numbers the first two numbers

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.730 
of four numbers the first two numbers
will<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.799> XY<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.909> where<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.510> top<00:01:42.960> left<00:01:43.440> of

want that line to be around the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.110 
want that line to be around the
rectangle<00:02:13.529> let's<00:02:13.919> go<00:02:14.099> ahead<00:02:14.189> and<00:02:14.370> run<00:02:14.519> this

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.390 

there's<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.240> rectangle<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.170> our<00:02:19.470> screen<00:02:19.830> let's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
there's a rectangle on our screen let's

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220 
there's a rectangle on our screen let's
move<00:02:20.940> these<00:02:21.120> numbers<00:02:21.480> around<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.870> little<00:02:21.990> bit

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
move these numbers around a little bit

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.550 
move these numbers around a little bit
and<00:02:22.490> see<00:02:23.490> how<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.730> changes<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.690> rectangle

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and see how that changes the rectangle

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.880 
and see how that changes the rectangle
if<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.190> take<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.910> out<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.870> if<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.470> were<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.680> set

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
if I take this out or if I were to set

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.020 
if I take this out or if I were to set
it<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.069> zero<00:02:29.580> how<00:02:29.940> does<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.209> change<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.600> code

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
it to zero how does that change the code

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.540 
it to zero how does that change the code
now<00:02:33.030> I've<00:02:33.390> got<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.930> solid<00:02:34.290> rectangle<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.340> note

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
now I've got a solid rectangle and note

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.699 
now I've got a solid rectangle and note
that<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:35.790> appearing<00:02:36.090> ahead<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.500> lies

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
that it's appearing ahead of the lies

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.770 
that it's appearing ahead of the lies
are<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.130> top<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.550> lines<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.510> were<00:02:39.630> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
are on top of the lines if I were to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.590 
are on top of the lines if I were to
make<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.800> rectangle<00:02:41.520> drawn<00:02:41.820> before<00:02:42.209> that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
make this rectangle drawn before that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600 
make this rectangle drawn before that
for<00:02:42.870> loop<00:02:43.020> then<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.410> would<00:02:43.530> appear<00:02:43.610> underneath

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
for loop then it would appear underneath

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.290 
for loop then it would appear underneath
them<00:02:44.970> lines<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.130> make<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.550> five<00:02:47.970> I'm

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
them lines if I make this a five I'm

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.690 
them lines if I make this a five I'm
gonna<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.630> thicker<00:02:48.870> rectangle<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.800> if<00:02:50.580> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
gonna have a thicker rectangle and if I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.140 
gonna have a thicker rectangle and if I
make<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.709> 150<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:53.520> should<00:02:53.820> move<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
make this a 150 it should move the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.340 
make this a 150 it should move the
tricked<00:02:54.480> angle<00:02:54.900> over<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.680> left<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.230> do

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
tricked angle over to the left so I do

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.960 
tricked angle over to the left so I do
have<00:03:01.530> thicker<00:03:01.769> lines<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.670> moves<00:03:02.880> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
have thicker lines and it moves the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.720 
have thicker lines and it moves the
rectangle<00:03:03.630> over<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> left<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.800> don't

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
rectangle over to the left I don't

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.949 
rectangle over to the left I don't
particularly<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.540> but<00:03:06.690> you'll<00:03:06.780> note

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
particularly like it but you'll note

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.100 
particularly like it but you'll note
that<00:03:06.989> pygame<00:03:07.470> makes<00:03:08.250> thick<00:03:08.790> lines<00:03:09.570> around<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
that pygame makes thick lines around the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.199 
that pygame makes thick lines around the
rectangle<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.860> my<00:03:11.100> opinion<00:03:11.610> just<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.910> little

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
rectangle in my opinion just a little

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.140 
rectangle in my opinion just a little
bit<00:03:12.390> buggy<00:03:12.780> because<00:03:13.500> you've<00:03:13.950> got<00:03:14.250> just<00:03:14.910> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
bit buggy because you've got just a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.470 
bit buggy because you've got just a
little<00:03:15.630> bit<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.080> indent<00:03:17.010> here<00:03:17.130> on<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.850> corners

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
little bit of indent here on the corners

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.520 
little bit of indent here on the corners
and<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:21.660> short<00:03:21.840> that's<00:03:22.049> how<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.290> draw<00:03:22.500> a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and in short that's how you draw a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.620 
and in short that's how you draw a
rectangle<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.730> want<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.970> draw<00:03:24.120> any<00:03:24.299> lips

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
rectangle if you want to draw any lips

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.080 
rectangle if you want to draw any lips
it<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.930> really<00:03:25.590> similar<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.160> drawing<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
it is really similar to drawing a

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.199 
it is really similar to drawing a
rectangle<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:29.010> fact<00:03:29.340> I'm<00:03:29.519> just<00:03:29.579> going<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.000> take

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
rectangle in fact I'm just going to take

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.819 
rectangle in fact I'm just going to take
this<00:03:30.480> rectangle<00:03:30.810> command<00:03:31.320> copy<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:33.829> paste

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
this rectangle command copy it and paste

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.150 
this rectangle command copy it and paste
it<00:03:35.040> right<00:03:35.100> below<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.470> instead<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.620> rect<00:03:37.890> I'm

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
it right below and instead of rect I'm

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.900 
it right below and instead of rect I'm
going<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.700> put<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.120> ellipse<00:03:40.430> now<00:03:41.430> when<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.730> run

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
going to put in ellipse now when I run

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.430 
going to put in ellipse now when I run
the<00:03:42.030> program<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.660> see<00:03:42.870> how<00:03:43.019> an<00:03:43.140> ellipse

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
the program you can see how an ellipse

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.140 
the program you can see how an ellipse
is<00:03:43.650> drawn<00:03:46.459> when<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.549> think<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.880> how<00:03:48.000> an

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
save it and run my program you can't see

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
save it and run my program you can't see

the rectangle because I'm no longer
drawing<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.980> but<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.550> point<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.060> I

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210

specified for starting the ellipse let

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.440 
specified for starting the ellipse let
me<00:04:57.130> move<00:04:57.280> this<00:04:57.430> up<00:04:57.610> here<00:04:57.910> is<00:05:01.050> one<00:05:02.050> fifty<00:05:03.450> fifty
