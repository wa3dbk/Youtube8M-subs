to take a look at it the new broken six

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.910 
to take a look at it the new broken six
system<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.610> new<00:00:33.700> physics<00:00:34.180> checking<00:00:34.990> what

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
system the new physics checking what

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.619 
system the new physics checking what
does<00:00:36.010> everybody<00:00:36.219> thought<00:00:36.430> so<00:00:36.610> far<00:00:36.820> yeah<00:00:37.540> you

does everybody thought so far yeah you
know<00:00:37.719> what<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.870> reactions<00:00:38.200> been<00:00:38.350> really

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
know what the reactions been really

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.260 
know what the reactions been really
really<00:00:38.920> good<00:00:39.040> you<00:00:39.460> know<00:00:39.489> we<00:00:39.640> talked<00:00:39.850> about<00:00:39.879> all

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
really good you know we talked about all

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.430 
really good you know we talked about all
the<00:00:40.300> new<00:00:40.450> features<00:00:40.629> put<00:00:40.989> in<00:00:41.050> each<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.290> every

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
the new features put in each and every

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.799 
the new features put in each and every
year<00:00:41.649> but<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.760> real<00:00:42.879> pro<00:00:43.059> proof<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.690> when

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
year but the real pro proof is when

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.119 
year but the real pro proof is when
people<00:00:43.930> get<00:00:44.140> their<00:00:44.289> hands<00:00:44.469> on<00:00:44.649> and<00:00:44.829> they<00:00:44.920> play

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
people get their hands on and they play

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.740 
people get their hands on and they play
it<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:45.670> know<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:45.789> tell<00:00:45.940> people<00:00:46.030> stand<00:00:46.629> in<00:00:46.660> the

surprise this was you know we put the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.229 
surprise this was you know we put the
physics<00:00:54.309> in<00:00:54.460> we<00:00:54.670> knew<00:00:54.760> was<00:00:54.879> gonna<00:00:54.940> make<00:00:55.149> the

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
physics in we knew was gonna make the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.910 
physics in we knew was gonna make the
game<00:00:55.359> look<00:00:55.390> different<00:00:55.960> play<00:00:56.170> different<00:00:56.559> but

even more since then the checking system

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.230 
even more since then the checking system
is<00:01:27.040> just<00:01:27.190> amazing<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.580> really<00:01:27.730> do<00:01:28.000> have<00:01:28.030> to

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.920 
give people the tools to create all
these<00:02:51.220> moments<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:51.730> if<00:02:52.240> something<00:02:52.480> happens<00:02:52.840> in

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
these moments so if something happens in

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.060 
these moments so if something happens in
the<00:02:52.990> sport<00:02:53.290> let's<00:02:53.500> give<00:02:53.650> them<00:02:53.740> people<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
the sport let's give them people the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.500 
the sport let's give them people the
tools<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.460> make<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.790> stuff<00:02:54.940> happen<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.420> then

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
tools to make that stuff happen and then

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.150 
tools to make that stuff happen and then
you<00:02:55.720> use<00:02:55.930> real-world<00:02:56.140> physics<00:02:56.440> just<00:02:56.800> use<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
you use real-world physics just use the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
you use real-world physics just use the
real<00:02:57.340> world<00:02:57.610> won't<00:02:57.760> happen<00:02:57.910> in<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.090> real

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
real world won't happen in the real

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.550 
real world won't happen in the real
world<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.630> just<00:02:58.990> see<00:02:59.080> what<00:02:59.200> happens<00:02:59.230> and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
world and just see what happens and

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.630 
world and just see what happens and
that's<00:02:59.650> what<00:02:59.830> people<00:03:00.040> want<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.310> that's<00:03:00.490> where

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
that's what people want and that's where

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.830 
that's what people want and that's where
you<00:03:00.670> know<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:00.940> think<00:03:01.090> all<00:03:01.270> sports<00:03:01.540> teams<00:03:01.720> are

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
you know I think all sports teams are

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.480 
you know I think all sports teams are
gonna<00:03:01.900> go<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.860> look<00:03:03.010> back<00:03:03.160> in<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.370> day

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
gonna go to you look back in the day

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
bench no we want to use you know we want

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.870 
bench no we want to use you know we want
to<00:03:11.290> be<00:03:11.350> dynamically<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.100> true<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.430> real<00:03:12.610> world

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880
