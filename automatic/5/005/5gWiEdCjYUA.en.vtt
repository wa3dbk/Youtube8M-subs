00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
what windows belong to which application

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.350 
what windows belong to which application
the<00:01:34.299> end<00:01:34.509> we<00:01:34.689> want<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.409> look<00:01:35.469> like<00:01:35.680> for<00:01:35.829> now<00:01:35.920> and

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.880 
will come back but say I have multiple
windows<00:03:12.790> open<00:03:13.270> then<00:03:13.480> they'd<00:03:14.050> each<00:03:14.320> minimize

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
windows open then they'd each minimize

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.530 
windows open then they'd each minimize
separately<00:03:15.490> over<00:03:15.760> here<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.210> could<00:03:16.330> build

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
separately over here so you could build

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.810 
separately over here so you could build
up<00:03:16.750> quite<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.110> few<00:03:17.470> windows<00:03:17.650> here<00:03:18.010> which<00:03:18.160> which

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
up quite a few windows here which which

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.340 
up quite a few windows here which which
is<00:03:18.880> why<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.090> don't<00:03:19.480> like<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.870> because<00:03:19.960> i<00:03:20.110> often

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
is why I don't like it because i often

use minimize was just building up so you

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.280 
use minimize was just building up so you
