00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.550
 you know the saying if it's too much 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.770
 beautiful to be true is that it's 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.440
 surely the case of words loaded with meaning 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.260
 no but if we were doing an experiment 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.789
 that goes against people's mistrust 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.509
 would it prevent them from taking advantage of a 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.900
 win-win situation 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.189
 that's what we're going to discover for 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.810
 this new experience we 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.380
 install a sentry box in a place 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.390
 public 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.400
 we will offer free money 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.419
 to passers-by they can use 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.280
 as much as he wishes 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.920
 we hide cameras everywhere 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.980

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.550

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.900

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.810

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.440

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.200
