00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
seeing the 3d pop out at you like at the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.330 
seeing the 3d pop out at you like at the
imax<00:00:51.210> theater<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> depth<00:00:53.160> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
imax theater you see a lot of depth of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
imax theater you see a lot of depth of
the<00:00:53.610> photo<00:00:53.850> ok<00:00:54.510> ok<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.440> see

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the photo ok ok and then what you see

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.150 
the photo ok ok and then what you see
then<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> background<00:00:58.160> sync

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
then is you see like the background sync

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.610 
then is you see like the background sync
back<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.600> person<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.410> see

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
back and and the person that you see

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.100 
back and and the person that you see
standing<00:01:01.829> there's<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:03.030> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.600> pop<00:01:03.780> for

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
standing there's now kind of pop for

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710 
standing there's now kind of pop for
words<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.500> make<00:01:04.650> sense<00:01:04.860> ok<00:01:05.309> yeah<00:01:05.549> ok<00:01:06.420> let's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
words that make sense ok yeah ok let's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.120 
words that make sense ok yeah ok let's
see<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.820> photo<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:10.100> or<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
see if we can see a photo in here or a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.500 
see if we can see a photo in here or a
video

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:31.550 

this<00:01:16.170> may<00:01:16.440> or<00:01:16.650> may<00:01:16.800> not<00:01:16.830> come<00:01:17.310> through

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.590 

so<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.979> can<00:01:33.189> definitely<00:01:33.460> see<00:01:33.909> right<00:01:34.420> here

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
so you can definitely see right here

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.660 
so you can definitely see right here
while<00:01:34.780> you're<00:01:34.929> looking<00:01:35.229> at<00:01:35.350> my<00:01:35.770> screen<00:01:36.069> you

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
a very crystal clear picture and in a in

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.339 
a very crystal clear picture and in a in
a<00:01:57.130> glasses-free<00:01:57.819> 3d<00:01:58.799> technology<00:02:00.869> awesome<00:02:01.869> not

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
a glasses-free 3d technology awesome not

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.499 
a glasses-free 3d technology awesome not
great<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:03.280> one<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.849> other<00:02:03.969> great<00:02:04.179> things

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
great so one of the other great things

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.289 
great so one of the other great things
is<00:02:04.689> that<00:02:04.719> it's<00:02:05.020> using<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.770> dual<00:02:06.369> core<00:02:06.700> dual

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
is that it's using a dual core dual

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.109 
is that it's using a dual core dual
channel<00:02:07.659> dual<00:02:07.989> memory<00:02:08.349> processors<00:02:09.129> which

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
channel dual memory processors which

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.940 
channel dual memory processors which
then<00:02:10.360> allows<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:10.959> move<00:02:11.110> very<00:02:11.530> very<00:02:11.709> quickly

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
then allows it to move very very quickly

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.729 
then allows it to move very very quickly
to<00:02:12.310> scroll<00:02:13.090> through<00:02:13.150> your<00:02:13.360> applications<00:02:14.200> to

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
to scroll through your applications to

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.259 
to scroll through your applications to
go<00:02:14.890> into<00:02:15.069> your<00:02:15.250> phone<00:02:15.519> book<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.879> access<00:02:16.030> your

go into your phone book and access your

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
contacts things like that now since

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.490
