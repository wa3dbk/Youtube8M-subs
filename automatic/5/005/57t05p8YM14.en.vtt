00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello friends of that vance that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.150
 As you are today, I wanted to show you a 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.310
 game or an application something special 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.080
 many of you will have seen what 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.240
 long of my videos this rubik's cube 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.189
 that personally accompanies me already during 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.610
 more than five years and you will always have 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.199
 seen without actually ordering the slam 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.850
 The truth is that I've never managed to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.410
 put together a Rubik's cube and I have not put 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.279
 I did not want to get into 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.260
 tutorials because good if we get to 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.420
 look on the internet although there is no 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.800
 an exact formula because in the end and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.200
 it is an enigma until 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
 depends a lot on the afternoon of the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.739
 position where the cubes fall 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.879
 poetry and strategies to face 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.950
 and do it in about 45 minutes the record 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.690
 is I think it was in five with six 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.390
 seconds that is a real asshole and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.300
 good today I wanted to present you the best 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.250
 Android application to be able to arm 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 a rubik's cube or to enjoy 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.259
 this game if we do not have forgiveness a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.299
 physical rubik cube that good 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.800
 to be able to play with him 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.110
 his name is x 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.030
 ruby as good in spanish rubik's cube 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.730
 and we see how I'm installing it is a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.530
 application that occupies very very little 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.620
 we see how the information appears 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.020
 how good is 16 megabytes is 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.060
 understandable but good depending on 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.670
 other video games because it occupies little 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.610
 taking into account what it is if the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.590
 we open so the cube appears 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.300
 fully armed and the truth is that it is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.660
 a pity now when we give him here to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.120
 that starts to disarm because that's how it is 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.620
 how we should stay the truth is that 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.850
 it is an application that is very very very 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.050
 intuitive that we're going to have to have 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.110
 careful because whenever we want 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.450
 move this cube in 3-d we're going to have to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.000
 click from outside so I do not know 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.890
 untwist everything and good we go as soon as 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.400
 let's take and let's do this and start the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.560
 application to crumble what is that 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.570
 order here we see a clock in the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.610
 that we are going to show us the time 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.470
 total that we take to assemble it for 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.929
 arm it we will not have more to have to 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.880
 go doing it like it's obvious and good 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.010
 so to go see the different layers 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.560
 as you will see then the truth is that 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.209
 it's practically very similar to playing in 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.050
 physical if we have what is this 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.870
 3d perspective we can also catch and 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.410
 give the movement backwards or return 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.770
 to catch and get disordered for good 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.420
 then start competing again in this 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.030
 clock if we leave it in the background 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.400
 because he will continue telling us the time 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.810
 sorry until we reopen the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.030
 application therefore we will be able to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.220
 have a total I do not know if it will reach the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.760
 years to years and obviously not but if 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.050
 to the total hours that 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.390
 Well, I like it, but I'm going to give it 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.150
 not because if it's not going to take me to the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.250
 google play and we are doing the video 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.230
 and as I tell you, here we can even 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.200
 catch and see 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.120
 a ranking of the people who have least 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.530
 slow to do it 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.959
 personally it is a challenge to see as soon as 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.370
 you are able to do it if you like what 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.110
 what is this rubik cube and well 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.700
 I like it if you liked the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.470
 application that I have brought you to today dale 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.150
 I do not like it if unfortunately not you 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.220
 He liked to subscribe if you want to be 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.349
 to the latest in terms of applications to 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.799
 smartphone gadget reviews like this 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.360
 and kazan sanders 5 a range smartphone 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.159
 mean good because they left us the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.079
 catam people and from here thank you 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.489
