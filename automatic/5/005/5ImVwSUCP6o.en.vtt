00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and so I've already done that to both

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.010 
and so I've already done that to both
sides<00:01:02.399> I've<00:01:02.940> shown<00:01:03.300> how<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
sides I've shown how to do that in the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.779 
sides I've shown how to do that in the
previous<00:01:04.649> video<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.039> I<00:01:05.220> didn't<00:01:05.430> want<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.640> have

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
previous video so I didn't want to have

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.570 
previous video so I didn't want to have
to<00:01:06.410> start<00:01:07.410> from<00:01:07.500> all<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.009> from<00:01:08.160> scratch<00:01:08.430> I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
to start from all the way from scratch I

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.249 
to start from all the way from scratch I
make<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.030> video<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.750> shorter<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
make this video a little bit shorter so

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.859 
make this video a little bit shorter so
as<00:01:11.039> you<00:01:11.160> can<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> faint<00:01:12.360> white

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.969 
always like to go concern um a little
bit<00:01:39.540> more<00:01:39.689> conservative<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.829> can

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
bit more conservative because I can

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.880 
bit more conservative because I can
always<00:01:41.340> keep<00:01:41.640> taking<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.650> go<00:01:43.860> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so you can kind of visualize it now it's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.140

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
slaves would be a lot smaller too

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.819 
slaves would be a lot smaller too
because<00:02:22.459> as<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.909> can<00:02:23.000> see<00:02:23.060> I'm<00:02:23.629> taking<00:02:24.200> quite
