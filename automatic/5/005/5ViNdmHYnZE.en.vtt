00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
you design that we working on we have

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.000 
you design that we working on we have
made<00:00:07.799> two<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.519> these<00:00:08.700> boxes<00:00:09.559> okay<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
made two of these boxes okay this is the

second<00:00:11.400> box

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
second box

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.980 
second box
the<00:00:12.320> first<00:00:13.320> one<00:00:13.620> had<00:00:14.160> some<00:00:14.910> type<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.150> cloth<00:00:15.630> on

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.380 
the first one had some type of cloth on
the<00:00:16.500> back<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.100> thought<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> good<00:00:18.029> idea

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the back I thought it was a good idea

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.070 
the back I thought it was a good idea
because<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.289> birds<00:00:19.800> can't<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.369> hurt<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
because the birds can't get hurt but the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560 
because the birds can't get hurt but the
wood<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.680> smooth<00:00:23.250> inside<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> don't

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
wood is smooth inside of it so I don't

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.300 
wood is smooth inside of it so I don't
think<00:00:24.810> they're<00:00:24.900> gonna<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.170> hurt<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:26.070> just

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
