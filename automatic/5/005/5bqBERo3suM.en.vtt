00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.690
 how is it possible 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.429
 it is 1,750 tons 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.730
 you should find the sixth battery 9 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.730
 but it is only half the size of that mark 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.159
 with 1 8 thousand and 600 tonnes of waste 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.159
 this is one of the biggest machines and mining 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.320
 the others are nothing 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 compared to this 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.840
 this is the largest land mobile machine that ever moved by possession 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.650
 from the earth 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.570
 during these 30 thousand tons 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.130
 has its own train station 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.680
 but incredibly enough a handful of people to operate this month 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.760
 and together they produce up to 90,000 tons of coal per day 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.000
 one more how it's possible 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 eat 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.440
 a big country like germany 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.250
 needs a lot of electricity and here in the northeast of the country this power plant 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.200
 state-of-the-art bar-code calls to vacancies or black pumps provide the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.430
 enough for more than two million homes 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.590
 operating at maximum power it raises doubts in the 6 30 hours equivalent to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.630
 production of 1,000 wind turbines 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.069
 in this plant generates energy 24 hours a day 365 days a year 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.890
 did not stop with low calorific value 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.100
 this valuable fuel provided Germany with 30% of its electricity 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.950
 to operate the plant needs 36 thousand tons of garbage per day 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 who can stay in the dark 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.310
 so as not to take risks the power station was built at 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.609
 mine side 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.179
 So 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.309
 bush 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.309
 from the open pit mine to success 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:24.559
 about 20 million tons of miniaturization extracted from here 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.039
 year 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.099
 but there is a problem 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.059
 at first I was grounded about 130 meters of sand gravel and clay 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.779
 to win you need one of those 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.829
 this is the fifth time he has been present 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.260
 this monster spends eight thousand and 600 tons and the third largest economies 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.029
 of the world 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.799
 it is operated for only one month 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.379
 was different 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.379
 this is the same way 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.139
 vaccination - who drove the fire truck the merck diadema was open 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.139
 it was love at first sight 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.639
 it is powered by an electricity supply of 30 thousand volts 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:20.329
 its huge bar actually a Ferris wheel is powered by three motors 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.329
 of 700 thousand votes that counts with 18 goals 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.999
 thomas is at the tip of the 17 meter 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.449
 capacity to 14,000 cubic meters of sand per hour 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:39.850
 rain 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.850
 7 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.519
 it is to be expected that in this matter the mother adds an employee 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.359
 marcia 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.510
 but despite the grandeur she puts little pressure on men 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:04:01.069
 this is because its weight is distributed by two mats and dentists with this 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.010
 means that the pressure on the soil of only one pound 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.779
 the police said 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.489
 fifty grams per square centimeter 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.489
 the same as a person walking 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.789
 The time of china coal is very cool was on the surface until the inep 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.829
 Full service is a relatively simple process 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:24.809
 ask the world's largest mobile machine 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.170
 more than 600 meters in length and weighing 30,000 tons from 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.810
 triple crusher is almost double the size of her support. 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.449
 your job is to expose one minute in a 400-meter-wide valley using three 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.370
 base series interconnected by a huge transport pot 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.180
 she moves on rails at four meters a minute processing 25 thousand 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.180
 cubic meters of material per hour 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.949
 this material is transferred to transport melting that crosses the valley to 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.949
 deposit it on the other side 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.860
 but it's worth working on the rally you need to protect a water table 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.589
 so a wall of clay with 20 kilometers of length prevented 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.589
 water drainage from neighboring land 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.430
 meanwhile a series of wells or submersible pumps to get off the ground 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.430
 100 cubic meters of water per minute 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.800
 this volume and diverted to the local estuaries maintaining a good level 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.249
 water and environmental balance 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:49.360
 but cavani agigante through bahrein and mind 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.439
 displacing the mine 300 meters a year along the German landscape 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.400
 the whole machine including turkey 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.449
 three arms 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:00.590
 is operated for one month 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.729
 instead of just 19 men 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:04.770
 10 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.580
 relatives 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.940
 1 tens of meters below the surface is the reward 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.900
 by effort 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.949
 the valuable red wine that does not measure efforts and said that at the minute he has 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.460
 15 million years 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.770
 braga nunes world norm 2010 at least 180 million years older 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.589
 than the Olympic leader of marseille 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:34.149
 but the power plant in relation to a bar is one of the most advanced of what is 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.149
 capable of extracting even the last drop of energy 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.270
 The problem is that since December 25 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.000
 of 16 meters deep of excavation of the vice-presidency 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.300
 - let's look at it but not at all 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.029
 sr 1300 usa she weighs one thousand 750 tons 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.810
 thanks to a head goal your vacancy can be my wife again 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.899
 this allowed the ball to enter 

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.899
 one thousand five hundred cubic meters per hour 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.360
 now the problem is that it's 80 meters deep in an area 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.180
 residential area and almost 10 kilometers from the 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.180
 how will they take advantage 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:26.340
 if coal were transported in trucks it would take more than 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.340
 a thousand of them 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.970
 there are four plays our lands carry good ones ahead 

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:46.419
 besides the 16 wagons it has about 60 tons of coal 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:50.539
 which means that every weekend trip almost one thousand tons of 

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:52.020
 charge 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.230
 fully charged pulse rails specially built for 

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:57.879
 that 

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:00.210
 the journey takes only 15 minutes 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.009
 are made up to 90 the trip
