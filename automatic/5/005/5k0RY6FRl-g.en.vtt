while they have a reinforced plate

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.789 
while they have a reinforced plate
inside<00:01:29.389> of<00:01:29.569> this<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:29.990> that<00:01:30.170> when<00:01:30.289> you<00:01:30.409> stand<00:01:30.709> on

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
inside of this so that when you stand on

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.120 
inside of this so that when you stand on
the<00:01:30.889> foot<00:01:31.069> Craig<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:33.020> won't<00:01:33.289> you<00:01:34.039> know

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
the foot Craig and it won't you know

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.489 
the foot Craig and it won't you know
bend<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.549> shoe<00:01:34.789> and<00:01:35.119> in<00:01:35.209> which<00:01:35.359> way<00:01:35.569> so<00:01:35.630> unlike

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
bend the shoe and in which way so unlike

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.919 
bend the shoe and in which way so unlike
basketball<00:01:37.069> shoes<00:01:37.249> which<00:01:37.459> are<00:01:37.549> very<00:01:37.759> soft<00:01:38.090> not

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
basketball shoes which are very soft not

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.139 
basketball shoes which are very soft not
so<00:01:39.139> durable<00:01:39.499> these<00:01:40.369> will<00:01:40.609> hold<00:01:40.729> up<00:01:40.969> i<00:01:41.090> would

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
so durable these will hold up i would

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.489 
so durable these will hold up i would
say<00:01:41.509> in<00:01:41.659> a<00:01:41.719> crash<00:01:43.630> these<00:01:44.630> are<00:01:44.810> mainly<00:01:45.049> for

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
say in a crash these are mainly for

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:49.300 
say in a crash these are mainly for
street<00:01:45.740> writing<00:01:46.099> um<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.179> so<00:01:47.840> they<00:01:48.829> do<00:01:48.889> have

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
street writing um and so they do have

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.330 
street writing um and so they do have
the<00:01:49.429> support<00:01:49.849> there<00:01:50.139> but<00:01:51.189> anything<00:01:52.189> else

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
the support there but anything else

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.339 
the support there but anything else
you'd<00:01:52.579> probably<00:01:52.819> want<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.209> higher<00:01:53.479> heel<00:01:53.779> these

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
you'd probably want a higher heel these

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.139 
you'd probably want a higher heel these
