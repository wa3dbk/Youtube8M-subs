00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.410
 hello everybody is 690 and here I am 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.230
 here guys come back with finally with 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.180
 a core kids and today I'm here in 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.720
 bring them precisely this nuclear with 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.029
 really very much a guys weapon 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.899
 difficult to use as you see the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:39.070
 kst guys very difficult in that sense 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.649
 let's say it's a weapon we say before 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.149
 it must be said that she is a mother 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.280
 with which it is very difficult to make a nucleus 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.260
 because obviously I don't assure you 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.790
 to killing because as soon as 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.010
 wrong one shot 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.380
 if you are face to face with an enemy 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.050
 most of the time you will die 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.520
 so it's a weapon I repeat way of each other 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.410
 its network you must definitely have one 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.120
 good good accuracy 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.399
 we must also say that I had one 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.759
 good dose of luck in this match 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:11.290
 because we say that accuracy 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:14.020
 modestly heaven though with other ki6 g 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.340
 times that I've used it I'm not 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.189
 never managed to use it right 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.409
 perfectly as i did in this in 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.359
 this gameplay as you see I'm not mistaken 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.240
 I don't really want a shot 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.340
 let's say I tell you let's say the class 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.069
 that he was using that fact 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.790
 from ki seats I tell you the accessories that 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:36.280
 they were in laser lasers as you see 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.790
 which then okay lives to make a purpose though 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.560
 we say that it is then almost gone 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.960
 impossible to do the purpose though 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.100
 sometimes I have to say that I did it e 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.830
 very difficult we say so cute 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.370
 purpose with this weapon laser sight I was 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.920
 saying long barrel and I think it is not 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.630
 so fast charger the third accessory 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.310
 I do not remember 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.420
 however this positive was played 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.180
 on playstation 3 later it was two months two 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.750
 almost three months it's up to you 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.410
 joystick of the playstation because it goes well 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.160
 I came back because my friend had me 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.860
 convinced that salute nicolÃ² who has me 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.700
 contacted on skype is actually a fan 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.489
 let's say we played together on ps3 because 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.050
 however I also wanted to come back 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.510
 to make a match on ps3 is therefore 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.030
 as soon as we say this here was the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.580
 first game I've made have been 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.750
 very lucky, however, I did immediately 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.290
 immediately this however for how much 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:49.090
 regards the impressions on this weapon 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.220
 I would say that we say a sentence that second 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.750
 me is very important if you know how to use it 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.540
 weapon 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.340
 the beast because short boys chose 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.160
 from all sides and a sniper though 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.870
 much much easier to use 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.610
 especially obviously in the clashes 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.470
 close encounters so I repeat if 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.740
 you know how to use this weapon is devastating 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.520
 I sometimes in respect of tweet 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:20.030
 which is a site where they show up in 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.660
 streaming of different games I see myself para 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.490
 site that I don't know if you know it well it is 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.630
 arrived with his team with headlights co 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.000
 impact early in los angeles in April 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.860
 so let's say i 'm the first one 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 in the world we say so mister and if so 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.860
 you can tell and guys when you see it 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.360
 play a few hsg he often plays with 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.380
 k seats because if it can 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.270
 to allow 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.680
 having a really aiming guys really 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.170
 unbelievable 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.540
 if you want to play a show why 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.239
 he's not really wrong but he's in 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.420
 general is strong with all weapons 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.030
 so let's say the impressions on 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.410
 this year they are good though if not 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.350
 there was a good aim and no 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.530
 advice because it is then it becomes becomes 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.519
 just complicated anyway for 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.380
 regarding the series of killings 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.860
 they are the usual ones for the nuclear web 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.410
 counterattack and pisa and then then 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.530
 nothing however regarding video 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.799
 I have to go back for a couple of things 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.729
 so what about the stands in me 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.530
 these days there are guys 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.180
 also 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.630
 a week and a half that you don't have 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.940
 port 1 I will explain to you for a moment the parquet 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.320
 let's say that in this period 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.510
 obviously a little difficult to put on 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.480
 agree with with the whole team in the summer 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.780
 obviously things to do things from 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.460
 do it on death so do n't you 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.950
 we never find all four all and 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.990
 four together so we are having 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.610
 this is a small problem 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.320
 obviously if we can find us 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.020
 all four together I will not hesitate to 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.950
 make a listening 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.840
 then oh well I also want to say that between 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.540
 some will start another tournament for sure 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.810
 organized by personal gamer 16 teams 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.490
 so maybe we could meet there 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.340
 I will also do some listening there 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.950
 I will do some of the matches of the 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.630
 tournament to boys this video 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.760
 lasted very little because a nuclear 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.250
 however quite fast with this k 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.350
