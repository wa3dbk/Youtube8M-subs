they<00:00:08.270> put<00:00:08.510> a<00:00:08.799> bolt<00:00:09.799> right<00:00:10.129> in<00:00:10.580> there<00:00:10.760> which<00:00:10.969> is

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
they put a bolt right in there which is

they put a bolt right in there which is
way<00:00:13.160> down<00:00:13.459> deep<00:00:14.529> on<00:00:15.529> the<00:00:15.770> side<00:00:15.980> right<00:00:16.250> down

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
way down deep on the side right down

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.800 
way down deep on the side right down
here<00:00:16.670> so<00:00:16.910> you<00:00:16.970> can<00:00:17.119> barely<00:00:17.360> even<00:00:17.539> get<00:00:17.750> a

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
here so you can barely even get a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.710 
here so you can barely even get a
 screwdriver<00:00:18.760> all<00:00:19.760> ratchet<00:00:20.600> down

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
 screwdriver all ratchet down

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.940 
 screwdriver all ratchet down
there<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:20.990> get<00:00:21.140> that<00:00:21.290> one<00:00:21.440> out<00:00:21.620> it<00:00:21.830> took

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
there to get that one out it took

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.920 
there to get that one out it took
probably<00:00:22.310> about<00:00:22.460> 20<00:00:23.330> minutes<00:00:23.600> of

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
probably about 20 minutes of

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.510 
probably about 20 minutes of
around<00:00:24.140> to<00:00:24.260> get<00:00:24.380> it<00:00:24.500> out<00:00:24.650> it<00:00:25.100> doesn't<00:00:25.430> make

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
around to get it out it doesn't make

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.020 
around to get it out it doesn't make
sense

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
sense

mean if you're building something you

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.060 
mean if you're building something you
should<00:00:32.629> make<00:00:32.809> it<00:00:32.930> easy<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.320> serve<00:00:33.620> as<00:00:33.829> plain

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
should make it easy to serve as plain

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
gonna use for pulling the engine out of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.430 
gonna use for pulling the engine out of
my<00:00:42.290> CD<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:44.120> other<00:00:44.360> projects<00:00:44.899> as<00:00:45.020> well<00:00:45.170> it's

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
my CD and other projects as well it's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:57.840 
my CD and other projects as well it's
all<00:00:45.590> kind<00:00:45.920> up<00:00:46.070> ready<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.370> go

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
this is removing the jet pump on players

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.080 
this is removing the jet pump on players
MSX<00:01:01.210> 150<00:01:01.900> turbo<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:03.430> to<00:01:03.580> start<00:01:03.940> off<00:01:04.059> by

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.150 

next<00:01:16.480> step<00:01:16.660> is<00:01:16.690> move<00:01:17.050> these<00:01:17.290> for<00:01:17.680> extremely

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
next step is move these for extremely

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.440 
next step is move these for extremely
long<00:01:18.340> bolts<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:20.170> there<00:01:20.440> down<00:01:20.800> there<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:22.210> so

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.670 
long bolts right there down there and so
forth<00:01:24.510> and<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.630> four<00:01:25.840> long<00:01:26.050> bolts<00:01:26.320> removed

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
forth and the four long bolts removed

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.100 
forth and the four long bolts removed
you<00:01:26.979> want<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.430> remove<00:01:28.060> these<00:01:28.270> two<00:01:28.540> lines<00:01:28.810> as

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
well and the whole thing should just

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.390 
well and the whole thing should just
pull<00:01:30.670> out<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:35.110> pull<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.530> shroud<00:01:35.800> and<00:01:36.160> the

something actually worked out good

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.210 
something actually worked out good
because<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.780> moved<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.229> coupler<00:01:50.619> far<00:01:51.040> enough

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
because I moved the coupler far enough

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.060 
because I moved the coupler far enough
they<00:01:51.430> need<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.790> pull<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.090> engine<00:01:52.210> out<00:01:52.420> wicked

out over the next few series I'm going
to<00:02:11.050> replace<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.500> turbo<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:11.980> put<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.250> back

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
to replace the turbo and put it back

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.520 
to replace the turbo and put it back
together<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.120> we're<00:02:13.810> gonna<00:02:13.900> see<00:02:14.110> how<00:02:14.350> else

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
together and we're gonna see how else

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.729 
together and we're gonna see how else
you<00:02:14.650> works<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:16.840> taken<00:02:17.170> apart<00:02:17.380> Rygaard

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
you works this have taken apart Rygaard

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.080 
you works this have taken apart Rygaard
so<00:02:17.920> I'm<00:02:17.980> gonna<00:02:18.070> have<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.250> figure<00:02:18.489> out<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.730> lot<00:02:18.940> of

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
so I'm gonna have to figure out a lot of

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.250 
so I'm gonna have to figure out a lot of
this<00:02:19.180> out<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:19.540> we'll<00:02:19.720> see<00:02:19.840> what<00:02:19.900> happens

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
on the deck and gonna do a compression

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.270 
on the deck and gonna do a compression
test<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.200> tomorrow<00:02:29.350> gonna<00:02:30.010> turn<00:02:30.250> over

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
test on it tomorrow gonna turn over

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.509 
test on it tomorrow gonna turn over
manually<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:31.500> battery<00:02:32.500> charger<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.400> see

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
manually with battery charger to see
