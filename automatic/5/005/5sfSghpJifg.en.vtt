into<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.890> should<00:01:19.130> know<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:19.610> you

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
into this and you should know and you

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
should remember that the judges we're

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.060 
should remember that the judges we're
scoring<00:01:22.670> these<00:01:22.909> competitors<00:01:23.540> based<00:01:24.200> on<00:01:24.500> a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
scoring these competitors based on a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.210 
scoring these competitors based on a
scale<00:01:25.880> from<00:01:25.909> seven<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.689> ten<00:01:26.960> just<00:01:27.740> like<00:01:27.920> real

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
scale from seven to ten just like real

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.040 
scale from seven to ten just like real
life<00:01:28.250> dunk<00:01:28.700> contest<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.480> lowest<00:01:29.810> score

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
life dunk contest so the lowest score

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.530 
life dunk contest so the lowest score
you<00:01:30.170> can<00:01:30.320> get<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.620> a<00:01:30.650> seven<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.880> highest<00:01:32.120> score

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
you can get is a seven the highest score

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.870 
you can get is a seven the highest score
you<00:01:32.570> can<00:01:32.780> get<00:01:32.930> is<00:01:33.050> a<00:01:33.080> ten<00:01:33.410> so<00:01:34.130> ultimately<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
you can get is a ten so ultimately the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.310 
you can get is a ten so ultimately the
highest<00:01:35.210> score<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.450> could<00:01:35.690> actually<00:01:35.870> have

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
highest score you could actually have

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.400 
highest score you could actually have
after<00:01:36.980> five<00:01:37.340> judges<00:01:37.820> voting<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:38.780> would<00:01:39.290> be

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
after five judges voting on you would be

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.440 
after five judges voting on you would be
a<00:01:39.440> 50<00:01:39.980> so<00:01:40.370> that<00:01:40.400> would<00:01:40.610> be<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.730> highest<00:01:41.120> score

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
a 50 so that would be the highest score

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.440 
a 50 so that would be the highest score
again<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.440> highest<00:01:42.740> score<00:01:42.830> would<00:01:43.040> be<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.190> 50<00:01:43.700> so

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
again the highest score would be a 50 so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.270 
again the highest score would be a 50 so
