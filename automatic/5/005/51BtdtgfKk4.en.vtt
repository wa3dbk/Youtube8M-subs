00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.149 
I'm applying a tiny amount of black out
with<00:01:40.689> that<00:01:40.869> same<00:01:41.140> pencil<00:01:41.409> brush<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.890> I'm

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
bringing that color into the crease but

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.590 
bringing that color into the crease but
only<00:01:44.710> lightly<00:01:45.219> because<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.520> don't<00:01:45.909> want<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.329> to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
only lightly because I don't want it to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.099 
only lightly because I don't want it to
be<00:01:46.840> too<00:01:47.619> overpowering<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.819> then<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.869> help

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
be too overpowering and then to help

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
products in it end up blending

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.609 
products in it end up blending
everything<00:01:57.159> out<00:01:57.689> after<00:01:58.689> that<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.869> just<00:01:59.020> went<00:01:59.349> in

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
everything out after that I just went in

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.099 
everything out after that I just went in
and<00:01:59.859> touched<00:02:00.130> up<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:00.700> any<00:02:01.090> colors<00:02:01.509> that<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.719> felt

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
and touched up on any colors that I felt

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.620 
and touched up on any colors that I felt
had<00:02:02.200> disappeared<00:02:03.130> with<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.520> blending<00:02:04.000> but<00:02:04.599> I

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
had disappeared with that blending but I

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.979 
had disappeared with that blending but I
continue<00:02:05.319> to<00:02:05.619> blend<00:02:06.429> as<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:07.179> went<00:02:07.629> so<00:02:07.840> it's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
continue to blend as I went so it's

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.020 
continue to blend as I went so it's
basically<00:02:08.379> just<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.769> matter<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.069> touching<00:02:09.940> up

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
basically just a matter of touching up

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.509 
basically just a matter of touching up
the<00:02:10.149> colors<00:02:10.479> blending<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.560> then<00:02:11.739> continuing

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
the colors blending and then continuing

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.089 
the colors blending and then continuing
to<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.150> until<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.079> have<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.379> the<00:02:14.680> desired

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
to do this until you have it the desired

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.530 
to do this until you have it the desired
look<00:02:16.799> then<00:02:17.799> for<00:02:18.069> eyeliner<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.670> did<00:02:18.879> my<00:02:19.120> typical

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
look then for eyeliner I did my typical

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.960 
look then for eyeliner I did my typical
wings<00:02:19.930> liner<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.739> opted<00:02:21.160> for<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.400> creamy

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
wings liner but I opted for a creamy

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.910 
wings liner but I opted for a creamy
pencil<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:22.660> time<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.170> smudged<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.739> out

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
pencil this time and smudged it out

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.400 
pencil this time and smudged it out
slightly<00:02:24.280> with<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.910> black<00:02:25.299> eye<00:02:25.569> shadow<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
slightly with a black eye shadow the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.259 
slightly with a black eye shadow the
some<00:02:26.590> reason<00:02:26.890> my<00:02:26.980> camera<00:02:27.340> didn't<00:02:27.640> record<00:02:27.730> half

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
some reason my camera didn't record half

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.780 
some reason my camera didn't record half
of<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.569> but<00:02:28.780> I'm<00:02:29.049> sure<00:02:29.379> you<00:02:29.650> get<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.220> idea<00:02:30.579> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
of it but I'm sure you get the idea and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.180 
of it but I'm sure you get the idea and

absolutely amazing by the way this is my
first<00:02:37.959> time<00:02:38.109> using<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.739> if<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.250> hadn't

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
first time using it and if I hadn't

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.309 
first time using it and if I hadn't
already<00:02:39.730> planned<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.299> using<00:02:40.450> false<00:02:40.840> lashes<00:02:41.139> I

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
already planned on using false lashes I

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.349 
already planned on using false lashes I
probably<00:02:41.920> wouldn't<00:02:42.609> have<00:02:42.790> because<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.239> just

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
probably wouldn't have because it just

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.930 
probably wouldn't have because it just
made<00:02:43.569> my<00:02:43.720> lashes<00:02:43.959> look<00:02:44.290> amazing<00:02:45.099> but<00:02:45.760> I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
made my lashes look amazing but I

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.059 
made my lashes look amazing but I

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
for my cheeks I wanted something that

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.800 
for my cheeks I wanted something that
was<00:03:45.890> quite<00:03:46.099> natural<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:46.790> understated<00:03:47.450> but

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
was quite natural and understated but

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.080 
was quite natural and understated but
still<00:03:48.080> had<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.410> rosy<00:03:48.739> tint<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.519> so<00:03:49.640> I<00:03:49.819> went

still had that rosy tint to it so I went

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.809 
still had that rosy tint to it so I went
with<00:03:50.180> truth<00:03:50.569> by<00:03:50.870> Kat<00:03:51.200> Von<00:03:51.230> D<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:51.980> because<00:03:52.640> that

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
with truth by Kat Von D and because that

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.910 
with truth by Kat Von D and because that
is<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> completely<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> matter<00:03:54.200> flash<00:03:54.680> I

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920

highlighted up my cheekbones with a max
soft<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.769> gentle<00:03:58.250> because<00:03:58.910> it<00:03:59.090> creates<00:03:59.390> a

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
soft and gentle because it creates a

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.130
