 hello welcome to android tips today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.770
 I'm going to show you a blocking part in 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.450
 which we can see all our 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.610
 whatsapp notifications or any 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.679
 application we can have several settings 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.540
 several quick accesses from it 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.190
 lock screen 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.500
 access the camera and other things that you 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.449
 I'll explain and well before I start 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 tell you what is this application of the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.800
 mel has recommended your christ mine mine 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.060
 thank you very much and thank you very much 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.130
 all of you for being here every day 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.180
 reviewing comments and nothing 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.890
 I hope you like this application 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.890
 I hope you like the video and it's going a year 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.210
 Well first of all I want to show you 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.430
 music screen blocked so 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.570
 we unlocked our device and this 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.370
 would be the lock screen in which 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.530
 we would have the time up here and the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 time although we can select it in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.920
 white color if we want instead of color 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 black as I have it and here then 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.770
 logically in the main subject 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.120
 we will have all notifications as 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 we see then I'm showing up all 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.260
 the notifications of the applications 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.910
 that I have in this case are the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.460
 whatsapp conversations for example 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.050
 Well, it's showing up here because the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.360
 conversation of this one 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.430
 of this person lady girlfriend this 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.500
 person to Carlos cycle and this and this 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 group the surf group that I have here 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.760
 Well, I also see all the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.470
 conversation and nothing too tell you that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.970
 if we slide up on this side 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.800
 we can directly access the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.200
 camera and we slipped from this corner 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.450
 up we can like some adjustments 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.920
 fast a small configuration in the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.900
 which in the center we could turn on and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.030
 turn off the flashlight on the right we can 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.820
 directly access the settings and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.759
 here, I think it was for the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.580
 calculator although I do not remember it well and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.470
 nothing will also have an access 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.020
 to regulate the brightness of the screen 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.100
 we can give more brightness or less brightness 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.100
 as we want 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.960
 and a few quick accesses to 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.670
 turn on and turn on and off the wifi it 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.920
 should turn off the 3g data turn on and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.009
 to turn off 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.330
 well the bluetooth the rest and good to say 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.729
 that with this lock screen yes 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.920
 we slide to the right we will open the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.390
 application of which we are sliding 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.799
 in this case if I of leixÃ³es and I 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.869
 slid to the right as we will open 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.700
 the conversation of lady girlfriend or if it is 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.620
 smooth to the left then we will close 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.600
 the notification we are going to close all the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.360
 notifications for you to really see 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.910
 as it makes a very nice effect in putting 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.769
 the wallpaper in fuzzy because 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.500
 it really is an image of a dog that 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.019
 it has become blurred when the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.430
 notifications we slide it and as 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.660
 we have then no longer appears in 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.049
 our our wallpaper 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.489
 totally clear with this application and 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.920
 nothing simply we slip and 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.209
 we will unlock our device and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.549
 good that I have taught what is coming 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.200
 being in this application to remind you that 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.880
 in the video discussion you will have the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.860
 link so you can download it and 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.880
 that it would be this one locker me still like that 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.440
 I would like you to stay because you 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.960
 they teach a configuration that is going to be 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.520
 to import 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.780
 Still, it will not be that you stay because 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.850
 I'll show you a configuration that's going to 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.440
 be a little bit important under me 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.270
 point of view to be able to use this 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.870
 application in the best conditions 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.670
 just open the application I m what 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.310
 would logically lock screen 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.050
 we would have to activate it, we give it to 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.990
 this little button we follow a few steps very 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.590
 simple and nothing and simply the 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.400
 we would activate 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.560
 and then it would have been singing that entering 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.879
 two in two or three places that for me are 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.920
 important as can be the 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.599
 reminder of notifications and 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.670
 here then I have to remind 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.099
 of new messages logically I have it 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.989
 activated and so that I can be turned on 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.819
 the screen this we can disable it or 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.739
 activate I like to activate it 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.540
 because when I get good when I get a 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.940
 automatic notification screen 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.620
 it lights up if I'm next or near 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.620
 of the device and so I can read the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.510
 own notification 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.980
 and if we enter in this last tab 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.540
 you are notifications of the application 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.890
 simply because we will choose the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.260
 applications that we want that we 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.090
 notify on the lock screen by 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.140
 example I have then the application of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.090
 Android tips 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.680
 the google chrome app already 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.260
 better camera application 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.209
 will rarely send me a notification 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.680
 so that's why I do not have it marked 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.879
 best odd game neither 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.620
 I have marked so that they are not 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.680
 arriving then annoying notifications of 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.849
 any game to lock screen 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.349
 In this section we have already done and 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.730
 we will go to the background section of 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.970
 screen is a pretty section 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.470
 interesting why do not we 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.720
 offers several wallpapers with one 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.579
 exquisite quality the truth and in addition 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.380
 then we can select our background 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.699
 of screen if we want if we do not want 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.740
 choose none of us here 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.389
 finally and therefore no less 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.360
 important I would like to tell you that 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.010
 enter custom configuration 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.350
 Well, it's going to be good for you basically 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.090
 you can here 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.639
 turn on or off you can see the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.919
 status bar I have hidden 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.539
 so good for it to be like more 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.880
 minimalist so to speak too 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.590
 I have activated the charge animation of 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.420
 sounds and so on 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.730
 in time zones logically 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.830
 we will have to enter so nothing for 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.690
 edit our time zone our 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.570
 location so you can put us the 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.980
 weather, weather and temperature and so on 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.320
 so that he can not put him 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.700
 where we ask because we do not 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.830
 It is interesting that they put us in another country 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.470
 world and also where it puts color of the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.150
 watch if we enter what's going on 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.980
 creating the mobile without battery nothing if 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.350
 we enter there we can simply 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.060
 place the clock in black or white 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.770
 as I told you at the beginning of the video 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.540
 of the good video 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.010
 the mobile is standing out without battery is 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.330
 that's why it may not look 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.770
 very good because the shine has been left 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.530
 automatically because I have less left 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.820
 of 5% but nothing this would be all up 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.160
 here I leave the video today I hope you 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.930
 You liked it if it was so leave 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.450
 a like to help me keep growing 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.770
 on youtube and you know you can comment 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.530
 anything we are going to try 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.820
 be pending in the comments and 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.820
 nothing until the next video
