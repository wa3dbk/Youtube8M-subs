00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.789 

so<00:00:05.180> we're<00:00:05.629> here<00:00:05.749> to<00:00:05.930> show<00:00:06.109> you<00:00:06.169> how<00:00:06.379> to<00:00:06.439> twist

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
so we're here to show you how to twist

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.440 
so we're here to show you how to twist
Tomatoes<00:00:07.990> we<00:00:08.990> twist<00:00:09.260> tomatoes<00:00:10.030> to<00:00:11.030> support

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
Tomatoes we twist tomatoes to support

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.099 
Tomatoes we twist tomatoes to support
them<00:00:12.309> up<00:00:13.309> to<00:00:13.609> the<00:00:13.760> string<00:00:14.090> you<00:00:15.049> can<00:00:15.080> do<00:00:15.529> this<00:00:15.740> by

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
them up to the string you can do this by

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.880 
them up to the string you can do this by
tying<00:00:18.109> them<00:00:18.410> to<00:00:18.939> bamboo<00:00:19.939> canes<00:00:20.440> the<00:00:21.440> process

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
tying them to bamboo canes the process

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.880 
tying them to bamboo canes the process
is<00:00:22.039> started<00:00:22.550> by<00:00:22.580> tying<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.020> string<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.830> the

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
is started by tying the string to the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.970 
is started by tying the string to the
plant<00:00:25.280> at<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.789> bottom<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.410> has<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.830> be<00:00:27.949> a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
plant at the bottom and this has to be a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.580 
plant at the bottom and this has to be a
very<00:00:28.220> loose<00:00:28.550> knot<00:00:28.910> otherwise<00:00:29.840> when<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.199> stem

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
very loose knot otherwise when the stem

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.819 
very loose knot otherwise when the stem
swells<00:00:30.980> up<00:00:31.279> it<00:00:32.180> restricts<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.079> flow<00:00:33.500> of

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
swells up it restricts the flow of

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.250 
swells up it restricts the flow of
moisture<00:00:34.219> over<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:34.969> plant<00:00:36.519> first<00:00:37.519> of<00:00:37.699> all<00:00:37.789> I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
moisture over the plant first of all I

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.139 
moisture over the plant first of all I
like<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.440> twist<00:00:39.620> them<00:00:39.859> always<00:00:40.069> in<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:40.879> same

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
like to twist them always in the same

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.660 
like to twist them always in the same
direction<00:00:41.420> which<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.530> clockwise<00:00:45.670> doesn't

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
direction which is clockwise doesn't

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.590 
direction which is clockwise doesn't
trap<00:00:46.909> the<00:00:47.089> leaves<00:00:48.010> against<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.389> stem<00:00:50.389> of<00:00:50.569> the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
trap the leaves against the stem of the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.879 
trap the leaves against the stem of the
plant<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:51.889> lift<00:00:52.249> the<00:00:52.460> leaves<00:00:52.670> around<00:00:53.569> the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:53.889 
plant so you lift the leaves around the

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:59.439 
plant so you lift the leaves around the
string<00:00:55.959> and<00:00:56.959> carry<00:00:57.319> on<00:00:57.639> twisting<00:00:58.639> till<00:00:59.359> you

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
string and carry on twisting till you

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.930 
string and carry on twisting till you
get<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.839> the<00:00:59.959> top<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.100> by<00:01:01.249> the<00:01:01.309> time<00:01:01.639> you<00:01:01.789> get

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
get to the top and by the time you get

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.320 
get to the top and by the time you get
to<00:01:01.999> the<00:01:02.239> top<00:01:02.479> it<00:01:03.229> becomes<00:01:03.709> difficult<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.970> twist

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
to the top it becomes difficult to twist

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.830 
to the top it becomes difficult to twist
it<00:01:05.479> any<00:01:05.540> further<00:01:06.100> but<00:01:07.100> that's<00:01:07.280> not<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> problem

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
it any further but that's not a problem

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.470 
it any further but that's not a problem
so<00:01:09.190> there<00:01:10.190> we<00:01:10.280> are<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.670> can<00:01:10.850> see<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.210> string

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
so there we are you can see the string

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.290 
so there we are you can see the string
is<00:01:12.080> twisted<00:01:12.860> all<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.190> way<00:01:13.280> around<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.730> plant

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
is twisted all the way around the plant

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.950 
is twisted all the way around the plant
right<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.020> top<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:17.060> string<00:01:17.360> twisted

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
right to the top the string twisted

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.760 
right to the top the string twisted
around<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.350> plant<00:01:19.780> but<00:01:20.780> actually<00:01:21.260> you're

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
around the plant but actually you're

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.950 
around the plant but actually you're
twisting<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.550> plant<00:01:22.820> around<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.630> string

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
twisting the plant around the string

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.700 
twisting the plant around the string
when<00:01:24.620> you<00:01:24.770> do<00:01:24.950> it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.590 

now<00:01:33.250> I'm<00:01:33.370> going<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.640> show<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:33.940> how<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.270> take

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
now I'm going to show you how to take

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.680 
now I'm going to show you how to take
outside<00:01:34.840> tubes<00:01:35.910> it's<00:01:36.910> important<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.480> take

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
outside tubes it's important to take

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.740 
outside tubes it's important to take
outside<00:01:37.900> tubes<00:01:38.470> because<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:40.240> side<00:01:40.480> tubes

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
outside tubes because the side tubes

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.880 
outside tubes because the side tubes
take<00:01:41.170> out<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.740> lot<00:01:41.980> of<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.280> energy<00:01:42.730> from<00:01:43.420> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
take out a lot of the energy from the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.490 
take out a lot of the energy from the
flowers<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.520> fruit<00:01:46.210> which<00:01:46.990> means<00:01:47.290> the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
flowers and the fruit which means the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.710 
flowers and the fruit which means the
fruit<00:01:47.710> won't<00:01:47.980> be<00:01:48.160> so<00:01:48.370> big<00:01:48.640> or<00:01:48.940> perhaps<00:01:49.270> even

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
fruit won't be so big or perhaps even

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.360 
fruit won't be so big or perhaps even
not<00:01:50.200> set<00:01:50.500> at<00:01:50.680> all<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.750> side<00:01:53.380> shoots<00:01:53.680> grow

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
not set at all so the side shoots grow

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.540 
not set at all so the side shoots grow
in<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.060> leaf<00:01:55.240> nodes<00:01:55.630> that's<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:57.010> leaf<00:01:57.520> node

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
in the leaf nodes that's the a leaf node

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.500 
in the leaf nodes that's the a leaf node
is<00:01:58.180> no<00:01:58.780> D's<00:01:59.020> between<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.820> leaf<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.480> stem

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
is no D's between the leaf and the stem

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.290 
is no D's between the leaf and the stem
of<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.990> plant<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.830> there<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.130> one<00:02:03.310> here<00:02:03.580> when

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
of the plant so there is one here when

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.540 
of the plant so there is one here when
you<00:02:04.480> break<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.990> out<00:02:05.200> between<00:02:06.040> your<00:02:06.220> thumb<00:02:06.400> and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
you break it out between your thumb and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.169 
you break it out between your thumb and
finger<00:02:07.560> there<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.679> another<00:02:08.950> bigger<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.550> and

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
finger there is another bigger one and

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.660 
finger there is another bigger one and
it's<00:02:10.330> usually<00:02:10.570> between<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.470> side<00:02:11.709> chute<00:02:12.100> so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
it's usually between the side chute so

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.440 
it's usually between the side chute so
below<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.690> truss<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:15.400> stronger<00:02:15.850> below<00:02:16.240> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
below the truss it's stronger below the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.480 
below the truss it's stronger below the
trust<00:02:16.750> because<00:02:17.170> he's<00:02:17.290> pulling<00:02:17.709> all<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
trust because he's pulling all the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.250 
trust because he's pulling all the
goodness<00:02:18.790> out<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.360> truss<00:02:19.600> or<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.020> one's

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
goodness out of the truss or that one's

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:29.370 
goodness out of the truss or that one's
very<00:02:20.350> important<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.250> get<00:02:21.400> out<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:27.490> one<00:02:28.380> there

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
very important to get out this one there

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.110 
very important to get out this one there
is<00:02:29.530> no<00:02:29.709> side<00:02:30.040> shoot<00:02:30.280> at<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.580> moment<00:02:30.940> because

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
is no side shoot at the moment because

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.720 
is no side shoot at the moment because
it<00:02:31.390> hasn't<00:02:31.540> developed<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.650> one<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.700> a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
it hasn't developed this one there is a

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.180 
it hasn't developed this one there is a
very<00:02:34.000> tiny<00:02:34.330> one<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.020> can't<00:02:35.380> get<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.709> out<00:02:35.860> and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
very tiny one but I can't get it out and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.699 
very tiny one but I can't get it out and
then<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:37.239> next<00:02:37.540> one<00:02:37.750> here<00:02:38.050> there's<00:02:38.470> another

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
then the next one here there's another

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.790 
then the next one here there's another
big<00:02:38.950> side<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.519> coming<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.050> take<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.560> one<00:02:41.769> out

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
big side you coming so take that one out

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.509 
big side you coming so take that one out
I<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.930> top<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.350> plant<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:45.280> very

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
I know the top of the plant is very

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.330 
I know the top of the plant is very
difficult<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.209> decide<00:02:46.570> which<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.350> side<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
difficult to decide which is the side to

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.590 
difficult to decide which is the side to
and<00:02:48.720> which<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.260> main<00:02:50.680> stem<00:02:51.360> besides<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
and which is the main stem besides you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.800 
and which is the main stem besides you
is<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.110> one<00:02:53.290> underneath<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.400> truss<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.970> so

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
is the one underneath the truss and so

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.420 
is the one underneath the truss and so
we're<00:02:55.959> going<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.140> take<00:02:56.350> one<00:02:56.560> out<00:02:56.590> anyway<00:02:57.220> and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
we're going to take one out anyway and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.699 
we're going to take one out anyway and
I'm<00:02:57.880> going<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.120> take<00:02:58.330> this<00:02:58.480> one<00:02:58.720> out<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.900> it

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
I'm going to take this one out and it

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.570 
I'm going to take this one out and it
was<00:02:59.800> going<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.040> be<00:03:00.160> difficult

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.970 

it's<00:03:06.090> useful<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.780> take<00:03:06.960> out<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.380> side<00:03:07.620> shoots

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
it's useful to take out the side shoots

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.270 
it's useful to take out the side shoots
on<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.370> dry<00:03:08.850> day<00:03:09.260> because<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> wound<00:03:10.650> needs<00:03:10.920> to

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
on a dry day because the wound needs to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.090 
on a dry day because the wound needs to
he<00:03:11.490> look<00:03:12.170> before<00:03:13.430> evening<00:03:14.840> otherwise

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
he look before evening otherwise

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.690 
he look before evening otherwise
diseases<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:17.310> botrytis<00:03:17.670> or<00:03:18.060> getting<00:03:19.700> that's

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
diseases like botrytis or getting that's

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.600 
diseases like botrytis or getting that's
two<00:03:21.000> more<00:03:21.210> here<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:28.740> then<00:03:28.860> there's<00:03:29.040> two<00:03:29.220> very

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
two more here and then there's two very

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.670 
two more here and then there's two very
very<00:03:29.820> small<00:03:30.120> ones<00:03:30.450> which<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.050> might<00:03:31.230> still<00:03:31.470> take

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
very small ones which I might still take

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.040 
very small ones which I might still take
out<00:03:34.310> because<00:03:35.310> when<00:03:35.820> they<00:03:36.000> grow<00:03:36.270> bigger<00:03:36.600> it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
out because when they grow bigger it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.010 
out because when they grow bigger it
will<00:03:37.170> make<00:03:37.350> more<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.950> wound<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:39.020> give

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
will make more of a wound and give

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.990 
will make more of a wound and give
botrytis<00:03:40.410> more<00:03:40.920> chance<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.460> get<00:03:41.610> into<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
botrytis more chance to get into the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:04:09.059 
botrytis more chance to get into the
stem<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.140> plants<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.740> killings

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.740 

one<00:04:09.640> advantage<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:11.819> twisting<00:04:12.819> them<00:04:13.060> before

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
one advantage of twisting them before

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.340 
one advantage of twisting them before
you<00:04:13.930> take<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.349> side<00:04:14.590> tubes<00:04:14.920> out<00:04:15.159> is<00:04:15.970> if<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.720> if

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
you take the side tubes out is if the if

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.879 
you take the side tubes out is if the if
by<00:04:17.709> chance<00:04:17.739> you<00:04:18.340> break<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.970> main<00:04:19.150> stem<00:04:19.889> when

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
by chance you break the main stem when

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.860 
by chance you break the main stem when
you're<00:04:21.070> twisting<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.639> you've<00:04:22.360> still<00:04:22.660> got<00:04:22.840> a

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
you're twisting it you've still got a

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.170 
you're twisting it you've still got a
side<00:04:23.169> you<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.860> can<00:04:24.070> grow<00:04:24.340> on<00:04:24.400> instead<00:04:25.030> of

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
side you that you can grow on instead of

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.710 
side you that you can grow on instead of
the<00:04:25.300> main<00:04:25.510> stem<00:04:26.669> so<00:04:27.669> it's<00:04:27.820> quite<00:04:28.060> important<00:04:28.690> to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
the main stem so it's quite important to

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.370 
the main stem so it's quite important to
do<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.139> in<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:30.250> order<00:04:30.570> in<00:04:31.570> case<00:04:31.780> you<00:04:31.960> do<00:04:32.110> break

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
do it in that order in case you do break

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.529 
do it in that order in case you do break
the<00:04:32.620> main<00:04:32.800> stem<00:04:33.160> out<00:04:33.340> when<00:04:33.610> you're<00:04:33.820> twisting

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
the main stem out when you're twisting

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:41.460 
the main stem out when you're twisting
it<00:04:36.449> situ<00:04:37.449> ting<00:04:37.960> I'll<00:04:38.380> be<00:04:38.590> doing<00:04:40.440> every<00:04:41.440> week

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
it situ ting I'll be doing every week

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.240 
it situ ting I'll be doing every week
and<00:04:42.100> twisting<00:04:42.789> I'll<00:04:43.120> be<00:04:43.300> doing<00:04:43.600> every<00:04:43.900> week<00:04:44.250> so

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
and twisting I'll be doing every week so

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.370 
and twisting I'll be doing every week so
you<00:04:45.310> would<00:04:45.580> twist<00:04:46.120> them<00:04:46.300> in<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.930> then<00:04:47.110> take

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
you would twist them in and then take

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.060 
you would twist them in and then take
the<00:04:47.530> side<00:04:47.710> tubes<00:04:47.979> out

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.310 

I<00:04:54.100> like<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:55.000> take<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.450> leaves<00:04:55.690> off<00:04:55.990> the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
I like to take the leaves off the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.790 
I like to take the leaves off the
tomatoes<00:04:57.310> as<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.300> trustees<00:04:58.720> get<00:04:58.960> ready<00:04:59.200> it

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
tomatoes as the trustees get ready it

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.240 
tomatoes as the trustees get ready it
helps<00:05:00.250> them<00:05:00.460> ripen<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.350> it<00:05:02.350> also<00:05:02.590> puts<00:05:03.070> some

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
helps them ripen and it also puts some

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.760 
helps them ripen and it also puts some
airflow<00:05:03.460> around<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.270> bottom<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:05.080> plant

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
airflow around the bottom of the plant

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.270 
airflow around the bottom of the plant
and<00:05:06.190> we<00:05:07.060> need<00:05:07.990> airflow<00:05:08.440> around<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.860> bottom<00:05:09.160> of

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
and we need airflow around the bottom of

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.370 
and we need airflow around the bottom of
the<00:05:09.400> plants<00:05:09.790> to<00:05:10.360> stop<00:05:10.630> botrytis

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
the plants to stop botrytis

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.740 
the plants to stop botrytis
getting<00:05:12.070> into<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.520> main<00:05:12.730> stem<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.360> killing

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
getting into the main stem and killing

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.540 
getting into the main stem and killing
the<00:05:13.900> plant<00:05:14.170> off<00:05:16.590> leaves<00:05:17.590> either<00:05:17.830> break<00:05:18.280> off

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
the plant off leaves either break off

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.420 
the plant off leaves either break off
well<00:05:18.910> pulling<00:05:19.750> them<00:05:19.930> down<00:05:19.960> or<00:05:20.470> pulling<00:05:21.190> them

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
well pulling them down or pulling them

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.880 
well pulling them down or pulling them
up<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.300> depends<00:05:22.750> on<00:05:22.840> which<00:05:23.050> variety<00:05:23.740> you

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
up and it depends on which variety you

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.270 
up and it depends on which variety you
have<00:05:23.920> so<00:05:24.880> it's<00:05:25.540> it's<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.200> sort<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.650> test<00:05:26.980> to

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
have so it's it's a sort of a test to

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.330 
have so it's it's a sort of a test to
see<00:05:27.490> if<00:05:27.520> they'll<00:05:28.080> break<00:05:29.080> upwards<00:05:29.680> or<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:30.100> break

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
see if they'll break upwards or to break

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.420 
see if they'll break upwards or to break
upwards<00:05:30.820> best<00:05:31.150> or<00:05:31.840> break<00:05:32.410> down<00:05:32.710> ones<00:05:33.010> best

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
upwards best or break down ones best

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.410 
upwards best or break down ones best
this<00:05:33.880> variety<00:05:34.150> bricks<00:05:34.780> easily<00:05:35.770> upwards<00:05:36.420> and

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
this variety bricks easily upwards and

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.300 
this variety bricks easily upwards and
I'm<00:05:37.570> going<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:37.900> take<00:05:38.140> off<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.830> trustees

plant I do like to twist them before I

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.540 
plant I do like to twist them before I
take<00:07:27.520> massage<00:07:27.880> in<00:07:28.180> fact<00:07:29.070> and<00:07:30.070> what<00:07:30.340> I'm<00:07:30.520> doing

take massage in fact and what I'm doing

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.450 
take massage in fact and what I'm doing
is<00:07:30.970> moving<00:07:31.510> the<00:07:31.660> plant<00:07:31.960> around<00:07:32.680> the<00:07:33.100> string

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:33.460 
is moving the plant around the string

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.409 
is moving the plant around the string
and<00:07:34.410> making<00:07:35.410> sure<00:07:35.620> the<00:07:35.889> leaves<00:07:36.150> don't<00:07:37.150> get

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:37.419 
and making sure the leaves don't get

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:41.659 
and making sure the leaves don't get
trapped<00:07:37.750> between<00:07:38.350> the<00:07:38.830> main<00:07:39.040> stem<00:07:39.520> and<00:07:40.139> the

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:41.669 
trapped between the main stem and the

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.330 
trapped between the main stem and the
string<00:07:42.669> if<00:07:43.360> this<00:07:43.630> happens<00:07:44.050> they<00:07:44.770> tend<00:07:45.070> to<00:07:45.160> get

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.340 
string if this happens they tend to get

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.860 
string if this happens they tend to get
botrytis<00:07:45.760> and<00:07:47.970> that<00:07:48.970> will<00:07:49.180> rock<00:07:49.419> through<00:07:49.720> the

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:49.870 
botrytis and that will rock through the

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.280 
botrytis and that will rock through the
main<00:07:50.050> stem<00:07:50.440> and<00:07:50.860> eventually<00:07:51.370> kill<00:07:51.610> the<00:07:51.760> plant

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.290 
main stem and eventually kill the plant

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.950 
main stem and eventually kill the plant
thank<00:07:54.280> you<00:07:54.460> and<00:07:54.670> again<00:07:54.760> we've<00:07:55.600> got<00:07:55.750> a<00:07:55.780> lot<00:07:55.930> more

thank you and again we've got a lot more
sights<00:07:56.410> on<00:07:56.890> this<00:07:57.040> plant<00:07:57.370> and<00:07:57.670> they<00:07:58.390> are<00:07:58.540> still

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:58.900 
sights on this plant and they are still

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.910 
sights on this plant and they are still
between<00:07:59.200> the<00:07:59.560> main<00:08:00.520> stem<00:08:00.940> and<00:08:01.570> the<00:08:01.840> leaf<00:08:02.020> so

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:02.920 
between the main stem and the leaf so

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.840 
between the main stem and the leaf so
I'm<00:08:03.010> going<00:08:03.220> to<00:08:03.250> break<00:08:03.490> that<00:08:03.550> one<00:08:03.940> out<00:08:05.730> there<00:08:06.730> is

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:06.850 
I'm going to break that one out there is

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.960 
I'm going to break that one out there is
another<00:08:07.000> one<00:08:07.330> there<00:08:07.620> between<00:08:08.620> that<00:08:08.860> leaf<00:08:09.730> and

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:09.970 
another one there between that leaf and

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.310 
another one there between that leaf and
the<00:08:10.300> main<00:08:10.450> stem<00:08:10.900> to<00:08:11.590> break<00:08:11.890> that<00:08:12.100> one
