i'm doing a review of the figure so

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.200 
i'm doing a review of the figure so
where's<00:00:34.550> your<00:00:34.640> class<00:00:35.680> Megatron<00:00:37.660> he<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.989> a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
where's your class Megatron he is a

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.380 
where's your class Megatron he is a
small<00:00:43.690> Voyager<00:00:44.690> Class<00:00:44.809> figure<00:00:44.930> compared<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.980> a

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
lot of other Voyager Class figures that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.299 
lot of other Voyager Class figures that
I<00:00:49.129> have<00:00:49.309> known<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:50.690> have<00:00:50.930> collected<00:00:51.589> in<00:00:52.129> my

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
I have known and have collected in my

I have known and have collected in my
time<00:00:52.699> of<00:00:52.870> collecting<00:00:53.870> transformers<00:00:55.390> um<00:00:56.390> but

he's<00:00:57.769> still<00:00:58.010> pretty<00:00:58.220> cool<00:00:58.519> um<00:00:59.800> because<00:01:01.809> he

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
he's still pretty cool um because he

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.780 
he's still pretty cool um because he
rose<00:01:04.690> well<00:01:05.690> I<00:01:05.720> guess<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:07.130> can<00:01:07.280> take<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:07.580> off

that and he looks really cool and the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.910 
Sun glaring down at him makes him even
look<00:02:49.790> cooler<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.020> was<00:02:51.290> telling<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.740> guys<00:02:51.770> a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
look cooler but I was telling you guys a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.300 
look cooler but I was telling you guys a
size<00:02:52.250> comparison<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:53.030> how<00:02:53.150> small<00:02:53.510> he<00:02:53.750> is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
size comparison to how small he is

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.960 
size comparison to how small he is
compared<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.550> Voyager<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:57.460> I<00:02:58.460> guess<00:02:58.760> it's

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
compared to a Voyager and I guess it's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.700 
compared to a Voyager and I guess it's
only<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.240> vehicle<00:02:59.690> mode<00:02:59.840> for<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> robot<00:03:00.830> mode

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
only in vehicle mode for the robot mode

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:09.910 
only in vehicle mode for the robot mode
he's<00:03:03.710> not<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.310> small<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.910> guess<00:03:07.870> maybe<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.290> few

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
he's not so small I guess maybe a few

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.150 
he's not so small I guess maybe a few
inches<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:11.510> Megatron<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.140> still<00:03:12.380> really<00:03:12.680> cool

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
inches but Megatron is still really cool

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.740 
inches but Megatron is still really cool
and<00:03:13.490> I<00:03:13.550> really<00:03:13.580> love<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.240> figure<00:03:15.130> about<00:03:16.750> but

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
and I really love this figure about but

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.920 
and I really love this figure about but
if<00:03:17.900> they<00:03:18.020> have<00:03:18.170> leader<00:03:18.410> class<00:03:18.680> figure<00:03:19.930> they'll

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
if they have leader class figure they'll

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.710 
if they have leader class figure they'll
be epic<00:03:21.970> but<00:03:22.970> I'll<00:03:23.060> not<00:03:23.210> we'll<00:03:23.390> be<00:03:23.420> able<00:03:23.570> to

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
be epic but I'll not we'll be able to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.060 
be epic but I'll not we'll be able to
get<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.020> because<00:03:24.170> I'm<00:03:24.380> going<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.710> get<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:24.890> few

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
get it because I'm going to get a few

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.330 
get it because I'm going to get a few
figures<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.790> then<00:03:26.510> we<00:03:26.660> have<00:03:26.810> mud<00:03:27.020> flap<00:03:27.340> but

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
figures and then we have mud flap but

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.210 
figures and then we have mud flap but
this<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.820> size<00:03:29.030> comparison<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.750> them

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
this is just a size comparison to them
