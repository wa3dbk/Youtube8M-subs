00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:08.470
 hello good again here we are going 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.290
 to finish doing the demonstration 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:15.040
 of the psuv sanding here we already have our 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:19.090
 iron is regulated the 380 in this 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.439
 moment has 3 176 degrees even and a 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.439
 90 seconds 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.600
 we have ready the glasses that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.620
 we prepare previously 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.340
 and the printed sheets 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.340
 in a mirror 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.060
 then what we are going to do now 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.050
 is to accommodate it 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.610
 and proceed to iron the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.120
 here is about to end 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.390
 I remind you that these temperatures are 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.970
 of reference depends a lot on the type of 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.090
 iron and power that are 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.090
 using 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.470
 to achieve temperature and quality 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.110
 of the transfer 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.900
 and another matter be very careful 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.900
 because it's hot 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.560
 we can see it more the sheet more 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.580
 white completely for 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.780
 that stands out or is noticed 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.780
 in floods 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.740
 and we are going to remove it 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.270
 What is it 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.020
 yes 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.020
 and you can see 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.990
 and news 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.990
 It is transfer 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.500
 happy 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.319
 and this is an example of transfer 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.689
 on glass 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.929
 we have prepared the following 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.929
 pieces 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.020
 keep in mind that you need to perform 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.980
 tests 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.530
 of which the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.180
 thicknesses and types of material 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.239
 they change a lot the requirements in 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.920
 Regarding time temperature and pressure 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.910
 We are generally going to use a 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.709
 low or medium pressure because also if 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.000
 we stressed too much material we run 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.000
 the risk of it breaking 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.960
 and we remove 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.930
 let's retire I'll help in this 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.490
 moment with a 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.500
 the baker's clothespin 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.650
 and here we have a transfer 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.620
 I want to show you see the difference between 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.580
 over and over here though the time and the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.420
 temperature were the same as are two 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.870
 pieces 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.489
 the heat that the two pieces need 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.720
 it would be higher 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.720
 the time that would be longer 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.830
 here it is a little more but still 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:38.090
 appear the transfer 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.090
 let's remove it 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.540
 let's put the last good too 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.870
 there what happened we put the glass by 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.610
 above and the paper below it here 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.640
 again 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.380
 let's put the paper over there is 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.050
 our glass 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:03.830
 and we proceed 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:06.920
 at this moment with 383 and 90 seconds 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.140
 at the end of the last sample 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.930
 to breathe let's breathe in this 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.939
 moment the biggest sample 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.820
 what I told them if we do not have 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:20.269
 careful about the pressure we can 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.100
 fracture the piece this fracture is not 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.100
 because this fracture is by pressure 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.260
 I'm going to put it here 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.040
 but I want to show you at this time 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.659
 the difference in quality 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.220
 in the transfer 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.759
 the paper up 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.759
 also the paper up 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.500
 and the paper 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.500
 first larry in this last case 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.720
 here we were observing the test with 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.450
 the paper on top of the glass 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.450
 the test with the bid on the paper 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.770
 paper on top of the glass 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.770
 and glass on paper 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.600
 and put the white paper in the part 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.600
 below is to be obvious 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.290
 as we can observe more clearly the 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.290
 transfer
