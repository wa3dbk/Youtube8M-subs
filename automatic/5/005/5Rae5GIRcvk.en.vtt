know we're gonna know more than likely
when<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.020> happens<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.530> gonna<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
when that happens you're gonna have a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.390 
when that happens you're gonna have a
little<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> time<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:09.420> much<00:01:10.280> but<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> little

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
little bit of time not much but a little

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.090 
little bit of time not much but a little
bit<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.750> depends<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> initial

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
bit and it all depends on that initial

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.630 
bit and it all depends on that initial
x-ray<00:01:14.700> blast<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.540> thing<00:01:15.650> rips<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.920> before

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
x-ray blast that thing rips to before

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.940 
x-ray blast that thing rips to before
anything<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.210> hits<00:01:18.810> earth<00:01:19.080> before<00:01:19.380> anything

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
anything in hits earth before anything

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.030 
anything in hits earth before anything
and<00:01:20.720> that<00:01:21.720> gets<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.320> quickly<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and that gets here very quickly and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.950 
and that gets here very quickly and
that's<00:01:23.790> where<00:01:23.939> they<00:01:24.030> talk<00:01:24.210> about<00:01:24.509> having<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that's where they talk about having a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.100 
that's where they talk about having a
radio<00:01:25.740> blackout<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.880> polar<00:01:27.090> regions<00:01:27.540> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
radio blackout in the polar regions you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.950 
radio blackout in the polar regions you
know<00:01:28.229> stuff<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.759> happens<00:01:30.270> when<00:01:30.840> we

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
know stuff like that it happens when we

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
know stuff like that it happens when we
keep<00:01:31.110> glancing<00:01:31.320> blows<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.340> something

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
keep glancing blows and it's something

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
keep glancing blows and it's something
we'll<00:01:32.820> probably<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.390> could<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.259> this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
we'll probably you could see with this

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.249 
we'll probably you could see with this

a<00:01:51.509> beautiful<00:01:51.960> I've<00:01:52.170> reported<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.710> them<00:01:52.860> before

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
a beautiful I've reported on them before

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.749 
a beautiful I've reported on them before
up<00:01:53.460> close<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.329> good<00:01:54.630> shots<00:01:55.310> look<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
up close really good shots look like you

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.490 
up close really good shots look like you
know<00:01:56.880> pillars<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.450> light<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> night<00:01:58.170> sky

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
know pillars of light in the night sky

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.700 
know pillars of light in the night sky
beautiful<00:01:59.719> and<00:02:00.719> what<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:03.409> probably<00:02:04.409> just

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
beautiful and what I think probably just

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.119 
beautiful and what I think probably just
as<00:02:05.060> amazing<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.710> amount<00:02:07.950> of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
as amazing here is the amount of

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.940 
as amazing here is the amount of
fireballs<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:09.410> normally<00:02:10.410> they're<00:02:10.619> sitting

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
fireballs but normally they're sitting
