00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
out of this if you just touch up the tip

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.140 
out of this if you just touch up the tip
work<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:20.070> we're<00:00:20.220> always<00:00:20.400> typing<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
work because we're always typing and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.390 
work because we're always typing and
constantly<00:00:21.660> doing<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.770> even<00:00:23.220> though<00:00:23.250> she

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
constantly doing this so even though she

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.120 
constantly doing this so even though she
has<00:00:23.730> raggedy<00:00:24.480> cuticles<00:00:25.020> like<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.470> we're

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
has raggedy cuticles like this we're

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.800 
has raggedy cuticles like this we're
going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> touch<00:00:26.520> up<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.699> color<00:00:27.000> first<00:00:27.360> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
going to touch up the color first and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.679 
going to touch up the color first and
then<00:00:28.739> let<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.070> completely<00:00:29.759> dry<00:00:30.150> because<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
then let it completely dry because you

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.080 
then let it completely dry because you
don't<00:00:30.869> want<00:00:30.930> any<00:00:31.259> oil<00:00:32.219> rights<00:00:32.550> door<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
don't want any oil rights door the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.360 
don't want any oil rights door the
lotion<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.379> I<00:00:34.440> could<00:00:34.649> see<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.010> she<00:00:35.070> had<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
lotion so I could see that she had a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.330 
lotion so I could see that she had a
nick<00:00:35.730> from<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.809> previous<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:38.070> she<00:00:38.219> was

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
nick from the previous when she was

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.020 
nick from the previous when she was
trying<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.700> dry<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:40.770> easily<00:00:41.340> touch<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.879> up

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
trying to dry so to easily touch that up

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.569 
trying to dry so to easily touch that up

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249 
fingers more the easiest way to control

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:59.919 
fingers more the easiest way to control
it<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.579> home<00:00:56.749> we<00:00:57.749> have<00:00:57.929> facebook<00:00:58.530> prep<00:00:58.859> here

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
it at home we have facebook prep here

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.630 
it at home we have facebook prep here
because<00:01:00.929> brush<00:01:01.229> is<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.710> much<00:01:01.859> easier<00:01:02.010> i'm

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
because brush is so much easier i'm

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.969 
because brush is so much easier i'm
going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> dip<00:01:03.179> the<00:01:03.359> brush<00:01:03.569> in<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.110> posh<00:01:04.409> remover

going to dip the brush in a posh remover
and<00:01:06.200> stroke<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.440> even<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.190> that<00:01:08.400> like

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and stroke this even like that like

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.620 
and stroke this even like that like
patch<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.659> hole

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
patch a hole

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.709 
patch a hole
this<00:01:11.229> is<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.439> good<00:01:11.619> trick<00:01:11.920> if<00:01:12.100> you<00:01:12.420> come<00:01:13.420> you

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
this is a good trick if you come you

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.359 
this is a good trick if you come you
know<00:01:13.840> whether<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.409> do<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.560> at<00:01:14.740> home<00:01:14.770> or<00:01:15.189> in<00:01:15.219> the

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
know whether you do it at home or in the

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.550 
know whether you do it at home or in the
salon<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.360> do<00:01:16.570> get<00:01:16.750> little<00:01:16.990> things<00:01:17.289> like

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
salon that you do get little things like

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.770 
salon that you do get little things like
this<00:01:17.799> because<00:01:18.159> either<00:01:18.789> were<00:01:19.030> impatient<00:01:19.390> or

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
this because either were impatient or

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.139 
this because either were impatient or
whatever<00:01:20.649> so<00:01:20.920> we're<00:01:21.039> just<00:01:21.280> constantly

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
whatever so we're just constantly

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.660 
whatever so we're just constantly
because<00:01:22.780> we're<00:01:22.930> weak<00:01:23.399> touching<00:01:24.399> everything

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
because we're weak touching everything

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.179 
because we're weak touching everything
anyway<00:01:25.299> so<00:01:25.750> we're<00:01:25.960> just<00:01:25.990> going<00:01:26.289> to<00:01:26.380> make<00:01:26.950> this

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
anyway so we're just going to make this

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.889 
anyway so we're just going to make this
smooth<00:01:27.579> edge<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.860> for<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.220> tip<00:01:30.490> we're<00:01:30.899> with

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
smooth edge and for the tip we're with

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.139 
smooth edge and for the tip we're with
the<00:01:31.990> same<00:01:32.229> color<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.799> had<00:01:33.039> before<00:01:33.220> our

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
the same color that you had before our

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.309 
the same color that you had before our
ball<00:01:34.780> caught<00:01:35.049> or<00:01:35.259> this<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:38.140> most

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
ball caught or this and the most

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.590 
ball caught or this and the most
important<00:01:38.799> thing<00:01:38.979> is<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.460> control<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.240> amount

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
important thing is to control the amount

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.809 
important thing is to control the amount
of<00:01:40.899> Nair<00:01:41.140> power<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.399> don't<00:01:42.549> want<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.729> have

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
of Nair power so you don't want to have

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.660 
of Nair power so you don't want to have
a<00:01:42.849> goopy<00:01:43.299> edge<00:01:43.539> and<00:01:43.959> the<00:01:44.170> best<00:01:44.470> trick<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.429> is

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
a goopy edge and the best trick of it is

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.399 
a goopy edge and the best trick of it is
that<00:01:45.789> you<00:01:46.090> want<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.360> bend<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.899> brush<00:01:47.140> like

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
that you want to bend the brush like

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.279 
that you want to bend the brush like
this<00:01:47.759> both<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:49.090> because<00:01:49.599> because<00:01:50.049> it's<00:01:50.229> just

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
this both I because because it's just

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.749 
this both I because because it's just
tip<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.069> don't<00:01:51.250> want<00:01:51.429> a<00:01:51.640> lot<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.860> polish<00:01:53.860> now

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
tip you don't want a lot of polish now

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.279 
tip you don't want a lot of polish now
you're<00:01:54.939> going<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.179> have<00:01:55.270> uneven<00:01:55.569> surface<00:01:56.080> like

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
you're going to have uneven surface like

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.870 
you're going to have uneven surface like
this<00:01:56.319> but<00:01:56.770> don't<00:01:56.979> worry<00:01:57.189> about<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.580> because

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
this but don't worry about it because

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.449 
this but don't worry about it because
we're<00:01:58.090> going<00:01:58.209> to<00:01:58.299> put<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.509> top<00:01:58.750> coat<00:01:58.990> over<00:01:59.289> it

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:23.940 

so<00:02:03.459> they're<00:02:03.640> less<00:02:03.819> polish<00:02:04.329> is<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:04.750> better

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.190 

now<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.670> course<00:02:24.730> I'm<00:02:25.209> doing<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.599> for<00:02:25.660> her<00:02:26.050> and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
now of course I'm doing this for her and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.809 
now of course I'm doing this for her and
if<00:02:26.260> she<00:02:26.379> does<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.680> by<00:02:26.860> herself<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.670> going

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
if she does this by herself it's going

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:28.650 
if she does this by herself it's going
to<00:02:27.879> be<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> little<00:02:28.120> bit<00:02:28.239> more<00:02:28.420> challenging

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
to be a little bit more challenging

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.380 
to be a little bit more challenging
because<00:02:29.319> you're<00:02:29.890> doing<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.160> all<00:02:30.310> your<00:02:30.489> self

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
because you're doing it all your self

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
because you're doing it all your self
but<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.410> same<00:02:32.709> concept<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:34.290> would<00:02:35.290> have

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
but it's the same concept I would have

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.820 
but it's the same concept I would have
done<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.680> myself<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:36.310> had<00:02:36.459> nail<00:02:36.610> polish<00:02:37.000> on

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:55.780 

basically<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.090> fill<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.420> whole

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.479 

and<00:02:56.269> I'm<00:02:56.450> just<00:02:56.629> dipping<00:02:57.019> my<00:02:57.049> thumb<00:02:57.650> into<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
and I'm just dipping my thumb into the

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.390 
and I'm just dipping my thumb into the
asset<00:02:58.969> pounds<00:02:59.269> that<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.510> have<00:02:59.659> to<00:02:59.780> clean<00:03:00.260> up

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
asset pounds that I have to clean up

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.520 
asset pounds that I have to clean up
with<00:03:01.400> any<00:03:01.579> cotton<00:03:01.909> edge<00:03:02.269> like<00:03:02.569> q-tips<00:03:02.930> or

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
with any cotton edge like q-tips or

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.929 
with any cotton edge like q-tips or
anything<00:03:03.799> like<00:03:03.829> that<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.730> most

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
anything like that so this is most

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.349 
anything like that so this is most
important<00:03:05.359> thing<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.569> bend<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.079> brush<00:03:06.349> and

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
important thing to bend the brush and

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.890 
important thing to bend the brush and
put<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.569> side<00:03:08.920> access<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.370> nail<00:03:10.700> polish<00:03:10.909> to

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
put the side access of nail polish to

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.039 
put the side access of nail polish to
wipe<00:03:12.109> it<00:03:12.349> off<00:03:12.530> on<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.859> side<00:03:13.099> of<00:03:13.129> the<00:03:13.870> lip<00:03:14.870> of

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
wipe it off on the side of the lip of

wipe it off on the side of the lip of
the<00:03:15.109> bottle<00:03:16.000> they<00:03:17.000> have<00:03:17.180> more<00:03:17.390> control

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.869 

and<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.110> is<00:03:35.260> great<00:03:35.470> refresher<00:03:36.129> if<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.610> type

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
brand this is the same concept now i'm

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.660 
brand this is the same concept now i'm
going<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.650> i<00:03:53.769> see<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.160> little<00:03:54.430> hole<00:03:54.640> there

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:11.640 

you're<00:04:03.400> going<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:03.610> let<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.790> dry<00:04:03.880> completely

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.660 

this<00:04:12.189> is<00:04:12.370> how<00:04:12.549> come

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.840 

again<00:04:16.739> dip<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.769> little<00:04:17.919> bit<00:04:18.250> like<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.669> an

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
again dip a little bit like this an

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.340 
again dip a little bit like this an
amount<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.450> know<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.810> need<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:20.079> little

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
amount and I know that I need a little

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:40.959 
amount and I know that I need a little
bit<00:04:20.620> more

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.479 

and<00:04:41.539> I'm<00:04:41.689> kind<00:04:41.989> of<00:04:42.049> pressing<00:04:42.679> to<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.009> edges

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:43.489 
and I'm kind of pressing to the edges

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:46.989 
and I'm kind of pressing to the edges
that<00:04:44.059> have<00:04:44.329> a<00:04:44.629> little<00:04:44.929> bit<00:04:45.019> of<00:04:45.169> tip<00:04:46.009> line<00:04:46.309> to

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:46.999 
that have a little bit of tip line to

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:53.679 
that have a little bit of tip line to
blend<00:04:47.389> in<00:04:47.569> a<00:04:47.779> little<00:04:48.049> bit<00:04:48.379> even<00:04:52.059> just<00:04:53.059> put<00:04:53.599> a

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:53.689 
blend in a little bit even just put a

00:04:53.689 --> 00:05:06.420 
blend in a little bit even just put a
slight<00:04:54.199> pressure<00:04:54.499> off

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.940 

and<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:07.150> color<00:05:07.420> is<00:05:07.870> different<00:05:08.170> now<00:05:08.620> but<00:05:08.830> by

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
and the color is different now but by

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.000 
and the color is different now but by
the<00:05:09.010> time<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.430> dries<00:05:09.670> it<00:05:09.700> should<00:05:10.180> blend

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
the time it dries it should blend

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.260 
the time it dries it should blend
because<00:05:12.010> one<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.370> what<00:05:12.670> what<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.120> not

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.360
