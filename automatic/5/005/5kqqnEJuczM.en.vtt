breathable it's got a gore-tex membrane
and<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.619> depending<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.070> your<00:00:26.189> temperature

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
and really depending on your temperature

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.460 
and really depending on your temperature
tolerances<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.990> believe<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.199> this

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
tolerances I have to believe that this

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.349 
tolerances I have to believe that this
glove<00:00:28.740> from<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.550> functionality<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
glove from a functionality and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.479 
glove from a functionality and
application<00:00:31.080> standpoint<00:00:31.410> would<00:00:31.949> probably

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
application standpoint would probably

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
application standpoint would probably
get<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.790> through<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.660> know<00:00:33.750> early<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.440> mid

what<00:02:15.049> gore-tex<00:02:15.620> does<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.040> well<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.730> while

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
what gore-tex does so well is that while

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.539 
what gore-tex does so well is that while
it<00:02:17.180> won't<00:02:17.360> let<00:02:17.480> any<00:02:17.750> outside<00:02:17.870> water<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:18.980> it

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
it won't let any outside water in it

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.580 
it won't let any outside water in it
will<00:02:19.700> allow<00:02:20.030> water<00:02:20.450> vapor<00:02:20.870> go<00:02:21.170> one<00:02:21.439> direction

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
will allow water vapor go one direction

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.920 
will allow water vapor go one direction
and<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.459> will<00:02:22.489> evaporate<00:02:22.879> through<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.810> what

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
and it will evaporate through so what

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.539 
and it will evaporate through so what
happens<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.409> that<00:02:24.439> breathability<00:02:25.040> factor

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
happens is that breathability factor

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.699 
happens is that breathability factor
your<00:02:25.909> hand<00:02:26.090> sweats<00:02:26.390> your<00:02:26.930> hand<00:02:27.109> heats<00:02:27.319> up<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
your hand sweats your hand heats up and

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.440 
your hand sweats your hand heats up and
that<00:02:28.159> water<00:02:28.459> vapor<00:02:28.670> has<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> chance<00:02:29.359> to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that water vapor has a chance to

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.809 
that water vapor has a chance to
evaporate<00:02:30.049> and<00:02:30.200> go<00:02:30.560> out<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:30.980> as<00:02:31.159> you're<00:02:31.400> riding
