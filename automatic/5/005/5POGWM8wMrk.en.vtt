here where you can you can go through

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.320 
here where you can you can go through
the<00:02:26.910> info<00:02:27.410> check<00:02:28.410> out<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.800> trip<00:02:29.310> time<00:02:29.580> range

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the info check out the trip time range

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.490 
the info check out the trip time range
which<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> actually<00:02:31.050> helps<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.320> calculate

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
which it actually helps you calculate

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620 
which it actually helps you calculate
how<00:02:32.010> far<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.610> thinks<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.510> then

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
how far it thinks you can go and then

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.320 
how far it thinks you can go and then
kind<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.930> your<00:02:34.080> current<00:02:34.470> battery<00:02:34.770> use

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
kind of your current battery use

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.720 
kind of your current battery use

average<00:02:39.510> speed<00:02:39.840> trip<00:02:40.500> time<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.770> mean<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.100> just

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
average speed trip time I mean it's just

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.760 
average speed trip time I mean it's just
got<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> ton<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.910> ton<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.960> options<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.620> there

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
got a ton of a ton of options in there

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.280 
got a ton of a ton of options in there
and<00:02:44.040> then<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.910> dial<00:02:45.150> up<00:02:45.450> or<00:02:45.660> down

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
and then you can you can dial up or down

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.350 
and then you can you can dial up or down
pedal<00:02:46.710> assist<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.430> bike<00:02:47.610> does<00:02:47.820> not<00:02:48.000> have

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
pedal assist so this bike does not have

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.050 
pedal assist so this bike does not have
twist<00:02:49.140> throttle<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:50.190> some<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.580> izip

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
twist throttle like some of the izip

bikes that I was most checking out at
the<00:02:53.760> show<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.740> pedal<00:02:56.010> assist<00:02:56.220> works<00:02:56.460> very

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the show but the pedal assist works very

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.580 
the show but the pedal assist works very
very<00:02:56.850> well<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.600> natural<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.560> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
very well it's natural and this is a

know<00:03:34.440> how<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> shift<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:40.550> as<00:03:41.550> well

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
know how to shift it as well

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.310 
know how to shift it as well
it<00:03:43.050> carries<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.440> weight<00:03:43.650> one<00:03:43.890> -<00:03:45.140> nice<00:03:46.140> and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
it carries the weight one - nice and

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.910 
it carries the weight one - nice and
soft

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
soft

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.820 
soft
I<00:03:51.110> like<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.230> shocks<00:03:53.360> okay<00:03:54.360> -<00:03:55.230> I'm<00:03:55.620> going<00:03:55.740> to

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
I like the shocks okay - I'm going to

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.610 
I like the shocks okay - I'm going to
shift<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.370> up<00:03:56.460> a<00:03:56.580> little<00:03:56.670> bit<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.120> try<00:03:58.110> going

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
shift it up a little bit and try going

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.110 
shift it up a little bit and try going
through<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:59.100> different<00:03:59.850> modes<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.660> up<00:04:01.410> one

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
through the different modes so I up one

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:14.699 
through the different modes so I up one
this<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.330> Niko<00:04:03.720> little<00:04:04.290> bit<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.530> moose

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.409 

yeah<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:16.340> can<00:04:16.459> hear<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.759> thing<00:04:16.940> whirring<00:04:17.329> a

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
yeah you can hear the thing whirring a

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.629 
yeah you can hear the thing whirring a
little<00:04:17.690> bit<00:04:17.840> but<00:04:18.560> I've<00:04:18.650> got<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.859> say<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.340> the

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
little bit but I've got to say that the

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.909 
little bit but I've got to say that the
torque<00:04:19.940> sensing<00:04:20.299> is<00:04:20.419> really<00:04:21.109> quick<00:04:21.380> really

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
torque sensing is really quick really

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.980 
torque sensing is really quick really
smooth<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:22.759> as<00:04:23.210> soon<00:04:23.389> as<00:04:23.539> you<00:04:23.630> start<00:04:23.870> pedaling

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
smooth so as soon as you start pedaling

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:32.430 
smooth so as soon as you start pedaling
it<00:04:24.259> kicks<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:24.620> as<00:04:24.740> soon<00:04:24.860> as<00:04:25.009> you<00:04:25.070> stop<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.520> stops

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:44.140 

beautiful<00:04:33.440> beautiful<00:04:33.770> discs<00:04:42.910> it's<00:04:43.910> hard<00:04:44.060> to

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
beautiful beautiful discs it's hard to

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.640 
beautiful beautiful discs it's hard to
illustrate<00:04:44.600> how<00:04:44.780> well<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.139> thing<00:04:45.199> works

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
illustrate how well this thing works

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.400 
illustrate how well this thing works
just<00:04:46.520> out<00:04:46.639> on<00:04:46.669> a<00:04:46.850> you<00:04:47.570> know<00:04:47.690> I'm<00:04:47.960> riding<00:04:48.169> on<00:04:48.350> a

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
just out on a you know I'm riding on a

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
track at Interbike but I did have the

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.010 
track at Interbike but I did have the
chance<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.750> try<00:04:51.020> this<00:04:51.080> out<00:04:51.350> on<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.830> trails<00:04:52.160> in

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
chance to try this out on the trails in

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.170 
chance to try this out on the trails in
outdoor<00:04:54.020> demo<00:04:54.650> day<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:55.130> it<00:04:55.340> works<00:04:55.789> great<00:04:56.120> I

mean<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.510> Boche<00:04:56.660> system<00:04:57.139> is<00:04:57.350> awesome

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
mean the Boche system is awesome

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.980 
mean the Boche system is awesome
definitely<00:04:58.340> top<00:04:58.550> of<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.820> line

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:20.020 

look<00:05:02.990> just<00:05:03.949> immediately<00:05:04.490> takes<00:05:04.789> off<00:05:19.030> it's

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
look just immediately takes off it's

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.010 
look just immediately takes off it's
very<00:05:20.210> agile<00:05:21.400> just<00:05:22.400> I<00:05:22.610> can<00:05:22.849> barely<00:05:23.419> push<00:05:23.840> on

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
very agile just I can barely push on

very agile just I can barely push on
this<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.500> it<00:05:24.979> barely<00:05:25.189> pushes<00:05:25.669> back<00:05:25.849> it's<00:05:26.840> not

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
this and it barely pushes back it's not

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.409 
this and it barely pushes back it's not
like<00:05:27.199> it's<00:05:27.349> taking<00:05:27.710> off<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:28.699> responds<00:05:29.270> almost

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
like it's taking off it responds almost

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.709 
like it's taking off it responds almost
immediately<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.969> the<00:05:31.969> bike<00:05:32.150> handles<00:05:32.659> very

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
immediately and the bike handles very

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:33.750 
immediately and the bike handles very
well

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
I'm gonna try to climb up a little bit

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.010 
I'm gonna try to climb up a little bit
more<00:05:45.729> oh<00:05:45.970> yeah

so<00:06:10.330> there<00:06:10.480> you<00:06:10.570> go<00:06:10.690> little<00:06:10.990> test<00:06:11.350> ride

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.230 

one<00:06:15.380> of<00:06:15.470> the<00:06:15.530> benefits<00:06:15.950> of<00:06:16.160> this<00:06:16.760> mid-drive

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
one of the benefits of this mid-drive

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.660 
one of the benefits of this mid-drive
system<00:06:17.780> like<00:06:17.960> this<00:06:18.170> so<00:06:19.100> you<00:06:19.160> keep<00:06:19.340> all<00:06:19.520> the

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
system like this so you keep all the

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.670 
system like this so you keep all the
weight<00:06:19.820> low<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.330> ground<00:06:20.440> centered<00:06:21.440> on<00:06:21.590> the

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
weight low to the ground centered on the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.830 
weight low to the ground centered on the
bike<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.160> that<00:06:22.190> just<00:06:23.000> makes<00:06:23.150> it<00:06:23.330> even<00:06:23.540> easier

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
bike and that just makes it even easier

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.470 
bike and that just makes it even easier
to<00:06:24.110> pedal<00:06:24.710> around<00:06:24.860> when<00:06:25.220> you're<00:06:25.310> going<00:06:25.550> you

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
to pedal around when you're going you

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.750 
to pedal around when you're going you
know<00:06:26.570> climbing<00:06:26.990> a<00:06:27.020> hill<00:06:27.100> taking<00:06:28.100> some<00:06:28.280> jumps

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
know climbing a hill taking some jumps

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.910 
know climbing a hill taking some jumps
may<00:06:29.240> be<00:06:29.300> going<00:06:29.510> down<00:06:29.630> navigating<00:06:30.380> rocks<00:06:30.620> and

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
may be going down navigating rocks and

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.890 
may be going down navigating rocks and
of<00:06:31.280> course<00:06:31.490> it<00:06:31.610> makes<00:06:31.730> it<00:06:31.910> so<00:06:32.240> much<00:06:32.450> easier<00:06:32.660> to

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
of course it makes it so much easier to

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.170 
of course it makes it so much easier to
change<00:06:33.080> a<00:06:33.290> flat<00:06:33.470> or<00:06:33.890> to<00:06:34.400> service<00:06:34.640> the<00:06:34.880> bike<00:06:35.030> you

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
change a flat or to service the bike you

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.370 
change a flat or to service the bike you
don't<00:06:35.210> have<00:06:35.420> to<00:06:35.510> worry<00:06:35.660> about<00:06:35.720> a<00:06:35.900> hub<00:06:36.140> motor

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
don't have to worry about a hub motor

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.440 
don't have to worry about a hub motor
getting<00:06:36.740> in<00:06:36.830> the<00:06:36.920> way<00:06:37.040> and<00:06:37.340> tightening<00:06:38.300> it<00:06:38.390> a

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
getting in the way and tightening it a

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.420 
getting in the way and tightening it a
certain<00:06:38.960> you<00:06:39.470> know<00:06:39.560> all<00:06:39.950> these<00:06:40.100> different

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
certain you know all these different

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.220 
certain you know all these different
specs<00:06:40.760> that<00:06:40.850> you<00:06:41.000> and<00:06:41.600> the<00:06:41.690> cables<00:06:42.110> and

specs that you and the cables and

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.170 
specs that you and the cables and
everything<00:06:42.290> I<00:06:42.770> really<00:06:43.100> think<00:06:43.370> this<00:06:43.490> is<00:06:43.670> this

everything I really think this is this
kind<00:06:44.390> of<00:06:44.510> the<00:06:44.570> future<00:06:44.750> of<00:06:46.090> especially<00:06:47.090> a

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
kind of the future of especially a
