00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.490 

greetings<00:00:30.480> everyone<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.199> time<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
greetings everyone it's that time of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.619 
greetings everyone it's that time of
year<00:00:31.650> again<00:00:32.149> we<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.510> set<00:00:33.870> up<00:00:34.760> my<00:00:35.760> warmest

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
year again we have set up my warmest

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.410 
year again we have set up my warmest
board<00:00:37.199> trap<00:00:37.790> contraption<00:00:39.199> that's<00:00:40.199> set<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
board trap contraption that's set and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.509 
board trap contraption that's set and
connected<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> spring<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:44.190> down<00:00:44.400> the

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
connected to a spring right down the

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.670 
connected to a spring right down the
hill<00:00:44.670> over<00:00:44.909> here<00:00:45.150> let's<00:00:45.989> run<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.379> through<00:00:46.650> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
hill over here let's run up through a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.009 
hill over here let's run up through a
pipe<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:47.250> spirals<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.449> so<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.839> double

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
pipe with spirals in it so it's a double

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.560 
pipe with spirals in it so it's a double
spiral<00:00:49.350> pipe<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.250> brings<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.730> right<00:00:50.970> here

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
spiral pipe that brings it right here

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.430 
spiral pipe that brings it right here
this<00:00:52.409> then<00:00:52.710> comes<00:00:53.070> out<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> another<00:00:53.760> spiral

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
this then comes out to another spiral

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
this then comes out to another spiral
unit<00:00:55.440> right<00:00:55.710> there<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.309> spiral<00:00:56.760> Isis<00:00:57.089> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
unit right there that spiral Isis the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.899 
unit right there that spiral Isis the
water<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.860> then<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:58.949> goes<00:00:59.070> into<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.519> board

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
water and then it goes into these board

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.899 
water and then it goes into these board
trap<00:01:00.239> units<00:01:00.720> each<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.769> of<00:01:01.799> these<00:01:01.979> is<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
trap units each one of these is a

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.740 
trap units each one of these is a
magnetic<00:01:03.720> sink<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:05.489> all<00:01:05.790> waste<00:01:06.270> waters

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
magnetic sink and then all waste waters

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230 
magnetic sink and then all waste waters
are<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> go<00:01:07.170> into<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:08.040> big<00:01:08.460> bin<00:01:08.759> here

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
are going to go into this big bin here

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450 
are going to go into this big bin here
in<00:01:09.720> order<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.200> water<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> garden<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.340> i'll

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
in order to water the garden and i'll

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.620 
in order to water the garden and i'll
show<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> how<00:01:11.670> we're<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
show you how we're going to do that and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.679 
show you how we're going to do that and
then<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.619> comes<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> final<00:01:14.689> four

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
then what comes out of the final four

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899 
then what comes out of the final four
trap<00:01:16.080> after<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:17.009> been<00:01:17.130> run<00:01:17.369> through<00:01:17.400> three

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
trap after it's been run through three

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
trap after it's been run through three
spirals<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:18.810> four<00:01:19.079> more<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.650> seven

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
spirals and then four more here seven

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
spirals and then four more here seven
total<00:01:20.159> spirals<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.900> what<00:01:21.900> we're<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.079> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
total spirals is what we're going to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.719 
total spirals is what we're going to
look<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.470> when<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.770> over<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.700> i

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
look at when we get over there but i

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.280 
look at when we get over there but i
wanted<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> show<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.270> how<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.079> this<00:01:25.229> thing

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
wanted to show you how to get this thing

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
wanted to show you how to get this thing
operational<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.520> was<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> very

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
operational because there was a very

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.450 
operational because there was a very
popular<00:01:27.090> video<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:28.049> out<00:01:28.140> last<00:01:28.320> year<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.829> me

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
popular video we put out last year of me

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.389 
popular video we put out last year of me
using<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.909> device<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
using this device and it was kind of a

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.020 
using this device and it was kind of a
quick<00:01:33.359> you<00:01:33.749> know<00:01:33.899> flash<00:01:34.679> in<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:34.979> pan<00:01:35.069> and<00:01:35.700> now

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
quick you know flash in the pan and now

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.010 
quick you know flash in the pan and now
we're<00:01:36.179> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.359> get<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> little<00:01:36.749> bit<00:01:36.840> more

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
we're going to get a little bit more

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.319 
we're going to get a little bit more
particular<00:01:37.679> so<00:01:38.520> i'm<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.789> go<00:01:38.880> over<00:01:38.969> here

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
particular so i'm going to go over here

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.469 
particular so i'm going to go over here
and<00:01:39.390> i'm<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.719> to<00:01:39.780> turn<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.909> unit<00:01:42.299> right

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
and i'm going to turn on the unit right

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.480 
and i'm going to turn on the unit right
here<00:01:42.619> very<00:01:43.619> slowly<00:01:44.219> because<00:01:46.189> this<00:01:47.189> device

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
here very slowly because this device

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.809 
here very slowly because this device
hasn't<00:01:47.729> been<00:01:47.969> used<00:01:48.179> in<00:01:48.359> a<00:01:48.479> while<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:50.549> now<00:01:50.670> it's

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
hasn't been used in a while so now it's

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.809 
hasn't been used in a while so now it's
coming<00:01:51.119> down<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.929> was<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.819> into

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
coming down this was right here into

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.870 
coming down this was right here into
this<00:01:54.149> spiral<00:01:55.109> unit<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.429> then<00:01:56.609> going<00:01:56.639> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
this spiral unit it's then going to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.580 
this spiral unit it's then going to
continue<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.450> over<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:58.109> and<00:01:58.289> eventually

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
continue on over to here and eventually

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.109 
continue on over to here and eventually
you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.429> water<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.969> look

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you can see the water if you look

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.429 
you can see the water if you look
closely<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:00.719> coming<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.049> hear<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.350> can

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
closely it's now coming to hear you can

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.389 
closely it's now coming to hear you can
see<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.649> coming<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.889> the<00:02:01.950> bottom<00:02:02.100> there<00:02:04.399> and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
see it coming out the bottom there and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.059 
see it coming out the bottom there and
i'm<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.609> going<00:02:05.819> to<00:02:05.850> gradually<00:02:06.840> step<00:02:07.380> by<00:02:07.619> step

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
i'm just going to gradually step by step

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.249 
i'm just going to gradually step by step
build<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.840> how<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.140> been

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
build up you can see how it's been

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
build up you can see how it's been
spiraled<00:02:10.740> see<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.130> spiral<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.819> water

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
spiraled see the spiral on this water

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:21.840 
spiraled see the spiral on this water
right<00:02:12.390> here

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.570 

ok<00:02:22.850> now<00:02:23.060> we're<00:02:23.240> filling

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.990 

and<00:02:27.180> basically<00:02:27.360> what<00:02:27.630> I'm<00:02:27.720> doing<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:28.110> just

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
and basically what I'm doing is just

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.270 
and basically what I'm doing is just
priming<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.720> pump<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.560> system<00:02:32.070> we're

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
priming the pump of this system we're

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.590 
priming the pump of this system we're
getting<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> water<00:02:32.910> moving<00:02:33.270> through<00:02:33.390> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
getting the water moving through the

system then I will go through and I will

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.700 
system then I will go through and I will
adjust<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.240> system<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
adjust the system so we can get the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.680 
adjust the system so we can get the
final<00:02:38.010> product<00:02:38.220> coming<00:02:38.550> out<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.760> our<00:02:38.940> fourth

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
final product coming out of our fourth

all<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.310> way<00:02:50.430> here<00:02:50.790> by<00:02:51.210> myself<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.930> my

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
all the way here by myself and my

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.460 
all the way here by myself and my
friends<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.070> lot<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.210> work

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
friends and it was a lot of work

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.500 
friends and it was a lot of work
basically<00:02:55.470> when<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.010> came<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.880> property

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
basically when I came to this property

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.440 
basically when I came to this property
here<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.930> was<00:02:58.590> forced<00:02:59.190> upon<00:02:59.370> me<00:02:59.610> every<00:03:00.210> single

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
here it was forced upon me every single

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.090 
here it was forced upon me every single
thing<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.990> old<00:03:01.110> system<00:03:01.320> broke<00:03:01.710> down<00:03:01.740> and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
thing in the old system broke down and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.530 
thing in the old system broke down and
we<00:03:02.190> replaced<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.850> obviously<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.360> had<00:03:03.450> to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
we replaced it and obviously we had to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.600 
we replaced it and obviously we had to
replace<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.840> with<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> best<00:03:04.860> stuff<00:03:05.010> possible

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
replace it with the best stuff possible

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.390 
replace it with the best stuff possible
which<00:03:06.240> we<00:03:06.450> did<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.840> now<00:03:07.830> we've<00:03:08.130> got<00:03:08.280> it

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
which we did and now we've got it

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.830 
which we did and now we've got it
finally<00:03:08.640> hooked<00:03:08.970> up<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.450> way<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.600> this

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
finally hooked up all the way to this

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.680 
finally hooked up all the way to this
we're<00:03:10.590> going<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.740> do<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.190> final<00:03:11.450> pump<00:03:12.450> near

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
we're going to do in the final pump near

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.240 
we're going to do in the final pump near
a<00:03:12.720> final<00:03:12.959> more<00:03:13.320> trap<00:03:13.560> here's<00:03:13.770> we<00:03:13.950> are<00:03:14.040> going<00:03:14.190> to

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
a final more trap here's we are going to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.730 
a final more trap here's we are going to
actually<00:03:14.490> capture<00:03:15.360> our<00:03:15.660> drinking<00:03:16.260> water<00:03:16.320> and

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
actually capture our drinking water and

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.320 
actually capture our drinking water and
that's<00:03:17.250> going<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.490> be<00:03:17.610> stored<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.150> house

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
that's going to be stored in the house

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.730 
that's going to be stored in the house
and<00:03:18.720> then<00:03:18.870> we'll<00:03:18.990> drink<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.440> over<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.709> next

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
and then we'll drink that over the next

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.760 
and then we'll drink that over the next
few<00:03:20.100> weeks<00:03:20.630> we<00:03:21.630> could<00:03:21.870> drink<00:03:22.140> directly<00:03:22.440> out<00:03:22.740> of

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
few weeks we could drink directly out of

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.800 
few weeks we could drink directly out of
the<00:03:22.830> spring<00:03:23.100> if<00:03:23.190> we<00:03:23.310> wanted<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.670> however<00:03:24.660> this

the spring if we wanted to however this

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.320 
the spring if we wanted to however this
is<00:03:24.990> getting<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.380> high<00:03:25.650> grade<00:03:26.040> formas<00:03:27.000> trap

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
is getting that high grade formas trap

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.720 
is getting that high grade formas trap

way that life primarily does that is

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.729 
way that life primarily does that is
through<00:03:44.430> magnetism<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:46.230> does<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.590> also

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
through magnetism and it does that also
