00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.949 
opportunity to try to get a state so you
like<00:03:27.519> tell<00:03:28.060> each<00:03:28.209> other<00:03:28.329> at<00:03:28.510> least<00:03:28.569> every<00:03:28.930> day

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
like tell each other at least every day

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.840 
like tell each other at least every day
I<00:03:29.079> practice<00:03:29.470> like<00:03:29.650> we<00:03:30.190> got<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.430> come<00:03:30.579> out<00:03:30.700> here

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
I practice like we got to come out here

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.340 
I practice like we got to come out here
every<00:03:30.880> day<00:03:31.209> like<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:31.750> our<00:03:31.870> last

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
every day like it's our last

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.770 
every day like it's our last

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
so that's pretty much motivation for

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.170 
so that's pretty much motivation for
