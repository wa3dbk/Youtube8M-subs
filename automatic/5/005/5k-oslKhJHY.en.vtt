show you guys this 7000 zerolemon
extended<00:00:07.220> versus<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.670> slims<00:00:09.030> all<00:00:09.840> right<00:00:09.990> i

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
extended versus the slims all right i

add<00:00:15.450> both<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.870> these<00:00:15.929> batteries<00:00:16.320> both<00:00:17.279> of

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
add both of these batteries both of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.640 
add both of these batteries both of
these<00:00:17.490> barrier<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.180> saying<00:00:18.420> they<00:00:19.260> last<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
these barrier and saying they last a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.980 
these barrier and saying they last a
long<00:00:19.680> time<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.910> now<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.510> know<00:00:21.630> i'm<00:00:21.840> going<00:00:21.930> to

show you guys you know the difference is
you<00:00:24.869> know<00:00:26.150> which<00:00:27.150> battery<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.869> you

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you know which battery be for you

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.150 
you know which battery be for you
basically<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:29.070> right<00:00:30.470> it<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.949> that's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
my lambs I mean the voltage this is the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.840 
my lambs I mean the voltage this is the
best<00:01:09.110> wall<00:01:10.110> charger<00:01:11.270> get

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
best wall charger get

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.859 
best wall charger get
all<00:01:14.840> right<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:16.220> input<00:01:16.490> AC<00:01:16.790> right<00:01:16.909> there<00:01:17.180> you

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
all right the input AC right there you

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.440 
all right the input AC right there you
guys<00:01:18.049> can<00:01:18.200> clearly<00:01:18.409> see<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.939> sure<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.000> one<00:01:20.060> I

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
guys can clearly see it sure the one I

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.969 
guys can clearly see it sure the one I
just<00:01:23.830> with<00:01:24.830> this<00:01:25.009> matter<00:01:25.220> right<00:01:25.460> here<00:01:26.799> was<00:01:27.799> it

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
just with this matter right here was it

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.270 
just with this matter right here was it
2,300

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
2,300

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.300 
2,300
you<00:01:31.280> can<00:01:31.400> get<00:01:31.490> about<00:01:31.660> 11<00:01:32.660> hours<00:01:32.780> 11<00:01:33.740> 12<00:01:33.980> hours

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can get about 11 hours 11 12 hours

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.510 
you can get about 11 hours 11 12 hours
whatever<00:01:35.300> usage<00:01:35.890> so<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.010> definitely<00:01:37.190> can't

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
whatever usage so you definitely can't

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.250 
whatever usage so you definitely can't
beat<00:01:37.700> that

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
beat that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:48.910 
beat that
definitely<00:01:40.040> worth<00:01:40.130> getting<00:01:41.290> get<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:47.920> that's

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
definitely worth getting get this that's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.450 
definitely worth getting get this that's
awesome<00:01:49.160> to<00:01:49.400> look<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.080> course<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:52.340> got

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
awesome to look and of course you got

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.740 
awesome to look and of course you got
the<00:01:52.550> big<00:01:52.700> boy<00:01:54.280> 7000<00:01:55.280> my<00:01:55.370> life<00:01:55.520> battery<00:01:55.940> right

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
the big boy 7000 my life battery right

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.730 
the big boy 7000 my life battery right
there

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.649 

so<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.859> is<00:02:00.890> double<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.249> battery<00:02:01.579> life<00:02:01.729> it

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
so this is double the battery life it

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.200 
so this is double the battery life it
comes<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.079> TPU<00:02:03.380> case<00:02:03.619> on<00:02:03.859> its<00:02:04.009> left<00:02:04.219> list<00:02:05.090> i

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
comes to the TPU case on its left list i

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.740 
comes to the TPU case on its left list i
get<00:02:05.390> about<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.630> day<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.560> half<00:02:07.360> maybe<00:02:08.360> two

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
get about a day and a half maybe two

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.500 
get about a day and a half maybe two
days<00:02:08.920> dependably<00:02:09.920> then<00:02:10.280> when<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.519> from<00:02:10.789> if

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
days dependably then when you from if

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.809 
days dependably then when you from if
you're<00:02:11.690> constantly<00:02:12.230> on<00:02:12.470> there<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.819> you

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
you're constantly on there like that you

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.699 
you're constantly on there like that you
get<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.000> better<00:02:14.180> day<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.629> 13<00:02:15.049> hours<00:02:15.200> or<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.620> day

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
get a better day in 13 hours or a day

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.850 
get a better day in 13 hours or a day
and<00:02:16.099> eight<00:02:16.610> hours<00:02:16.970> vary<00:02:17.900> some<00:02:18.349> time<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> time

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
and eight hours vary some time to time

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.380 
and eight hours vary some time to time
it's<00:02:19.129> not<00:02:19.220> always<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.730> same<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.790> also<00:02:22.940> depends

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's not always the same it also depends

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.110 
it's not always the same it also depends
on<00:02:23.569> your<00:02:23.720> usage<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.280> all<00:02:25.400> depends<00:02:25.730> on<00:02:25.849> usage

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
on your usage so it all depends on usage

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.869 
on your usage so it all depends on usage
