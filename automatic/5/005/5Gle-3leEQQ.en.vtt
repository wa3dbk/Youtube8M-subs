probably<00:00:26.120> wonder<00:00:27.120> was<00:00:27.270> it<00:00:27.300> November<00:00:27.930> 2012

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
probably wonder was it November 2012

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.970 
probably wonder was it November 2012
trying<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> think<00:00:31.350> is<00:00:31.440> something<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> talk

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
trying to think is something to talk

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.970 
trying to think is something to talk
about<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.640> feel<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:32.879> I've<00:00:33.270> I've<00:00:33.980> not

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
about because I feel like I've I've not

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.060 
about because I feel like I've I've not
made<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> video<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> very<00:00:35.940> long<00:00:36.150> time<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
made a video in a very long time so this

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.890 
made a video in a very long time so this
is<00:00:38.190> something<00:00:38.580> that<00:00:39.090> I've<00:00:39.239> been<00:00:39.270> working<00:00:39.809> on

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
is something that I've been working on

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.189 
is something that I've been working on
and<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.199> not<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.739> great<00:00:41.010> yet<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.540> part<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
and it's not really great yet so part of

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.049 
and it's not really great yet so part of
the<00:00:43.290> message<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.769> that<00:00:44.040> sometimes<00:00:44.909> these

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the message is that sometimes these

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.860 
the message is that sometimes these
things<00:00:45.120> take<00:00:45.540> time

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
things take time

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.070 
things take time
even<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.379> other<00:00:47.220> things<00:00:47.339> come<00:00:47.760> easy<00:00:47.790> so<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:49.050> I

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
even if other things come easy so what I

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.290 
even if other things come easy so what I
want<00:00:49.290> to<00:00:49.350> talk<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.040> what<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:51.269> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
want to talk about is what we like to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.979 
want to talk about is what we like to
call<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.930> side<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.379> side<00:00:52.970> so<00:00:53.970> we<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.780> from

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
call the side to side so we know from

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.490 
call the side to side so we know from
other<00:00:55.199> lessons<00:00:55.769> that<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.900> do<00:00:57.900> a<00:00:58.019> lot<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.290> tongue

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
other lessons that I do a lot of tongue

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.740 
other lessons that I do a lot of tongue
blocking<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.309> single<00:00:59.580> notes<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.720> think

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
blocking for single notes we all I think

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.719 
blocking for single notes we all I think
everybody<00:01:00.989> should<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.680> least<00:01:01.830> know<00:01:02.220> how<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
everybody should at least know how to

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.140 
everybody should at least know how to
tongue<00:01:03.000> block<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:04.670> different<00:01:05.670> octaves<00:01:05.970> or

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
tongue block to get different octaves or

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.000 
tongue block to get different octaves or
split<00:01:06.420> intervals<00:01:06.900> from<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> harmonica<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
split intervals from the harmonica so

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.789 
split intervals from the harmonica so
for<00:01:08.880> example<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.690> put<00:01:09.720> my<00:01:10.229> tongue<00:01:11.299> here<00:01:12.299> I

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
for example if I put my tongue here I

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.149 
for example if I put my tongue here I
can<00:01:13.799> play<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.280> two<00:01:14.460> notes<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> either<00:01:15.000> side<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
can play the two notes to either side a

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.090 
can play the two notes to either side a
one-in-four<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.649> really<00:01:22.799> good

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
one-in-four like and that's really good

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980 
one-in-four like and that's really good
because<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.670> play<00:01:24.210> two<00:01:24.630> notes<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
because you can play two notes at the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.480 
because you can play two notes at the
same<00:01:25.079> time<00:01:25.469> it<00:01:25.619> makes<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.859> harmonica<00:01:26.280> sound

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
same time it makes the harmonica sound

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
same time it makes the harmonica sound
bigger<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.850> cover<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.329> talk<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.049> octaves

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
bigger we cover that talk about octaves

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.039 
bigger we cover that talk about octaves
and<00:01:28.680> split<00:01:28.829> intervals<00:01:29.659> another<00:01:30.659> thing<00:01:30.899> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and split intervals another thing that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.399 
and split intervals another thing that
we<00:01:31.140> talked<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.520> was<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:33.750> very<00:01:33.810> very

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
we talked about was it's very very

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
we talked about was it's very very
common<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:34.920> useful<00:01:35.399> technique<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.240> two

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
common very useful technique the two

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.870 
common very useful technique the two
whole<00:01:36.600> shake<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.350> where<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.679> play<00:01:37.890> three<00:01:38.789> or

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
whole shake right where we play three or

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
whole shake right where we play three or
four<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.270> four<00:01:39.420> mostly<00:01:39.869> four<00:01:40.109> or<00:01:40.170> five

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
four or four mostly four or five

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
four or four mostly four or five
sometimes<00:01:40.590> three<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:40.979> four<00:01:43.640> whether<00:01:44.640> shaking

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
sometimes three and four whether shaking

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.179 
sometimes three and four whether shaking
our<00:01:45.240> head<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.810> maybe<00:01:45.960> we're<00:01:46.259> shaking<00:01:46.679> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
our head or maybe we're shaking the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.370 
our head or maybe we're shaking the
harmonica<00:01:48.950> well<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.280> side<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.729> side<00:01:51.200> puts<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
harmonica well the side to side puts the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.800 
harmonica well the side to side puts the
two<00:01:52.590> together<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.640> another<00:01:54.060> thing<00:01:54.179> that<00:01:54.600> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
two together now another thing that that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.330 
two together now another thing that that
I've<00:01:55.380> always<00:01:55.560> done<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.100> tongue<00:01:56.939> slaps<00:01:57.299> right

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
I've always done is tongue slaps right

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.950 
I've always done is tongue slaps right
so<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.670> build<00:01:59.909> these<00:02:00.090> techniques<00:02:00.570> I'm<00:02:00.780> just

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so as I build these techniques I'm just

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.889 
so as I build these techniques I'm just
showing<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.770> where<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.609> didn't<00:02:03.390> know<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> side

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
showing you where I didn't know the side

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.940 
showing you where I didn't know the side
to<00:02:04.079> side<00:02:04.259> existed<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> very<00:02:06.210> long<00:02:06.479> time<00:02:06.950> and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to side existed for a very long time and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.230 
to side existed for a very long time and
it's<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.399> those<00:02:08.490> things<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.850> once<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
it's one of those things that once you

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.609 
it's one of those things that once you
hear<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
hear it you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.830 
hear it you
it's<00:02:11.069> an<00:02:11.250> epiphany<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.240> some<00:02:12.390> reason<00:02:12.690> I

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it's an epiphany and for some reason I

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.120 
it's an epiphany and for some reason I
never<00:02:12.900> picked<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.500> up<00:02:13.620> probably<00:02:14.130> because<00:02:14.850> I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
never picked it up probably because I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.550 
never picked it up probably because I
don't<00:02:17.130> know<00:02:17.250> why<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.550> missed<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.530> of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
don't know why I missed it but so one of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.839 
don't know why I missed it but so one of
the<00:02:19.710> things

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the things

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.199 
the things
if<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.870> tongue<00:02:22.109> slapping<00:02:22.769> from<00:02:23.159> that<00:02:23.430> that

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
if a tongue slapping from that that

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.449 
if a tongue slapping from that that
split<00:02:25.109> interval<00:02:25.499> or<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.829> octave<00:02:26.249> on<00:02:26.340> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
split interval or that octave on the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.319 
split interval or that octave on the
bottom<00:02:26.819> right<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.540> I'm<00:02:27.659> playing<00:02:27.810> 1<00:02:28.079> 4<00:02:29.329> and

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
bottom right so if I'm playing 1 4 and

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.390 
bottom right so if I'm playing 1 4 and
if<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.569> flutter<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:31.109> tongue<00:02:31.379> in<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.829> out<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.219> can

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
if I flutter my tongue in and out I can

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.119 
if I flutter my tongue in and out I can
make<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.670> sound<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.680> were<00:02:40.739> alternating

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
make it sound so we were alternating

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.099 
make it sound so we were alternating
between<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.819> chord<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.420> b-flat<00:02:45.780> harp

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
between the chord this is a b-flat harp

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.449 
between the chord this is a b-flat harp
so<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.379> F<00:02:46.530> chord<00:02:46.829> if<00:02:47.040> I'm<00:02:47.129> drawing<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:49.459> quickly

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
so the F chord if I'm drawing in quickly

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.610 
so the F chord if I'm drawing in quickly
fluttering<00:02:51.359> my<00:02:51.450> tongue<00:02:51.659> on<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.049> off<00:02:52.169> so<00:02:52.469> it's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
fluttering my tongue on and off so it's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.670 
fluttering my tongue on and off so it's
alternating<00:02:53.040> between<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.639> octave<00:02:54.530> or<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
alternating between the octave or the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.369 
alternating between the octave or the
one<00:02:55.829> on<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.040> 4<00:02:56.280> or<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.120> whole<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:57.810> chord<00:02:58.139> so

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
one on the 4 or the whole the chord so

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.140 
one on the 4 or the whole the chord so
you're<00:02:58.530> getting<00:02:58.829> that<00:03:01.549> well<00:03:02.549> that's<00:03:02.699> that's

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
you're getting that well that's that's

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.059 
you're getting that well that's that's
all<00:03:03.389> I<00:03:03.449> ever<00:03:03.569> knew<00:03:03.959> when<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.230> worked<00:03:04.439> on<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.829> but

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
all I ever knew when I worked on it but

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.189 
all I ever knew when I worked on it but
then<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.669> started<00:03:06.510> hanging<00:03:06.719> out<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:06.959> these

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:07.199 
then I started hanging out with these

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.860 
then I started hanging out with these
like<00:03:07.530> even<00:03:08.069> more<00:03:08.370> insane<00:03:08.969> harmonica<00:03:09.659> players

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
like even more insane harmonica players

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.179 
like even more insane harmonica players
and<00:03:10.139> you<00:03:10.409> know<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> lot<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.859> Little<00:03:11.099> Walter

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
and you know a lot of the Little Walter

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.129 
and you know a lot of the Little Walter
guys<00:03:11.579> figured<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.629> out<00:03:12.780> because<00:03:12.870> Walter

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
guys figured this out because Walter

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.520 
guys figured this out because Walter
started<00:03:13.560> doing<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:13.889> later<00:03:14.219> on<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:15.530> Walter

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
started doing this later on but Walter

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.899 
started doing this later on but Walter
was<00:03:16.709> doing<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.069> what<00:03:17.159> a<00:03:17.189> lot<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.489> guys<00:03:17.609> can<00:03:17.819> do

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
was doing and what a lot of guys can do

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.429 
was doing and what a lot of guys can do
like<00:03:18.060> Kim<00:03:18.239> Wilson's<00:03:18.569> really<00:03:18.840> good<00:03:18.989> at<00:03:19.139> it

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
like Kim Wilson's really good at it

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
like Kim Wilson's really good at it
is<00:03:20.040> take<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:21.120> tongue<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.500> instead<00:03:23.069> of<00:03:23.280> your

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
is take the tongue and instead of your

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.249 
is take the tongue and instead of your
tongue<00:03:23.669> so<00:03:23.849> my<00:03:23.969> finger<00:03:24.299> now<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.659> the<00:03:24.840> analog

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259 
tongue so my finger now is the analog

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.749 
tongue so my finger now is the analog
for<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.620> tongue<00:03:25.829> so<00:03:26.009> I'm<00:03:26.099> blocking<00:03:26.519> say<00:03:26.699> I'm

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:26.759 
for the tongue so I'm blocking say I'm

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.319 
for the tongue so I'm blocking say I'm
blocking<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.299> right<00:03:27.569> there<00:03:28.519> see<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.549> so

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
blocking that right there see that so

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.520 
blocking that right there see that so
let's<00:03:30.509> pretend<00:03:30.629> that's<00:03:30.840> my<00:03:31.019> tongue<00:03:31.290> and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
let's pretend that's my tongue and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.649 
let's pretend that's my tongue and
instead<00:03:31.859> of<00:03:31.919> going<00:03:32.159> right<00:03:34.699> what<00:03:35.699> the<00:03:36.359> tongue

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
instead of going right what the tongue

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.259 
instead of going right what the tongue
is<00:03:36.840> doing<00:03:37.169> is<00:03:37.290> going<00:03:37.439> back<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:37.979> forth<00:03:38.310> so

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
is doing is going back and forth so

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.360 
is doing is going back and forth so
you're<00:03:39.419> alternating<00:03:39.870> between<00:03:40.379> blocking<00:03:41.159> out

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
you're alternating between blocking out

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.990 
you're alternating between blocking out
for<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.209> 1<00:03:42.389> and<00:03:42.569> 4<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.709> 2<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.069> 5<00:03:44.280> or<00:03:44.609> even

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
for the 1 and 4 to the 2 and 5 or even

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.449 
for the 1 and 4 to the 2 and 5 or even
you<00:03:45.840> know<00:03:45.870> further<00:03:46.259> on<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.709> up<00:03:46.859> but<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
you know further on and up but the

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.789 
you know further on and up but the
tongue<00:03:47.729> is<00:03:47.939> rolling<00:03:48.599> back<00:03:48.629> and<00:03:48.930> forth<00:03:49.139> I<00:03:49.349> find

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
tongue is rolling back and forth I find

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.210 
tongue is rolling back and forth I find
this<00:03:49.889> incredibly<00:03:50.609> difficult<00:03:51.199> and<00:03:52.199> I've<00:03:52.349> asked

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
this incredibly difficult and I've asked

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.979 
this incredibly difficult and I've asked
and<00:03:53.340> gotten<00:03:53.609> lessons<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.359> one<00:03:54.509> lesson<00:03:54.780> I

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
and gotten lessons so the one lesson I

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.999 
and gotten lessons so the one lesson I
got<00:03:55.229> from<00:03:55.500> my<00:03:55.590> good<00:03:55.769> friend<00:03:55.829> Danny<00:03:56.579> Valentino

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:58.009 
got from my good friend Danny Valentino

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.589 
got from my good friend Danny Valentino
he<00:03:59.009> said<00:03:59.250> you'd<00:03:59.430> always<00:03:59.639> sort<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.060> sounds<00:04:00.540> like

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
he said you'd always sort of sounds like

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.030 
he said you'd always sort of sounds like
the<00:04:00.780> five<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:02.220> play

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.460 

and<00:04:07.819> I<00:04:07.939> didn't<00:04:08.180> make<00:04:08.269> sense<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.689> me<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.200> kept

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
and I didn't make sense to me and I kept

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.960 
and I didn't make sense to me and I kept
practicing<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:10.099> it<00:04:10.159> didn't<00:04:10.400> work<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:10.790> kept

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
practicing and it didn't work and I kept

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.399 
practicing and it didn't work and I kept
practicing<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.510> didn't<00:04:11.689> work<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:11.989> it's<00:04:12.079> still

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
practicing it didn't work and it's still

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.000 
practicing it didn't work and it's still
only<00:04:12.920> just<00:04:13.310> getting<00:04:14.000> there<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.659> can<00:04:15.379> barely<00:04:15.680> do

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
only just getting there I can barely do

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.530 
only just getting there I can barely do
it<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.160> can't<00:04:16.430> even<00:04:16.489> do<00:04:16.639> it<00:04:16.669> when<00:04:16.790> I<00:04:16.850> perform<00:04:17.299> yet

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
it I can't even do it when I perform yet

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.599 
it I can't even do it when I perform yet
but<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.590> know<00:04:18.680> that's<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.979> process<00:04:19.220> guys

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
but you know that's the process guys

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.810 
but you know that's the process guys
even<00:04:19.850> if<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.239> tough<00:04:20.449> technique<00:04:21.639> for<00:04:22.639> me

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
even if it's a tough technique for me

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.900 
even if it's a tough technique for me
this<00:04:23.120> technique<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.720> secret<00:04:24.199> is<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:25.550> harder

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
this technique the secret is the harder

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.540 
this technique the secret is the harder
I<00:04:25.940> try<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:27.820> more<00:04:28.820> difficult<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.419> is<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.710> it's

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
I try the more difficult it is so it's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.760 
I try the more difficult it is so it's
like<00:04:31.820> it's<00:04:32.180> like<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.570> weird<00:04:32.870> Zen<00:04:33.380> thing

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
like it's like this weird Zen thing

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.250 
like it's like this weird Zen thing
where<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.120> it's<00:04:35.360> tricky<00:04:35.870> because<00:04:36.020> you're

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
where it's a it's tricky because you're

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.529 
where it's a it's tricky because you're
trying<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.680> I'm<00:04:37.430> trying<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.789> train<00:04:38.060> my<00:04:38.240> tongue

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
trying to I'm trying to train my tongue

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.409 
trying to I'm trying to train my tongue
to<00:04:39.050> go<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.770> know<00:04:39.860> very<00:04:40.130> carefully<00:04:41.000> back<00:04:41.210> and

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
to go you know very carefully back and

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.330 
to go you know very carefully back and
forth<00:04:41.660> but<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.260> more<00:04:42.470> carefully<00:04:42.979> I<00:04:43.010> try<00:04:43.280> to

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
forth but the more carefully I try to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.840 
forth but the more carefully I try to
control<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.830> uglier<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:46.039> sounds<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:46.699> it's

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
control it the uglier it sounds so it's

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.240 
control it the uglier it sounds so it's
almost<00:04:47.120> like<00:04:47.449> one<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.229> those<00:04:48.350> topics<00:04:48.710> of<00:04:49.039> like

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
almost like one of those topics of like

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.390 
almost like one of those topics of like
being<00:04:49.460> sloppy<00:04:50.470> but<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:51.590> not<00:04:51.770> sloppy<00:04:52.130> it's

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
being sloppy but it's not sloppy it's

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.370 
being sloppy but it's not sloppy it's
precise<00:04:52.820> but<00:04:53.060> when<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.240> try<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.570> be<00:04:53.750> precise<00:04:54.139> it

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
precise but when I try to be precise it

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.320 
precise but when I try to be precise it
sounds<00:04:55.070> sloppy<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.550> when<00:04:55.639> I<00:04:55.669> when<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.090> allow

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
sounds sloppy and when I when I allow

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.120 
sounds sloppy and when I when I allow
myself<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.840> be<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.050> little<00:04:57.289> sloppy<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.770> guess

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
myself to be a little sloppy and I guess

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.629 
myself to be a little sloppy and I guess
the<00:04:58.280> point<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:58.610> relaxed<00:04:59.410> so<00:05:00.410> it's<00:05:01.039> really<00:05:01.400> cool

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
the point is relaxed so it's really cool

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.240 
the point is relaxed so it's really cool
because<00:05:01.850> I<00:05:02.120> think<00:05:02.570> this<00:05:02.780> this<00:05:03.410> particular

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
because I think this this particular

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.180 
because I think this this particular
technique<00:05:05.080> while<00:05:06.080> difficult<00:05:06.680> for<00:05:06.889> me<00:05:07.039> to

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
technique while difficult for me to

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.950 
technique while difficult for me to
attain<00:05:07.580> is<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:10.400> does<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.120> sound<00:05:11.479> is<00:05:11.750> more

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
attain is it does the the sound is more

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.469 
attain is it does the the sound is more
fluid<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:12.770> sounds<00:05:13.220> actually<00:05:13.729> to<00:05:13.970> me<00:05:14.120> like<00:05:14.360> the

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
fluid it sounds actually to me like the

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.719 
fluid it sounds actually to me like the
notes<00:05:14.750> are<00:05:14.900> liquid<00:05:15.440> instead<00:05:16.310> of<00:05:16.490> being

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
notes are liquid instead of being

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.189 
notes are liquid instead of being
percussive<00:05:17.510> where<00:05:19.419> when<00:05:20.419> when<00:05:20.780> these<00:05:20.930> notes

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
percussive where when when these notes

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.900 
percussive where when when these notes
are<00:05:21.380> going<00:05:21.500> back<00:05:21.710> and<00:05:21.740> forth<00:05:22.220> if<00:05:22.490> I<00:05:22.550> can<00:05:22.669> do<00:05:22.789> it

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
are going back and forth if I can do it

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:35.930 
are going back and forth if I can do it
I'll<00:05:23.030> probably<00:05:23.120> fail

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.340 

okay<00:05:36.940> it's<00:05:37.120> all<00:05:37.390> really<00:05:37.600> not<00:05:37.840> great<00:05:38.140> but<00:05:38.290> you

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
okay it's all really not great but you

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.870 
okay it's all really not great but you
but<00:05:38.650> if<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.520> listen<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.000> later<00:05:40.360> little<00:05:40.750> Walter

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
but if you listen to later little Walter

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.940 
but if you listen to later little Walter
those<00:05:43.810> are<00:05:43.930> guys<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:44.080> are<00:05:44.350> really<00:05:44.500> geeky

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
those are guys that are really geeky

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.640 
those are guys that are really geeky
about<00:05:45.040> it<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:46.120> know<00:05:46.240> send<00:05:46.990> me<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.140> notes<00:05:47.410> and

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
about it you know send me a notes and

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.190 
about it you know send me a notes and
I'll<00:05:47.710> try<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.010> put<00:05:48.250> together<00:05:48.660> some<00:05:49.660> lists<00:05:50.050> of

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
I'll try to put together some lists of

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.990 
I'll try to put together some lists of
when<00:05:50.440> every<00:05:50.680> time<00:05:50.710> you<00:05:50.980> I<00:05:51.010> hear<00:05:51.520> it<00:05:51.640> I<00:05:51.730> try<00:05:51.940> to

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
when every time you I hear it I try to

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.360 
when every time you I hear it I try to
write<00:05:52.570> it<00:05:52.720> down<00:05:52.750> and<00:05:52.990> remember<00:05:53.920> where<00:05:54.160> the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
write it down and remember where the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.250 
write it down and remember where the
where<00:05:54.640> the<00:05:54.670> exactly<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.420> example<00:05:55.720> is<00:05:55.990> so<00:05:56.200> I

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
where the exactly that example is so I

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.780 
where the exactly that example is so I
can<00:05:56.500> you<00:05:56.860> know<00:05:56.950> continue<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.460> teach<00:05:57.580> myself

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
can you know continue to teach myself

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.080 
can you know continue to teach myself
the<00:05:58.060> difference<00:05:58.540> but<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.380> side-to-side<00:06:00.090> it's

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
the difference but the side-to-side it's

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.550 
the difference but the side-to-side it's
definitely<00:06:01.630> one<00:06:01.780> of<00:06:01.810> those<00:06:01.930> higher-level

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
definitely one of those higher-level

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.680 
definitely one of those higher-level
techniques<00:06:04.530> but<00:06:05.530> for<00:06:06.460> like<00:06:06.640> you<00:06:06.850> crazy<00:06:07.120> blues

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
techniques but for like you crazy blues

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.110 
techniques but for like you crazy blues
guys<00:06:07.960> of<00:06:08.590> which<00:06:08.800> I<00:06:08.950> kind<00:06:09.460> of<00:06:09.520> consider<00:06:09.850> myself

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
guys of which I kind of consider myself

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.200 
guys of which I kind of consider myself
it's<00:06:10.960> definitely<00:06:11.680> something<00:06:12.130> worth<00:06:12.580> having

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
it's definitely something worth having

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.000 
it's definitely something worth having
in<00:06:13.570> your<00:06:13.690> bag<00:06:13.870> of<00:06:13.900> tricks<00:06:14.080> because<00:06:14.830> it

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
in your bag of tricks because it

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.920 
in your bag of tricks because it
especially<00:06:15.580> amplified<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.270> think<00:06:16.570> it<00:06:16.660> sounds

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
especially amplified I think it sounds

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.890 
especially amplified I think it sounds
really<00:06:16.990> awesome<00:06:18.120> so<00:06:19.120> but<00:06:19.510> then<00:06:19.630> it's<00:06:19.780> not

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
really awesome so but then it's not

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.720 
really awesome so but then it's not
always<00:06:20.110> easy<00:06:20.380> to<00:06:20.530> hear<00:06:20.830> if<00:06:21.010> somebody's<00:06:21.430> doing

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
always easy to hear if somebody's doing

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.960 
always easy to hear if somebody's doing
this<00:06:21.880> one<00:06:22.150> or<00:06:22.390> doing<00:06:22.690> that<00:06:22.900> one<00:06:23.700> so<00:06:24.700> I<00:06:24.730> don't

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
this one or doing that one so I don't

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.520 
this one or doing that one so I don't
know<00:06:25.060> I'm<00:06:25.240> gonna<00:06:25.330> keep<00:06:25.540> working<00:06:25.780> on<00:06:26.140> it<00:06:26.170> really

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
know I'm gonna keep working on it really

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.620 
know I'm gonna keep working on it really
and<00:06:26.830> I<00:06:26.860> hope<00:06:27.040> I<00:06:27.310> hope<00:06:27.400> I<00:06:27.850> hope<00:06:28.210> to<00:06:28.480> make<00:06:28.600> a

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
and I hope I hope I hope to make a

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.200 
and I hope I hope I hope to make a
couple<00:06:28.900> more<00:06:29.080> videos<00:06:29.440> before<00:06:29.620> Christmas<00:06:30.370> but

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
couple more videos before Christmas but

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.360 
couple more videos before Christmas but
my<00:06:31.420> life<00:06:31.600> is<00:06:31.780> in<00:06:31.930> chaos<00:06:32.200> I<00:06:32.590> wish<00:06:32.740> I'm<00:06:33.040> not<00:06:33.220> going

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
my life is in chaos I wish I'm not going

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.330
