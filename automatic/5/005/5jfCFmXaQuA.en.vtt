nevertheless<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.869> hope<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.110> audience

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
nevertheless and I hope the audience

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.830 
nevertheless and I hope the audience
appreciated<00:01:40.090> what's<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.149> matter<00:01:41.299> Danny<00:01:41.509> you

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
appreciated what's the matter Danny you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.780

never<00:01:41.990> taken<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.289> shortcut<00:01:42.560> before

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.980 

the<00:01:50.790> thing<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.510> when<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.750> started

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the thing is that that when we started

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.210 
the thing is that that when we started
racing<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> World's<00:01:52.620> End<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.860> thought<00:01:53.040> well

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
racing the World's End we thought well

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.710 
racing the World's End we thought well
actually<00:01:53.370> maybe<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.300> make<00:01:54.510> this<00:01:54.660> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
actually maybe we can make this a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.810 
actually maybe we can make this a
trilogy<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:56.010> think<00:01:56.310> people<00:01:56.640> will

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
trilogy and I think people will

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.190 
trilogy and I think people will
understand<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.510> see<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.810> film<00:01:58.080> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
understand when they see the film that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.350 
understand when they see the film that
it<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.800> thematic<00:01:59.160> wrap-up<00:01:59.910> is<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> new

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it is like a thematic wrap-up is a new

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.320 
it is like a thematic wrap-up is a new
story<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.590> new<00:02:01.740> characters<00:02:02.180> but<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
story and with new characters but it

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.410 
story and with new characters but it
does<00:02:03.510> continue<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.500> resolve<00:02:05.400> themes<00:02:06.000> from

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
does continue and resolve themes from

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.190 
does continue and resolve themes from
the<00:02:06.600> other<00:02:06.750> movies<00:02:07.230> it's<00:02:07.650> about<00:02:08.009> closure

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200
