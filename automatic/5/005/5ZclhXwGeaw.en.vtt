00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:17.259
 m is the truth of love jojojojo 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.999
 what 50% and mannerism 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.999
 but 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.669
 the experimentation and the consequent innovations 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.420
 that were developed during the period of the 400 lead to the arrival 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.190
 the change in theory 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.600
 in a moment of fullness of maximum artistic brilliance 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.700
 that consolidates the triumph of classicism 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.070
 50 is therefore a period of splendor of full rebirth 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.410
 that is named like this in attention to the moment in which it develops 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.080
 the beginning of the 16th century 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.780
 It is also an especially fortunate moment 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.280
 by generationally match cradle site of universally renowned artists 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.040
 that give an unsuspected flash to this artistic episode 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280
 Just remember the names of Leonardo da Vinci 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.500
 rafael sanzio 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.439
 or the great miguel angel buonarroti 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.690
 to certify what was said 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.110
 despite all that despite 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.440
 this full Renaissance classicism will not last long 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.070
 the classical language soon becomes repetitive 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.550
 and encorseta the creativity of the artists in a margin too narrow 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.990
 especially if the genius of Miguel Angel is loaded with concerns to innovate 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.149
 and to reorient the paths of art through new criteria 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.330
 an increasingly critical response to the language of the plenary is emerging 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.909
 rebirth that assumes progressively 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.909
 anti classic positions and formal and thematic solutions 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.700
 more imaginative and personal 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.210
 it's the mannerism 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.789
 an artistic period 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.630
 and begins to manifest itself in the second third of the 16th century 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.539
 hill until the end of the painting already 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.689
 will move to a second plane 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.689
 the language of the plenary without presented 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.320
 During the XI meeting, characteristic aspects of the first 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.329
 birth 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.279
 especially the attachment to the classic guidelines 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.149
 however, they are also produced 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:18.889
 certain people who in the Italy of the time 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.249
 that alter the general universe that defined the art of 4 80 euros 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.279
 especially the political imposition of the papacy 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.700
 whose new patronage 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.329
 to turn Rome into the artistic capital of the world at this time 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.740
 53, therefore, of the century of Rome 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.210
 and of the prince fathers who were the greatest patrons of art like July 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.889
 second 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:40.980
 tenth lion 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.689
 or clement seventh 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:43.950
 will be your orders 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.420
 those that attract the capital 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 to the great artists of the moment like Miguel Angel 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.590
 rafael 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.339
 picture na all lover 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.169
 in the field of architecture 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.059
 the classic influence on the use of condoms remains 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.469
 as well as constructive trying elements 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.209
 highlights the construction of new palaces of greater magnificence than 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.859
 in the previous century and of temples that seek 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.119
 a new approach with the centralization of your plants 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:12.940
 in this sense 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.339
 the prolonged work of the new Vatican 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.439
 marks a milestone in the whole century 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.519
 the constructive expert of this second rebirth 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.359
 the work of gift to his lover is achieved 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.560
 something later 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.390
 There will also be the singular legacy shown by the villas of Andrea Palladio 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:35.249
 in sculpture continues the sense that exists of 4 80 euros 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:39.059
 balanced and harmonic and I'm going to thematic preserves the perfect symbiosis 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.329
 between reasons to prost and mythology 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.849
 in any case you can talk 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.590
 of a growing trend 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.509
 to the compositional agitation 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.900
 to the constant search for movement 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.409
 read it monumentality 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.480
 who find their final synthesis in the first pobras of miguel angel 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.290
 the painting although equally balanced and static 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.989
 in a large part of the works 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.450
 rafael or leonardo is very soon with revolutionary contributions 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.520
 as in his mantle 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.509
 with the perspective adrián leonard es k 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.660
 as the wholesale incursions themselves 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.809
 from Rafael himself 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:15.150
 all this without forgetting 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.870
 the growing influence of Venetian painting 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.700
 and add its colorful strength 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.800
 to the classicism of the first pitching not intentions 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.780
 Gil moves away from the limitations 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.960
 the 4 80 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.430
 turning it into a new trajectory 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.600
 whose first step will be marinism 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 and his goal the baroque painting 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.140
 from the second third of the 16th century a new artistic response emerges 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.189
 contrary to the dogmatic imposition of classical orthodoxy 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:44.280
 a new art 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.370
 and a new language much more spontaneous and fanciful 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.740
 which has anti classical proposals 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.539
 is the machinery whose main mentor 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.330
 It will be the emblematic figure 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.309
 by miguel ángel 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:01.569
 as a result of this the 16th century lilian artist still filling by 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.869
 attention to the classical balance by spatial audio versus 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:06.729
 The amplitude 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.270
 the contrasted light in front of the homogeneous the intense chromatism in front 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.639
 to the soft the volumetry in front of the volatility 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.310
 the expressiveness in front of the idealism and the restlessness the surprise and the anxiety 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.020
 against the euro 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.080
 the Mannerist wake of Miguel Angel 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.780
 other authors will follow 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.009
 they will complete the artistic framework of the Menem period 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.979
 in sculpture and despite the artistic monopoly exercised by Miguel Angel 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.580
 in this period other renowned artists appear as neither adds 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.909
 hoben asked if livni 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.300
 in painting but also the influence of Miguel Angel 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.050
 he occupied practically all the work done 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.520
 in the second half of the 16th century 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.649
 especially in its decoration of the Sistine Chapel is no less true 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.610
 in this field, the payroll of painters with their own personality and marked 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.749
 is greater than in other arts 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:02.110
 not only in venice 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.880
 where the personality of tintoretto emerges with enormous force 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.979
 or Peronism 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.300
 but in other areas 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.310
 those that arise painters like parmigianino bronzino arcimboldo 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.470
 pontormo or the own greco that enrich plurally the battering ram 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.559
 madridista in the painting 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:23.450
 the expansion of the Renaissance in the rest of Europe 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.800
 will be an inevitable phenomenon given the enormous strength of the artist no longer 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.219
 16th century 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:32.099
 its adaptation to different European environments 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.240
 they will be any other case 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.439
 and its degree of approach to the Italian art to which they derive 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.330
 it will be different according to the artistic substrate 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.419
 Of each country 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:43.340
 in Spain 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.240
 the weight of the Gothic tradition 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.610
 and the poor success of the classical language 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.770
 will lead to a singular renaissance 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.830
 very ornate in architecture 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.849
 and in general of little humanist content 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.510
 in painting in any case stands out exceptionally 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.430
 the Mannerist and personal style of doménico theotocópuli 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.919
 the greco 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.000
 in the Netherlands and Germany the expressionist vein will predominate 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:09.960
 it had developed brilliantly 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.199
 in the preceding centuries 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.639
 in Germany in the work of painters like maggie smith a rival 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:16.699
 lucas cranach 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.399
 gualberto durero 

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:19.730
 in the netherlands 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.780
 pieter brueghel 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.569
 and the bosco preserve the bright tradition 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.710
 of flamenco painting 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.330
 finally in france 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.879
 the classicism triumph 

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.879
 and will persevere in his art even beyond 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:35.729
 baroque quino
