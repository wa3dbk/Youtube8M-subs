00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.580
 Even though I'm afraid in the water was it a little 9 days it is from the small fish 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.380
 this 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.030
 It is- 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:20.470
 I would like to introduce a little any time using the Yu-like similar products 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:24.580
 Of course the screen size in the sense that the field Faye before in the field of it is disgusting example design 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.930
 It is I think more than is first whether one can say that it is not be better to wide it 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.650
 The actual design is wide space 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.100
 Good order efficiency and those that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.710
 Just a day, our design tool 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.670
 Took a pretty space in a variety of functions is are we the panel has the whether out of the leaguer 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.740
 I will do 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.880
 It is when I was on this scale 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:55.600
 It might be standardized is considerably smaller also referred to as the kind in the leaves of radish 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.600
 I think we can perform how easy things that you're carrying is the in person out in the work of 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.260
 See you at the photoshop now , but this time 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.960
 And switched the application 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.960
 You have to start the person design 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:26.880
 For example, in the sense of producing paper media , 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:30.840
 I think that there were many places that did such things or the confirmation of the final color 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.469
 This time it is app rgb 99% 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.770
 Because there is a place called color was Dibeshon is taken in the form 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:41.189
 That 's the confirmation of the next section, even if you don't have an Asazah freeter 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.560
 Another one to be able to confirm the 12-click on the monitor 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.340
 I think there is no way 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.850
 The Kedomo you have to click in practice this is to expand 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.770
 More than that, it really shines, so it shines 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.360
 Though this is support 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.630
 Since it also can you go in larger size 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.760
 If there is a second-hand house on the line 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.760
 When the enlarged and can be confirmed 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.890
 It is where you say 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:16.690
 Of course color can also be used very efficiently wide working space 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.150
 Also it is one of the bright-like monitor I display manager 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.030
 There was explanation of work par 3 fan, but thought that it was very effective for me of this tree 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.910
 The 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.910
 Because I'm working now 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.900
 For example, from the client's side 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.920
 When a pdf of the configuration has been sent 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.920
 I assume for a moment 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.620
 It is a necessary part in 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.620
 Look like this 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.140
 For example, correction space 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.140
 Hey That's right 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.680
 I liked that there was around this 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.680
 If you have to 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.000
 It is this 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.000
 now 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:21.040
 You can see it, it's a large space, so it's good to be shared now 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.219
 This is a function called egr children 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.250
 Do the necessary places, but in the space first 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:29.250
 I want to fix the location of the small fish Oh and occurred 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.450
 I 'll set the stage a little 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.160
 It is towards the age east indesign in 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.160
 And also it has a knob on the 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:52.540
 It is smooth here 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.540
 Can you confirm that Junk Nakaji got this way ? 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:03.409
 Let's Machida In the part of working while switching various applications 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:06.310
 It is a judgment that the work of the screen being maintained as needed with a wide screen as needed 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.310
 You must go 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:15.959
 Also while it is an example in the meaning of work while 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.959
 Look at the website 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:27.960
 For example, if there is a part of the information that you are very concerned about, such as the video of Half 2 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.960
 It is part 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:40.310
 Tsu and design something to art while looking after pulling as information 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:40.310
 I think this is also the direction of movement of a wide screen 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.959
 I become what I am allowed to be with me is the other day in fact, is it this ustream 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:54.400
 But 

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:57.699
 Other work has picked up here is something larger and become the first semester while looking at these kind of things 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.620
 It is very It is also in this fine setting this 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.620
 Easy sign is prepared 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.509
 Getting up 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:54.689
 Also to be a very effective Well thing called the functions described above looks fine register 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.689
 We respect myself 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:04.920
 Yes the meaning you saw is the actual work 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:10.080
 It is and I design tools and very this display compatibility is good 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:14.460
 I think and also those who use such people, especially those who are digital differences 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.850
 Well, as an offline media, it is also very useful to have a card reader here 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.850
 It is easy 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:24.060
 I also thought 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.020
 By all means use here and take advantage of our creative tools 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.900
 You 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:35.180
 When it comes to sex , something is used to celebrate Bagh 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:37.600
 Because it is exchanged, it is monitor here or everyone is doing soon 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.600
 If you can
