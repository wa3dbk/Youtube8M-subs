00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
very difficult to leave the machine

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.390 
very difficult to leave the machine
because<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.260> might<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.830> one<00:02:02.010> pull<00:02:02.220> away

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
because you might just be one pull away

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:16.040 
because you might just be one pull away
