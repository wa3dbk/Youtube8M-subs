all<00:03:52.180> right<00:03:52.300> here<00:03:52.600> we<00:03:52.630> go<00:03:52.690> kind<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.260> those<00:03:53.410> cards

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
all right here we go kind of those cards

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.550 
all right here we go kind of those cards
so<00:03:53.830> now<00:03:53.920> let's<00:03:54.070> take<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.220> look<00:03:54.310> at<00:03:54.459> what<00:03:54.490> we<00:03:54.640> got

Dino thing fungus all this things if it
looks<00:04:05.050> like<00:04:05.140> it's<00:04:05.230> forwarding<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:05.980> looks<00:04:06.160> like

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
looks like it's forwarding it looks like

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.100 
looks like it's forwarding it looks like
its<00:04:06.459> nose<00:04:06.730> as<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.060> sphincter<00:04:07.570> let<00:04:07.780> me<00:04:07.840> just<00:04:08.020> let

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
its nose as a sphincter let me just let

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.790 
its nose as a sphincter let me just let
you<00:04:08.230> get<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.380> good<00:04:08.590> look<00:04:08.709> at<00:04:08.860> that<00:04:09.070> Oh<00:04:10.560> layer<00:04:11.560> on

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
you get a good look at that Oh layer on

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.030 
you get a good look at that Oh layer on
an<00:04:12.330> energy<00:04:13.330> card<00:04:13.600> special<00:04:14.170> energy<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.709> believe

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
an energy card special energy I believe

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.310 
an energy card special energy I believe
that's<00:04:15.190> just<00:04:15.459> useful<00:04:15.670> for<00:04:16.090> bananas<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.140> don't

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320
