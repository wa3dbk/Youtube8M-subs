00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
was actually rebuilding and I thought

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
was actually rebuilding and I thought
the<00:01:15.180> prongs<00:01:15.420> were<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.689> decent<00:01:15.900> shape<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.500> they

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the prongs were in decent shape and they

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.749 
the prongs were in decent shape and they
weren't<00:01:17.030> no<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.720> an<00:01:18.930> infallible<00:01:19.549> as<00:01:20.549> much
