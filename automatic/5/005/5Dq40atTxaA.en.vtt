00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
performed at a very best for the day and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.830 
performed at a very best for the day and
might<00:02:06.369> have<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.610> chance<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.270> winning<00:02:07.329> South

score<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:31.269> landings<00:02:31.719> a<00:02:31.810> little<00:02:32.019> bit<00:02:32.139> better

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
score the landings a little bit better

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.780 
score the landings a little bit better
and<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> dynamics<00:02:33.129> are<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> little<00:02:33.489> bit<00:02:33.639> better

and the dynamics are a little bit better
as<00:02:33.999> well<00:02:35.099> it's<00:02:36.099> up<00:02:36.219> to<00:02:36.249> the<00:02:36.459> judges<00:02:36.700> though

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:36.969 
as well it's up to the judges though

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:38.220 
as well it's up to the judges though
they<00:02:37.180> might<00:02:37.329> see<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.629> differently<00:02:37.989> they've

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
they might see it differently they've

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.750 
they might see it differently they've
got<00:02:38.409> a<00:02:38.439> different<00:02:38.799> angle<00:02:38.889> than<00:02:39.159> we<00:02:39.310> have<00:02:39.489> here

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.800 

they're<00:02:42.760> quite<00:02:42.969> close<00:02:43.180> then<00:02:43.480> they<00:02:43.569> sit<00:02:43.780> down

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
they're quite close then they sit down

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.869 
they're quite close then they sit down
low<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.500> they<00:02:44.620> watch<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:45.040> vault<00:02:45.280> from<00:02:45.459> under

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
low so they watch the vault from under

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.190 
low so they watch the vault from under
the<00:02:46.000> vault<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.329> it's<00:02:46.599> quite<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.840> different

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
the vault so it's quite a different

it'll<00:02:57.609> just<00:02:57.639> depend<00:02:58.209> on<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.540> second<00:02:59.200> score

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it'll just depend on this second score

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.149 
it'll just depend on this second score
to<00:03:00.069> boost<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.489> average<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.419> two<00:03:01.599> vaults
