now<00:01:02.690> if<00:01:03.679> you<00:01:03.859> take<00:01:04.070> these<00:01:04.280> balls<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:04.970> divide

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
now if you take these balls and divide

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:15.010 
now if you take these balls and divide
them<00:01:05.449> by<00:01:07.570> 2001<00:01:08.710> u<00:01:09.710> equal<00:01:10.340> T<00:01:11.060> V<00:01:11.360> X<00:01:13.240> 9000<00:01:14.240> camera

horn which equals amazing now once you

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.290 
horn which equals amazing now once you
got<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.590> whole<00:02:20.920> equation<00:02:21.190> down<00:02:21.580> which<00:02:22.180> is

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
got that whole equation down which is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.600 
got that whole equation down which is
quite<00:02:22.480> simple<00:02:22.959> equation<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:24.069> can<00:02:24.099> take<00:02:24.430> this

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
quite simple equation you can take this

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.100 
quite simple equation you can take this
amazing<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.190> skew<00:02:27.190> bit<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.150> tenth<00:02:28.569> cubed

you back to Jeff yeah I knew that it's

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.789 
you back to Jeff yeah I knew that it's
like<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> sense<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.810> where<00:02:41.079> it's<00:02:41.380> very<00:02:41.410> simple

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
like a sense of where it's very simple

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.870 
like a sense of where it's very simple
equation<00:02:42.310> here<00:02:42.489> now<00:02:43.450> where<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.690> lines<00:02:44.880> you

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
equation here now where the lines you

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.460 
equation here now where the lines you
