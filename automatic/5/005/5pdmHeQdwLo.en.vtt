00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.200 
the seven channels and we'll go right
around<00:02:04.140> you'll<00:02:04.590> hear<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> helicopter<00:02:05.850> go

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
around you'll hear the helicopter go

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.670 
around you'll hear the helicopter go
right<00:02:06.479> around<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.869> ear<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.229> everything

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
right around your ear and everything

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.020 
right around your ear and everything
from<00:02:07.860> left<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> right<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> way<00:02:08.879> around

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
from left to right all the way around

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.680 
from left to right all the way around
works<00:02:09.869> great<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:11.129> conflicts<00:02:11.879> with<00:02:11.970> ghosts

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
works great but it conflicts with ghosts

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.690 
works great but it conflicts with ghosts
free<00:02:12.959> time

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
free time

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.110 
free time
so<00:02:13.910> what<00:02:14.330> I've<00:02:14.450> done<00:02:14.480> was<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.739> went<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.849> there

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
so what I've done was I went in there

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.110 
so what I've done was I went in there
and<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.810> when<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.680> went<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.950> reset<00:02:19.340> my<00:02:19.489> drivers<00:02:19.940> I

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
and I when I went to reset my drivers I

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.170 
and I when I went to reset my drivers I
had<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:21.500> program<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.760> figured<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.090> know

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
had that program so I figured you know

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.210 
had that program so I figured you know
what<00:02:23.510> let<00:02:24.140> me<00:02:24.230> take<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> program<00:02:24.890> at<00:02:25.069> and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
what let me take the program at and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.100 
what let me take the program at and
start<00:02:25.519> step<00:02:25.819> by<00:02:26.000> step<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:26.750> that's<00:02:26.900> what<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.080> did

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
start step by step so that's what I did

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.949 
start step by step so that's what I did
took<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.650> program<00:02:28.040> out<00:02:28.280> took<00:02:29.120> my<00:02:29.330> realistic

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
took the program out took my realistic

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.880 
took the program out took my realistic
realtek<00:02:31.480> drivers<00:02:32.480> out<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.620> put<00:02:33.800> the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
realtek drivers out and I put the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.880 
realtek drivers out and I put the
realtek<00:02:34.250> back<00:02:34.489> in<00:02:34.730> started<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.930> game<00:02:36.110> ran

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
realtek back in started up the game ran

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.670 
realtek back in started up the game ran
fine<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.730> played<00:02:38.360> eight<00:02:38.660> nine<00:02:38.930> ten<00:02:39.230> missions

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
not a problem with it I didn't even want

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.039 
not a problem with it I didn't even want
to<00:02:42.530> put<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.069> software<00:02:43.580> back<00:02:43.940> in<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.480> the
