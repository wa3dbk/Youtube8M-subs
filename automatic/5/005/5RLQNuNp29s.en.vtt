00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.610 

underneath<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:52.690> have<00:00:52.840> some<00:00:52.990> silicon<00:00:53.410> grips

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
underneath we have some silicon grips

which come with with the package this

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.080 
which come with with the package this
helps<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.800> stop<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.100> frames<00:00:57.400> slipping<00:00:57.850> on<00:00:57.970> the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
helps to stop the frames slipping on the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.810 
helps to stop the frames slipping on the
clones<00:00:58.740> if<00:00:59.740> you<00:00:59.950> just<00:01:00.100> have<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.340> metal<00:01:00.580> frame

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
clones if you just have the metal frame

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.790 
clones if you just have the metal frame
the<00:01:01.210> painted<00:01:01.570> surface<00:01:02.290> will<00:01:02.470> just<00:01:02.620> slip

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
the painted surface will just slip

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.920 
the painted surface will just slip
whenever<00:01:03.490> to<00:01:03.610> use<00:01:03.880> it<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.510> we<00:01:04.540> just<00:01:04.720> put<00:01:04.900> these

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
whenever to use it so we just put these

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.469 
whenever to use it so we just put these
silicon<00:01:05.619> grips<00:01:05.860> on<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.760> stop<00:01:06.970> any<00:01:07.119> slippage

medium<00:01:30.159> I'm<00:01:30.549> going<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:30.820> set<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.210> frame<00:01:31.479> as

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
medium I'm going to set the frame as

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.169 
medium I'm going to set the frame as
wide<00:01:32.530> as<00:01:32.740> possible<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.340> if<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:33.640> take<00:01:34.060> the

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
wide as possible so if you just take the

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.059 
wide as possible so if you just take the
hole<00:01:34.329> for<00:01:34.539> me<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:35.319> can<00:01:35.439> see<00:01:35.590> Nathan's<00:01:35.920> got

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
hole for me you can see Nathan's got

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.940 
hole for me you can see Nathan's got
quite<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.549> wide<00:01:36.759> frame<00:01:37.539> there<00:01:37.810> long<00:01:38.380> arms<00:01:38.740> so

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
quite a wide frame there long arms so

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.609 
quite a wide frame there long arms so
you<00:01:39.609> can<00:01:39.789> set<00:01:39.969> the<00:01:40.060> frame<00:01:40.299> as<00:01:40.719> wide<00:01:41.439> as

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
you can set the frame as wide as

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.029 
you can set the frame as wide as
possible<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:46.499> perchance<00:01:47.499> don't<00:01:47.770> remember

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
possible and perchance don't remember

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.359 
possible and perchance don't remember
point<00:01:48.420> any<00:01:49.420> injury<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.200> long<00:01:50.350> as<00:01:51.039> I<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.249> see

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
point any injury so long as I can see

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.620 
point any injury so long as I can see
there's<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:51.609> slight<00:01:51.759> offset<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.450> she'll

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
there's a slight offset and she'll

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.649 
there's a slight offset and she'll
broken<00:01:53.079> contact<00:01:53.259> okay<00:01:53.829> since<00:01:54.700> it's<00:01:54.850> my<00:01:55.240> offset

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
broken contact okay since it's my offset

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.300 
broken contact okay since it's my offset
distance<00:01:55.840> ourselves<00:01:56.259> I'm<00:01:56.619> just<00:01:56.799> slightly

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
distance ourselves I'm just slightly

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.399 
distance ourselves I'm just slightly
offset<00:01:57.609> that's<00:01:57.999> the<00:01:58.359> setting<00:01:58.899> of<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.170> frame

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
offset that's the setting of the frame

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.739 
offset that's the setting of the frame
just<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.219> allow<00:02:00.579> a<00:02:00.909> little<00:02:01.179> bit<00:02:01.270> lower<00:02:01.479> on<00:02:01.600> the

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
just to allow a little bit lower on the

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.929 
just to allow a little bit lower on the
right-hand<00:02:02.170> side<00:02:02.340> than<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.429> left

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
right-hand side than the left

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.959 
right-hand side than the left
so<00:02:04.630> negative<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.079> frame<00:02:05.289> set<00:02:05.700> once<00:02:06.700> we've<00:02:06.850> got

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
so negative the frame set once we've got

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.510 
so negative the frame set once we've got
the<00:02:07.030> frame<00:02:07.240> set<00:02:07.770> easier<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.979> system<00:02:09.280> by<00:02:09.459> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
the frame set easier to system by the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.520 
the frame set easier to system by the
partner<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:10.660> if<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.899> aren't<00:02:10.990> dancing<00:02:11.350> on

I've<00:02:18.049> just<00:02:18.230> heard<00:02:18.439> Nathan's<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:18.890> camera

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
I've just heard Nathan's the camera

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.640 
I've just heard Nathan's the camera
you'll<00:02:20.150> see<00:02:20.359> that<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:21.290> frame<00:02:21.530> is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
you'll see that the frame is

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.429 
you'll see that the frame is
deliberately<00:02:22.310> designed<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:23.450> sit<00:02:23.659> down<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.379> the

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
deliberately designed to sit down in the

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.190 
deliberately designed to sit down in the
back<00:02:24.590> these<00:02:25.370> curves<00:02:25.760> here<00:02:26.060> sit<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.989> large

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
back these curves here sit on the large

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.860 
back these curves here sit on the large
deltoid<00:02:27.950> muscles<00:02:28.359> and<00:02:29.359> then<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.510> frame<00:02:29.689> goes

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
deltoid muscles and then the frame goes

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.750 
deltoid muscles and then the frame goes
over<00:02:30.139> the<00:02:30.230> shoulder<00:02:30.260> like<00:02:31.219> if<00:02:31.370> she<00:02:31.489> turns<00:02:31.670> it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
over the shoulder like if she turns it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.539 
over the shoulder like if she turns it
back<00:02:31.849> right<00:02:32.439> and<00:02:33.439> then<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:34.219> take<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.400> on

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
back right and then just take it on

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:35.199 
back right and then just take it on
backwards

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
backwards

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.339 
backwards
and<00:02:35.900> over<00:02:37.629> and<00:02:38.629> then<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:38.930> see<00:02:39.109> them<00:02:39.260> as

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
and over and then the you see them as

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.770 
and over and then the you see them as
frames<00:02:39.650> if<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.670> think<00:02:40.819> of<00:02:40.969> the<00:02:41.060> male<00:02:41.239> ones<00:02:41.510> down

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
frames if we think of the male ones down

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.830 
frames if we think of the male ones down
saying<00:02:42.079> as<00:02:42.230> tails<00:02:42.500> as<00:02:43.129> a<00:02:43.189> bowtie<00:02:43.700> here<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
saying as tails as a bowtie here the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.589 
saying as tails as a bowtie here the
line<00:02:45.079> of<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.409> frame<00:02:45.730> should<00:02:46.730> sit<00:02:47.000> as<00:02:47.299> if<00:02:47.450> it's

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
line of the frame should sit as if it's

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.699 
line of the frame should sit as if it's
going<00:02:47.810> through<00:02:48.109> the<00:02:48.169> bone<00:02:48.319> Tommy

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
going through the bone Tommy

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.619 
going through the bone Tommy
so<00:02:49.159> whether<00:02:49.340> they<00:02:49.549> use<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:50.180> front<00:02:50.419> of<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
so whether they use it in front of the

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.289 
so whether they use it in front of the
dancer<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.709> looking<00:02:51.980> at<00:02:52.189> him<00:02:52.400> she<00:02:53.269> should

shoulder if the frame slips during usage
and<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.739> see<00:03:03.950> it's<00:03:04.099> up<00:03:04.310> here<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:05.359> can<00:03:05.510> see<00:03:05.659> how

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
and you see it's up here you can see how

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.440 
and you see it's up here you can see how
you<00:03:05.900> can<00:03:06.079> narrow<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.379> down<00:03:06.409> much<00:03:07.010> too<00:03:07.400> low<00:03:07.579> and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
you can narrow it down much too low and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.030 
you can narrow it down much too low and
it's<00:03:08.599> known<00:03:08.840> sitting<00:03:09.260> almost<00:03:09.560> touching<00:03:09.950> his

it's known sitting almost touching his

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.119 
it's known sitting almost touching his
neck<00:03:10.389> what<00:03:11.389> you<00:03:11.510> must<00:03:11.689> do<00:03:11.870> rather<00:03:12.829> than<00:03:12.980> just

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
neck what you must do rather than just

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.960 
neck what you must do rather than just
pushing<00:03:13.519> lift<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.689> frame<00:03:15.489> tilted<00:03:16.489> back<00:03:16.699> and

pushing lift the frame tilted back and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.170 
pushing lift the frame tilted back and
then<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.840> man<00:03:17.989> resets<00:03:18.500> himself<00:03:19.060> into<00:03:20.060> the

then the man resets himself into the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.789 
then the man resets himself into the
front<00:03:21.370> ok<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.760> then<00:03:23.479> he's<00:03:23.599> ready<00:03:23.799> respond

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
front ok and then he's ready respond
