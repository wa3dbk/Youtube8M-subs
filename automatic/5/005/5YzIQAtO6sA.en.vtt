00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
bringing in the upper deck which I'll

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
bringing in the upper deck which I'll
show<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> next<00:01:02.309> exercise<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.090> also<00:01:03.270> do

these reps I just chased the pump just
that<00:01:37.979> good<00:01:38.189> mind<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> muscle<00:01:39.060> connection<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that good mind to muscle connection that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
that good mind to muscle connection that
a<00:01:39.659> lot<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.840> people<00:01:39.960> talk<00:01:40.259> about<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
a lot of people talk about and it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
a lot of people talk about and it's
really<00:01:41.520> useful<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> comes<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> isolate

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
really useful when it comes to isolate

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
really useful when it comes to isolate
in<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> muscle<00:01:43.409> group<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.729> just

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
in the muscle group like this it's just

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.990 
in the muscle group like this it's just
imagining<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.350> squeeze<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.159> keeping<00:01:47.880> your

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
imagining the squeeze and keeping your

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
imagining the squeeze and keeping your
hands<00:01:48.149> tight<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.110> over<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.350> decline

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
hands tight so then I go over to decline

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.340 
hands tight so then I go over to decline

importance<00:02:34.230> about<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.950> again<00:02:35.280> not<00:02:35.550> try

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
importance about this is again not try

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.370 
importance about this is again not try
not<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.210> go<00:02:36.330> too<00:02:36.390> far<00:02:36.570> back<00:02:37.020> with<00:02:37.260> your
