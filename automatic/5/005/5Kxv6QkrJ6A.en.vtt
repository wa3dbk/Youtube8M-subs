00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.850
 it's time to put the ground beef in it 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.109
 recipe I used exactly half a pound and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.630
 I tried it with sun vinegar and oregano 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.360
 Then, after you have, you 'll have her. 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.020
 It's just you let her give her a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.020
 fry 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.269
 after the meat is already fried we 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.449
 Let's add half a can of 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.489
 tomato and a can of sour cream as 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.079
 if it were a ground beef stroganoff 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.180
 after all the ingredients 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.390
 are mixed 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.670
 we're going to book the stuffing now we 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.409
 Let's make the bank mass 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.010
 in a large bowl we'll mix 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:04.430
 the liquid ingredients that are four 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.140
 spoons of oil two eggs and a cup 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.940
 of milk tea 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.060
 after mixing everything did not reach us 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.050
 Let's hit it well after all. 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.619

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.960
 we will put a pinch of salt and then 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.600
 then start putting flour in the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.979
 few in total are a cup and a half of 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.740
 wheat flour 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.090

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.090

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.610
 now to fry pancake batter 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.520
 We're going to need a frying pan. 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.979
 medium and anti-adherent so that the mass 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.110
 always leaving the flame of the 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.960
 stove in the medium term we will put in the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.159
 frying pan in olive oil only for 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.439

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.080
 after that just put a box 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.570
 small dough and turn the skillet 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.689
 so that the masses are waiting 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.320
 brown on one side turns pancake and pasta 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.320

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.280
 meat stuffing 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.750
 I put some cheese on top 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.030
 grated Parmesan 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.930
 just to give a little more taste but this 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.200
