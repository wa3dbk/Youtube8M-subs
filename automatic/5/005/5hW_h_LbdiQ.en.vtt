00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.240 

okay<00:00:01.140> let's<00:00:01.350> see<00:00:01.439> if<00:00:01.500> we<00:00:01.530> can<00:00:01.709> do<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:01.979> again

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
okay let's see if we can do this again

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.120 
okay let's see if we can do this again
so<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.720> completely<00:00:04.620> rigged<00:00:04.830> debate

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
so this is the completely rigged debate

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.340 
so this is the completely rigged debate
what<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.430> wanted<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.759> show<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:06.000> was<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
what I wanted to show you was that the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.830 
what I wanted to show you was that the
hook<00:00:07.680> actually<00:00:08.309> sits<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.790> channel<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.630> top

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
hook actually sits in a channel on top

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.350 
hook actually sits in a channel on top
of<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> bait<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.469> here<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.160> I've<00:00:12.059> rigged<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
of the bait up here and I've rigged a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.640 
of the bait up here and I've rigged a
little<00:00:12.570> backdrop<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.170> can<00:00:13.290> see<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.530> better

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
little backdrop so you can see it better

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.970 
little backdrop so you can see it better
but<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.210> hook<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.540> only<00:00:16.170> actually<00:00:16.470> touching

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
but the hook is only actually touching

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.260 
but the hook is only actually touching
the<00:00:17.010> bait<00:00:17.220> right<00:00:17.250> here<00:00:17.430> at<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> back<00:00:17.940> only

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the bait right here at the back only

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.150 
the bait right here at the back only
goes<00:00:18.480> through<00:00:18.510> right<00:00:19.260> through<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.590> area

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
goes through right through this area

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.040 
goes through right through this area
oops<00:00:20.460> sorry<00:00:20.699> right<00:00:21.390> through<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.660> area<00:00:21.930> here

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
oops sorry right through this area here

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.429 
oops sorry right through this area here
and<00:00:22.730> when<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> fish<00:00:24.029> bites<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and when the fish bites it's going to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.589 
and when the fish bites it's going to
push<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.890> bait<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> way<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.240> expose

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
push that bait out of the way and expose

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.320 
push that bait out of the way and expose
that<00:00:27.810> hook<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:29.099> barely<00:00:29.640> barely<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
that hook and I barely barely have to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.070 
that hook and I barely barely have to
touch<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.660> at<00:00:30.779> all

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
touch that at all

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.510 
touch that at all
so<00:00:31.560> that's<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.890> kind<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.160> while<00:00:32.399> you're

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
so that's just kind of while you're

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.770 
so that's just kind of while you're
fishing<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> sit<00:00:33.300> right<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:33.480> in

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
fishing it going to sit right down in

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.740 
fishing it going to sit right down in
that<00:00:33.809> channel<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.410> top<00:00:34.620> right<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.750> then

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that channel on top right here and then

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
that channel on top right here and then
here's<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> bait<00:00:37.829> holder<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.460> attached

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
here's the bait holder up here attached

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.810 
here's the bait holder up here attached
to<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> eye<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.280> then<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> course<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
to the to the eye and then of course the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.000 
to the to the eye and then of course the
little<00:00:41.910> weighted<00:00:42.719> belly<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> swings<00:00:43.860> down

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
little weighted belly of it swings down

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310 
little weighted belly of it swings down
that<00:00:44.280> way<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> idea<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.260> he

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that way so I think the idea is when he

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
that way so I think the idea is when he
bites<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> moves<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
bites on it it moves out of the way and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.520 
bites on it it moves out of the way and
exposes<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.539> hook<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:48.989> goes<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
exposes that hook and it goes in and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.029 
exposes that hook and it goes in and
it's<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.309> offset<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.920> can

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's a little offset from the you can

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
it's a little offset from the you can
see<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> little<00:00:53.460> offset<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.420> actual

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
see it's a little offset from the actual

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
see it's a little offset from the actual
eye<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.530> you're<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.800> pulling<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.340> line<00:00:56.579> you're

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
eye so you're not pulling in line you're

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.590 
eye so you're not pulling in line you're
actually<00:00:57.629> pulling<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.989> little<00:00:58.379> bit<00:00:58.500> more

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
actually pulling a little bit more

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.520 
actually pulling a little bit more
off-center<00:01:00.600> which<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.020> good<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.379> that's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
off-center which is good because that's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
off-center which is good because that's
going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> rotate<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.340> try<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> hook<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
going to rotate and try to hook that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.359 
going to rotate and try to hook that
fish<00:01:03.290> alright<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.470> let's<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> rigging<00:01:05.129> now

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
fish alright so let's do the rigging now

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.080 
fish alright so let's do the rigging now
like<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.700> guys<00:01:05.880> asked<00:01:07.549> what<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
like you guys asked what I like to do is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.210 
like you guys asked what I like to do is
I<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.510> figured<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.650> take<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.979> bait

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
I I figured out that if I take this bait

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.510 
I I figured out that if I take this bait
holder<00:01:11.490> off<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.780> use<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.310> as

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
holder off I can use that and do that as

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
holder off I can use that and do that as
a<00:01:14.549> second<00:01:14.970> step<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> end<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.780> take<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
a second step at the end so I take that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.490 
a second step at the end so I take that
off

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
off

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.940 
off
I<00:01:16.880> hold<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> bait<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.470> just<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
I hold the bait up just as it's going to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
I hold the bait up just as it's going to
lay<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.250> there<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.350> what<00:01:22.350> I'm

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
lay in there just like that and what I'm

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
lay in there just like that and what I'm
focusing<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.490> line<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.090> where<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
focusing on is this line of where the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.179 
focusing on is this line of where the
hook<00:01:24.630> would<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.960> through<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> lure<00:01:25.920> right

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
hook would go through the lure right

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
hook would go through the lure right
here<00:01:26.509> okay<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.930> try<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> follow<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
here okay so then I try to follow that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.039 
here okay so then I try to follow that
line<00:01:28.860> straight<00:01:29.490> through<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.880> bottom<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
line straight through the bottom of the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.039 
line straight through the bottom of the
fish<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.500> mean<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> bait<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.750> up<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
fish I mean of the bait right up in the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.210 
fish I mean of the bait right up in the
middle<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> back<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
middle of the back and you can see it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.190 
middle of the back and you can see it
coming<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.170> then<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
coming out right there and then just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.649 
coming out right there and then just
rotate<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> over<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.030> lays<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.210> down

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
rotate that over so it lays right down

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.580 
rotate that over so it lays right down
in<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.979> in<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.130> channel<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:42.590> then

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
in that in that channel there right then

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
in that in that channel there right then
I<00:01:43.619> come<00:01:43.890> back<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.610> my<00:01:45.380> bait<00:01:46.380> holder<00:01:47.299> screw<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
I come back take my bait holder screw it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.460 
I come back take my bait holder screw it
directly<00:01:48.869> straight<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> nose<00:01:50.869> okay<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
directly straight into the nose okay and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.190 
directly straight into the nose okay and
I<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:53.329> try<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.360> keep<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.840> straight<00:01:55.049> as

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I just try to keep it as straight as

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.780 
I just try to keep it as straight as
possible<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> horrible<00:01:56.310> start<00:01:56.520> let's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
possible that was a horrible start let's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.219 
possible that was a horrible start let's
do<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> over<00:01:59.479> can<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> hook<00:02:00.930> out<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
do it over can I get the hook out of the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.219 
do it over can I get the hook out of the
way

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.530 

there<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.680> go<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.100> much<00:02:05.219> better<00:02:05.399> start

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
there we go that's a much better start

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.940 
there we go that's a much better start
just<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.719> pinch<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> nose<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.680> just<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
just kind of pinch the nose and just you

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
just kind of pinch the nose and just you
can<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.220> watch<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.670> right<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.000> actually

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
can just watch it go right in actually

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.400 
can just watch it go right in actually
and<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> pretty<00:02:11.430> well<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.819> there<00:02:12.260> then<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and get it pretty well in there then I

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.270 
and get it pretty well in there then I
turn<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.650> sideways<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:16.980> kind<00:02:17.220> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
turn it sideways and then I just kind of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.510 
turn it sideways and then I just kind of
muscle<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.500> hook<00:02:20.240> around<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.750> where<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.520> goes

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
muscle the hook around to where it goes

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.670 
muscle the hook around to where it goes
right<00:02:23.790> onto<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.660> bait<00:02:24.900> holder<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.530> like

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
right onto that bait holder just like

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.560 
right onto that bait holder just like
that<00:02:25.890> then<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.820> just<00:02:26.910> make<00:02:27.210> sure<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> bait

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
that then I just make sure the bait

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.940 
that then I just make sure the bait
holder<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.850> perpendicular<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.120> hook<00:02:30.950> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
holder is perpendicular to the hook and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.620 
holder is perpendicular to the hook and
there<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> go<00:02:32.280> again<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:33.210> going<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> just

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
there you go again it's going to just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.690 
there you go again it's going to just
get<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.710> way<00:02:34.800> as<00:02:34.920> soon<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.250> fish

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
get out of the way as soon as that fish

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.760 
get out of the way as soon as that fish
hooks<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.930> mean<00:02:37.080> bites<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.530> and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
hooks it that mean bites it and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.770 
hooks it that mean bites it and
hopefully<00:02:38.310> set<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.820> hook<00:02:38.970> alright<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.650> yeah
