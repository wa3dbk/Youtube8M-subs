the<00:00:41.430> hypno<00:00:41.700> traps<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.660> pick<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the hypno traps so you can pick up a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
the hypno traps so you can pick up a
schematic<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.309> only<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> time

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
schematic you only have one at a time

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
schematic you only have one at a time
and<00:00:45.719> then<00:00:46.350> when<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> schematic<00:00:48.180> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and then when you have the schematic you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.569 
and then when you have the schematic you
find<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.960> other<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.800> smaller<00:00:50.250> tool

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
find these other little smaller tool

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.209 
find these other little smaller tool
boxes<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.350> open<00:00:52.649> those<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.829> search

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
boxes and when you open those you search

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
boxes and when you open those you search
those<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.730> gonna<00:00:53.820> pick<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.449> Intel

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
those I'm just gonna pick up this Intel

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
those I'm just gonna pick up this Intel
here<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.829> search<00:00:56.129> those<00:00:56.370> toolbox

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
here but when you search those toolbox

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
here but when you search those toolbox
see<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.590> one

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
see in the it was actually there was one

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
see in the it was actually there was one
in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> room<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.190> was<00:00:59.609> right<00:00:59.879> ahead<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.180> me

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
in the room that was right ahead of me

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.860 
in the room that was right ahead of me
as<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:00.899> picking<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.469> Intel<00:01:02.000> but<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
as I was picking up that Intel but you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.260 
as I was picking up that Intel but you
have<00:01:04.080> these<00:01:04.260> toolboxes<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.580> actually<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
have these toolboxes and it actually the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.289 
have these toolboxes and it actually the
toolboxes<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.140> give<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.680> from<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.970> found

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
toolboxes do give you from what we found

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.969 
toolboxes do give you from what we found
the<00:01:09.810> exact<00:01:10.290> items<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> need<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.970> your

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
the exact items that you need for your

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.750 
the exact items that you need for your
schematics<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.250> doesn't<00:01:14.460> matter<00:01:14.549> what

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
schematics so it doesn't matter what

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.640 
schematics so it doesn't matter what
kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> schematic<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.619> kind

here we're gonna search it okay cell
battery<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.670> part<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
battery so that's one part of the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
battery so that's one part of the
schematic<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.159> hypno<00:01:32.460> trap<00:01:32.670> here's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
schematic for this hypno trap here's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.539 
schematic for this hypno trap here's
another<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.869> second<00:01:34.380> toolbox<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.250> save

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
another one the second toolbox we save

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.190 
another one the second toolbox we save
some<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.180> progress<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.810> save<00:01:36.960> them

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
some of these we progress and save them

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.350 
some of these we progress and save them
so<00:01:37.530> we've<00:01:37.650> gone<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.240> our

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
so we've gone back so now we have our

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.030 
so we've gone back so now we have our
second<00:01:39.750> component<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> our<00:01:40.290> construct<00:01:40.920> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
second component to our construct I

skipped ahead this is the third toolbox
it's<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> area<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.270> after

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
it's up in the area now this is after

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.350 
it's up in the area now this is after
you<00:01:46.409> fight<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> tentacle<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you fight the tentacle like you have to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.749 
you fight the tentacle like you have to
destroy<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:49.170> hurt<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> tentacle<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.520> and

you get other cryptids coming within
proximity<00:03:07.410> that's<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.220> becomes<00:03:08.459> more

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
proximity that's it becomes more

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.880
