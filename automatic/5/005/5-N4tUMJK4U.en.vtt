00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello with you, Alexander 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 Vasiliev I am the author of the website give 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.880
 experience point ru 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.969
 on which I talk about my 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.389
 computer experience and in this video we 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.750
 consider the question of how to transfer to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.240
 flash drive large file will be discussed 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.890
 about large files larger than 4 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 gigabytes lately flash drives 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.050
 48 16 gigabytes is not uncommon to even 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.149
 on the 16th gigovy flash drive to copy the file 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 four and a half and blows 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.460
 impossible seemingly not difficult 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 should arise 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 capacity of the stick allows 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.379
 carry large amounts but when it is 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.850
 for large files 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.000
 it turns out that they are impossible 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.950
 copy to flash drive if we take 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 several video files of the size 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.020
 one and a half two gigabytes then they are easy 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.289
 copied to a USB flash drive even if their total 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.629
 volume will exceed 4 gigabytes but with 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.140
 trying to transfer one file to a flash drive 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.720
 4 rio 300 size 50 50 megabytes 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.360
 a message appears about the impossibility 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.030
 perform this operation for example i 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.790
 I took a 8 gigabyte USB flash drive and Iâ€™m sure 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.009
 I know that the flash drive is an empty problem at all 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.490
 the other thing is that the file system 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.729
 fat32 flash drive and it can not perceive 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.890
 files larger than 4 gigabytes in order 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.380
 to teach a flash drive to take big 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.159
 files need to change her file 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.189
 the system 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.020
 This can be done in several ways. 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.470
 for example in the windows operating system 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.140
 seven 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.530
 it's very easy to open it 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.280
 computer we hover our flash drive and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.610
 right click on the flash drive in 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.130
 menu, select the line 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.110
 format be careful 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.140
 if your flash drive has valuable 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.479
 the information or pictures you need then 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.670
 copy them to your computer in advance 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.159
 since the flash drive when formatting all 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.100
 information will be deleted 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.049
 in the format menu we have 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.300
 ability to select multiple file 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.819
 systems 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.459
 one of them is and exfat here is 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.650
 small problem when using 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.049
 such a flash drive on a computer with 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.510
 windows xp operating system 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.120
 the exfat file system may not 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.280
 perceived though on windows seven 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.290
 everything reads perfectly so I 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.989
 I recommend formatting a USB flash drive 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.510
 system interface to start 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.110
 formatting after selecting all the necessary 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.690
 parameters click on the start button 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.819
 on completion of formatting we take 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.950
 again the properties of the flash drive and see that in 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.400
 This moment we have already changed 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.459
 file system now it is vat and on 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.230
 flash drive there is free space to all of them 600 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.730
 megabyte 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.940
 return try to copy this 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.560
 flash file size 4 and 350 megabytes 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.160
 as we see now he has no problems 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.019
 housed on windows xp no flash drive 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.090
 the ability to change the file so quickly 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.280
 system on a flash drive in mts 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.680
 but there are special programs that 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.950
 help to do this one of them 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.930
 called diskron acronis like me 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.150
 its use is detailed in 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.870
 article, change the file system flash drives 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.299
 nine tfs 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.049
 on my site in the category of small 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.209
 tricks 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.190
 besides this you will find a lot of other 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.670
 useful information on my website 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.220
 give experience point ru 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.920
 so in this video we looked at how 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.050
 change file system to flash drive 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.720
 fat32 on the interface with you was alexander
