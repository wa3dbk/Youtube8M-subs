00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.400 

I'm<00:00:06.090> nearing<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.779> end<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.260> my<00:00:07.319> pearl<00:00:07.800> row<00:00:08.069> and

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
I'm nearing the end of my pearl row and

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.250 
I'm nearing the end of my pearl row and
the<00:00:10.410> confirmation<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.540> that<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
the confirmation is that that is the

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.890 
the confirmation is that that is the
short<00:00:13.530> row<00:00:13.740> wrap<00:00:14.039> I<00:00:14.459> could<00:00:15.209> actually<00:00:15.389> lift

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
short row wrap I could actually lift

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.950 
short row wrap I could actually lift
that<00:00:16.199> wrap<00:00:16.529> off<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.430> stitch<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.060> that's<00:00:18.720> what

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that wrap off the stitch and that's what

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.050 
that wrap off the stitch and that's what
a<00:00:18.990> wrap<00:00:19.260> looks<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.190> little<00:00:20.460> circle

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
a wrap looks like it's a little circle

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.630 
a wrap looks like it's a little circle
of<00:00:21.210> yarn<00:00:21.560> so<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:22.679> just<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> thread<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
of yarn so I'm just going to thread that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
of yarn so I'm just going to thread that
back<00:00:23.999> over<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.599> stitch<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:27.650> you<00:00:28.650> should<00:00:28.859> be

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
back over that stitch and you should be

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.859 
back over that stitch and you should be
able<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.220> see<00:00:29.460> them<00:00:29.640> fairly<00:00:29.939> clearly<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.720> they

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
able to see them fairly clearly but they

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
able to see them fairly clearly but they
will<00:00:31.019> hide<00:00:31.259> in<00:00:31.619> amongst<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> bumps<00:00:32.940> in

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
will hide in amongst all the bumps in

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.760 
will hide in amongst all the bumps in
the<00:00:33.480> Garter<00:00:33.690> stitch<00:00:33.840> there's<00:00:34.380> no<00:00:34.530> need<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770

just pull my knitting needle through so
that<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.670> beginning<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.749> other<00:01:15.929> side<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
that I'm beginning at the other side of

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.349 
that I'm beginning at the other side of
the<00:01:16.530> work<00:01:16.740> where<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.729> other<00:01:17.880> yarn<00:01:18.210> is

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
the work where the other yarn is

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.200 
the work where the other yarn is
conveniently<00:01:19.140> waiting<00:01:19.520> this<00:01:20.520> way<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.909> can

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
conveniently waiting this way I can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
conveniently waiting this way I can
maintain<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.869> Garter<00:01:22.200> stitch<00:01:22.229> throughout

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
maintain the Garter stitch throughout

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.669 
maintain the Garter stitch throughout
the<00:01:23.100> scarf<00:01:23.399> and<00:01:23.960> because<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> ripple

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
the scarf and because this is the ripple

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.940 
the scarf and because this is the ripple
all<00:01:26.249> I<00:01:26.310> need<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.969> is<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.450> garter<00:01:28.289> bump<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
all I need now is one garter bump in the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.379 
all I need now is one garter bump in the
contrasting<00:01:29.579> color<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:32.090> because<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:33.389 
contrasting color and because it's the

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:35.599 
contrasting color and because it's the
ripple<00:01:33.689> version<00:01:34.109> of<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.499> scarf<00:01:34.829> I'm<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.490> to

stitches knitwise using my modified
conventional<00:01:54.600> bind<00:01:54.869> off<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.979> we're<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.219> to

right hand needle through the front of
the<00:02:06.659> second<00:02:07.079> stitch<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:09.720> then<00:02:10.130> bring<00:02:11.130> that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the second stitch I can then bring that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.690 
the second stitch I can then bring that
new<00:02:11.490> stitch<00:02:11.790> down<00:02:12.180> where<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> needle<00:02:12.840> went<00:02:13.049> in

new stitch down where the needle went in

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.059 
new stitch down where the needle went in
so<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.819> needle<00:02:15.090> goes<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.420> tip<00:02:15.689> to<00:02:15.840> tip<00:02:16.069> right

so the needle goes in tip to tip right

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.260 
so the needle goes in tip to tip right
needle<00:02:17.310> goes<00:02:17.549> into<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.909> second

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
just as if to knit it normally and it

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.300 
just as if to knit it normally and it
must<00:02:21.390> come<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.780> between<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.440> two<00:02:22.620> strands<00:02:23.040> at

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
must come out between the two strands at

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.580 
must come out between the two strands at
the<00:02:23.370> back<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.790> needle<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.960> causes<00:02:25.230> the

the back of the needle and it causes the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.510 
the back of the needle and it causes the
two<00:02:25.770> stitches<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.580> make<00:02:26.610> an<00:02:26.910> X<00:02:28.190> then<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.220> knit

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
much it stretches is up to you depending

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
much it stretches is up to you depending
on<00:03:00.480> how<00:03:00.540> close<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> needle<00:03:01.650> tips<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.070> work
