00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and you can think to yourself the world

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
and you can think to yourself the world
is<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.980> construction<00:00:47.489> kit<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
is really just a construction kit and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
is really just a construction kit and
meaning<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.930> something<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.469> can

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.030 
tools and that's something Intel's
working<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.560> thing<00:01:31.650> that's<00:01:31.829> cool<00:01:31.979> about

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
working on one thing that's cool about

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
working on one thing that's cool about
the<00:01:32.310> until<00:01:32.549> two<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.000> pc<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.630> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the until two and one pc is that you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.450 
the until two and one pc is that you
really<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.229> compact<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.310> some

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really can compact it and get some

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.609 
really can compact it and get some
really<00:01:35.670> powerful<00:01:35.820> embedded<00:01:36.619> prototyping

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
really powerful embedded prototyping

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.319 
really powerful embedded prototyping
going<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.009> makey<00:01:38.220> makey<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.939> pretty<00:01:39.180> easy

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
going with makey makey it's pretty easy

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.630 
going with makey makey it's pretty easy
to<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.530> power<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> two

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
to get all that power that's in the two

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
to get all that power that's in the two
and<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:41.909> pc<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.540> make<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> react<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and one pc and make it react to the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.050 
and one pc and make it react to the
everyday<00:01:43.950> environment<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.759> they're<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> good

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
everyday environment so they're a good

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.580 
everyday environment so they're a good
combo<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> things<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.409> i<00:01:46.530> really

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
combo one of the things that i really

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
combo one of the things that i really
like<00:01:46.920> about<00:01:46.950> intel<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:47.880> founded

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
like about intel is that it was founded

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
like about intel is that it was founded
by<00:01:48.479> makers<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.590> think<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.340> powerhouses<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
by makers and I think the powerhouses of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.090 
by makers and I think the powerhouses of
the<00:01:51.450> future<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> economy<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the future of the economy are going to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.859 
the future of the economy are going to
be<00:01:53.310> places<00:01:53.820> where<00:01:54.000> there's<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> lot<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.630> people

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
be places where there's a lot of people

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.790 
be places where there's a lot of people
who<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> make

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
who know how to make

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.310 
who know how to make
and<00:01:56.220> in<00:01:56.640> tell<00:01:56.850> us<00:01:56.940> one<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.150> those<00:01:57.270> places<00:01:57.450> we

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and in tell us one of those places we

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.140 
and in tell us one of those places we
believe<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.710> everybody<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.580> invent<00:01:59.910> and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
believe that everybody can invent and

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.000 
believe that everybody can invent and
make<00:02:00.330> things<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.870> change<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> world<00:02:01.470> that's

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
make things and change the world that's

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.460 
make things and change the world that's
why<00:02:02.160> we<00:02:02.280> invented<00:02:02.520> making<00:02:02.940> me<00:02:03.170> when<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.290> make

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
why we invented making me when we make

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.820 
why we invented making me when we make
our<00:02:04.620> world<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:05.160> make<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> better<00:02:05.610> world
