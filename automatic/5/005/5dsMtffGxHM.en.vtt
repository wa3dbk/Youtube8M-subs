00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
brother to the galaxy note I'd probably

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.380 
brother to the galaxy note I'd probably
call<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> galaxy<00:01:41.790> note<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> big<00:01:42.119> brunt<00:01:42.329> of

call the galaxy note the big brunt of
the<00:01:42.509> galaxy<00:01:42.899> s3<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:44.130> makes<00:01:44.340> sense<00:01:44.610> but

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the galaxy s3 if that makes sense but

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.179 
the galaxy s3 if that makes sense but
it's<00:01:45.600> marginally<00:01:46.500> bigger<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> thought

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it's marginally bigger and I thought

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.130 
it's marginally bigger and I thought

we've<00:03:53.889> got<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.160> camera<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:56.440> thing

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
we've got the camera and the this thing

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.840 
we've got the camera and the this thing
would<00:03:56.739> stop<00:03:56.980> vibrating<00:03:57.190> that's<00:03:57.579> going<00:03:57.790> to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
would stop vibrating that's going to

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.220 
would stop vibrating that's going to
probably<00:03:58.000> bother<00:03:58.239> me<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> little<00:03:58.600> bit<00:03:58.780> the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
probably bother me a little bit the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.349 
probably bother me a little bit the
device<00:03:59.440> vibrates<00:03:59.739> when<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.400> take<00:04:01.030> out<00:04:01.180> the

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
stylus and put it back in but i'll

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:03.900 
stylus and put it back in but i'll
probably<00:04:03.069> get<00:04:03.280> used<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.519> it<00:04:03.609> after<00:04:03.670> a<00:04:03.819> little

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
probably get used to it after a little
