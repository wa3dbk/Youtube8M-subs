using<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.540> simple<00:01:28.140> bag<00:01:28.650> rice<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.700> cooks<00:01:30.030> in

using the simple bag rice it cooks in

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
using the simple bag rice it cooks in
ten<00:01:30.420> minutes<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:34.280> with<00:01:35.280> our<00:01:35.460> chili<00:01:36.799> when<00:01:37.799> I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
ten minutes and with our chili when I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.700 
ten minutes and with our chili when I
was<00:01:38.100> growing<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.670> my<00:01:39.119> mom<00:01:39.299> always<00:01:39.659> poured<00:01:40.590> it

over<00:01:40.979> rice<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:42.799> I<00:01:43.799> guess<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.549> because<00:01:44.990> we

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
over rice and I guess it was because we

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.840 
over rice and I guess it was because we
had<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> large<00:01:46.439> family<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.070> she<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.490> trying<00:01:47.729> to
