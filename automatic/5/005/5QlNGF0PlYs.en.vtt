drank<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:06.600> don't<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.020> mean<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> question

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
drank we don't I mean that is a question

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.410 
drank we don't I mean that is a question
that<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.040> certainly<00:01:08.280> ask<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.000> mean<00:01:09.180> certainly

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that will certainly ask I mean certainly

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.910 
that will certainly ask I mean certainly
I<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.049> anybody<00:01:10.260> wanted<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.830> get

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
I don't think anybody wanted to get

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.440

drunk<00:01:11.250> at<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.520> event<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.299> would

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
drunk at that event because that would

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
drunk at that event because that would
not<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.780> been<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.960> good<00:01:13.140> image<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.560> i<00:01:13.590> doubt

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
not have been a good image so i doubt

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.499 
not have been a good image so i doubt
that<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.310> were<00:01:14.369> inviting<00:01:14.939> too<00:01:15.090> much<00:01:15.270> around

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that they were inviting too much around

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.300 
that they were inviting too much around
the<00:01:15.630> table<00:01:15.930> perhaps<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:16.530> I'll<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.280> a
