working<00:01:32.960> let's<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.500> ahead<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> move

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
working let's go ahead and move

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 
working let's go ahead and move
something<00:01:35.250> over<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> internal<00:01:37.170> memory

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
something over to the internal memory

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.319 
something over to the internal memory
and<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:38.400> we'll<00:01:38.520> move<00:01:38.640> something<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and then we'll move something back to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
and then we'll move something back to
the<00:01:39.420> USB<00:01:39.840> device<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> could<00:01:40.680> see

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the USB device so you could see

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.730 
the USB device so you could see
approximately<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.700> long<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.180> takes<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:43.320> for

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
approximately how long it takes for for

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
approximately how long it takes for for
some<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.159> stuff<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> move<00:01:45.110> let's<00:01:46.110> go

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
some of this stuff to move let's go

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
some of this stuff to move let's go
ahead<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.710> open<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> test<00:01:47.520> folder<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.909> have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
ahead and open the test folder I have

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.160 
ahead and open the test folder I have
here<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.680> I<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.220> 10<00:01:50.640> megabyte<00:01:51.149> file<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
about 50 50 55 megabyte file so we're

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.920 
about 50 50 55 megabyte file so we're
gonna<00:01:55.979> transfer<00:01:56.640> these<00:01:56.909> from<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> drive<00:01:57.509> over

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
gonna transfer these from the drive over

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.749 
gonna transfer these from the drive over
to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> internal<00:01:58.770> memory<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.640> gonna

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
to the internal memory so I'm just gonna

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.170 
to the internal memory so I'm just gonna
select<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.180> 10<00:02:00.360> megabyte<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:00.930> first<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
select the 10 megabyte one first and

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.969 
select the 10 megabyte one first and
select<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> copy<00:02:03.630> button<00:02:03.990> we'll<00:02:04.530> go<00:02:04.710> right

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
select the copy button we'll go right

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.550 
select the copy button we'll go right
into<00:02:05.159> let's<00:02:06.090> say<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.420> podcasts<00:02:07.079> folder<00:02:07.380> since

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
into let's say the podcasts folder since

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.300 
into let's say the podcasts folder since
that's<00:02:07.799> empty

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that's empty

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.730 
that's empty
and<00:02:08.420> paste<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.950> paste

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
and paste it paste

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.520 
and paste it paste
you

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.650 

so<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.680> only<00:02:17.770> took<00:02:18.070> maybe<00:02:18.370> five<00:02:18.850> seconds<00:02:19.510> or

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
so that only took maybe five seconds or

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.740 
so that only took maybe five seconds or
so<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:21.100> let's<00:02:21.250> go<00:02:21.370> back<00:02:21.400> over<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.270> USB

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
so so let's go back over to the USB

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.280 
so so let's go back over to the USB
drive<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.350> select<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.160> 55<00:02:24.610> megabyte<00:02:25.290> 150

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
drive and select a 55 megabyte 150

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.780 
drive and select a 55 megabyte 150
megabyte<00:02:26.710> one<00:02:26.940> copy<00:02:27.940> into<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.930> same<00:02:29.140> folder

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
megabyte one copy into the same folder

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:50.030 
megabyte one copy into the same folder
go

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.089 

so<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.190> one<00:02:51.370> took<00:02:51.580> around<00:02:51.870> 30<00:02:52.870> seconds<00:02:53.470> if

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
so that one took around 30 seconds if

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.649 
so that one took around 30 seconds if
you're<00:02:54.280> doing<00:02:54.489> files<00:02:54.940> around<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.420> size

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
you're doing files around this size

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.149 
you're doing files around this size
you're<00:02:56.230> not<00:02:56.349> going<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.560> be<00:02:56.620> waiting<00:02:56.920> very<00:02:57.040> long

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
you're not going to be waiting very long

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.690 
you're not going to be waiting very long
so<00:02:58.000> we're<00:02:58.150> going<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.450> move<00:02:58.659> these<00:02:58.810> back<00:02:59.170> over

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
so we're going to move these back over

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.460 
so we're going to move these back over
to<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.000> USB<00:03:01.420> Drive<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.730> let<00:03:03.730> me<00:03:03.819> go<00:03:03.940> delete<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
to the USB Drive so let me go delete the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.289 
to the USB Drive so let me go delete the
ones<00:03:05.650> off<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.950> drive<00:03:06.629> and<00:03:08.069> back<00:03:09.069> into<00:03:09.549> my

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
ones off the drive and back into my

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.080 
ones off the drive and back into my
memory<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.260> let's<00:03:11.530> see<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.799> 10<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.700> 10<00:03:12.879> Meg

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
memory so let's see the 10 the 10 Meg

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:23.650 
memory so let's see the 10 the 10 Meg
one<00:03:13.330> back<00:03:13.569> over

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.760 

around<00:03:24.350> eight<00:03:24.650> nine<00:03:24.980> seconds<00:03:26.050> go<00:03:27.050> to<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.320> 55

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
around eight nine seconds go to the 55

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:54.199 
around eight nine seconds go to the 55
Meg<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:30.320> paste

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.170 

so<00:03:54.840> around<00:03:55.019> 33<00:03:55.590> seconds<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:58.709> works<00:03:59.180> or

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
so around 33 seconds so it works or

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.360 
so around 33 seconds so it works or
works<00:04:00.390> well<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.620> definitely<00:04:02.129> recommend

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
works well and I definitely recommend

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.089 
works well and I definitely recommend
buying<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.969> because<00:04:03.379> if<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.590> if<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.920> need
