what<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.810> already<00:00:21.960> know<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:22.859> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
what we already know how to do it on a

here's<00:00:24.240> neutral<00:00:24.660> then<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.470> crank<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.800> right

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
here's neutral then you crank it right

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.220 
here's neutral then you crank it right
and<00:00:26.220> then<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.300> way<00:00:27.420> back<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and then you go all the way back to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
and then you go all the way back to
crouch<00:00:28.980> block<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.849> move<00:00:29.970> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
crouch block and then you move it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.179 
crouch block and then you move it
forward<00:00:30.240> again<00:00:30.500> that's<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> lot<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.769> travel

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
forward again that's a lot of travel

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.930 
forward again that's a lot of travel
time<00:00:32.279> same<00:00:32.610> with<00:00:32.759> your<00:00:32.880> thumb<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.210> AB<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> pad

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
time same with your thumb on AB on a pad

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.160 
time same with your thumb on AB on a pad
hitbox<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> little<00:00:36.420> different<00:00:36.719> take<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
hitbox is a little different take on it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.619 
hitbox is a little different take on it
there's<00:00:37.559> no<00:00:38.040> travel<00:00:38.309> time<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> little

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
there's no travel time and it's a little

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.660 
there's no travel time and it's a little
more<00:00:39.809> simple<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> Grassi<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.160> tap<00:00:41.370> forward

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
more simple to Grassi the tap forward

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.410 
more simple to Grassi the tap forward
down<00:00:42.480> down<00:00:42.989> forward<00:00:43.879> fingers<00:00:44.879> never<00:00:45.149> move

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
down down forward fingers never move

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.830 
down down forward fingers never move
there's<00:00:45.750> no<00:00:45.899> travel<00:00:46.170> time<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
there's no travel time as you can get a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.410 
there's no travel time as you can get a
lot<00:00:48.840> more<00:00:49.079> computable<00:00:49.559> play<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> I'll<00:00:51.239> show

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
lot more computable play so I'll show

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.330 
lot more computable play so I'll show
you<00:00:51.449> real<00:00:51.660> quick<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> left<00:00:52.289> side<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
you real quick on the left side it's the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.549 
you real quick on the left side it's the
same<00:00:53.579> thing<00:00:53.820> only<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.360> start<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.719> your<00:00:54.930> ring

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
same thing only you start with your ring

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.970 
same thing only you start with your ring
finger<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:57.360> results<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.170> lot<00:00:58.590> less<00:00:58.770> side

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
finger and results a lot less side

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
finger and results a lot less side
dependency<00:00:59.719> it's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:00.960> different<00:01:01.109> at

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
dependency it's a little different at

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.930 
dependency it's a little different at
first<00:01:01.320> using<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:01.890> ring<00:01:02.010> finger<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.699> you'll

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
first using your ring finger but you'll

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.060 
first using your ring finger but you'll
be<00:01:02.969> fine<00:01:03.359> long<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.260> stay<00:01:04.439> nice<00:01:04.589> loose<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
be fine long as you stay nice loose and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.289 
be fine long as you stay nice loose and
relaxed<00:01:05.750> doesn't<00:01:06.750> matter<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.430> don't<00:01:09.150> mess

using<00:02:04.670> what<00:02:04.760> we<00:02:04.850> talked<00:02:05.030> about<00:02:05.180> last<00:02:05.420> lesson

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
using what we talked about last lesson

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.270 
using what we talked about last lesson
with<00:02:06.050> fairly<00:02:06.650> depressing<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:08.020> forward<00:02:09.020> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
with fairly depressing the forward and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.860 
with fairly depressing the forward and
then<00:02:10.280> falling<00:02:10.610> into<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.060> plink<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.660> feels

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
then falling into the plink so it feels

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.610 
then falling into the plink so it feels
like<00:02:12.110> one<00:02:12.700> liquid<00:02:13.700> motion<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.920> fast<00:02:16.130> very

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
like one liquid motion it's fast very

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.990 
like one liquid motion it's fast very
fast<00:02:18.620> fast<00:02:19.070> fast<00:02:19.190> fast

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
fast fast fast fast

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.510 
fast fast fast fast
you<00:02:20.900> do<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.140> when<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.710> want<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.920> do<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.190> that
