it is more efficient to work with larger

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.610 
it is more efficient to work with larger
chunks<00:01:34.310> rather<00:01:35.030> than<00:01:35.390> single<00:01:35.690> phonemes<00:01:36.320> that

chunks rather than single phonemes that

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:52.020 
chunks rather than single phonemes that
now<00:01:36.979> add<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.340> last<00:01:37.520> part<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.690> know<00:01:50.170> and
