that is in fact the case we're going to
hit<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> couple<00:00:21.960> times<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.560> some<00:00:22.769> io<00:00:23.189> shot

hit a couple times with some io shot
skirt<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.689> give<00:00:27.840> them<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.990> work

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
being slowed down by auto mode or is it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.630 
being slowed down by auto mode or is it
just<00:00:45.180> blocking<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.770> alert<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
just blocking the alert because it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.970 
just blocking the alert because it
didn't<00:00:47.879> last<00:00:48.120> long<00:00:48.450> enough<00:00:48.719> let's<00:00:49.680> try<00:00:49.860> this

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
didn't last long enough let's try this

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.010 
didn't last long enough let's try this
let's<00:00:50.579> try<00:00:51.350> hitting<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.500> an<00:00:52.800> IO<00:00:52.949> shot

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
let's try hitting it with an IO shot

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.619 
let's try hitting it with an IO shot
while<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.410> auto<00:00:56.100> mode<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.510> what

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
while it's in auto mode but then what

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.500 
while it's in auto mode but then what
the<00:00:57.719> signal<00:00:58.050> turned<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.530> we're<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
the signal turned off we're going to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.119 
the signal turned off we're going to
quickly<00:01:00.510> switch<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.230> highway<00:01:01.620> mode<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
quickly switch it in highway mode and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:11.469 
quickly switch it in highway mode and
see<00:01:02.510> what<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.799> seen<00:01:05.810> here<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.930> go

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.310 

there<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:14.310> got<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> signal<00:01:15.560> 24.1<00:01:16.560> 35<00:01:18.320> so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
there it is it got the signal 24.1 35 so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
there it is it got the signal 24.1 35 so
the<00:01:19.470> max<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:22.729> that<00:01:23.729> k<00:01:24.000> band

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the max is actually see that k band

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
the max is actually see that k band
signal<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:25.560> auto<00:01:25.799> mode<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.580> not

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
signal in auto mode it's just not

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.649 
signal in auto mode it's just not
permitting<00:01:27.750> an<00:01:27.869> alert<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.470> set<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:30.210> we'll

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
permitting an alert to be set now we'll

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.310 
permitting an alert to be set now we'll
get<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.930> highway<00:01:31.290> mode<00:01:32.780> we'll<00:01:33.780> leave<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.140> my

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
get in highway mode we'll leave it in my

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.810 
get in highway mode we'll leave it in my
way<00:01:34.500> mode<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.920> shoot<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> couple<00:01:35.610> times

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
way mode will shoot you a couple times

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.480 
way mode will shoot you a couple times
here<00:01:36.500> show<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> how<00:01:37.710> quick<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.369> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
here show you how quick it really is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.039 
here show you how quick it really is
it's<00:01:39.150> always<00:01:39.299> seeing<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> signal<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.380> way

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:02:00.010 

24.1<00:01:46.049> 36

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.310 

so<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.410> fast<00:02:02.210> in<00:02:03.210> highway<00:02:03.840> mode<00:02:04.050> it's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
so very fast in highway mode it's

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.030 
so very fast in highway mode it's
telling<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.710> user<00:02:04.740> exactly<00:02:05.550> what<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.820> seen

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
telling the user exactly what it's seen

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.900 
telling the user exactly what it's seen
but<00:02:08.040> when<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.369> switch<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.119> auto<00:02:09.660> mode<00:02:10.910> now

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
but when we switch it to auto mode now

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.820 
but when we switch it to auto mode now
it's<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.270> build<00:02:12.540> something<00:02:13.020> haba<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's going to build something haba the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.410 
it's going to build something haba the
late<00:02:14.010> built<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.490> there<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.850> if<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.060> signal

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
late built in there and if that signal

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.090 
late built in there and if that signal
doesn't<00:02:15.600> persist<00:02:16.080> over<00:02:16.320> certain<00:02:16.860> amount<00:02:17.010> of

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
doesn't persist over certain amount of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.990 
doesn't persist over certain amount of
time<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:18.600> won't<00:02:18.870> send<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.410> alert<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:20.490> near<00:02:20.760> you

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
time it won't send the alert to near you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.690 
time it won't send the alert to near you
no<00:02:21.690> audio<00:02:22.080> no<00:02:22.140> visual<00:02:25.970> alert<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.880> learn

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
no audio no visual alert then we learn

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.340 
no audio no visual alert then we learn
no<00:02:32.700> alert<00:02:32.940> now<00:02:34.489> we'll<00:02:35.489> hit<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.790> again<00:02:36.150> k<00:02:37.050> being

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
no alert now we'll hit it again k being

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.100 
no alert now we'll hit it again k being
shot<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.940> again<00:02:39.180> we'll<00:02:39.360> quickly<00:02:39.600> switch<00:02:39.959> it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
shot and again we'll quickly switch it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.600 
shot and again we'll quickly switch it
in<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.290> highway<00:02:40.500> mode<00:02:40.890> see<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> alert

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
in the highway mode see if the alert

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.090 
in the highway mode see if the alert
star

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.880 

okay<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:49.310> not<00:02:49.430> there<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:49.820> time
