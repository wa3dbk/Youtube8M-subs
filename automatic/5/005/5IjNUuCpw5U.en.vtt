00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.030
 didn't cheat on flour i did it 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.430
 specifically to reduce the amount 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.140
 carbohydrate 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:06.490

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.930
 browned on one side 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.850
 Well, I was asked to go round attention 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.190
 on the fact that the pan with ceramic 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.680
 I just fell in love with it 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.820
 because but she doesn't require there 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.420
 in addition to you 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.490
 roll in flour effect of cells or there 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.860
 large amounts of oil is not easy 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.230
 nothing sticks still wanted to draw 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.920
 attention that I lowered the temperature from 9 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.640
 to 6 to roast over moderate heat 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.640
 all chops 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.069
