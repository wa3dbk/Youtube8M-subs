 a team letter from Uruguay in 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.400

 d 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.780
 attention because I think the autograph 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.590

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.420
 Russia 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.520
 and if Mr. robbie van persie I think that 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.450
 that autograph because it's rotated 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.450
