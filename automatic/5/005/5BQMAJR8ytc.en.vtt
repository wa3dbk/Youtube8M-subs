00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
if people could make their own skins and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
if people could make their own skins and
submit<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> who<00:01:13.170> knows<00:01:13.350> even<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
submit it in and who knows even with the

submit it in and who knows even with the
skin<00:01:14.250> packs<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.729> released<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.180> they

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
skin packs they do released if they

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
skin packs they do released if they
released<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> community<00:01:16.619> skin

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
released something like a community skin

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.039 
released something like a community skin
pack<00:01:17.189> would<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.240> nice<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.810> would

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
pack would be really nice and would

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.719 
pack would be really nice and would
branch<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.650> into<00:01:19.920> many<00:01:20.100> different<00:01:20.189> ways<00:01:20.520> if

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
branch out into many different ways if

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700 
branch out into many different ways if
they<00:01:20.970> could<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:22.439> just

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
they could do that and I you know just

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.320 
they could do that and I you know just
stuff<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> mario<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> sonic<00:01:24.000> stuff

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
stuff with the mario and sonic stuff

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.789 
stuff with the mario and sonic stuff
it's<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.659> hard<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.170> stuff<00:01:25.290> approved

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
it's so hard to get that stuff approved

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.940 
it's so hard to get that stuff approved
and<00:01:26.070> almost<00:01:26.520> near<00:01:26.759> impossible<00:01:27.420> sadly<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.140> only
