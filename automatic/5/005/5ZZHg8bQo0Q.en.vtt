if you have your own mod packs you can

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.000 
if you have your own mod packs you can
do<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.230> following<00:00:16.619> mods<00:00:16.800> will<00:00:16.920> be

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
do this but the following mods will be

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.980 
do this but the following mods will be
using<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> thermal<00:00:18.029> expansion<00:00:18.830> build<00:00:19.830> craft

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
using a thermal expansion build craft

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.840 
using a thermal expansion build craft
extra<00:00:21.990> utilities<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.859> don't<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.640> use

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
extra utilities you don't have to use

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.939 
extra utilities you don't have to use
these<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.900> easily<00:00:25.170> use<00:00:25.529> other<00:00:25.859> things

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
these you can easily use other things

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.609 
these you can easily use other things
but<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.599> using<00:00:29.900> these<00:00:30.900> instead<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
but I just like using these instead of

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.450 
but I just like using these instead of
for<00:00:32.099> instance<00:00:32.189> build<00:00:32.669> craft<00:00:32.910> pipes<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
for instance build craft pipes the the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
for instance build craft pipes the the
two<00:00:35.880> essential<00:00:36.120> mods<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.110> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
two essential mods that you will have to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.720 
two essential mods that you will have to
have<00:00:37.500> build<00:00:38.489> craft<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.030> ARS<00:00:39.390> Magica<00:00:39.809> though

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730

here or there if you place it here it's
gonna<00:02:58.659> place<00:02:59.310> liquid<00:03:00.310> essence<00:03:00.610> down<00:03:00.970> here<00:03:01.239> and

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
gonna place liquid essence down here and

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.110 
gonna place liquid essence down here and
along<00:03:02.019> all<00:03:02.230> these<00:03:02.409> blocks<00:03:02.620> as<00:03:02.799> well<00:03:02.829> but<00:03:03.790> just

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
along all these blocks as well but just

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.640 
along all these blocks as well but just
for<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.420> video<00:03:04.750> I'll<00:03:05.049> do<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.260> down<00:03:05.409> here

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
for the video I'll do it down here

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.839 
for the video I'll do it down here
because<00:03:05.920> we<00:03:06.159> don't<00:03:06.250> really<00:03:06.430> need<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.700> place

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
because we don't really need to place

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.580 
because we don't really need to place
that<00:03:07.030> much<00:03:07.950> okay<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.870> we're<00:03:11.079> going<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.349> need

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
that much okay now we're going to need

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.539 
that much okay now we're going to need
some<00:03:12.099> storage<00:03:13.030> for<00:03:14.019> liquid<00:03:14.319> essence<00:03:14.590> now<00:03:15.220> how

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
some storage for liquid essence now how

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.490 
some storage for liquid essence now how
you<00:03:15.609> go<00:03:16.000> about<00:03:16.150> getting<00:03:16.689> the<00:03:16.840> liquid<00:03:17.019> essence

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
you go about getting the liquid essence

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.559 
you go about getting the liquid essence
is<00:03:17.769> entirely<00:03:18.310> up<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.939> can<00:03:19.060> use<00:03:19.090> pumps

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
is entirely up to you you can use pumps

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.690 
is entirely up to you you can use pumps
within<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.019> tanks<00:03:20.349> you<00:03:20.470> can<00:03:20.500> use<00:03:20.739> Universal

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
within the tanks you can use Universal

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.970 
within the tanks you can use Universal
fluid<00:03:22.030> cells<00:03:22.269> there<00:03:23.049> are<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:23.349> many<00:03:23.530> ways<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.859> do

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
fluid cells there are so many ways to do

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.039 
fluid cells there are so many ways to do
this<00:03:24.099> but<00:03:24.459> that's<00:03:25.090> not<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.480> problem<00:03:25.659> I<00:03:25.900> came

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
this but that's not the problem I came

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.539 
this but that's not the problem I came
across<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.440> problem<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:26.829> came<00:03:27.040> across<00:03:27.129> was

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
across the problem I came across was

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.990 
across the problem I came across was
spending<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:28.709> 10<00:03:29.709> minutes<00:03:29.920> clicking<00:03:30.879> on

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
spending like 10 minutes clicking on

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.270 
spending like 10 minutes clicking on
buckets<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.480> emptying<00:03:31.780> them<00:03:31.989> into<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
buckets and emptying them into the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.699 
buckets and emptying them into the
essense<00:03:34.209> nexus<00:03:34.569> so<00:03:34.989> we<00:03:35.349> won't<00:03:35.560> worry<00:03:35.590> about

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
essense nexus so we won't worry about

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.509 
essense nexus so we won't worry about
that<00:03:36.069> so<00:03:37.000> say<00:03:37.840> we've<00:03:38.319> got<00:03:38.500> our<00:03:38.680> liquid<00:03:39.250> essence

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
that so say we've got our liquid essence

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.300 
that so say we've got our liquid essence
there's<00:03:39.849> 256<00:03:40.780> buckets<00:03:41.079> in<00:03:41.200> there<00:03:41.319> all<00:03:42.220> right

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
there's 256 buckets in there all right

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.129 
there's 256 buckets in there all right
let's<00:03:42.609> get<00:03:42.730> something<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.120> pipe<00:03:43.780> out<00:03:43.959> the

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
let's get something to pipe out the

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:44.780 
let's get something to pipe out the
fluid

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
fluid

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.440 
fluid
okay<00:03:45.790> fluid<00:03:46.180> ox<00:03:46.299> will<00:03:46.480> do<00:03:48.060> now<00:03:49.060> I'm<00:03:49.239> just<00:03:49.329> going

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
okay fluid ox will do now I'm just going

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.480 
okay fluid ox will do now I'm just going
to<00:03:49.510> do<00:03:49.689> that

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:03.920 

and<00:03:55.490> now<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.740> stop<00:03:58.040> popping<00:03:58.430> out<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.610> fluid

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.030 

it'll<00:04:04.930> go<00:04:05.080> into<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.320> floodgate<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:08.040> they'll

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
it'll go into the floodgate and they'll

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.980 
it'll go into the floodgate and they'll
start<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> spin<00:04:09.670> Singh<00:04:09.910> out<00:04:10.090> all<00:04:10.390> over<00:04:10.450> that

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
start the spin Singh out all over that

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.950 
start the spin Singh out all over that
bottom<00:04:11.260> level<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.970> as<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.090> can<00:04:13.210> see<00:04:13.450> we're

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
bottom level and as you can see we're

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.830 
bottom level and as you can see we're
not<00:04:14.020> using<00:04:14.320> a<00:04:14.380> bucket<00:04:14.560> at<00:04:14.800> all<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.690> is

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
not using a bucket at all so that is

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.010 
not using a bucket at all so that is
what<00:04:17.080> I<00:04:17.110> call<00:04:17.790> sweet-ass<00:04:18.790> automation<00:04:19.510> for<00:04:19.780> the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
what I call sweet-ass automation for the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.830 
what I call sweet-ass automation for the
as<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.860> dispensing<00:04:21.580> of<00:04:21.700> liquid<00:04:22.090> essence<00:04:22.420> into

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
as the dispensing of liquid essence into

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.810 
as the dispensing of liquid essence into
the<00:04:23.140> next<00:04:23.500> next<00:04:23.740> i<00:04:23.860> because<00:04:24.160> i've<00:04:24.340> spent<00:04:24.490> so

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
the next next i because i've spent so

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.370 
the next next i because i've spent so
much<00:04:25.000> time<00:04:25.060> using<00:04:25.570> buckets<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.260> was

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
much time using buckets and I was

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.640 
much time using buckets and I was
wondering<00:04:27.310> how<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.520> could<00:04:27.760> avoid<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.290> do

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
wondering how I could avoid that and do

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.420 
wondering how I could avoid that and do
something<00:04:29.680> else<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.600> finally<00:04:31.840> did<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.560> I'm

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
something else and I finally did so I'm

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.350 
something else and I finally did so I'm
really<00:04:33.580> happy<00:04:33.790> about<00:04:33.910> that

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
really happy about that

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.840 
really happy about that
and<00:04:34.450> for<00:04:35.410> instance<00:04:35.680> if<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.950> wanted<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.430> you

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
and for instance if you wanted to you

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.410 
and for instance if you wanted to you
could<00:04:37.030> easily<00:04:37.300> just<00:04:37.690> do<00:04:38.590> this<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.420> replace

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
could easily just do this and replace

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.190 
could easily just do this and replace
that<00:04:41.010> there<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:43.450> then<00:04:43.600> that<00:04:43.750> would<00:04:43.930> fill<00:04:44.170> up

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
that there and then that would fill up

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.020 
that there and then that would fill up
this<00:04:44.500> level<00:04:44.860> as<00:04:44.980> well<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.700> that<00:04:45.850> would<00:04:46.000> just

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
this level as well and that would just

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.720 
this level as well and that would just
leave<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.450> even<00:04:46.630> more<00:04:46.780> essence<00:04:47.080> below<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.730> as

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
leave you even more essence below you as

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.830 
leave you even more essence below you as
you<00:04:48.850> can<00:04:48.940> see<00:04:49.060> it's<00:04:49.180> already<00:04:49.300> nearly<00:04:49.630> hitting

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
you can see it's already nearly hitting

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.790 
you can see it's already nearly hitting
8%<00:04:51.480> now<00:04:52.480> what<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.660> did<00:04:52.870> over<00:04:53.050> there<00:04:53.380> was<00:04:53.590> just

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
8% now what I did over there was just

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.300 
8% now what I did over there was just
basically<00:04:54.190> just<00:04:55.500> some<00:04:56.500> red<00:04:56.710> alloy<00:04:57.010> Wow

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
basically just some red alloy Wow

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.610 
basically just some red alloy Wow
running<00:04:57.850> along<00:04:58.090> here<00:04:58.120> redstone<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.020> then

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
running along here redstone and then

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.680 
running along here redstone and then
when<00:04:59.770> I<00:04:59.800> don't<00:05:00.700> want<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:00.910> dispense<00:05:01.300> anymore<00:05:01.660> I

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
when I don't want to dispense anymore I

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.630 
when I don't want to dispense anymore I
just<00:05:01.750> flip<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.440> lever<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.890> it<00:05:03.010> stops<00:05:03.280> pulling

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
just flip the lever and it stops pulling

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.430 
just flip the lever and it stops pulling
it<00:05:03.730> out<00:05:03.850> sorry<00:05:04.420> but<00:05:04.630> that's<00:05:04.840> all<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.050> did<00:05:05.260> there

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
it out sorry but that's all I did there

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.680 
it out sorry but that's all I did there
yeah<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.490> base<00:05:06.670> premise<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.240> basically

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
yeah so the base premise is basically

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.590 
yeah so the base premise is basically
the<00:05:07.900> floodgate<00:05:08.440> that's<00:05:08.680> about<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:09.450> then<00:05:10.450> it's

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
the floodgate that's about it then it's

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.340 
the floodgate that's about it then it's
just<00:05:10.660> a<00:05:10.840> setup<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.320> do<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:12.870> redstone<00:05:13.870> signals

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
just a setup you do and redstone signals

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.470 
just a setup you do and redstone signals
and<00:05:14.560> all<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:14.800> stuff<00:05:15.100> so<00:05:15.390> thanks<00:05:16.390> for
