00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.020
 Cadjee Chief has not a little moment 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.160
 we did not see but the sun 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.620
 who comes back I'm already in the process of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.540
 prepare for the future look for the mayor by 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.910
 botul it's the big hall d here with 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 my expert hello to all by simple 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.190
 small barbecue with a large surface 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.020
 Cooking 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.220
 she will show us directly how 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 we start the slap no 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.250
 no other 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 and in pace now we will leave 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.029
 heat a little while and then we go 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.580
 start on sett as first 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.770
 pregnancy I planned a rack of lamb at 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.410
 thyme is what I love when we 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.750
 counted for grilling as cooking 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 so the ideal is first to do it 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.530
 play on the giant plates and vivid 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.260
 so yes exactly 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
 and then we put it in aluminum 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.129
 for a live cooking had 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.580
 quietly will let the lamb cook 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.600
 melting of our hit the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.600
 perfect then let's go for the news 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.410
 there are two all the noise outside 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.780
 these are these two double burns or h 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 so a lot of power and it's 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.830
 equitable and its distributed property over any 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.140
 the surface so really robust like 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.050
 as tired so here I get my at 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.820
 a lamb case well grier 3 little bit of 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.590
 misdemeanor a loaf of salt of the evil pepper 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 placed on the rooster's grid will continue 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.680
 to write quietly 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
 but age it is also the control of the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 temperature on the cost of crime 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.390
 that's really great for mad max 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.390
 baucus features 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.460
 3 2 facing the level of cleaning 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.619
 it's very simple in fact we close like 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.549
 a good principle we heat up thoroughly 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.549
 maximum 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.220
 that's exactly for 15 minutes and 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.200
 very hot it removes a brush 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.060
 it's all nice simple all this is so 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.479
 really easy to use for grilling 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.979
 simple to clean compact enough for bc2 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.530
 who even types only a small balcony 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.880
 you work and then we're good 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.500
 go get fancy take me think 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 really a child and for seven of eleven 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.049
 cars 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.049
