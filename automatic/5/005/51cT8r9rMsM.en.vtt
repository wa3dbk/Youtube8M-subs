00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.290 
on the ninth fret and G I'm gonna pick
1911<00:01:30.790> on<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.180> g<00:01:31.450> string<00:01:32.940> but<00:01:33.940> I'm<00:01:34.030> not<00:01:34.150> gonna

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
those eighth notes together one more

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.060 
those eighth notes together one more
time<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.210> D<00:02:18.990> okay<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.260> let<00:02:20.380> me<00:02:20.470> play<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.770> up<00:02:20.920> to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
time so D okay so let me play that up to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.660 
time so D okay so let me play that up to
speed<00:02:22.860> then<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:23.950> carry<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.630> five<00:02:25.630> six<00:02:25.989> seven<00:02:26.670> on

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
speed then I carry on five six seven on

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.170 
speed then I carry on five six seven on
the<00:02:28.000> G<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:28.930> civil<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.530> e<00:02:29.760> at<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.910> same

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the G with civil on the e at the same

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.199 
the G with civil on the e at the same
thing<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.630> Fritz<00:02:31.930> lower<00:02:32.170> three<00:02:33.100> four<00:02:33.459> five<00:02:33.850> on

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
thing to Fritz lower three four five on

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.490 
thing to Fritz lower three four five on
the<00:02:34.360> G<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:35.550> then<00:02:36.550> five<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.239> G<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.320> those

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the G and then five on the G so those

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.780 
the G and then five on the G so those
eighth<00:02:38.739> notes<00:02:38.770> would<00:02:39.220> sound<00:02:39.430> like<00:02:39.489> this

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
eighth notes would sound like this

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.200 
eighth notes would sound like this
slowly<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.320> speed

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
slowly and up to speed

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.610 
slowly and up to speed
okay<00:02:47.210> so<00:02:47.270> let's<00:02:47.720> put<00:02:47.840> everything<00:02:48.350> we've

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
okay so let's put everything we've

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.160 
okay so let's put everything we've
looked<00:02:48.830> at<00:02:48.950> together<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.520> far<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.540> then<00:02:54.080> I

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
looked at together so far and then I

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.390 
looked at together so far and then I
ended<00:02:54.470> with<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:55.160> fourth<00:02:55.430> rate<00:02:55.670> energy<00:02:56.120> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
ended with the fourth rate energy and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.390 
ended with the fourth rate energy and
then<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.610> third<00:02:59.210> fret<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.810> e-string<00:03:00.400> so

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
then the third fret on the e-string so

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.430 
then the third fret on the e-string so
slowly<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.910> lick<00:03:02.240> would<00:03:02.420> be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.940 

okay<00:03:10.130> now<00:03:10.340> there's<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.210> slight<00:03:12.080> variation<00:03:12.530> on

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
okay now there's a slight variation on

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.640 
okay now there's a slight variation on
that<00:03:12.980> if<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.460> play<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.760> up<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.910> speed<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.500> do

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
that if you play it up to speed to to do

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.280 
that if you play it up to speed to to do
to<00:03:15.980> emulate<00:03:16.490> that<00:03:16.640> chicken<00:03:17.060> picking<00:03:17.900> type<00:03:18.140> of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
to emulate that chicken picking type of

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.260 
to emulate that chicken picking type of
sound<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.250> let<00:03:19.400> me<00:03:19.460> play<00:03:19.610> it<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.790> you're<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.120> to

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
sound so let me play it to you're up to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.970 
sound so let me play it to you're up to
speeds<00:03:20.570> or<00:03:20.780> Holik<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.380> then<00:03:21.530> I'll<00:03:21.650> discuss

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
speeds or Holik and then I'll discuss

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.660 
speeds or Holik and then I'll discuss
the<00:03:22.160> technique<00:03:22.520> in<00:03:22.640> more<00:03:22.760> detail<00:03:23.120> here<00:03:23.450> we<00:03:23.540> go

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.450 

okay<00:03:28.360> so<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.500> hear<00:03:29.740> on<00:03:29.890> my<00:03:30.100> dream

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
okay so as you can hear on my dream

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.790 
okay so as you can hear on my dream
string<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:31.030> kind<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.630> don't<00:03:31.930> play<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.470> notes

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
string I kind of I don't play the notes

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.250 
string I kind of I don't play the notes
ring<00:03:33.130> out<00:03:33.250> for<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.610> full<00:03:33.880> value<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.540> kind<00:03:35.200> of

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
ring out for the full value I kind of

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.490 
ring out for the full value I kind of
keep<00:03:35.470> them<00:03:35.680> muted<00:03:36.430> slightly<00:03:37.080> so<00:03:38.080> they<00:03:38.230> sound

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
keep them muted slightly so they sound

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:48.450 
keep them muted slightly so they sound
more<00:03:38.620> more<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:39.460> this<00:03:44.040> instead<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:47.370> because<00:03:48.370> I

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
more more like this instead of because I

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.950 
more more like this instead of because I
want<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.790> contours<00:03:49.240> of<00:03:49.390> this<00:03:49.600> slightly

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
want the contours of this slightly

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.270 
want the contours of this slightly
muffled<00:03:51.750> sound<00:03:52.750> with<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.140> bright<00:03:53.500> sound<00:03:53.830> on<00:03:54.100> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
muffled sound with a bright sound on the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.660 
muffled sound with a bright sound on the
on<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.640> E<00:03:54.670> string<00:03:58.170> okay<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.340> one<00:04:00.340> way<00:04:00.520> of

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
on the E string okay so one way of

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.580 
on the E string okay so one way of
achieving<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:01.240> is<00:04:01.300> as<00:04:01.540> soon<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.320> making

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
achieving that is as soon just making

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.500 
achieving that is as soon just making
sure<00:04:02.740> that<00:04:02.770> you're<00:04:03.070> playing<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:04.180> notes<00:04:04.390> on

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
sure that you're playing the notes on

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.780 
sure that you're playing the notes on
the<00:04:04.570> g<00:04:04.600> string<00:04:04.810> with<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.440> very<00:04:05.709> staccato<00:04:05.980> type

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
the g string with a very staccato type

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:19.949 
the g string with a very staccato type
of<00:04:07.050> phrasing<00:04:17.850> then<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.940> can<00:04:19.090> hear<00:04:19.299> those<00:04:19.510> the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
of phrasing then you can hear those the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.050 
of phrasing then you can hear those the
top<00:04:20.170> note<00:04:20.380> really<00:04:20.590> jumps<00:04:20.980> out<00:04:23.760> okay<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:24.820> that's

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
top note really jumps out okay so that's

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.880 
top note really jumps out okay so that's
basically<00:04:25.480> what's<00:04:25.750> known<00:04:25.930> as<00:04:26.170> chicken

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
basically what's known as chicken

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.800 
basically what's known as chicken
picking<00:04:27.280> now<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:27.970> can<00:04:28.240> also<00:04:28.390> play<00:04:29.730> scales<00:04:30.810> with

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
picking now I can also play scales with

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.300 
picking now I can also play scales with
that<00:04:32.020> where<00:04:32.200> I<00:04:32.230> don't<00:04:32.440> have<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.770> interval

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
that where I don't have the interval

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.820 
that where I don't have the interval
jumps<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.000> then<00:04:34.750> let's<00:04:35.080> say<00:04:35.290> I'm<00:04:35.590> going<00:04:35.770> to

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
jumps and then let's say I'm going to

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.670 
jumps and then let's say I'm going to
play<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.430> C<00:04:36.900> country<00:04:37.900> scale<00:04:38.169> in<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.410> open

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
play the C country scale in the open

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.159 
play the C country scale in the open
position<00:04:38.770> using<00:04:39.640> sort<00:04:40.390> of<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.510> chicken<00:04:40.690> picking

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
position using sort of a chicken picking

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:50.090 
position using sort of a chicken picking
approach<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:42.030> then<00:04:43.030> it'll<00:04:43.240> sound<00:04:43.540> like<00:04:43.690> this

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.440 

okay<00:04:51.100> so<00:04:51.160> that's<00:04:51.430> quite<00:04:51.669> a<00:04:51.700> different<00:04:52.150> sound

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
okay so that's quite a different sound

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.480 
okay so that's quite a different sound
as<00:04:52.780> opposed<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.380> alternate<00:04:53.919> picking<00:04:54.130> let<00:04:54.430> me

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
as opposed to alternate picking let me

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.920 
as opposed to alternate picking let me
play<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.850> lick<00:04:55.000> for<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.210> using<00:04:55.510> alternate

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
play that lick for you using alternate

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.939 
play that lick for you using alternate
picking<00:04:58.200> one<00:04:59.200> more<00:04:59.350> time<00:04:59.530> alternate<00:04:59.919> picking

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
picking one more time alternate picking

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.079 
picking one more time alternate picking
then<00:05:02.949> using<00:05:03.249> the<00:05:03.519> hybrid<00:05:03.729> picking<00:05:05.909> what<00:05:06.909> was

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:07.089 
then using the hybrid picking what was

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:10.469 
then using the hybrid picking what was
more<00:05:07.269> of<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.360> chicken<00:05:07.599> picking<00:05:08.080> approach<00:05:09.479> and

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
more of a chicken picking approach and

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.479 
more of a chicken picking approach and
you'll<00:05:11.049> see<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.529> same<00:05:11.739> thing<00:05:11.799> where<00:05:12.129> I<00:05:12.189> cut

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:12.489 
you'll see the same thing where I cut

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:15.569 
you'll see the same thing where I cut
the<00:05:12.669> note<00:05:12.849> shorter<00:05:13.389> I<00:05:14.199> don't<00:05:14.769> let<00:05:14.889> them<00:05:15.069> ring

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:15.579 
the note shorter I don't let them ring

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:20.100 
the note shorter I don't let them ring
for<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.909> fool<00:05:16.179> for<00:05:16.689> their<00:05:16.809> full<00:05:16.959> value<00:05:19.110> okay

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
for the fool for their full value okay

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.829 
for the fool for their full value okay
so<00:05:20.169> if<00:05:20.769> you<00:05:20.979> want<00:05:21.129> to<00:05:21.219> get<00:05:21.309> used<00:05:21.519> to<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.689> this

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:22.839 
so if you want to get used to to to this

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.209 
so if you want to get used to to to this
new<00:05:23.019> style<00:05:23.289> of<00:05:23.409> picking<00:05:23.679> then<00:05:23.829> I<00:05:23.889> would

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
new style of picking then I would

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.309 
new style of picking then I would
suggest<00:05:24.569> practicing<00:05:25.569> these<00:05:25.719> two<00:05:25.929> things<00:05:26.139> I've

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
suggest practicing these two things I've

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.169 
suggest practicing these two things I've
just<00:05:26.499> shown<00:05:26.829> you<00:05:26.860> first<00:05:27.759> of<00:05:27.879> all<00:05:27.999> would<00:05:28.119> be

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:28.179 
just shown you first of all would be

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:33.659 
just shown you first of all would be
this<00:05:28.419> lick<00:05:31.409> and<00:05:32.409> secondly<00:05:33.309> it<00:05:33.369> will<00:05:33.459> be<00:05:33.549> this

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
this lick and secondly it will be this

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.809 
this lick and secondly it will be this
one<00:05:37.679> so<00:05:38.679> you<00:05:38.769> can<00:05:38.889> practice<00:05:39.309> those<00:05:39.429> two<00:05:39.639> things

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
one so you can practice those two things

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.249 
one so you can practice those two things
just<00:05:40.179> to<00:05:40.269> get<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.479> hang<00:05:40.629> of<00:05:40.719> the<00:05:40.869> technique

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
just to get the hang of the technique

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.519 
just to get the hang of the technique
and<00:05:41.499> them<00:05:41.709> I've<00:05:41.889> used<00:05:42.309> that<00:05:42.610> style<00:05:43.539> for<00:05:44.289> most

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.529 
and them I've used that style for most

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.209 
and them I've used that style for most
of<00:05:44.679> the<00:05:44.769> solo<00:05:45.219> if<00:05:46.119> it's<00:05:46.360> if<00:05:46.509> it's<00:05:46.629> a<00:05:46.779> bit<00:05:46.929> too

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
of the solo if it's if it's a bit too

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.739 
of the solo if it's if it's a bit too
awkward<00:05:48.219> for<00:05:48.639> you<00:05:48.729> at<00:05:48.879> first<00:05:49.149> and<00:05:49.389> you<00:05:49.509> and<00:05:49.689> you

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:49.749 
awkward for you at first and you and you

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.749 
awkward for you at first and you and you
really<00:05:49.989> like<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.229> learn<00:05:50.349> the<00:05:50.469> solo<00:05:50.649> then<00:05:50.949> you

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
really like to learn the solo then you

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.189 
really like to learn the solo then you
can<00:05:51.939> do<00:05:52.059> that<00:05:52.209> with<00:05:52.360> just<00:05:52.599> alternate<00:05:52.959> picking

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
can do that with just alternate picking

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.519 
can do that with just alternate picking
of<00:05:53.409> course<00:05:53.679> as<00:05:53.829> well<00:05:54.039> but<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:56.050> get<00:05:56.169> that<00:05:56.379> kind

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 
of course as well but to get that kind

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.549 
of course as well but to get that kind
of<00:05:56.679> convincing<00:05:57.309> country<00:05:58.239> sound<00:05:58.569> then<00:05:59.229> I<00:05:59.379> would

00:05:59.549 --> 00:05:59.559 
of convincing country sound then I would

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.619 
of convincing country sound then I would
really<00:05:59.799> suggest<00:06:00.189> to<00:06:01.059> try<00:06:01.299> and<00:06:01.389> get<00:06:01.509> this

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
really suggest to try and get this

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.089 
really suggest to try and get this
chicken<00:06:01.839> picking<00:06:02.259> thing<00:06:02.439> under<00:06:02.619> your<00:06:02.679> fingers

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
chicken picking thing under your fingers

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.039 
chicken picking thing under your fingers
and<00:06:03.279> then<00:06:03.999> one<00:06:04.209> more<00:06:04.389> thing<00:06:04.629> before<00:06:04.749> we<00:06:04.959> move

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:05.049 
and then one more thing before we move

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:07.259 
and then one more thing before we move
on<00:06:05.289> to<00:06:05.319> the<00:06:05.469> actual<00:06:05.709> solo<00:06:06.279> because<00:06:06.849> I've<00:06:07.089> got<00:06:07.239> a

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:07.269 
on to the actual solo because I've got a

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:09.569 
on to the actual solo because I've got a
little<00:06:07.389> bit<00:06:07.569> of<00:06:07.659> a<00:06:07.719> slap<00:06:08.050> back<00:06:08.319> delay<00:06:08.349> on<00:06:09.129> my

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:09.579 
little bit of a slap back delay on my

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:12.059 
little bit of a slap back delay on my
sound<00:06:09.939> which<00:06:10.839> is<00:06:10.959> very<00:06:11.139> common<00:06:11.499> in<00:06:11.619> country<00:06:11.979> as

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
sound which is very common in country as

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.449 
sound which is very common in country as
well<00:06:12.279> just<00:06:12.969> to<00:06:13.619> throughout<00:06:14.619> me<00:06:14.829> start<00:06:15.069> even<00:06:15.279> a

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:15.459 
well just to throughout me start even a

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:18.659 
well just to throughout me start even a
little<00:06:15.669> bit<00:06:15.849> more<00:06:16.029> authentic<00:06:16.119> as<00:06:16.659> well<00:06:17.259> so<00:06:17.919> for

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
little bit more authentic as well so for

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.850 
little bit more authentic as well so for
setback<00:06:19.209> delay<00:06:19.479> you<00:06:19.659> can<00:06:19.689> try<00:06:20.019> if<00:06:20.349> you<00:06:20.709> add<00:06:20.829> a

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
setback delay you can try if you add a

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.189 
setback delay you can try if you add a
delay<00:06:21.159> unit<00:06:21.719> that<00:06:22.719> you<00:06:22.839> can<00:06:22.959> sit<00:06:23.139> in

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
delay unit that you can sit in

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.519 
delay unit that you can sit in
milliseconds<00:06:23.849> anything<00:06:24.849> from<00:06:25.059> about<00:06:25.509> 80<00:06:25.809> to

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
milliseconds anything from about 80 to

milliseconds anything from about 80 to
150<00:06:27.129> milliseconds<00:06:28.079> kind<00:06:29.079> of<00:06:29.249> tends<00:06:30.249> to<00:06:30.399> give

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
150 milliseconds kind of tends to give

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.759 
150 milliseconds kind of tends to give
you<00:06:30.610> a<00:06:30.639> nice<00:06:30.879> slap<00:06:31.179> back<00:06:31.419> sound<00:06:31.749> if<00:06:32.139> you've<00:06:32.559> got

you a nice slap back sound if you've got

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:35.639 
you a nice slap back sound if you've got
one<00:06:32.889> of<00:06:33.009> the<00:06:33.099> tap<00:06:33.909> delays<00:06:34.569> then<00:06:35.289> you<00:06:35.409> want<00:06:35.559> to

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649
