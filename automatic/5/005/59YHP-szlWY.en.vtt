00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.709
 hello that such welcome to 10 33 minutes were talks about how to run 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:05.930
 the order of the day 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.930
 and how to make your max movie 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.050
 It is very important to keep in mind that at the time that we use a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.189
 order we should reinforce it in a positive way what does this mean the peru 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.269
 he does something right we give him a prize 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.739
 one of the most common mistakes when using the order 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.039
 is that we supervise the order in situations of stress that means 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:35.660
 this 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.010
 we for example see that a car is approaching at high speed and it is then 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.810
 when they use 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.820
 or that an elder showed a child can be hurt by our 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.190
 accidentally dogs since then 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.320
 in such a way that every one of us says 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.360
 we do it only under stress situations 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.360
 Another very common error is when we use the order 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.300
 two and three times we started screaming 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 and the dog perceive the moment we provide 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.800
 we are under pressure the dog is scared we get angry 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.280
 and finally the situation ends in this way 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.490
 the dog stays still in the place we hope that we have 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.480
 on the other hand the others we approach him we scold 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 we take it to the chain we retire angry 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.870
 and the fearful dog 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.930
 this only closes a vicious circle in which the order 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.760
 to counteract the feeling of tension that the abdomen produces when 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.800
 you are in the street 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.780
 we recommend your customers 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.060
 small at home 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.220
 illana your dog when you are in a quiet situation and without 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.790
 seven breaks of bad congratulations and this 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.580
 as time goes by, it will be reinforced and what does not increase will happen 3 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.819
 once they have dominated side of a home try 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.760
 the time has come to practice the on the street 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.780
 This is clearly on a leash I came walking with you 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.929
 somewhat distracted point and a few steps back 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.919
 this is the moment that expresses your prize rows the order 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 on the other hand 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.689
 bring too much 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:51.029
 so also that the order came Jorge that puts you to test your friend idealize 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:52.539
 the opposition 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.039
 If you notice that he is distracted, another of the projects is normal 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.219
 who do want to go back to the previous step 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.779
 Remember that your dog must fulfill 100% of his orders to be a 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.439
 reliable dog in situations of stress whether for his own safety 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.809
 or that of other people
