00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.339
 hello a video here to show you 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.830
 how to estimate 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.599
 surface area measurements with 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.650
 the software measures in so we will 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.710
 put in the frame of the class of 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.150
 terminal where we can use this 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.970
 software to make an estimate of the 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.820
 leaf area of ​​a terrestrial plant 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.240
 so there terrestrial plants here that I have 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.400
 chosen is the foot laments and 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.360
 first step actually it's a 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.290
 once we have determined the mass of this 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.629
 foot of nantes then its volume 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.120
 eventually we go in a first 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.100
 time completely stripping spiez of 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.600
 mint and arrange the main 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.980
 elements that constitute it constitutes 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.990
 on a blank sheet taking care 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.850
 having 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.830
 an object whose leaders are known 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.420
 beauties on a piece of graph paper 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.160
 the leaves are arranged on a 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.560
 foot leaf in fact requests are 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.200
 arranged on a white background there the rod 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.960
 so we got this so we can 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.070
 we can use it with measured but we 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.350
 we're going a little bit better we're going 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.880
 change a little bit for the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.440
 result we get with the software 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.510
 be of better quality so we go on 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.150
 can easily retouched this kind of 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.550
 photos and so we have it in the editing 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.040
 image we removed here the stem 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.630
 we removed a very large part of the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.540
 grid you were there so you 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.450
 keep a small element of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.720
 of scale here was added our 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 legend with its translation 1 cm and then 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.570
 we actually have the leaves 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.450
 the interest of having made a photograph 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.730
 on a white background is to allow 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.210
 to have very colorful objects 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.630
 clearly 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.360
 we will say discernible by their 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.200
 outline then even that image there that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.890
 can be a document that can 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.390
 use after in communication even 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.190
 this image there we go a little bit more 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.170
 modify it and invade the mashed potatoes 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.420
 maximum to keep only 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.110
 leaves and then just the trail of 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.100
 sons sons so it gives the following thing 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.420
 and this is the document that we have 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.970
 worked so we are a little bit far 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.530
 from the original photo we always have the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.480
 line the scale 1 cm and then our 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.590
 leaves then the putis rod trial on 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.280
 will work with this document 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.580
 jean-marie so we will launch the jury and 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.739
 we will open with this one 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.870
 the image that is titled here leaves of 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.879
 words for 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.610
 Hong Kong opens the first of things to 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.599
 do since we're going to do a measurement that 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.950
 whether surface measurements or 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.430
 length the first thing to do is 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.379
 to define or modify create the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.810
 chains whose saint michel to define ok 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.019
 it's a length scale going back 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.520
 on the very strong suite we are asked 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.220
 to draw a line 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.290
 here we do and we try to superpose 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.640
 at best the work that we trace with 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.520
 the scale feature that is already at 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.510
 present it has been said that software that this 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.700
 line represents 1 cm and made 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.290
 investigation 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.000
 this is the cellars the re-entries 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.580
 remember it will only serve to 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.250
 this photo there we do ok then for 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.260
 measure the surface of the leaves on this 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.300
 white background there are many ways with 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.099
 measure and we will use a way that 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.060
 is quite simple we go to them in pictures and 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.340
 we will delimit zones 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.530
 so these areas it m to rely on the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.239
 does our objects our leaves are 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.549
 on a white background we will delimit 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.099
 areas and this is the point of having 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.959
 objects with a very contrasting color 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.090
 in relation to the bottom so what we 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.220
 demand the same jury in a 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.829
 first time to paint the objects of which 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.239
 we want to estimate the surface so here in 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.989
 do me what interests us not this 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.579
 which interests me is to see the surface 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.200
 green 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.480
 compared to my white background so I 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.890
 take the pencil 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.390
 request to paint on the image the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.430
 parts benchmarks mouse I 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.220
 take a pencil and I'll take a 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:01.010
 pencil with a very thick 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:04.280
 important I choose a color on 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.710
 to do by compliance with obligations in all 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.110
 case should not take white 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.530
 and I place a point 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.760
 so I placed a point 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.350
 then I do a thing with the bottom 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.060
 of the image so I'm going to keep my 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.510
 pencil the same thickness but I had to 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.669
 change the color of a pencil and I 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.010
 place a white dot on a white background 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.500
 so it does not show up and I said to 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.360
 able to extend in this classification 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.800
 of color to all the pixels that's 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.169
 to say that he to consider me that the 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.730
 area that is here is an area that is 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.250
 bleached valentin he will extend it to 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.490
 the whole of my white surface and I 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.490
 am ok 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.410
 the result appears fairly quickly 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.360
 I have here percentage values and 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.360
 in square centimeters 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.310
 and on my drawing 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.129
 I'm going to zoom out a little bit 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.339
 chamand drawing 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.560
 the leaves now appear in 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:10.009
 glass 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.300
 measure he tells me that the surface of the 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:17.240
 green object is about 55 centimeters 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.339
 squares to make sure that what is 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.649
 colorful matches the leaves 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:25.539
 I will finally play on transparency 

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:25.539
 Calq here 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.409
 and decreasing by increasing that's 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.009
 transparent I find my leaves and 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.199
 when 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.569
 I fuck this transparency I see the 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.479
 coloring done by measure I see 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.819
 that there is an excellent superposition 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.979
 between the coloring done by the 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:47.979
 software and the sheets that I have in 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.979
 below I can therefore estimate quite 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.960
 plausible the value that our juries even 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.650
 van beek so my leaf area for 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.419
 the mint foot 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.400
 so it was question and on which 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.000
 I had worked and about 55 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.000
 square centimeters
