00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
inhibitor to go down now and TSM is

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.830 
inhibitor to go down now and TSM is
completely<00:03:10.400> controlling<00:03:10.969> this<00:03:11.090> game<00:03:11.180> the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
completely controlling this game the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.209 
completely controlling this game the
thing<00:03:12.169> that<00:03:12.319> has<00:03:12.409> gotten<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:12.919> much<00:03:13.040> better

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.219 
thing that has gotten so much better

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.399 
thing that has gotten so much better
really<00:03:13.639> for<00:03:13.790> all<00:03:13.969> teams<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.569> this<00:03:14.930> split<00:03:15.230> is

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
really for all teams in this split is

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.929 
really for all teams in this split is
their<00:03:15.650> ability<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:16.099> close<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.579> out<00:03:16.669> and<00:03:16.849> move

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
their ability to close it out and move

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.539 
their ability to close it out and move
forward<00:03:17.299> I<00:03:17.799> think<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.889> reason<00:03:19.040> we<00:03:19.250> popped<00:03:19.430> out

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
forward I think the reason we popped out

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.740 
forward I think the reason we popped out
of<00:03:19.609> that<00:03:19.669> replay<00:03:19.969> is<00:03:20.030> because<00:03:20.209> they<00:03:20.329> got<00:03:20.510> that

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
of that replay is because they got that

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.409 
of that replay is because they got that
inhibitor<00:03:21.379> so<00:03:21.650> yep<00:03:22.310> second<00:03:22.819> inhibitor<00:03:23.209> down

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
inhibitor so yep second inhibitor down

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.210 
inhibitor so yep second inhibitor down
easy<00:03:23.989> rush<00:03:24.290> on<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.620> Nexus<00:03:24.889> turrets<00:03:25.129> here

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220
