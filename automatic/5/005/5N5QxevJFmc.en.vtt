 returned 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.990
 need to 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.990
 have my own 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.010
 with 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.900
 sugar past themselves 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.640
 he will come 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.640
 whether 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.640
 immodest 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.000
 named 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.680
 the song intro is played as follows 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:17.220
 We play a chord of em 9 play 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.860
 sixth string 3 2 1 a twang 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.930
 after which we play 3 2 and release 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:30.019
 ring finger and get the first 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.019
 empty all together so it goes 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:38.780
 here here is empty she, too , should sound 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:45.159
 be long after that 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.159
 extract two notes second string and 3 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.290
 pause here again 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:02.409
 after which we start singing brute force on 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:06.090
 couplets and in the first chorus so I 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:09.640
 simplified it because in the original there 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.659
 there are big pauses between which you need 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.199
 drink and this is not for everyone just 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.739
 number and for me in general means brute force 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.519
 so you three two one long 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.130
 sound 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.130
 after which 323 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.800
 so repeat just 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.169
 he gets there to lose in 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.259
 most cases two times on 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.199
 each chord in a couplet and one 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.569
 once on the court in the refrain 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:48.500
 only there are exceptions in 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:52.039
 couplet chords am7 d7 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.789
 there one time for each chord boy 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.490
 songs 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:05:02.919
 from the second verse the next one hit 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:07.889
 top down strong and long lasting 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:12.830
 then a quick upward movement 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.830
 after which 3 movements are sharp on top of 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:20.039
 mainly on the lower side and in 

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:20.039
 closing three up and down 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.450
 for it repeats itself 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.970
 it means playing as well as 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.050
 bust in a couplet chord 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.320
 predominantly 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.910
 and in the chorus once for each 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.390
 chord 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:48.690
 including the last stanza 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:52.250
 case on this hope hope helped you 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.250
 successful parsing and success
