00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.140
 I think you'll tell the government forces towards the game format, but you wish best regards Yes I do 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.820
 I will 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.280
 Please protect me 6 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.340
 I think the official system 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.980
 I have a certainty in the hammer as my own Korean 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.210
 I think I can not bring my heart 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.200
 Come and thought I can not himself be not match 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.660
 Prepare large items and talk 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:33.079
 I also have a big ladder because I withdraw black guy and turn it back 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.829
 That manager 喰 333 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.060
 Let's do it, I'm already a stroller 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:46.470
 I think that source of revenue maybe this is not complete anymore 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:51.300
 The past two times that past until I think it will not be completed 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.610
 Well type is the third time I 'll do it in the tank each other is a god tool 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.840
 I agree 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.610
 It may not open a strange hurdle, or it will be easy to say that the hurdle is raised 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.840
 Also 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.309
 In order to do this I think that it really makes sense to have this match form 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.450
 That's because it was so hard 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.130
 I also have strange memories because it's another format 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.130
 Thank you so much 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.970
 I wonder after Datte that large, et al 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.530
 Let's have 3 made for myself 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.790
 I don't want to use it in vain or really wasting parts 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.800
 After all 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.800
 I have a rudder to say that I will be against Tsukamoto's hammer 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 Enjoy 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.420
 Nde I will in any case of kishōtenketsu the story 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.210
 In the not take the paragraph this game 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 Of course, followed by what you say prima facie prima facie of the paragraph that does not matter at all 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.260
 First of all I want to do this a bit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.580
 Tsukamoto and I am the same 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:03.300
 There is a place where I think too much how to do 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.410
 Well the one that something a little stupid 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:15.380
 Hey also hope Na' good when you are When you become I mean that I hope Once you have become accustomed is that two people 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:18.970
 That's what I hope for now , like experiencing the Doctor Serve world 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:24.040
 Arare-chan and something about it 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:29.079
 I think I was able to show you something like that kind of stupid thing 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.159
 It is not something specific to Hiroshi Motomiya, and it will be concrete if it is raised in the world of the representative tax increase Motomiya city 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.910
 stomach 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.110
 I will say if I can put out something 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.780
 A little in the world because you do not know well Dokutasuranpu 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.810
 Just because I thought become stupid really and do not you, if that is not Hahon 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:50.950
 It sounds too good to be like to doctor Saab study 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:03:00.489
 a Ito player's opponent is a patieir who will meet with ace gw 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:03.170
 In Drake Younger here how real is cured guard A'2008 America 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.280
 Even though I've been doing a single match 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:12.110
 Yeah Kedomo I wanted to do the format of the time that you were originally 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.370
 It is said that it is not sold in Japan by the item which is not understood well and maybe only in the US 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.900
 It by 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.680
 Where you can not do it 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:26.220
 Eemaa was thinking what going to do 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:31.780
 To say that I think we glass is good if was I doing here cola House Hall 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.990
 I would like to do with Drake Younger who gets packed with glass board 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.590
 Already 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.590
 Feces a 4 5 years ago but I bought it at that time 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:48.190
 Of course at that time I do not think that Drake is that time 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.330
 In that respect I think I have some tips 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.330
 I think it will be somehow
