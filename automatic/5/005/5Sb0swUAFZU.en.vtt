come<00:02:26.290> out<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.680> side<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.430> go<00:02:27.489> over<00:02:28.209> here<00:02:28.569> and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
come out this side and go over here and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.090 
come out this side and go over here and
this<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.050> where<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.319> antenna<00:02:29.650> tube<00:02:29.920> is

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
this is where the antenna tube is

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.940 
this is where the antenna tube is
installed<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.840> receiver<00:02:32.290> really<00:02:32.770> does

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
installed so the receiver really does

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.729 
installed so the receiver really does
have<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.250> go<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:34.060> way<00:02:34.569> one<00:02:35.260> small<00:02:35.500> feature

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.560 
and it's all held down with a little
grub<00:04:14.049> screw<00:04:14.500> now<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.250> antenna<00:04:15.760> tube<00:04:16.030> they<00:04:16.269> did

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
grub screw now the antenna tube they did

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.390 
grub screw now the antenna tube they did
include<00:04:16.959> however<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.590> did<00:04:17.830> have<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.130> trim<00:04:18.370> that

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
include however I did have to trim that

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.070 
include however I did have to trim that
but<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.880> was<00:04:19.000> really<00:04:19.299> easy<00:04:19.330> because<00:04:19.780> all<00:04:20.049> I

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
but that was really easy because all I

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
but that was really easy because all I
had<00:04:20.289> to<00:04:20.380> do<00:04:20.530> was<00:04:20.859> use<00:04:21.070> scissors

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
had to do was use scissors

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.880 
had to do was use scissors
they<00:04:22.280> also<00:04:22.520> include<00:04:23.120> this<00:04:23.510> binding<00:04:23.960> plug<00:04:24.260> now

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
they also include this binding plug now

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.980 
they also include this binding plug now
thankfully<00:04:25.370> they<00:04:25.970> already<00:04:26.300> bound<00:04:26.660> this

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
thankfully they already bound this

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.110 
thankfully they already bound this
receiver<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.830> remote<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.220> have<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.000> don't

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
receiver to the remote I have so I don't

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.090 
receiver to the remote I have so I don't
have<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.480> deal<00:04:29.630> with<00:04:29.810> any<00:04:29.990> of<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.200> but<00:04:30.590> if<00:04:31.010> I

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
have to deal with any of that but if I

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.950 
have to deal with any of that but if I
get<00:04:31.160> any<00:04:31.460> receivers<00:04:31.970> in<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.210> future<00:04:32.660> I'm

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
get any receivers in the future I'm

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.290 
get any receivers in the future I'm
gonna<00:04:33.080> have<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.410> use<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:33.860> they<00:04:34.430> also<00:04:34.670> include

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
gonna have to use this they also include

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
this little peg this peg is used on the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.480 
this little peg this peg is used on the
receiver<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.560> help<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:39.860> customize<00:04:40.130> the

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
receiver to help you customize the

receiver to help you customize the
failsafe<00:04:40.970> but<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:41.930> don't<00:04:42.200> have<00:04:42.290> to<00:04:42.440> worry<00:04:42.590> about

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
failsafe but I don't have to worry about

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.760 
failsafe but I don't have to worry about
that<00:04:43.010> right<00:04:43.280> now<00:04:43.340> or<00:04:43.760> at<00:04:43.970> least<00:04:44.180> yet<00:04:44.660> now<00:04:45.320> is

I<00:04:48.410> went<00:04:48.860> ahead<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:49.130> charged<00:04:49.580> up<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.880> remote

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
I went ahead and charged up the remote

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.300 
I went ahead and charged up the remote

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
and I plugged in a battery into the ESC

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.080 
and I plugged in a battery into the ESC
I'm<00:05:04.880> gonna<00:05:05.480> push<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.200> hold<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:07.010> ESC<00:05:07.520> until

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
I'm gonna push and hold the ESC until

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.270 
I'm gonna push and hold the ESC until
the<00:05:08.390> light<00:05:08.570> turns<00:05:08.810> red<00:05:11.770> once<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:12.920> turns<00:05:13.100> red

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
awesome and now for the throttle and for

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.490 
awesome and now for the throttle and for
the<00:05:37.580> first<00:05:37.850> time<00:05:38.150> since<00:05:38.510> I've<00:05:38.720> had<00:05:38.870> this<00:05:39.020> RC

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
the first time since I've had this RC

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.920 
the first time since I've had this RC
this<00:05:40.310> thing<00:05:40.610> is<00:05:40.880> running<00:05:41.360> under<00:05:41.570> its<00:05:41.810> own

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
this thing is running under its own

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.650 
this thing is running under its own
power<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:43.540> finally<00:05:44.540> this<00:05:45.380> upgrade<00:05:46.190> is<00:05:46.660> almost

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
power and finally this upgrade is almost

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.140 
power and finally this upgrade is almost
done<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.410> last<00:05:48.650> thing<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.190> do<00:05:49.340> is<00:05:49.400> go<00:05:50.000> ahead

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
done the last thing to do is go ahead

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.920 
done the last thing to do is go ahead
and<00:05:50.660> program<00:05:51.050> a<00:05:51.650> name<00:05:51.980> into<00:05:52.550> this<00:05:52.730> that<00:05:53.660> might

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
and program a name into this that might

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.430 
and program a name into this that might
not<00:05:54.140> be<00:05:54.170> like<00:05:54.890> a<00:05:55.130> huge<00:05:55.490> thing<00:05:55.550> or<00:05:56.290> something<00:05:57.290> to

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
not be like a huge thing or something to

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.740 
not be like a huge thing or something to
include<00:05:57.860> with<00:05:58.460> this<00:05:58.700> whole<00:05:58.880> upgrade<00:05:59.360> but

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750
