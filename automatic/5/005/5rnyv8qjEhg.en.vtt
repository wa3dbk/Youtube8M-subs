00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.280
 sat in a hotel room somewhere in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.410
 Cologne 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.049
 It was already late and actually wanted 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.110
 We do not spend the night either 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:22.770
 we only wanted to be alone once 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.550
 just gone the whole day we sat in 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.649
 save this room 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.919
 It was nice my best friend times 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.780
 to be alone again 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.870
 sometimes I wish we would 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.519
 spend much more time together without 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.730
 my thoughts were somehow different 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.460
 but soon from charles deeper 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.359
 schÃ¶nach voice interrupted 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 Do not you think we should be slow 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:56.969
 back home so we left that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.819
 room and went straight to one 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.440
 elevator too 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:04.250
 Finally, the door closed and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.720
 The elevator started to move 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.980
 I always had a very queasy 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.820
 Feeling the lift is on the other hand 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.820
 it did not seem to matter 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.190
 Suddenly the elevator stops 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.860
 first moment I thought that we already 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.500
 arrived in the lobby would be there 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.020
 I had heard myself on the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.110
 display board you could see that they 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.750
 We were only on the second floor 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.970
 I started to shake the light fell 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.470
 it was dark so dark you could see 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.130
 not even recognize his own hand 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.870
 could 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.000
 if she was right in front of you a dumpling 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.260
 in the throat 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 I was terrified of that 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.270
 darkness where's the worst for 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.270
 me 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.240
 However, I did not want to share that 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.570
 noticed a lot of fear you really had 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.910
 I tried to calm down 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.490
 I leaned against the wall as if ran 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.300
 a shiver down the back 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.280
 I felt so fragile that 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.910
 sobbing dreams out of my mouth 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.730
 I could not hold it back like so 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:30.140
 they are slowly crying over a cheek 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:34.280
 I wanted to say something 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.709
 but I could not when I did it again 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.940
 wanted to try lay down suddenly 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.940
 two strong arms 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.590
 I let myself fall into his arms 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.590
 and suddenly I felt safe 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.160
 He tried to calm me down by asking 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.130
 started to cut my back 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.420
 my fear was for my despair 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.890
 I would never blunder because of me 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.430
 my fears would say anything he would 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.010
 never laugh at me 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.250
 He left everything and lie around me 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.010
 to comfort me when I was feeling sick 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.590
 I was able to confide everything to him further 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.160
 everything for me 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.830
 In short he is the best of the best 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.690
 friend you could wish for and 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.690
 I was damned glad to have him
