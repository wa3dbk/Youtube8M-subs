00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 I will now you something about the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.339
 negotiation opportunities with a few special 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.020
 in my opinion the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.470
 Preaching opportunities at parship really 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.750
 very well 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.340
 there are many possibilities you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.809
 contact with the future with your 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.080
 can accommodate future partners 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.400
 or of course these are also with you 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.220
 First, I have to say everything 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.350
 you see, are premium features I have 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.699
 a premium account and that is 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.580
 Of course the contact is much 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.070
 easier because he could still be active 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.210
 Write to other members here 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.949
 you see, I have to go here 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 get eight new messages, for example 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.430
 without me at all anything 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.620
 parship has also done a profile 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.719
 fill out and upload a picture 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 I think that's quite remarkable 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.950
 you see that to me parship due 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.890
 a personality profile which 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.140
 had filled filled 53 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.489
 partner suggestions shows we look 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.969
 First of all, the new news 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.360
 on 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.280
 you click on it and then you would be 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.750
 a letter at parship as at 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.809
 many other partners 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.730
 Recruitment agencies mostly only looks 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.729
 the profession is the name and in the case 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.950
 ps and titan behind it a pseudonym 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.930
 so you are not the poor right away or 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 you look at a field a pretty stupid 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.100
 stuff and then have to think it out for yourself 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.960
 Of course you can be rough with that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.680
 assess as before I have one here 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.470
 Business Administration 35 There are several 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.909
 news contact 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.009
 here is the example of a smile 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.900
 for you with a message only one 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 smile for you just a smile for you 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.020
 I can say that I would 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.540
 always a personal message 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.400
 can write my one with buy 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.869
 if you yourself message a smile 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.610
 or send a fun question 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.110
 Personally, I do not think so 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.340
 good because that shows for me that one 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.470
 not necessarily with the opposite 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.070
 has dealt with and for example 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.750
 I just click once on it a smile 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.579
 that's great for me, that's what it says to me now 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.439
 nothing has to go first 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.600
 and look at myself who is that? 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.939
 wm-final message of course personally 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.369
 Dirty the profiles before exactly 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.750
 then you know has been rude to do 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.790
 have and then you can already 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.409
 ask a few personal questions or 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.329
 Maybe it's a great hobby 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.950
 what then or that have already 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.989
 be on a much better one 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.610
 Conversation base as too harmless smile too 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.750
 look here either 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.210
 receive a message 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.860
 for example, I have stated as fun 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.480
 that all people do yoga and yoga 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.670
 because you do not need single exchanges anymore 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.790
 one can be equal to two gb know all 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.380
 Since the lady has received that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.300
 I can not surpass her with me 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.010
 this sport is just something 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.510

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.550
 funny story because I do not synonymous

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.030

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.300
 I personally think so 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.130

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.650

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.760
 hanger to be able to start conversation 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.300

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.830

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.750
 that's probably me personally always 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.890

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.110

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.540
 bit about it 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.780
 who she is and not about her 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.040
