00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.920
 [Music] 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.180
 [Applause] 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.359
 [Music] 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.359
 [Applause] 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.830
 very good 7 hajrovic we are in the part 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.660
 5 of our zombie guide that 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.450
 dismantle the shield as long as the 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.130
 title the shield is very simple only 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.390
 It has two pieces but it takes advantage of 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.000
 as well 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.250
 to show you a trick as you have 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.720
 seen just catch this piece here that 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.820
 sometimes you can go out in this area 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.010
 from the cafeteria after going here 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.090
 behind you can be where you have seen 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.079
 this piece is very big it does not have 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.880
 find it 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.040
 OK 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.830
 now we have to open here I stayed 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.830
 no points but good and we put it 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 then we lack the door to leave 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.570
 here in the car in case you do not know the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.220
 car leaves here are the two sites that 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.850
 I know that I have seen it I found it 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.850
 we put 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.840
 we take it by picking it up as you see it clears 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.080
 the turbine because we can take that 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.720
 an object 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.200
 then the trick to see if more Aryan the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.200
 ticket office 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:29.119
 if he was lucky they pay him soon 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.119
 finish to see if the box office came out and 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.800
 that as you saw the bus no 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.360
 forever 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.360
 and how he changed it 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.240
 those on the bus do not always come out not always 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.790
 it comes out the same, it always varies, I come 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.399
 here to see if there is luck later in the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.430
 trick if you would not have to cut up 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.899
 get the mexican piece came out good 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.770
 I'm going to cut the ball if each piece 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.770
 I teach you the trick 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.790
 I've been lucky and more came out pretty 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.200
 easy to finish the game has 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.510
 He started another more out nothing 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.430
 so then we come inside 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.110
 of the cafeteria you already know in the second 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.910
 stop 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.030
 we put here 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.860
 and it helps me to teach it to others 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.840
 from this video what was in the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.630
 title that are the galvanized knuckles 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.550
 the electric fists as you want to call 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.330
 those that go super super good because 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.600
 until the 14th round they kill me in one fell swoop 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.100
 it's worth the trick we put the shield like that 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.750
 that as you have just seen it does not have 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.720
 mystery we turn our backs on the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.030
 hole we put the shield high that 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.410
 wait for a zombie to come and good to 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.770
 me while it helps me explain what 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.560
 that the knuckles as I say until 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.130
 round 14 killing a super van hit 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.980
 super well what from 14 already 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.050
 it's two hits per zombie yet it's going very 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.640
 very well because you already know those of 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.160
 the fog you have to give him 5 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.660
 slashes at these with only him 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.550
 demos 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.530
 although only two punches with the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.420
 knuckles we have more to climb if it is that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.700
 you are already seeing here the trick of 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.220
 shield are blocked those that 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 they go up here they can not is not a 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.420
 trick wonder but good is a 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.360
 trick that this you wanted to teach 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.670
 As you can see, we put shield only 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.819
 attack up here if we ran out 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.099
 much as you see they give us and yes 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.469
 if they come on top yes they could 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.090
 break the shield but now that the round 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.590
 2 will not come but I say as you see 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.790
 here they get stuck they can climb 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.769
 everyone who wants to here that is 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.389
 chaos will be left behind but those of 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.780
 above yes they can break the 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:43.840
 shield or what 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.310
 well also this video I'm going to 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.010
 leave here because you have already seen how 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.770
 the shield is mounted as if in the part 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.810
 from above as in trujillo 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.810
 shield decided where the worlds are 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:12.370
 [Music] 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.370
 no no no
