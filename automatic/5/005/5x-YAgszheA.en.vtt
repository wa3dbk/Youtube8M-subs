this<00:00:29.300> year<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.810> kind<00:00:29.990> of<00:00:30.080> objective<00:00:30.230> right

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
this year the kind of objective right

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.589 
this year the kind of objective right
from<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:30.919> beginning<00:00:31.009> was<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:31.460> actually<00:00:31.820> match

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
from the beginning was to actually match

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.720 
from the beginning was to actually match
what<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:32.989> have<00:00:33.140> in<00:00:33.260> real<00:00:33.410> life<00:00:33.590> if<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:34.460> want

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
what you have in real life if you want

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.760 
what you have in real life if you want
that<00:00:34.850> formula<00:00:35.120> one<00:00:35.390> experience<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.470> stuff

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
that formula one experience the stuff

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.710 
that formula one experience the stuff
we've<00:00:36.920> been<00:00:36.949> doing<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.309> 2012<00:00:38.090> has<00:00:38.270> moved<00:00:38.570> that

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
we've been doing the 2012 has moved that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.560 
we've been doing the 2012 has moved that
on<00:00:38.899> a<00:00:39.110> whole<00:00:39.320> new<00:00:39.500> generation<00:00:39.680> now<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:44.420> whole

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
on a whole new generation now the whole

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.329 
on a whole new generation now the whole
weather<00:00:44.809> scenario<00:00:45.379> system<00:00:45.769> has<00:00:45.920> really<00:00:46.190> been

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
weather scenario system has really been

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.100 
weather scenario system has really been
refined<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:46.879> year<00:00:47.089> so<00:00:47.420> you'll<00:00:47.780> get<00:00:47.930> where

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
refined this year so you'll get where

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.509 
refined this year so you'll get where
the<00:00:48.199> friends<00:00:48.500> come<00:00:48.710> in<00:00:48.829> now<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:49.250> could<00:00:49.400> be

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
the friends come in now and it could be

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.399 
the friends come in now and it could be
raining<00:00:49.670> at<00:00:49.970> once<00:00:50.300> section<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.960> track<00:00:51.170> but

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
raining at once section of the track but

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.049 
raining at once section of the track but
dry<00:00:51.620> on<00:00:51.769> another<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:52.430> get<00:00:52.610> those<00:00:52.790> real

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
dry on another so you get those real

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.700 
dry on another so you get those real
moments<00:00:53.540> where<00:00:53.720> you're<00:00:54.199> not<00:00:54.320> sure<00:00:54.589> which

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
moments where you're not sure which

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.770 
moments where you're not sure which
tires<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.250> be<00:00:55.370> on<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:56.089> really<00:00:56.300> mixes<00:00:56.659> up

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
tires to be on so that really mixes up

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.420 
tires to be on so that really mixes up
the<00:00:56.809> racing<00:00:57.260> quite<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.500> lot<00:00:57.739> they'll<00:00:58.070> having<00:00:58.309> to

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
the racing quite a lot they'll having to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.649 
the racing quite a lot they'll having to
wear<00:00:58.610> up<00:00:58.699> your<00:00:58.879> mind<00:00:59.089> should<00:00:59.210> I<00:00:59.299> switch<00:00:59.510> the

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
wear up your mind should I switch the

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.929 
wear up your mind should I switch the
interns<00:01:00.019> or<00:01:00.229> wet<00:01:00.500> sore<00:01:00.769> dryers<00:01:01.070> it's<00:01:01.729> really

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:01.939 
interns or wet sore dryers it's really

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.420 
interns or wet sore dryers it's really
unpredictable<00:01:02.390> now<00:01:02.869> it's<00:01:03.769> really<00:01:04.010> matching

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
unpredictable now it's really matching

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.580 
unpredictable now it's really matching
what<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.729> people<00:01:05.030> are<00:01:05.239> seeing<00:01:05.390> on<00:01:05.570> TV

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.600 

significant<00:01:09.590> work<00:01:09.740> has<00:01:09.890> gone<00:01:09.920> into<00:01:10.070> the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
significant work has gone into the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.340 
significant work has gone into the
physics<00:01:11.090> model<00:01:11.420> particularly<00:01:12.140> the

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
physics model particularly the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.039 
physics model particularly the
suspension<00:01:12.950> which<00:01:13.369> has<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.549> real<00:01:13.880> kind<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.240> sea

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
suspension which has a real kind of sea

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
change on the feel of the car you can

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.899 
change on the feel of the car you can
really<00:01:17.299> attack<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:17.930> track<00:01:18.340> many<00:01:19.340> people<00:01:19.729> will

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
really attack the track many people will

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.390 
really attack the track many people will
watch<00:01:20.119> fastest<00:01:20.570> laps<00:01:20.840> or<00:01:21.110> pole<00:01:21.380> laps<00:01:21.650> on<00:01:21.920> TV<00:01:22.369> a

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
watch fastest laps or pole laps on TV a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.310 
watch fastest laps or pole laps on TV a
weekend<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.630> can<00:01:23.780> really<00:01:24.020> get<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.290> sense

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
weekend now you can really get the sense

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.469 
weekend now you can really get the sense
of<00:01:24.590> doing<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:24.890> same<00:01:25.070> things<00:01:25.369> as<00:01:25.549> drivers<00:01:26.240> it's

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
of doing the same things as drivers it's

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.210 
of doing the same things as drivers it's
just<00:01:26.689> those<00:01:26.810> extra<00:01:27.439> elements<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.009> make<00:01:28.130> you

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
just those extra elements and make you

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.580 
just those extra elements and make you
fill<00:01:28.400> up<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.610> real<00:01:28.790> formula<00:01:29.150> one<00:01:29.299> driver<00:01:32.590> we've

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
fill up a real formula one driver we've

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.740 
fill up a real formula one driver we've
got<00:01:33.740> some<00:01:33.890> really<00:01:34.040> cool<00:01:34.310> engine<00:01:34.790> audio<00:01:35.030> what's

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
got some really cool engine audio what's

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.780 
got some really cool engine audio what's
to<00:01:35.900> drive<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.380> car<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.340> other<00:01:37.430> cars<00:01:37.730> were

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
to drive in the car the other cars were

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.100 
to drive in the car the other cars were
out<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.120> circuit<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.630> particularly<00:01:38.990> on<00:01:39.080> the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
out in circuit and particularly on the

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.510 
out in circuit and particularly on the
pacifiers<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:39.830> those<00:01:39.950> are<00:01:40.100> just<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:40.370> much

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
pacifiers and those are just so much

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.120 
pacifiers and those are just so much
more<00:01:40.580> realistic<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:41.500> think<00:01:42.500> players<00:01:42.890> who

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
more realistic I think players who

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.280 
more realistic I think players who
played<00:01:43.400> f1<00:01:43.700> 2010<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.240> f1<00:01:44.479> 2011<00:01:45.020> are<00:01:45.110> really

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
played f1 2010 and f1 2011 are really

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.540 
played f1 2010 and f1 2011 are really
going<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:45.500> see<00:01:45.620> a<00:01:45.650> big<00:01:45.830> uplift<00:01:46.100> in<00:01:46.190> that<00:01:46.310> Ariel

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
going to see a big uplift in that Ariel

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.240 
going to see a big uplift in that Ariel
issue

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.800 

we've<00:01:50.910> had<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> bit<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.390> change<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.780> direction

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
we've had a bit of a change in direction

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.160 
we've had a bit of a change in direction
for<00:01:52.170> 2012<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.550> 10<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.180> 11<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.690> player<00:01:54.930> had

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
for 2012 and 10 and 11 the player had

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.930 
for 2012 and 10 and 11 the player had
the<00:01:55.410> main<00:01:55.590> user<00:01:55.800> interface<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.550> main<00:01:56.730> menu

sitting<00:01:57.720> inside<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.080> paddock<00:01:58.410> whether<00:01:58.650> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
sitting inside the paddock whether you

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.920 
sitting inside the paddock whether you
have<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.010> interviews<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.000> 2012<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
have the interviews but for 2012 and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.780 
have the interviews but for 2012 and
wanted<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> try<00:02:01.380> something<00:02:01.590> different<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.640> now

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
wanted to try something different so now

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.790 
wanted to try something different so now
it's<00:02:02.970> about<00:02:03.090> projecting<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:04.170> passion<00:02:04.650> and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
it's about projecting the passion and

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's about projecting the passion and
the<00:02:04.890> technicality<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> forming<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.420> make

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the technicality of forming on to make

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.090 
the technicality of forming on to make
it<00:02:06.690> really<00:02:06.840> look<00:02:07.020> cool<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.470> also<00:02:07.710> ease

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
it really look cool and also ease
