00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.439
 good morning good afternoon good night 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.990
 in the center growing to be welcome 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:12.090
 to this tutorial 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:19.540
 so a story about the program 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 but several questions have arisen in 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.080
 another video 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.820
 the first is hey asks you to idea then and 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.430
 I can not open the application that I do 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.430
 good when right now 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.120
 however when you 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.769
 synchronized those applications 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:13.909
 with red letters in this window 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.470
 you will appear here here just a 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.970
 blue button right now is in crisis because 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.540
 I do not have anything connected but a button 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:31.630
 and we are more or less and I will be able to 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.630
 open applications and 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.880
 updates 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.869
 here is a number 2 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.630
 it means that there are already two applications 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.060
 that have an update we're going to 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.430
 direct to this tab where they are two and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.649
 let's find what is the application that 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:57.380
 is the one that is going to update timid here 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:00.409
 there are three colors orange green blue 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.110
 well those colors depend on these 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.010
 three icons here 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.710
 if it is not here is a p as the p of 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.380
 here an apple held in hand 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.810
 like here and here an apple nothing 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.780
 more like the one from here good and which of 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.220
 these three I will give fire as headquarters 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.550
 where you download two application times 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.610
 before the red letters that there are and where 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.570
 they are going to click here on that similar icon 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.280
 maybe you are going to click and 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.580
 they will automatically see here a 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.610
 download a one and it will download the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.620
 upgrade 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.750
 then for all positions 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.810
 here I have another update for the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.960
 movie comics and in the same way 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.940
 it usually happens that only 15 logical 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.940
 activated this means waiting 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.410
 a little more until here and 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.410
 until the baby 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.260
 is here 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.100
 now the other question that installs us 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.200
 An iphone 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.480
 obviously he has to look 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.370
 applications that are according to the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.890
 version of your system here 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:56.110
 so the version from the version 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:56.110
 this is the version and here it is 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.560
 from 5 and so look very well at the 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.050
 version that supports 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.050
 and you can put more 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.910
 that you
