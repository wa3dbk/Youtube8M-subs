00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this stack down here and to choose a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.780 
this stack down here and to choose a
number<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.969> cards<00:00:33.360> i<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.960> put<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.309> i

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
number of cards i will put here and i

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.700 
number of cards i will put here and i
will<00:00:35.940> throw<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.450> dice<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.300> rule

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
will throw a dice and the first rule

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.760

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
says to me I'll show me how much dice I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.569 
says to me I'll show me how much dice I
will<00:00:44.010> take<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:45.059> aggravate<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.829> number<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
will take to aggravate the number of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.569 
will take to aggravate the number of
cards<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.660> take<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:50.100> ice<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
cards I will take so first ice from the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.380 
cards I will take so first ice from the
first<00:00:50.910> dies<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.949> it's<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.160> four<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> take

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
first dies and it's a four so I take

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.660 
first dies and it's a four so I take
four<00:00:57.390> dice<00:00:57.600> yes<00:00:59.629> put<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:05.070> sum<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
four dice yes put it and the sum of the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.030 
four dice yes put it and the sum of the
digit<00:01:06.320> will<00:01:07.430> be<00:01:08.430> our<00:01:09.090> number<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> cards<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.560> put

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
digit will be our number of cards i put

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.730 
digit will be our number of cards i put
here<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> we've<00:01:14.130> got<00:01:15.380> six<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.860> five<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.880> 11<00:01:18.740> 11

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
here so we've got six and five is 11 11

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.560 
here so we've got six and five is 11 11
and<00:01:19.890> 2<00:01:20.189> 13<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.229> certain<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.380> honest<00:01:22.759> 14<00:01:23.759> so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and 2 13 and certain and honest 14 so

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:39.969 
and 2 13 and certain and honest 14 so
would<00:01:25.439> take<00:01:25.759> 14<00:01:26.759> cards<00:01:28.820> 1<00:01:29.930> 2<00:01:30.930> 3<00:01:32.659> 4<00:01:33.740> 5<00:01:34.909> 6<00:01:35.909> 7<00:01:36.290> 8<00:01:37.490> 9<00:01:38.720> 10

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
would take 14 cards 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:50.060 
would take 14 cards 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11<00:01:42.049> 12<00:01:43.189> 13<00:01:45.049> 14<00:01:46.490> cards<00:01:47.570> this<00:01:48.570> card<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.680> put<00:01:49.920> away

right right left right left right ok and
now<00:02:18.600> something<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.930> say<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.710> value<00:02:23.710> of<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
now something to say to the value of the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:33.660 
now something to say to the value of the
cards<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:29.190> jack<00:02:30.190> counts<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:32.670> Queen

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
cards and the jack counts to the Queen

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.760 
cards and the jack counts to the Queen
count<00:02:34.390> three<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:36.130> King<00:02:37.110> counts<00:02:38.110> for<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
count three the King counts for and the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.430 
count three the King counts for and the
cards<00:02:42.190> with<00:02:42.370> analyst<00:02:42.930> counts<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.050> number<00:02:44.080> of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
cards with analyst counts the number of

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:54.449 
cards with analyst counts the number of
itself<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:47.010> today's<00:02:48.959> counts<00:02:51.150> 11s<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:54.280> is

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
itself and today's counts 11s this is

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.970 
itself and today's counts 11s this is
the<00:02:54.610> value<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.330> cards<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:58.440> now<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.500> flip

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
the value of the cards and now I flip

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.190 
the value of the cards and now I flip
over<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.400> cards<00:03:01.030> on<00:03:01.209> top<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:04.000> we're<00:03:04.360> c8<00:03:04.870> and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
over the cards on top so we're c8 and

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.610 
over the cards on top so we're c8 and
here's<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.380> nine<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.690> number<00:03:11.020> of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
here's a nine and this is number of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.470 
here's a nine and this is number of
itself<00:03:12.070> so<00:03:12.489> we<00:03:12.670> count<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.440> some<00:03:14.440> nine<00:03:15.070> and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
itself so we count and some nine and

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.550 
itself so we count and some nine and
eight<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.080> sum<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.530> 9<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:17.920> 8<00:03:18.160> 17<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.560> now

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
eight and the sum of 9 and 8 17 and now

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.420 
eight and the sum of 9 and 8 17 and now
we<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.640> count<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:23.290> number<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.160> cards

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
we can you count this number of cards

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:41.270 
we can you count this number of cards
first<00:03:25.739> random<00:03:27.900> stack<00:03:29.790> 1<00:03:31.019> 2<00:03:32.019> 3<00:03:33.510> 4<00:03:34.739> 5<00:03:35.970> 6<00:03:36.970> 7<00:03:37.440> 8<00:03:38.880> 9<00:03:40.110> 10

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 okay okay and now

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.280 
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 okay okay and now
you<00:03:58.300> could<00:03:58.720> say

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
you could say

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.970 
you could say
now<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.890> first<00:04:01.129> choice<00:04:01.459> was<00:04:01.790> not<00:04:02.560> random<00:04:04.510> so

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
now the first choice was not random so

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.740 
now the first choice was not random so
we<00:04:06.980> do<00:04:07.189> the<00:04:07.790> first<00:04:08.090> choice<00:04:08.829> with<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:10.010> same

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
we do the first choice with the same

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.009 
we do the first choice with the same
procedure<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:12.560> via<00:04:12.799> stronger<00:04:13.219> dice<00:04:13.459> and

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
procedure that via stronger dice and

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.080 
procedure that via stronger dice and
then<00:04:15.019> we<00:04:15.349> have<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:16.370> name<00:04:16.579> of<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.759> dice<00:04:17.060> you

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
then we have the name of the dice you

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.830 
then we have the name of the dice you
