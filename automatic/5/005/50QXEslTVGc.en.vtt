00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.920
 Las Meninas is probably the most 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 Vel치zquez's famous and one on which 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 more has been written 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.970
 in principle the protagonist of the picture 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.920
 could be the little princess because 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.650
 the illumination mode receives the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.140
 more obvious attention however is 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.510
 only appearance by the meninas is something 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.370
 more than a simple portrait is a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.790
 brilliant defense of the nobility of the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.070
 painting 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.380
 in the background we can see the image of the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.600
 kings reflected in a mirror and in the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.270
 left to the Vel치zquez himself who has 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.700
 included in the scene next to him a 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.110
 disturbing and enigmatic element a 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.400
 canvas turned on its back 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.770
 deliberately by the painter 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.050
 is painting Vel치zquez 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.580
 in the opinion of some it is a question of 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.190
 portrait of the kings that would look 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.260
 reflected in the mirror other authors 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.360
 they defend that in reality the mirror 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.850
 reflects the monarchs themselves that as 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.630
 everyone accepts just arrived and 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.880
 it's the people who look at the characters 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.539
 the presence of fourth felipe is what 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.670
 really important then with your visit 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.820
 ennobles the artist and with him his work 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.119
 that is, painting is an art worthy of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.159
 the attention of the king besides vel치zquez not 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.770
 is in the attitude of painting but in the 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.049
 think that you are going to paint with this suggests 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.020
 that painting is not something handmade but 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.149
 that requires intellectual activity 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.700
 in these same years he paints the 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.890
 spinners also coinciding with the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.299
 time in which you will undertake the process 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 to be admitted in the order of 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.979
 Santiago 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.960
 It is a work painted almost in size 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.409
 natural and with an absolutely technique 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.659
 innovator had a great influence on the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.549
 painting later something easily 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.299
 perceptible in the family of Carlos
