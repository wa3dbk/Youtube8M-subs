00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.520 
cut nice so I'm just gonna take our
chicken<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.299> we've<00:01:48.600> already<00:01:48.840> rinsed<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
chicken now we've already rinsed this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.139 
chicken now we've already rinsed this
chicken<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.979> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.429> a<00:01:53.579> somewhat

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
chicken and that is kind of a somewhat

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.770 
chicken and that is kind of a somewhat
of<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.360> controversial<00:01:55.610> area<00:01:56.610> when<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> talk

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
of a controversial area when you talk

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.399 
of a controversial area when you talk
about<00:01:57.810> rinsing<00:01:58.560> chicken<00:01:59.399> prior<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.409> actually

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
about rinsing chicken prior to actually

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.219 
about rinsing chicken prior to actually
preparing<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:03.000> believe<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
preparing it and I believe that that it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.770 
preparing it and I believe that that it
is<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> popular<00:02:05.219> term<00:02:05.459> from<00:02:05.819> older<00:02:06.240> cookbooks

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
is a popular term from older cookbooks

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.080 
is a popular term from older cookbooks
before<00:02:07.709> we<00:02:08.310> got<00:02:08.459> into<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> spread<00:02:09.060> of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
before we got into the spread of

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.720 
before we got into the spread of
bacteria<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.200> how<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:10.769> splashing<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
bacteria and how actually splashing the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.220 
bacteria and how actually splashing the
water<00:02:11.760> around<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.390> sink<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:13.049> to<00:02:13.110> get

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
water around the sink is going to get

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.350 
water around the sink is going to get
that<00:02:13.349> bacteria<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.069> more<00:02:14.280> places<00:02:14.430> than<00:02:15.330> just

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
that bacteria in more places than just

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.750 
that bacteria in more places than just
keeping<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.230> consolidated<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> chicken

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
keeping it consolidated on the chicken

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.759 
keeping it consolidated on the chicken
so<00:02:18.239> from<00:02:18.750> if<00:02:18.900> you're<00:02:19.019> from<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.200> old<00:02:19.319> school

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
so from if you're from the old school

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.350 
so from if you're from the old school
you<00:02:19.980> may<00:02:20.099> want<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.370> wash<00:02:20.549> it<00:02:20.579> and<00:02:20.910> Pat<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.090> dry

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
you may want to wash it and Pat it dry

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.220 
you may want to wash it and Pat it dry
if<00:02:21.750> you're<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.459> go<00:02:23.579> straight<00:02:23.910> from

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
if you're not you can go straight from

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.530 
if you're not you can go straight from
packaging<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:26.130> cooking<00:02:26.549> so<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.880> make<00:02:27.329> that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
packaging to to cooking so you make that

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.350 
packaging to to cooking so you make that
choice<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.140> believe<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:30.030> you'll<00:02:30.209> be

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
choice but I believe that that you'll be

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.420 
choice but I believe that that you'll be
safe<00:02:30.660> if<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> go<00:02:31.049> from<00:02:31.200> packaged<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.069> cooking

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
safe if you go from packaged to cooking

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.339 
safe if you go from packaged to cooking
now<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.000> start<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.540> we're<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.079> to
