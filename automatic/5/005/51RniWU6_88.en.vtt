NASA system here is and as you can see I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.840 
NASA system here is and as you can see I
played<00:00:17.039> all<00:00:17.490> four<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.449> em<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.369> two<00:00:20.670> and

only<00:00:45.120> two<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:48.000> motor<00:00:48.210> starts<00:00:49.730> as<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.880> can

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
only two of the motor starts as you can

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.470 
only two of the motor starts as you can
see<00:00:51.380> already<00:00:52.380> those<00:00:52.800> two<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:53.880> step

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
see already those two and this one step

and nothing happens with them and they
are<00:00:58.740> on<00:00:59.040> channel<00:00:59.700> on<00:00:59.970> m1<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> m2<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> let

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
are on channel on m1 and m2 and so let

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.250 
are on channel on m1 and m2 and so let
me<00:01:04.409> stop<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:08.690> now<00:01:09.690> do<00:01:09.750> something

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
me stop it here now do something

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:21.710 
me stop it here now do something
different<00:01:12.560> let<00:01:13.560> me<00:01:15.770> switch<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.880> speed

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
different let me switch the speed

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:33.399 
different let me switch the speed
controls<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.409> m1<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.250> m2<00:01:26.300> to<00:01:27.300> m5<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.440> m6<00:01:30.500> and

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
controls on m1 and m2 to m5 and m6 and

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.219 
controls on m1 and m2 to m5 and m6 and
what<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:38.870> I'll<00:01:39.870> be<00:01:40.200> able

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
what this will do is that I'll be able

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
what this will do is that I'll be able
to<00:01:40.890> use<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:42.290> i<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:44.040> i<00:01:44.430> was<00:01:45.320> on<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.520> exists<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to use it as i as i was on a exists and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.820 
to use it as i as i was on a exists and
now<00:01:48.000> i'm<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.420> using<00:01:48.900> channel<00:01:49.409> 1<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.590> channel

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
now i'm not using channel 1 and channel

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.149 
now i'm not using channel 1 and channel
2<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:51.119> i'm<00:01:51.299> using<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:51.960> them<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.070> other

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
2 and i'm using all them all the other

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.380 
2 and i'm using all them all the other
ones<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:54.270> three<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.140> six<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.180> here's<00:01:57.180> what

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
ones from three to six and here's what

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:09.270 
ones from three to six and here's what
happens<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:58.140> let<00:01:58.440> me<00:01:58.650> power<00:01:58.950> it

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.770 

and<00:02:10.280> now<00:02:11.060> I'm<00:02:11.690> also<00:02:12.080> turn<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.569> computer

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and now I'm also turn it to the computer

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.170 
and now I'm also turn it to the computer
so<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> can<00:02:18.290> switch<00:02:18.890> from<00:02:20.349> quadcopter<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:22.180> an

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
so I can switch from quadcopter to an

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.690 
so I can switch from quadcopter to an
exit<00:02:23.690> copter<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.269> go<00:02:26.510> i<00:02:26.780> plug<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.440> in

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
exit copter and here you go i plug it in

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.690 
exit copter and here you go i plug it in
as<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.910> can<00:02:28.970> see<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:29.750> over<00:02:30.049> here<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.549> if<00:02:31.549> i

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
as you can see it's over here and if i

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.500 
as you can see it's over here and if i
switch<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.180> any<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.319> these<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.310> i<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.730> use<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
switch to any of these so i can use the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.500 
switch to any of these so i can use the
other<00:02:35.810> two<00:02:36.200> motors<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.910> what<00:02:38.060> happens

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
other two motors this is what happens

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.140 
other two motors this is what happens
i'm<00:02:39.019> going<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.380> write<00:02:40.120> then<00:02:41.120> i<00:02:41.599> plug<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.349> off

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
i'm going to write then i plug it off

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.339 
i'm going to write then i plug it off
from<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.299> computer<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.700> let<00:02:46.700> me<00:02:46.910> start<00:02:47.349> the

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
from the computer and let me start the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:58.539 
from the computer and let me start the
speed<00:02:48.620> controls<00:02:49.130> now<00:02:56.260> co4<00:02:57.260> powered<00:02:57.620> up<00:02:57.950> let's

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
speed controls now co4 powered up let's

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:11.759 
speed controls now co4 powered up let's
see<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:07.090> esc<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.359> great<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.109> it<00:03:09.470> works<00:03:09.950> and

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
see so the esc is great and it works and

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.740 
see so the esc is great and it works and
let's<00:03:12.769> do<00:03:13.100> something<00:03:13.579> else<00:03:13.700> now<00:03:14.120> let<00:03:14.720> me

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
let's do something else now let me

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:23.550 
let's do something else now let me
unplug<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:19.810> now

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.040 

let's<00:03:24.250> use<00:03:24.670> those<00:03:25.150> two<00:03:25.540> again<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:27.610> m1<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:28.900> m4

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
let's use those two again on m1 and m4

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.790 
let's use those two again on m1 and m4
let<00:03:29.770> me<00:03:29.980> switch<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.520> over<00:03:30.670> here<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.620> one<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
let me switch it over here and one and

let me switch it over here and one and
I'm<00:03:32.920> chooser<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.520> nothing<00:03:34.090> for<00:03:34.650> m1<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.790> m2<00:03:40.890> ok

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
I'm chooser and nothing for m1 and m2 ok

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.070 
I'm chooser and nothing for m1 and m2 ok
now<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:43.150> have<00:03:44.099> those<00:03:45.099> two<00:03:45.459> back<00:03:45.730> on<00:03:46.000> m1<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.930> m2

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
now I have those two back on m1 and m2

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.080
