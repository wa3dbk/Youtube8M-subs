there<00:00:07.020> are<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.680> Panamera<00:00:08.069> plug-in<00:00:08.639> fits<00:00:08.910> in

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
there are the Panamera plug-in fits in

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.730 
there are the Panamera plug-in fits in

this<00:00:11.550> isn't<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> first<00:00:12.090> time<00:00:12.269> we've<00:00:12.690> worked

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
this isn't the first time we've worked

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.440 
this isn't the first time we've worked
on<00:00:13.110> ways<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.349> turn<00:00:13.740> off<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.070> engine<00:00:17.330> but<00:00:18.330> now

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
on ways to turn off the engine but now

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.970 
on ways to turn off the engine but now
we've<00:00:18.660> arrived<00:00:18.960> at<00:00:19.140> an<00:00:19.260> entirely<00:00:19.680> new

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
we've arrived at an entirely new

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.560 
we've arrived at an entirely new
dimension<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> Panamera<00:00:21.300> as<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.780> read

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
dimension in the Panamera as I read

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.080 
dimension in the Panamera as I read

be driven to a top speed of 135 km/h so

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.330 
be driven to a top speed of 135 km/h so
it's<00:00:29.840> even<00:00:30.080> possible<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.529> drive<00:00:30.740> electrically

it's<00:00:34.830> the<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.340> hybrid<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:36.060> is<00:00:36.120> truly<00:00:36.600> fun

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.830 

amazing<00:00:41.370> thing<00:00:41.580> about<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.910> Panamera<00:00:42.300> plug-in

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
amazing thing about the Panamera plug-in

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.720 
amazing thing about the Panamera plug-in
is<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.560> now<00:00:43.710> delivers<00:00:44.160> such<00:00:44.310> a<00:00:44.340> broad

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
is that it now delivers such a broad

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.910 
is that it now delivers such a broad
range<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.450> positive<00:00:45.660> traits<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.800> be

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
range of positive traits it can be

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.740 
range of positive traits it can be
driven<00:00:47.130> electrically<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.030> also<00:00:48.240> offers

entitled the decision to build a plug-in
was<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.710> very<00:01:01.890> rational<00:01:02.490> we<00:01:02.670> wanted<00:01:03.000> to
