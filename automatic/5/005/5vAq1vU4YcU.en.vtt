from the front side of the cake because

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.459 
from the front side of the cake because
it's<00:02:05.549> usually<00:02:05.849> more<00:02:06.450> loosely<00:02:06.840> compressed

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
it's usually more loosely compressed

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's usually more loosely compressed
than<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> back<00:02:08.160> side<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.830> if<00:02:10.830> you'd<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
than the back side but if you'd like to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.670 
than the back side but if you'd like to
keep<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> design<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> front<00:02:12.720> nice<00:02:12.960> then

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
keep the design on the front nice then

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.809 
keep the design on the front nice then
it<00:02:13.830> really<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.280> better

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
it really is better

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.429 
it really is better
to<00:02:14.879> start<00:02:15.180> breaking<00:02:15.599> from<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.840> backside<00:02:16.409> of

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
to start breaking from the backside of

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.520 
to start breaking from the backside of
the<00:02:16.620> cake<00:02:17.060> after<00:02:18.060> all<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:18.959> doesn't<00:02:19.379> really

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the cake after all it doesn't really

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.920 
the cake after all it doesn't really
matter<00:02:19.829> at<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.189> backside<00:02:20.670> looks<00:02:20.999> good<00:02:21.269> or<00:02:21.389> not

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.660 

next<00:02:24.930> I'll<00:02:25.260> demonstrate<00:02:25.530> with<00:02:26.069> black<00:02:26.400> or

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
next I'll demonstrate with black or

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.789 
next I'll demonstrate with black or
cooked<00:02:27.180> puer<00:02:27.659> that<00:02:27.989> has<00:02:28.170> been<00:02:28.379> compressed

into<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.189> bowl<00:02:29.489> shape<00:02:30.170> like<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.379> cake<00:02:31.590> form<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
into a bowl shape like the cake form the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.910

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.729 
the back or bottom side of the bowl
first<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:48.450> steps<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.989> breaking<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.530> bowl

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739

let's try breaking an eight year old
brick<00:03:42.629> of<00:03:42.900> puer<00:03:43.349> tea<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:45.030> front<00:03:45.299> of<00:03:45.449> the<00:03:45.540> brick

brick of puer tea the front of the brick

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.140 
brick of puer tea the front of the brick
is<00:03:45.959> nice<00:03:46.169> and<00:03:46.409> smooth<00:03:46.769> while<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.669> back<00:03:47.879> side

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
is nice and smooth while the back side

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.369 
is nice and smooth while the back side
is<00:03:48.389> somewhat<00:03:48.810> spotty<00:03:49.229> and<00:03:49.530> gray<00:03:50.810> once<00:03:51.810> again<00:03:51.959> I

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
is somewhat spotty and gray once again I

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.469 
is somewhat spotty and gray once again I
suggest<00:03:52.979> starting<00:03:53.129> from<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.729> back<00:03:53.939> in<00:03:54.209> order

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
suggest starting from the back in order

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.659 
suggest starting from the back in order
to<00:03:54.689> maintain<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.470> nice<00:03:55.709> appearance<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.519> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
little bit different from the cake and

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.959 
little bit different from the cake and
the<00:04:02.519> bowl<00:04:02.729> forms<00:04:03.919> we<00:04:04.919> can<00:04:05.099> start<00:04:05.430> breaking<00:04:05.819> the

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:05.969 
the bowl forms we can start breaking the

tea from any one of the bricks four
corners<00:04:09.229> simply<00:04:10.229> find<00:04:10.530> which<00:04:10.769> corner<00:04:11.219> is<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
loosest which will make it easier to

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.449 
loosest which will make it easier to
stick<00:04:14.009> the<00:04:14.219> tea<00:04:14.459> needle<00:04:14.819> in<00:04:16.250> with<00:04:17.250> this

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
stick the tea needle in with this

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.610 
stick the tea needle in with this
particular<00:04:18.090> brick<00:04:18.359> we<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.930> see<00:04:19.199> that<00:04:19.440> this

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
particular brick we can see that this

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.129 
particular brick we can see that this
corner<00:04:20.039> is<00:04:20.219> loosest<00:04:20.729> making<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:21.900> Best

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
corner is loosest making it the Best

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.240 
corner is loosest making it the Best
Breakthrough<00:04:22.500> point<00:04:24.289> basically<00:04:25.289> we<00:04:25.800> use<00:04:25.979> the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
Breakthrough point basically we use the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.490 
Breakthrough point basically we use the
needle<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.820> separate<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.539> tea<00:04:27.750> into<00:04:28.050> four

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
needle to separate the tea into four

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.189 
needle to separate the tea into four
layers

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
layers

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.989 
layers
with<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.379> first<00:04:31.589> stick<00:04:32.009> you<00:04:32.399> can<00:04:32.429> tell<00:04:32.789> how

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:32.999 
with the first stick you can tell how

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:39.469 
with the first stick you can tell how
tightly<00:04:33.299> compressed<00:04:33.809> the<00:04:34.139> tea<00:04:34.349> is<00:04:37.099> it<00:04:38.359> will<00:04:39.359> be

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
tightly compressed the tea is it will be

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.689 
tightly compressed the tea is it will be
much<00:04:39.719> looser<00:04:40.229> after<00:04:40.679> the<00:04:40.799> second<00:04:41.219> stick

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.759 

finally<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:45.179> third<00:04:45.509> stick<00:04:45.929> will<00:04:46.169> separate

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:46.769 
finally the third stick will separate

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:49.009 
finally the third stick will separate
the<00:04:46.979> portion<00:04:47.429> from<00:04:47.609> the<00:04:47.789> brick<00:04:48.029> perfectly

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:49.019 
the portion from the brick perfectly

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:53.509 
the portion from the brick perfectly
demonstrating<00:04:49.829> the<00:04:50.129> three<00:04:50.489> stick<00:04:50.849> process
