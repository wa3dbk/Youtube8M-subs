true perry section that will have more
guns<00:00:36.480> sticking<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:40.520> another<00:00:41.520> rocket<00:00:42.000> area<00:00:42.300> in

guns sticking out another rocket area in

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.729 
guns sticking out another rocket area in
the<00:00:42.809> back<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.760> X<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> pillbox<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.890> another

the back that X is a pillbox and another

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
the back that X is a pillbox and another
support<00:00:49.739> structure<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.629> from<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> back

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
support structure so from the back

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.920 
support structure so from the back
basically<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.180> back<00:00:54.390> stuff<00:00:54.750> was

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
basically all all the back stuff was

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.260 
basically all all the back stuff was
done<00:00:55.140> from<00:00:56.480> there<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:01:00.180> happy<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.780> it

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
done from there so pretty happy with it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.759 
done from there so pretty happy with it
starting<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> look<00:01:03.449> kind<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.870> realistic<00:01:04.320> with

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
starting to look kind of realistic with

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.880 
starting to look kind of realistic with
all<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:06.080> extra<00:01:08.840> detailing<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.990> stuff<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.790> I

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
all the extra detailing and stuff and I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.310 
all the extra detailing and stuff and I
had<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.070> some<00:01:14.250> thinking<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.700> this

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.880 

my<00:01:22.320> concept<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:25.130> um<00:01:27.320> this<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
my concept here is that um this was a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.040 
my concept here is that um this was a
originally<00:01:30.080> was<00:01:31.080> a<00:01:31.110> vehicle<00:01:31.890> transport<00:01:33.050> by

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
originally was a vehicle transport by

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.500 
originally was a vehicle transport by
the<00:01:34.110> Imperial<00:01:34.740> um<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.700> Carol<00:01:36.030> guard<00:01:36.300> and

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
the Imperial um like Carol guard and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.380 
the Imperial um like Carol guard and
burial<00:01:36.750> Navy<00:01:37.020> um<00:01:37.850> I<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.720> fit

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
burial Navy um I think I can fit

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.320 
burial Navy um I think I can fit
probably<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:43.250> scout<00:01:44.250> Titan<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
probably like a scout Titan in that

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.290 
probably like a scout Titan in that
center<00:01:45.660> area<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:49.220> two<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.430> six<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:50.880> seven

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
center area and two there's six or seven

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.950 
center area and two there's six or seven
other<00:01:51.450> vehicles<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.580> basically<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.810> whole

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
other vehicles so it basically the whole

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.760 
other vehicles so it basically the whole
idea<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.940> from<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
idea was that you know from the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.700 
idea was that you know from the
battleship<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.100> load<00:01:59.520> on<00:02:00.710> just

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
battleship they would just load on just

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.440 
battleship they would just load on just
the<00:02:01.890> skeleton<00:02:02.340> crew<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.500> vehicles<00:02:05.450> strap

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the skeleton crew of the vehicles strap

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.380 
the skeleton crew of the vehicles strap
the<00:02:06.630> vehicles<00:02:07.050> on<00:02:07.429> unlike<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.459> two<00:02:08.759> wing<00:02:09.000> ends

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the vehicles on unlike the two wing ends

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.870 
the vehicles on unlike the two wing ends
and<00:02:09.600> whatnot<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:10.289> then<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.220> kick<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.670> out

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
and whatnot and then just kick it out

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.640 
and whatnot and then just kick it out
and<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> glide<00:02:12.810> down<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.260> invade<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and have a glide down to invade the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130 
and have a glide down to invade the
planet<00:02:14.040> however<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.209> last<00:02:15.420> stop<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:16.050> it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
planet however the last stop that it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.070 
planet however the last stop that it
made<00:02:16.380> um<00:02:16.940> never<00:02:17.940> got<00:02:18.209> out<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.600> then<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> orcs

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
made um never got out of then the orcs

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.540 
made um never got out of then the orcs
got<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.320> hold<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:20.010> what<00:02:20.160> they<00:02:20.310> did<00:02:20.370> is

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
got a hold of it so what they did is

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.410 
got a hold of it so what they did is
they<00:02:20.760> took<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.510> vehicle<00:02:22.610> holding<00:02:23.610> platforms

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
they took the vehicle holding platforms

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.100 
they took the vehicle holding platforms
and<00:02:24.769> turn<00:02:25.769> those<00:02:26.040> into<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.299> armored<00:02:27.780> gun

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and turn those into like armored gun

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.460 
and turn those into like armored gun
decks<00:02:28.470> with<00:02:28.830> all<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.690> scrap<00:02:31.049> plating

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
decks with all the the scrap plating

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.130 
decks with all the the scrap plating
from<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> hangars<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.670> whatnot<00:02:33.060> so

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
from like the hangars and whatnot so

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.050 
from like the hangars and whatnot so
it's<00:02:34.579> really<00:02:35.840> eluded<00:02:39.769> space<00:02:40.769> naval<00:02:41.280> vessel<00:02:41.700> is

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it's really eluded space naval vessel is

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.990 
it's really eluded space naval vessel is
is<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.650> backdrop<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.400> gonna<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.760> going

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
is the the backdrop that gonna be going

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.130 
is the the backdrop that gonna be going
with<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.329> it's<00:02:45.630> going<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.079> lot<00:02:46.440> of

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
with this it's going to have a lot of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.229 
with this it's going to have a lot of
gothic<00:02:49.310> iconography<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.430> stuff<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:50.970> as

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
gothic iconography and stuff on it as

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.890 
gothic iconography and stuff on it as
well<00:02:51.630> as<00:02:51.840> or<00:02:52.110> key<00:02:52.410> stuff<00:02:52.739> um<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.540> think<00:02:54.780> that

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
well as or key stuff um and I think that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.440 
well as or key stuff um and I think that
matches<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:55.320> nicely<00:02:55.350> with<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.890> looted<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.579> land

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
matches up nicely with the looted a land

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.020 
matches up nicely with the looted a land
raider<00:02:57.690> that's<00:02:58.049> acting<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.500> battle<00:02:58.920> wagon<00:02:59.220> so

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
raider that's acting is battle wagon so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.690 
raider that's acting is battle wagon so
