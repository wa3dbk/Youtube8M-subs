brand new so it's very hard to do this

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.080 
brand new so it's very hard to do this
here<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.650> can<00:03:35.800> move<00:03:35.950> up<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.190> frame<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.640> stop

here you can move up the frame and stop

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.840 
here you can move up the frame and stop
at<00:03:37.270> several<00:03:37.630> different<00:03:37.660> locations<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:38.850> just

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
at several different locations so just

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.950 
at several different locations so just
bear<00:03:40.030> with<00:03:40.060> me<00:03:40.300> it's<00:03:40.360> quite<00:03:40.540> hard<00:03:42.750> pull<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.870> all

stopping anywhere in between

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.620 
stopping anywhere in between
and<00:03:47.140> then<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:47.980> just<00:03:48.160> push<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.370> one<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:49.450> lock

after this answer for your new board
without<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.610> can<00:04:00.730> probably<00:04:00.940> toddler

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
without that you can probably toddler

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.970 
without that you can probably toddler
straight<00:04:01.840> into<00:04:02.080> this<00:04:02.200> one<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.590> bit<00:04:02.770> bigger

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
straight into this one so a bit bigger
