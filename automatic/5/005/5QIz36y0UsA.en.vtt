00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
protoss ratio so this should be a really

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.049 
protoss ratio so this should be a really
really<00:00:34.860> good<00:00:35.160> series<00:00:35.489> between<00:00:35.640> these<00:00:36.000> two

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
really good series between these two

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.819 
really good series between these two
players<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.989> when<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> violent

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
players and when do you see the violent

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.580 
players and when do you see the violent
going<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.940> Nonie<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> moment<00:00:40.410> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
going down for Nonie at the moment I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.260 
going down for Nonie at the moment I
sure<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.100> scouting<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.790> wrong<00:00:42.030> direction

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
sure is scouting the wrong direction

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.080 
sure is scouting the wrong direction
however<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:43.110> his<00:00:43.260> Overlord<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.760> don't

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
however with his Overlord and I don't

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.459 
however with his Overlord and I don't
think<00:00:45.360> he's<00:00:45.480> gonna<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.719> too<00:00:45.899> happy<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
think he's gonna be too happy not to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.840 
think he's gonna be too happy not to
find<00:00:46.829> his<00:00:46.920> opponent<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
find his opponent there because you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.190 
find his opponent there because you
usually<00:00:48.090> want<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.750> opponent<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> be

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
usually want your opponent to be

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.660 
usually want your opponent to be
relatively<00:00:49.590> far<00:00:49.800> away<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.489> can

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
relatively far away from you so you can

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.450 
relatively far away from you so you can
Mak<00:00:50.940> her<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.239> pretty<00:00:51.480> easily<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.289> nicely<00:00:53.039> and

gateways<00:03:19.600> go<00:03:19.780> up<00:03:19.900> there<00:03:20.080> is<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.200> total<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.590> three

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
gateways go up there is a total of three

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
gateways go up there is a total of three
gateways<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.930> think<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.130> really

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
gateways and I think this is a really

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.120 
gateways and I think this is a really
really<00:03:24.910> good<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.600> strong<00:03:26.080> opening<00:03:26.350> against

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
really good and a strong opening against

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.060 
really good and a strong opening against
any<00:03:27.430> player<00:03:27.910> but<00:03:28.810> he<00:03:29.050> does<00:03:29.230> have<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.680> double

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
any player but he does have the double

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.250 
any player but he does have the double
gas<00:03:30.370> investment<00:03:31.060> which<00:03:31.209> you'll<00:03:31.420> allow<00:03:32.019> him<00:03:32.170> to

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
gas investment which you'll allow him to

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.290 
gas investment which you'll allow him to
build<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.620> lot<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.340> those<00:03:33.640> centuries<00:03:34.120> which

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
build a lot of those centuries which

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.330 
build a lot of those centuries which
will<00:03:34.480> also<00:03:35.200> allow<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.470> Pretender<00:03:35.890> lot<00:03:36.100> of

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
will also allow the Pretender lot of

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.040 
will also allow the Pretender lot of
force<00:03:36.790> fields<00:03:37.090> for<00:03:37.239> fuels<00:03:37.450> are<00:03:37.570> very<00:03:37.840> very

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
force fields for fuels are very very

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.570 
force fields for fuels are very very
good<00:03:38.200> against<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.590> zerg<00:03:38.739> because<00:03:39.160> they<00:03:39.430> will

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
good against the zerg because they will

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.759 
good against the zerg because they will
be<00:03:39.730> able<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.940> prevent<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.840> surround<00:03:41.440> and

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.800 
be able to prevent that surround and
zerg<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> race<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.940> really<00:03:43.269> heavily

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
zerg is a race that really heavily

earlier and Idris Overlord was a little

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.409 
earlier and Idris Overlord was a little
bit<00:04:35.889> over<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.520> edge<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.909> that<00:04:36.970> cliff<00:04:37.389> and

bit over the edge of that cliff and

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.730 
bit over the edge of that cliff and
that's<00:04:37.720> why<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.870> don't<00:04:38.080> he<00:04:38.169> was<00:04:38.289> able<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.530> take<00:04:38.710> a

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
that's why I don't he was able to take a

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.279 
that's why I don't he was able to take a
couple<00:04:38.949> of<00:04:39.039> shots<00:04:39.190> at<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.460> with<00:04:39.729> those

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
opponent has a lot of centuries so he's

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.990 
opponent has a lot of centuries so he's
going<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:44.830> be<00:04:44.889> building<00:04:45.099> a<00:04:45.250> road<00:04:45.490> worn<00:04:45.789> inside

going to be building a road worn inside
his<00:04:46.300> base<00:04:46.659> to<00:04:47.259> try<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.800> be<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.940> little<00:04:48.970> bit<00:04:49.860> more

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
his base to try to be a little bit more

his base to try to be a little bit more
defensive<00:04:51.580> i<00:04:51.699> think<00:04:51.909> and<00:04:52.090> he<00:04:52.240> has<00:04:52.449> put<00:04:52.690> down<00:04:52.840> to

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
defensive i think and he has put down to

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.230 
defensive i think and he has put down to
spine<00:04:53.379> crawlers<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:53.949> case<00:04:54.550> his<00:04:54.669> opponent<00:04:55.090> does

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
spine crawlers in case his opponent does

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.059 
spine crawlers in case his opponent does
attack<00:04:55.659> very<00:04:55.960> very<00:04:56.169> awesome<00:04:56.560> play<00:04:56.680> for<00:04:56.860> both

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
identical for these two players but if

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
we take a look an army count a slight in

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.469 
we take a look an army count a slight in
